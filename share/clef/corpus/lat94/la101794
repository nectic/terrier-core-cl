ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: SOFTBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 CO-ED CRAZE: Slow pitch softball used to be a boys' night out, but there now 
is no shortage of both sexes on Orange County diamonds. Women's softball has 
been steadily gaining popularity; the ratio of men's to women's teams 
countywide has gone from nearly 3 to 1 in 1989 to less than 2 to 1 in 1993. . . 
. Lori Larkin, 24, plays third base for a Garden Grove team and has found new 
friends in the low-key environment. "Everyone plays as a team," she said, "and 
has a great, non-stressful time." 
</P>
<P>
 TEAM TRIBUTE: A Costa Mesa men's team knows what it's like to rebound. "The 
Skulls" are composed of recovering head-injury patients from Coastline 
College's special programs for the disabled. . . . Craig Stephens, Coastline 
staff member and team manager, says it was formed to give students 
self-confidence and develop motor skills. "A lot of these guys were very active 
in their lives," he says, "and a lot of them have had to face emotional 
problems because they can't do the things they used to do. . . . We rarely win, 
but when we do, it's cause for celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG LEAGUES: A different game is being played on Seal Beach's Zoeter Field. 
"Big Ball" features a 16-inch softball that looks hittable but doesn't travel 
very far and is easy prey for the defense. The game, also played in Laguna 
Beach and Manhattan Beach, generally results in scores far lower than average. 
"You really have to hit it good to get it to travel," says league player Carl 
Champion, 28. "In the later innings the ball gets mushy." 
</P>
<P>
 RALLY KILLERS: A unique situation exists on the women's field at Corona del 
Mar's Community Youth Center: There's a 24-foot-high wall in shallow right 
field, and a new rule intended to keep secure some nearby condominiums. The 
condos are out of reach for most female batters, and they are awarded a home 
run for clearing the fence; but males, far more of whom could put a ball 
through a window, receive three outs for the same feat. . . . The deterrent was 
necessary, League Director Scott Williamson said, because "it used to only 
count as one out, but guys would show off and hit it over anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 WEATHER: Sunny with highs in the upper 70s. Lows will be in the mid-50s. (B6)

 PICKING UP: More motorists are trading in their cars for pickup trucks, 
dealers say . . . In Ventura County, where there were more than 571,000 
registered vehicles in 1992, more than 114,000 were trucks. Upscale design has 
kept the demand high . . . "In the past, a truck was a truck," said Jim 
McConica of McConica Motors in Ventura. "Now they ride much more like a 
passenger car." 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE SPOTLIGHT: Each is subject to daily scrutiny from tough audiences . . . 
but while John Uelman stands before high school history students in a Thousand 
Oaks classroom, his brother Gerald confronts a considerably bigger crowd as an 
attorney on the O.J. Simpson legal "dream team." . . . John has taught at 
Newbury Park High for 25 years. In pre-O.J. days, Gerald did time in the 
classroom too, as a law professor. John's colleagues -- and students -- 
sometimes quiz him about his brother. "It's funny how people are picking up on 
it," John said. 
</P>
<P>
 UNIFORM APPROACH: It seemed like a good idea at the time. . . . But the 
uniforms that students at Simi Valley's Garden Grove Elementary wore at the 
start of the school year may be falling out of favor (B3) . . . The concept 
seems to have taken hold at schools in Long Beach and Orange County, said state 
school board head Sherry Loofbourrow. That may prompt more districts to mull 
the idea. "Parents and students seem to be quite favorable into looking into 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING FRIENDS: Sometimes it's hard to get to know your neighbors. But in 
Moorpark, a 100-year-old quilt -- of all things -- has brought two families 
closer together. . . . Debra Daley's quilt, hand-stitched by her grandmother, 
was falling to shreds from age. Then Mary Osborn, who lives part of the time 
with relatives nearby, painstakingly restored it. Before, the women were barely 
acquainted. Now they're good friends. "She's been only two doors down from me 
all these years," Daley said.

70,000 MARCH THROUGH L.A. AGAINST PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: PROTESTERS CONDEMN 
THE INITIATIVE AND BURN AN EFFIGY OF GOV. WILSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest mass protests in the city's history, a more than 
mile-long column of nearly 70,000 demonstrators marched from the Eastside to 
Downtown on Sunday in boisterous condemnation of Proposition 187, the 
immigration initiative, and its principal advocate, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition is not against the illegal (immigrant), it's against 
children," declared Salvador Alendar, a 32-year-old textile factory worker and 
Mexican native who carried his 2-year-old daughter, Lisbeth, on his shoulders 
throughout the march's almost four-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sentiment repeated by other outraged marchers and by the dozens of 
speakers who took to the elevated podium set up at Spring and First streets, 
just across from City Hall, and addressed the multitudes assembled beneath an 
azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided as a family that we needed to come and express our feelings on 
this 187," said Samuel G. Perez, 60, a retired auto worker from San Fernando, 
who marched with his children. "They are playing games with us and that's not 
right. Politically, it's wrong and it's racist." 
</P>
<P>
 The march was the latest in a series of anti-187 demonstrations, but polls 
have shown continued strong support for the initiative. By contrast, 
proposition backers have run a near-invisible campaign from their Orange County 
base, mostly responding to news media inquiries and appearing at forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, among other things, would bar illegal immigrants from 
receiving public school educations and a range of other state and county-funded 
benefits, including non-emergency health care and a variety of social services. 
</P>
<P>
 March organizers said more than 100,000 participated Sunday, but police 
estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 took part. The crowd included nearly 100 Cal 
State Northridge students and instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the largest protest gathering here in decades, surpassing Vietnam 
War-era demonstrations including the historic 1970 Eastside march for Chicano 
rights that turned violent and left three dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no serious injuries and no arrests on Sunday. Hundreds of 
volunteers helped to guide the orderly, regimented crowd, which formed a column 
more than a mile long, a roiling river of banners, flags and placards moving 
triumphantly down Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, renamed for the late United 
Farmworkers Union founder. Eastside sidewalks were packed and impromptu vendors 
set up shop selling "No on 187" T-shirts. Another design declared "No Re-pete," 
a reference to Gov. Wilson's reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's image was burned in effigy near City Hall during the speeches, 
placed in a coffin and depicted on placards, T-shirts and elsewhere with a 
noose around his neck, as a pig, and in other pejorative images. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Antonio Rosales, 21, of Burbank, and Alberto Ibarra, 28, of Granada 
Hills, vented their anger at Wilson through a bit of street theater, depicting 
Wilson as a man on a short leash who is controlled by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to bring out the crowd spirit and berate Wilson in a humorous 
way," Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Garcia, dean of the school of humanities at CSUN who took part in the 
march, said the turnout was a response borne of the frustration of "being 
dumped on" for too long. "It's time to challenge them openly and publicly. And 
this is just a little town meeting among a few people," he said as he marched 
with another educator from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the practice of blaming illegal immigrants for economic woes isn't 
new in the United States. Latinos, he said, are the latest targets of a cycle 
of scapegoating that has been around since the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, it was the Chinese, then the Okies," he said. "Now it's us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite participants' anger, the mood on Sunday was mostly exuberant, leavened 
with ethnic pride. Flags of Mexico, El Salvador and other Latin American 
nations were everywhere. The event had been heavily promoted in the 
Spanish-language media and at community organizations statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers converged across from City Hall where, before speakers addressed the 
throng, three horn players performed a mariachi riff of "The Star-Spangled 
Banner" to thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the vast majority of participants were Latinos, reflecting the region's 
large immigrant population from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, 
non-Latino whites, Asian Americans, African Americans and others also took 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who says the immigrants of California are not working and are on 
welfare is lying," Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who made a spirited 
bid against Wilson in the Republican gubernatorial primary race, told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents a portion of the east San 
Fernando Valley, dressed in crisp white shirt, walked arm in arm with event 
organizers and other politicians in the first row of the procession. He joined 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and City Councilman Mike Hernandez 
as a speaker on the podium at the end of the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers called the protest part of a multiethnic campaign to reject growing 
anti-immigrant "hysteria" nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a not a parade, this is a social movement," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, 
an Eastside activist and leading march strategist, who noted planners' desire 
to turn around what he called an anti-immigrant tide and win official 
recognition of immigrants' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, attention is focused on next month's California 
elections and two critical contests: Gov. Wilson's reelection bid and the 
heated battle about Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson was the favored target of Sunday's demonstration, depicted 
repeatedly in posters and speeches as a "racist" who has made immigration a 
centerpiece of his campaign in a cynical effort to woo the non-Latinos who 
dominate California's voting rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson dismissed the criticisms and downplayed the march's 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are demonstrating represent a relatively small minority of 
Californians," said Dan Schnur, a Wilson campaign spokesman. "Most Californians 
understand the innate unfairness of providing services for individuals who live 
in this state illegally at the same time services are being cut for those who 
live here legally." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson himself, during a 45-minute address Sunday to an audience of about 400 
in the retirement community of Leisure World in Laguna Hills, did not mention 
the protest when he blamed illegal immigrants for costing the state billions of 
dollars in services that should be reserved for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to provide services to our own legal residents," Wilson said. 
He declared that illegal immigrants absorb 10% of the state's general fund. 
"Now, that is terribly unfair. . . . I say we should end those services to 
illegal immigrants. We are . . . rewarding people for violating U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from educators, medical groups, organized labor and others, 
polls have shown strong support for Proposition 187 among likely voters, 
including many Latinos. Proponents say it will deter new illegal immigration 
and force those already here to return home -- a premise disputed by opponents, 
who say that measure would leave hundreds of thousands of youths without 
education while enhancing the spread of disease by cutting access to 
non-emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's strong support, analysts say, underlines a widespread 
preoccupation about the fast-paced immigration that has drastically altered 
California's demographic mix since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 strategists acknowledge a difficult uphill battle, particularly 
because even though anti-Proposition 187 forces have apparently raised more 
than twice as much as proponents, fund-raising efforts have so far fallen short 
of the kind of money needed for an all-out television blitz against the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the anti-187 coalition -- including mainstream Latino groups like the 
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- argued that a massive 
march barely three weeks before the election was a bad tactic, and attempted to 
scuttle the event. Several Latino activists privately expressed fears that a 
sea of brown faces marching through Downtown Los Angeles would only antagonize 
many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, Taxpayers Against 187 -- the umbrella organization spearheading 
the campaign against the initiative whose member groups include teachers, 
medical professionals and union activists -- did not take part in organizing 
the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, march organizers -- a statewide coalition of activists grouped 
together as the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and Civic 
Participation -- opted to go ahead with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called the demonstration a success, as it provided a forum for 
opponents -- citizens and non-citizens alike -- to express their frustrations. 
And they believe it sets the stage for increased immigrant participation in 
future campaigns, electoral and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was concern and disagreement based on what was the best way of 
defeating 187, but I don't think you can deny people the right to participate," 
said Councilman Hernandez, who was among the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so impressed was Ron Prince, chairman of the pro-187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather's nice, they can do that if they want to," Prince responded 
when contacted at the campaign's Orange County offices. "I'm sure a lot of 
people were there to see the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The march, he predicted, would bolster his cause by focusing attention on the 
problem of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people look at the issue, they understand the problem and they tend to 
support Proposition 187," said Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's march follows a similar protest last May that drew between 8,000 to 
25,000 protesters to Downtown Los Angeles, before Proposition 187 was 
officially placed on the ballot.

Nicholas Riccardi in Los Angeles and Julie Marquis in Orange County.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frances Cagney, actor James Cagney's beloved "Billie," his wife for 64 years, 
died Oct. 10 in the rural Upstate New York farmhouse where she and her husband 
found respite from his fame. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cagneys had lived in Stanfordville, 54 miles south of Albany, working as 
gentlemen farmers, since 1955. She remained there after his death in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cagney, who appeared generally as an anti-hero in 64 films beginning in 
1930, may be best known for his Oscar-winning role as song-and-dance man George 
M. Cohan in the 1942 film "Yankee Doodle Dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 He first met Frances Willard (Billie) Vernon (her parents had wanted a boy) 
when she was dancing in the chorus and he was a specialty performer in the 1920 
New York musical "Pitter Patter." They married in 1922. A daughter, Kathleen, 
survives.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mason Wiley, co-author of one of the definitive works on the Academy Awards, 
has died in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Cole, his longtime companion, said that Wiley was 39 when he died from 
the complications of AIDS on Oct. 7.Wiley had been seriously ill for about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 With fellow Columbia University classmate Damien Bona, Wiley in 1986 wrote a 
year-by-year account of the fantasies and foibles of the Oscar presentations. 
The writing and research had taken them more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards," the book 
-- published by Ballantine -- has sold tens of thousands of copies. A fourth, 
updated edition was published in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley also was a critic for such publications as the New York Times, Los 
Angeles Times, New York Newsday, Cosmopolitan, Time and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cole, Wiley is survived by his parents, Robert and Margaret 
Wiley of Rocky Mount, N.C., and two sisters.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When a street is being resurfaced, why is the crew that roughens up the old 
surface not better coordinated with the crew that lays down the new one? It 
seems that motorists must deal with the grooves and ruts for weeks or months, 
not to mention lack of lane markings before the new pavement is poured. 
</P>
<P>
 A current example is Vineland Avenue between Riverside Drive and Ventura 
Boulevard. It has been gouged up for more than a month with no new asphalt in 
sight! 
</P>
<P>
 David Kunz 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 We agree that driving over roads in the process of being repaved can make your 
teeth chatter more than a chilly winter's night. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Lionel Citizen of the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance, 
that shouldn't happen on any one stretch of road for more than three to four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 For resurfacing, if the street is structurally sound and doesn't need major 
repair, work crews first shave off the top two inches or so of asphalt, leaving 
behind the grooved and rutted surface that makes you shake like an overdose of 
caffeine. Citizen says it has to be rough, or else the new asphalt would have 
nothing to adhere to and would creep along the street as a sticky ooze. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first crew finishes skimming off the top, the repaving crew should 
come along within the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically it should be three weeks between crews," Citizen says. "No more 
than three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, bad weather or delays in previously scheduled projects can throw 
the schedule off. Utility companies might want to do their own work in the 
area, making use of the exposed street but holding up the repaving process. 
</P>
<P>
 As for that stretch of Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood you mentioned, 
Citizen says paving could begin today, and would take two to four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Someone (Caltrans?) has recently placed a "No Right Turn on Red" sign at the 
entrance to the westbound Ventura Freeway from the southbound side of DeSoto 
Avenue. I travel this route frequently, and find this has become an irritant on 
my commute home in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 As one approaches this on-ramp, traffic along DeSoto heading south toward the 
freeway moves at a snail's pace. Then, when you're lucky enough to get onto the 
on-ramp, a red meter signal awaits you at the end even though there are no 
other cars waiting before you. You have to brake and proceed after the light 
has turned green. 
</P>
<P>
 They should: 1) remove the "No Right Turn on Red" sign, because it only adds 
to the congestion on DeSoto, and 2) have the meter signal idle at green when 
there is no one waiting at the light, rather than defaulting to red. 
</P>
<P>
 Please pass this letter on. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Friedman 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 We did pass your letter on to Caltrans, which shares jurisdiction over the "No 
Right Turn on Red" sign with the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to spokesman Rick Holland, the sign was put up because of traffic in 
the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists headed north on DeSoto who want to get onto the westbound Ventura 
Freeway on-ramp have two left-turn lanes that feed directly onto the two lanes 
of the on-ramp. The no-right-turn sign protects those northbound DeSoto drivers 
turning left onto the freeway in the outer lane, who would clash with commuters 
like you wanting to turn right onto the same on-ramp from the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the meter signal, an electronic sensor should detect your presence as 
you approach the light and make you brake just momentarily before you proceed 
onto the freeway. The wait shouldn't be too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be able to go in a couple of seconds, so what's his complaint?" 
said Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Readers: 
</P>
<P>
 This Wednesday is Caltrans' statewide "Safety Stand Down" Day, when the agency 
takes time to review all its safety procedures in the field and office. The 
first such safety day was initiated three years ago after five highway workers 
were killed during a three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency reviews its procedures on weather hazards, working in the road 
close to high-speed traffic, night working conditions, proper clothing for easy 
visibility and other safety measures. Spokesman Rick Holland said motorists are

STREET SMART: MOTORIST FINDS SIGNAL'S YELLOW CYCLE IS GONE IN A FLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done about a traffic signal when the yellow caution light is 
unusually short? The signal at La Paz Road and Muirlands Boulevard is the one 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of motorists have found the signal turns red unexpectedly soon, and 
they have gotten a citation. 
</P>
<P>
 One traffic officer acknowledged the yellow signal is only three seconds long. 
A motorist who got a ticket took a stop watch and timed eight other signals in 
nearby areas and found they were uniformly five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception is that officers, knowing the short cycle, are using the 
situation as a speed trap. It seems that it would be in order to have traffic 
authorities review the situation and make appropriate adjustments. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Caltrans is responsible for that traffic signal in Mission Viejo, and they say 
the time allotted to the yellow light is sufficient. The sequence of signal 
lights is determined by the rate of speed and the amount of traffic in the 
area, said Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. The signal at the La Paz Road 
off-ramp from Interstate 5 and Muirlands Boulevard calls for a 3.2-second 
minimum requirement for the yellow signal, but Caltrans has set the yellow at 
3.6 seconds, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal responds to the presence of vehicles with the aid of about six loop 
detectors embedded in the road and placed within 54 feet before the crosswalk, 
Orem said. When there are no vehicles within that 54-foot perimeter, the loop 
detectors shift the light to the next color, red, yellow or green. This is why 
the yellow light appears to suddenly change, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 At Ortega Highway and Rancho Viejo Road in San Juan Capistrano, on the 
northwest corner is a stop sign meant for the right-turn lane. But the 
intersection is controlled by a traffic light.  
</P>
<P>
 If the light is green and I'm turning right, do I have to stop because there's 
a stop sign? And why is the stop sign there?  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Gunderson 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 If you are in the right-turn lane, you must stop for the stop sign even if the 
light is green, said Ted Simon, city engineer for San Juan Capistrano. Proceed 
when traffic is clear.  
</P>
<P>
 The stop sign is there so that people turning right onto northbound Rancho 
Viejo don't collide with those turning on the left from across the street onto 
Rancho Viejo, Simon said. 
</P>

 The Orange County Transportation Authority invites the public to share ideas 
on improving mobility through the heart of Orange County as part of a study to 
determine if an urban transit system is in Orange County's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Three open houses have been scheduled to elicit public comments on 
transportation options for the densely populated, heavily trafficked corridor 
between Fullerton and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the OCTA board of directors selected this six-mile-wide and 
28-mile-long corridor for a study of a possible urban rail system or enhanced 
bus service.  
</P>
<P>
 The open houses won't have a structured agenda, but will allow those who 
attend an opportunity to view materials and discuss issues with OCTA directors, 
staff members and transit industry experts. Materials will be available in 
Spanish and bilingual staff members will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The first open house will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Oct. 25 at Rancho Santiago 
College in the auditorium of Building U.  
</P>
<P>
 The second will be from 6-8 p.m. Oct. 27, at the Fullerton Senior 
Multi-Service Center, 340 W. Commonwealth Ave. The final open house will be 
held from 6 to 8 p.m. Nov. 2 at Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center Plaza.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
LINCOLN PLACE: A CLASSIC AFFORDABLE-HOUSING BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For generations, Los Angeles tenants, property owners and public policy-makers 
have battled over how to maintain affordable housing in the city. The 
disagreement continues at Venice's Lincoln Place apartments -- a pleasant, 
tree-lined 40-acre complex of 795 apartments nearly a half-century old. The 
current owner wants to demolish and replace the whole complex over a 10-year 
period, ending up with 654 market-rate condominiums selling at $280,000 and up, 
plus 196 low-income apartments and "below market-rate" townhomes on which 
current residents would have first call. Current monthly rents on one- and 
two-bedroom units range from $388 to $971. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. formed in response to a previous renovation 
plan, has tried unsuccessfully to purchase the property. Now members are trying 
to block demolition of what they regard as attractive, structurally sound 
buildings more in need of repair than replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 A rival tenant group, Lincoln Place Tomorrow, supports the owner's claims that 
the apartments' inadequate parking and aging electrical, plumbing and heating 
systems make new construction the only economically sensible option. A 
45-YEAR-OLD-COMMUNITY 
</P>
<P>
 1949-'85 
</P>
<P>
 Built in response to severe post-WWII housing shortage. (The location has 
changed so little since construction that Lincoln Place was recently used as a 
location for Tim Burton's period movie, "Ed Wood.") 
</P>
<P>
 1986-'89 
</P>
<P>
 Complex is acquired by TransAction Cos. of Berkeley. Angry residents form 
Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. (LPTA) to remain in their apartments when owners 
issue eviction notices to begin rehab work, which would have increased rents. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 
</P>
<P>
 TransAction Cos. discloses plans for demolition of current structures and 
proposes redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 1992-'93 
</P>
<P>
 LPTA offers to buy Lincoln Place for $47.7 million. The offer is later 
modified to $40 million. Owners reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 City Planning Department holds public hearing. Council member Ruth Galanter 
advises city building and zoning officials of her opposition to the project as 
proposed. PRESERVE IT 
</P>
<P>
 RUTH HOLZGREEN, 15 1/2-year resident, member of Lincoln Place Tenants Assn.; 
opposes rebuilding  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, (the buildings) are old and there's always going to be repairs. 
Even new buildings need to be repaired. But it's unconscionable to destroy 
something that's still good. In my mind I can't conceive other than that the 
proposed development is pure greed. Leave Lincoln Place for the people who need 
affordable housing. Build more affluent housing elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 STEVE RASMUSSEN CANCIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Lead organizer, Coalition for Economic Survival, a Los Angeles tenants' rights 
group  
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Place represents a significant percentage of the affordable housing in 
Venice and in the City of Los Angeles. It is essential to preserving the ethnic 
and economic diversity of Venice. We already have the worst affordable housing 
crisis in the nation and we can't afford to lose more units. REPLACE IT 
</P>
<P>
 MARY ROBERTS 
</P>
<P>
 19-year resident, member of Lincoln Place Tomorrow; supports redevelopment 
</P>
<P>
 If I thought (the owner) and his group were wrong I would fight it tooth and 
nail -- just like I'm trying to fight for my dignity and a nice place to live. 
There's not a day goes by that I don't worry about the electricity. The 
plumbing is bad. It's nobody's fault; it's just the age of the buildings. What 
we're trying to do here is uplift the area, give it some prospects of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 MARC RYAVEC, 
</P>
<P>
 Board member, Venice Action Committee, a community-based service and 
beautification organization 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants have made good faith proposals which, unfortunately, ignore the 
underlying economics of the situation. The answer here is not taking property 
rights. The answer is for the city to use various incentives to get the private 
sector to do what it wants them to do. But in the absence of a compromise I 
support the owner's proposal because they're the ones taking the risk.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; SHOULD A 
POLITICAL SPOUSE'S BELIEFS BE CONSIDERED WHEN VOTING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent days, the role of Arianna Huffington in her husband's Senate 
campaign has become a hot topic in the race. Former staffers have stated that 
she acts virtually as campaign manager, and questions have been raised about 
her affiliation with a controversial church founded by a man who calls himself 
John-Roger. In earlier races, the investments of Dianne Feinstein's husband, 
Richard Blum, became public issues. TRIN YARBOROUGH asked political activists 
how much a spouse's beliefs and actions ought to affect a candidate. SUE 
BURNSIDE 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I think if a spouse or partner is actively on the campaign trail, we need to 
view them as a co-candidate, because their influence is obviously very large. 
For example, Mrs. Huffington has been interviewed on the McNeil-Lehrer TV 
program, but her candidate husband has not. And she debated Robert Dornan in 
her husband's earlier campaign for Congress but her husband has not. Since she 
is shaping and giving the candidate's message, we need to view her as a 
co-candidate. When a spouse is as involved as Mrs. Huffington or as Hillary 
Clinton, it means they'll have a major role and be part of the daily 
decision-making if the candidate is elected. So we need to learn who they 
really are. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if it's just a supportive spouse who's not taking an active 
role, they shouldn't be scrutinized in the same critical light. There shouldn't 
be a lot of dirt brought up about a spouse like that. With all the problems and 
corruption and complicated issues involved in campaigns it's already hard 
enough for voters to sort things out. LARRY PICKENS 
</P>
<P>
 Political Aide to L.A. City Council member Jackie Goldberg, partner of School 
Board Member Jeff Horton 
</P>
<P>
 People need to know that the "significant other" of someone in politics plays 
a very important role. A significant other really has to be 100% supportive of 
the person campaigning or serving in office. Sometimes you're the only one they 
can come and talk to, even if you're just listening. In my own case, listening 
has helped me to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters should consider the political beliefs, the community involvement and 
the organizations of a spouse or partner because those things give a key to the 
candidate. For example, Hillary Clinton's involvements and her support of Bill 
Clinton made me think better of him. The kind of spouse or partner a candidate 
chooses says something about that candidate. Of course, a lot of times you 
don't know anything about them until after a candidate is already elected. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think certain kinds of negative information about the significant 
other should be considered. For example, if a spouse has a drinking problem, 
you shouldn't blame the candidate. People have minds of their own, and the 
candidate shouldn't be blamed for what's done by someone acting out his or her 
own flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 But why shouldn't the significant other also get to express ideas to the 
candidate, just like every citizen? After all, we want a candidate who listens 
to everybody, because that kind of listening and working together is how all of 
us move forward. MARY SOLOW 
</P>
<P>
 Member, L.A. County Commission for Public Social Services 
</P>
<P>
 When a spouse is involved in campaigning and in making campaign and political 
decisions, who they are should be of great interest to voters. In the Senate 
race in California, Michael Huffington's wife appears involved in many 
political decisions, so who she is becomes of interest. On the other hand, I'm 
not sure that Dianne Feinstein's husband is involved in politics at all. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't say that all spouses are either an asset or a detriment. Sometimes a 
spouse is even more appealing than the candidate. While the main emphasis in 
deciding how to vote should be on the candidate, it would be foolish to ignore 
meaningful information about the spouse. I would be tremendously concerned 
about a candidate whose spouse belonged to a group I considered dangerous in 
some way, or who was corrupt or had shady connections. That kind of information 
ought to be weighed as part of the evidence on how a candidate might behave if 
elected. ZYRA MCCLOUD 
</P>
<P>
 President of Parent and Community Action Team, Inglewood 
</P>
<P>
 I think about 25% percent of a person's decision on how to vote should be 
based on the spouse of a candidate. A real leader is a strong person, inspired 
by a greater calling, by a feeling from within, one that's between the leader 
and God. 
</P>
<P>
 I would probably weigh the religion of a spouse at zero percent, unless it's a 
way-out religion that would be detrimental to the people of this country. And I 
would consider the circumstances of choosing a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at Tina Turner, for example. She went into Buddhism at a desperate time 
in her life, and Buddhism worked for her. So I wouldn't count a spouse as more 
than 25% unless that spouse belonged to some organization like the Ku Klux 
Klan. Then the warning flag would go up.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WHAT I'VE LEARNED; 
'LET'S ACT LIKE A GIANT HAND TO SLAP POLITICIANS ACROSS THE FACE'; DICK DALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm a lifelong lover of animals. I used to have a zoo at my Newport Beach 
home. I trained and cared for lions, tigers, ocelots, toucans. I try to emulate 
their roars and calls through my music. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings can never match the power and strength of the African lion, tiger 
or elephant or the power of the waves of the ocean. When you feel invincible, 
go empty-handed into a cage with a 500-pound Siberian tiger or paddle out to 
face a wave 15 feet high. You will then instantly realize what you are and what 
you are not. 
</P>
<P>
 My whole life has been surfing. But I don't surf anymore because I almost had 
my leg amputated from an infection I caught right out in front of my house in 
Newport Beach. I continued to surf and caught the same infection again in 
Hawaii, Jamaica and Tahiti. So That taught me to stay out of the water. When 
you know what's in the water, you don't go near it: DDT and mercury, raw 
sewage, chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The whales are dying out because their immune systems are breaking down. These 
creatures have never been confronted with the array of toxins that now tarnish 
their waters. Sewage is pumped offshore every day. Whenever there's a storm, 
they close the beach because of sewage spills. Humans can stay out, but what 
about the whales? What about the fish? They live there. 
</P>
<P>
 With the endless polluting of our oceans, our animals and our society, I felt 
compelled to speak through my music in the hope of reaching other people who 
wonder why the strong devour the weak. 
</P>
<P>
 To my delight, college radio stations across the country have embraced my 
music and invited me to visit and play concerts. So, for the first time in my 
life, I played to a different crowd in a different town every night. The shows 
lasted 1 1/2 hours, then I would step aside and greet people. 
</P>
<P>
 Through this ritual, I realized how many others are dismayed by the greed and 
apathy that seem to be destroying our environment and our society. These were 
people from all walks of life: housewives, skinheads, bikers, lawyers, 
students, teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 So there is a movement going on. But it needs to be bigger. If we could get 
everybody to have the mental strength and courage that comes from knowledge, we 
could have a rumbling through this country that nobody's ever seen. If we could 
unite and act like a giant hand to slap some of the politicians across the 
face, then maybe we might start receiving some legislation that is actually 
geared toward our -- and the environment's -- well being. 
</P>

OTHER MEDIA; YOLK; HOW AN ASIAN AMERICAN MAGAZINE GOT ITS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Obviously, Yolk was chosen because the yolk of an egg is yellow. It really has 
nothing to do with the fact that an egg white surrounds it or that it is 
surrounded by an outer white shell (or brown, if you choose to eat brown eggs). 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say that the yolk symbolizes the birth of something. I've also 
heard someone refer to the body builders' use of the phrase "getting yolked up" 
meaning getting bigger in size or more muscular and, when used for Asians, 
meaning empowering ourselves. Another observer said that the yolk represents 
the Asian American struggle to "break free from our shells." These are all 
good, but I prefer a simpler explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolk simply stands for the color of our skin. If you think about it, our skin 
color is really the only thing that connects Asians with other Asians and Asian 
Americans. It goes beyond geographical lines, cultural lines, language lines, 
age lines, gender lines and class lines. 
</P>
<P>
 And since self-esteem seems to be a major part of growing up, I would add that 
skin color goes beyond beauty lines as well. Yolk, above all else, stands for 
the belief that "Yellow is Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>

Yolk, "a magazine for the New Generasian," published in Los Angeles.

OTHER MEDIA; HISPANIC REPORTER; LATINOS LOSING OUT IN HOLLYWOOD NAME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are famous U.S. celebrities and unknown Latinos: Florencia Vicenta de 
Casillas, Raquel Tejada, Baldemar Huertas, Rocky Echeverria. You probably know 
them by their stage names: Vikki Carr, Raquel Welch, Freddy Fender and Steven 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens in every sector of society. But it is nowhere more apparent than in 
the entertainment industry, where over the years talented Latinos have been 
encouraged to deny their roots by changing their names. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a stage name is common among entertainers, but do they also have to 
change their ethnicity when choosing a new surname? The answer is no. Take 
Dolores del Rio, the Mexican actress whose real name was Martinez. She held on 
to her heritage when she chose a stage name and still managed to conquer 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days of Hollywood, for some celebrities, it was a matter of 
survival. They were constantly facing the dilemma of either hiding their 
heritage or losing an acting job. This makes it hard to judge and condemn them, 
but it also makes it easy to admire people like Desi Arnaz, Ricardo Montalban, 
Jose Ferrer, Cesar Romero and Fernando Lamas. By refusing to sell out their 
roots, they opened doors for today's Latino celebrities who are proud of their 
surnames: Andy Garcia, Raul Julia, Rita Moreno, Edward James Olmos, Paul 
Rodriguez and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many lead roles that call for a Latino character are given to 
non-Latinos. Al Pacino played the Cuban "Scarface." Omar Sharif was Che 
Guevara. Natalie Wood was Maria in "West Side Story."  
</P>
<P>
 In some circles, it is now convenient to have a Latino name. I know a woman 
who married a Latino and kept using her non-Latino maiden name. She was 
recently told by her agent to drop her maiden name and start using her 
husband's because she has a better shot at finding a job as a television 
reporter if she pretends to be a Latina. Go figure.

<P>
 Is affordable housing a basic democratic right? Who is responsible for 
providing it? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, the federal government formed 
the Home Owner's Loan Corp. to help families facing financial ruin refinance 
their home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time the government became involved in a federal housing 
program but it set the stage for the future. By the time the Depression ended, 
the United States had established that government would help provide a basic 
human need: a home. But 60 years later, decent housing remains beyond the reach 
of many. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is especially acute in California, where the gap between wages and 
housing prices is higher than any other state in the nation, according to Peter 
Dreier, a professor of public policy at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 A philosophical battle over how to provide affordable housing in California is 
being played out in Venice, where members of the community are torn over 
whether to renovate or demolish the aging Lincoln Place apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Place residents argue in today's In The Neighborhood about whether to 
tear down the complex and replace it with a mixed-income housing project. It is 
an emotional subject because housing is at the heart of every social and 
economic issue in American society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing is related to everything from voting to getting social services to 
getting a job," says Abel Valenzuela, an assistant professor of urban planning 
at UCLA's Cesar Chavez Center for Chicano Studies. "Housing is the basis for 
most of the social and economic activities that enable a citizen to function in 
everyday society." 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector, with the encouragement of government tax incentives, is 
playing an active role today in providing mixed housing. "We try to develop 
balanced communities," says Dawn McCormick, spokesperson for the Irvine Co. 
real estate development firm. "We want people working in the community to be 
able to live in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 No one argues with that statement where new development is concerned. But the 
issue is stickier at Lincoln Place, where existing affordable housing is at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue, however, that such battles distract from a far more important 
issue, the deductibility of home mortgage interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this fiction that government only helps the poor," says Dreier. "All 
wealthy people are subsidized. Homeowner interest deductions cost the federal 
government $47 billion last year. All of Beverly Hills gets more housing 
subsidies than South Central or East L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier advocates a progressive homeowner tax break pegged to income. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger social benefits of affordable housing might also be worth 
considering.  
</P>
<P>
 "If people are sleeping four families to a small apartment, there is no 
conducive atmosphere for growth and nurturing," says Ginger Garcia of Habitat 
for Humanity, a nonprofit group dedicated to building low-cost housing. "We 
believe that if people have a safe haven they can break the cycle of poverty."

 Birth of the Bab: Beginning Wednesday evening, Baha'is celebrate the 
anniversary of the birth of Siyyid Ali Muhammad, prophet and forerunner to 
Baha'u'llah, founder of the Baha'i faith.Born Oct. 20, 1820, in Shiraz, Persia 
(now Iran), he would later take the tile Bab, meaning gate in Persian, 
announcing that he was a prophet whose mission was to prepare the world for the 
appearance of another who would fulfill the promises of previous religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The birth of the Bab is a day on which Baha'is suspend work. It is celebrated 
locally with prayers, readings from sacred scriptures and music. In Iran, 
Baha'i followers are persecuted, even executed, and are not free to worship 
publicly.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; 'WILL 
MARGARET CHO'S DEPICTIONS REFLECT ON MY OWN FAMILY?'; A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS 
WORRIES THAT THE STEREOTYPED COMEDY OF 'ALL AMERICAN GIRL' WILL BE SEEN AS 
REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KIM, Karen Kim is a senior at Calabasas High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fall is the season of change and beginnings: Parents eagerly await the first 
day of school, which many of their children regard with dread. The weather 
grows colder, a reminder that the fun-filled days at the beach are over until 
next year. And then there's new television sitcom lineup, which this year has 
an Asian twist with Margaret Cho's "All American Girl" on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first heard that Cho would star in a comedy dealing with relationships 
between Korean parents and their Americanized children, I was excited that 
Hollywood was acknowledging Asian Americans, who are scarce in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But this happiness was almost immediately replaced with reservations and 
anxiety. I've seen Cho's comedy act several times and find her very funny. But 
even as I'm laughing, I feel a little embarrassed about her depictions of her 
family.  
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing for small group of people to laugh at Cho while she pokes fun 
at her own family; it's another thing to have a whole nation of viewers 
laughing at her jokes on her heritage -- jokes that many viewers will assume 
pertain to all Korean American families. When Cho makes fun of her 
old-fashioned grandmother, will viewers think my grandmother is the same way? 
To TV watchers who don't know any better, will Cho's depiction of her 
television family reflect on my parents? 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that while Cho is funny, her show has the potential to be a 
major stereotype of Korean American life. Her show is going to be the only real 
example to America of how Korean Americans live and that's a big responsibility 
for a television show and for Cho.  
</P>
<P>
 After watching the first few episodes, my anxieties have yet to disappear. 
Although the show is funny and has a promising plot line, I have a problem with 
the way the so-called traditional Korean family is depicted. The biggest is 
that Cho's attitude toward her parents is exaggerated to the point of 
unbelievability. No Korean daughter -- no matter how Americanized she is -- can 
speak to her mother as disrespectfully as Cho's character does. A Korean 
grandmother is a respected figure of authority but on the show she sometimes 
seems silly and ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
 The show is also inaccurate about cultural traditions. In one episode, Cho's 
mother gives her a necklace, explaining that it has been passed through 
generations of her family. That sort of tradition is Chinese, unheard of in a 
Korean family. Another time, the story centered around the belief that the way 
the house is arranged determines the family's luck. That is feng shui , a 
custom that is basically Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has great potential. I am proud of Cho's accomplishments. With a 
little more attention to cultural details, I am optimistic the show will be a 
great step forward for Koreans, something everyone could take pride in.

<P>
 On the heels of fall it comes, like a gusty Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicators of its arrival litter store aisles like leaves in the street: 
Jack-o'-lanterns, witches, black cats, skeletons. Cobwebs suspend from 
ceilings; ghosts peer out from candy-laden displays; monsters dangle on racks 
alongside Princess Jasmine costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween, a day mingled with harmless reverie and diabolical ritual, is here 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since I became a parent I have struggled with this holiday. On a 
superficial level, I wonder why I feel obligated to purchase a cache of candy 
that I never buy during the rest of the year and give those sweets away to 
anyone who rings the doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the superficial, though, I wonder why I should acquiesce to traditions 
of a holiday that have nothing to do with my religious faith, traditions which 
can be traced to Druid priests whose superstitious fears drove them to don 
grotesque costumes and offer sacrifices to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The early Christian church attempted to sanitize these pagan rites by moving 
"All Saints' Day" from spring to fall and designating it "All Hallow's Eve." 
Halloween, the day of tricks, treats, and other childish fancies, is all that 
remains of that ancient Druid ritual, and today most people recognize it as 
such. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, though, the veil masking the reality of Halloween is flimsy. With 
little effort I can remove that veil and see Halloween for what it is: a 
holiday steeped in sorcery and the occult. So as a Christian parent, I 
struggle. Do I conform to the generally accepted image of Halloween or do I 
dissent, a maverick? 
</P>
<P>
 When my oldest child was small, dissent was uncomplicated: Darken the house, 
leave a sign on the porch, ignore the doorbell.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until my daughter entered school that the struggle became more 
complicated. Her school had Halloween parties. Her friends dressed up. It did 
no good to explain to her, "Christians don't celebrate Halloween" because even 
some of her Christian friends went trick-or-treating. How could I explain to 
her that sometimes Christians disagree about certain issues, that occasionally 
we have to make decisions about our behavior based on personal conviction, not 
on conformity to what others do? 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween nears, so once again I struggle. Not because my conviction has 
changed; it hasn't. Indeed, it became more resolute last year after friends 
awoke the morning after Halloween and discovered their pet chickens 
disemboweled on their back porch -- victims, it would appear, of a midnight 
ritual performed in stealth by unknown celebrants.  
</P>
<P>
 No, my struggle is more subjective. I feel a momentary weakening in resolve as 
I watch my daughter admire a neighbor's costume or bravely shrug and answer 
"nothing" when asked for the 19th time, "What are you going to be for 
Halloween?" Is it wrong, I muse, to impose my beliefs on a child who is perhaps 
incapable of comprehending? Should my convictions cause her to suffer? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I should just go along with the innocuous aspects of the holiday and 
ignore the spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a struggle I would rather not have to face. If I had the power to enact 
legislation, I would eliminate Halloween from the calendar. At best, I find it 
a useless waste of time and money; at worst, a dangerous foray into an 
uncertain spiritual realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Halloween is here to stay and with it, my annual scrutiny. Each 
year I conclude anew that what the majority does need not influence my 
lifestyle, nor that of my children. For now, I am grateful our church offers 
alternative festivities compatible with our faith. I'm grateful for the few 
people I know who share our convictions and strive to instill them in their 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostly I'm grateful that, though Halloween arrives faithfully on the heels of 
fall, it just as faithfully departs. 
</P>
<P>
 And on its heels, like a pleasant breeze, comes Thanksgiving.

</P>
<P>
 I loved the Gilbertian humor of your editorial, in which you call upon the 
British to allow Gerry Adams (president of the Irish nationalist party Sinn 
Fein) to visit London -- the capital of the United Kingdom. The British claim 
that, as one prime minister put it, "Northern Ireland is as much a part of the 
United Kingdom as Yorkshire."Under British law, Adams is a citizen of the 
United Kingdom. At one time, he was an elected member of the United Kingdom 
Parliament. Yet he is banned from visiting London. A rough analogy in this 
country would be to restrict Sen. Edward Kennedy to Massachusetts and deny him 
entry to any of the other 49 states. 
</P>
<P>
 On reflection, that is not such a bad idea.

OFF BEAT THERAPIES GO TO WASHINGTON; FLAP DEVELOPS OVER EFFORT TO VALIDATE 
ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Established medicine has long been slow to recognize the potential value of 
unconventional therapies. When acupuncturists from Asia first introduced that 
technique in this country, they were shunned and reviled by most doctors. Today 
acupuncture is widely accepted as a means of treating pain and other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current uproar in Washington over how to validate so-called 
alternative medical therapies gives us concern. Leaders of the National 
Institutes of Health are under intense pressure from Congress to study bee 
pollen, shark cartilage, special diets and other unproved remedies for a 
variety of diseases and conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 With an angry blast at what he called improper pressure from Congress to 
bypass the rigors of science to validate alternative remedies, Dr. Joseph 
Jacobs resigned Sept. 30 as director of the NIH's Office of Alternative 
Medicine. That office was formed two years ago largely at the behest of a 
powerful Democrat, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, who claims to have cured his 
allergies by taking capsules of bee pollen recommended by a friend who is a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 PRAYER AND DIETS: The potential value of alternative remedies has been 
underscored by the scourge of AIDS and certain cancers, which have shown the 
limitations of conventional medicine. Even if the afflicted find only better 
quality of life rather than a cure, it is worth studying whether meditation, 
yoga, massage, hypnosis, imagery, macrobiotic diets and prayer can be useful 
adjuncts to traditional treatments. There are some good studies suggesting that 
such techniques, although offering no cures, can extend life. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are dangers. Alternative medicine has provided fertile ground 
for all manner of snake-oil salesmen and other scam artists who prey on the 
desperate and gullible. At best, the patients lose their money; at worst their 
lives. There is a crying need for an agency like the NIH to separate the wheat 
from the chaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that controls the NIH 
budget, asserts that Americans spend $13 billion a year on various 
unconventional therapies and that the federal government has done little to try 
to determine which are valid. He complains that the NIH office under Jacobs was 
poorly managed and the agency was slow to change. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue seems to boil down to how to validate the alternative therapies. 
Jacobs wanted to create several university-based centers where the therapies 
could be tested by people who have no emotional or financial stakes in the 
outcome. Harkin's backers preferred "site investigations" whereby the NIH would 
help alternative practitioners devise proper clinical trials of their 
techniques so they could qualify for approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 BEES AND SHARKS: The NIH's alternative medicine office plans to support site 
investigations of a number of alternative therapies, including the use of bee 
pollen to treat asthma, a urine extract called antineoplastons to combat brain 
tumors and shark cartilage to treat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin says he favors a combination of the center and site approaches and 
disputes suggestions that he is hostile to scientific method, which relies on 
controlled replicable experiments. But the problem is that many of the 
practitioners of alternative medicine are skeptical of scientific method and 
are not good candidates to enlist to study and evaluate their own work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Office of Alternative Medicine accounts for only a tiny 
fraction of the NIH budget, the issue has presented the NIH director, Harold 
Varmus, with a particularly sticky issue as the search goes on for a new 
alternative medicine director. The NIH should realize it has given inadequate 
attention to offbeat and perhaps even weird regimens. But both the agency and 
Harkin will be embarrassed if it lets down the guard against medical 
charlatans.

PROP. 185: TOO AMBITIOUS, TOO COSTLY; MEASURE CALLING FOR 4% GAS TAX HIKE IS 
RIDDLED WITH FLAWS; VOTE NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 185, one of the measures on the Nov. 8 ballot, attempts to do too 
much at too great a cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, it would impose a 4% sales tax on gasoline, with revenues 
dedicated to a variety of mandated transportation projects. This additional tax 
would add around 5 cents to the price of each gallon. As gasoline prices rose, 
so would revenues from the tax. It's projected that Proposition 185 would 
produce about $700 million a year in its initial phases. There is no expiration 
date for the tax. It would go on indefinitely, until repealed by a vote of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 is a highly complicated, 78-page initiative that is heavily 
weighted toward rail systems. It's no coincidence that its major backer is 
Southern Pacific. The measure mandates at least $850 million toward the 
purchase of SP rights of way and improvements to SP facilities, including the 
Coast Route. 
</P>
<P>
 A second major backer is Morrison-Knudsen, which builds rail cars. Proposition 
185 -- again by no coincidence -- specifically bans magnetic levitation trains 
of the kinds now being built abroad. In so doing it commits to what is regarded 
as an obsolescent technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 contains other serious flaws. Only one-fourth of its funds 
would be allocated to seismic safety refitting, and that only until the year 
2000. Much of the state's most important safety needs would thus be left unmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would decide how the steadily rising revenues produced by Proposition 185 
would be spent? The measure would set up a three-member body with exclusive 
authority to operate outside the existing transportation process. Decisions of 
that body would be made by majority vote. Thus two people could effectively 
control how billions of dollars in transportation revenues would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185, given its great cost, would in fact do little to solve the 
air pollution, energy conservation, seismic safety and public transportation 
problems it purports to address. Nor could its requirements be easily changed. 
Under its terms it would take a four-fifths vote by the Legislature to change 
any of its key provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians can do better than lock themselves into this measure. We urge a 
"no" vote on Proposition 185.

A CAUSE THAT CAN'T BE TALKED TO DEATH; GOP FILIBUSTER BLOCKS LOBBYING/CAMPAIGN 
REFORM, BUT OBSTRUCTIONISM WON'T HAVE FINAL SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 24 years as president of the public interest group Common Cause, Fred 
Wertheimer has reason to say, as he did last Tuesday, that it is time for him 
to move on. Sadly, however, Wertheimer's last Common Cause news releases are an 
indirect commentary on the blind congressional obstructionism that is driving 
good people away from public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer's last releases scored the Republican-led filibuster that 
successfully blocked a reform banning gifts from lobbyists to members of 
Congress and requiring that the names of contributors to political action 
committees be disclosed. On this issue, the will of the voters is 
overwhelmingly clear, and the first Senate votes respected it. The ban on 
lobbyist gifts to members of Congress, including lobbyist-paid travel and 
contributions to entities controlled by members of Congress, initially passed 
in the Senate on a 95-4 vote. The requirement that the names of contributors to 
PACs be disclosed passed 95 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, after final House approval, when the bills came up for final 
Senate approval, 38 senators, of whom 32 are Republicans, joined in a 
filibuster against the very reform they had first endorsed. They did not have 
the votes to defeat it, so they talked it to death. 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing the bill, the Republicans exaggerated the impact of a provision 
added by the House in conference that would have made lobbying disclosure rules 
apply to all PACs, including grass-roots organizations. But when Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell and the Democrats offered to delete this part of the 
bill, the only part to which objection had been made, the Republicans declined 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? On the eve of an election, the Republicans preferred to have a do-nothing 
Congress to run against rather than a did-something Congress that might reflect 
credit on the majority party. Asked why he had switched his vote, Minority 
Leader Bob Dole said, disingenuously, that he had not read the bill carefully 
enough. Virtually every non-incumbent candidate running for Congress runs 
against Congress. To that extent, the worse Congress looks, the better it is 
for congressional challengers. But when this premise leads to the conclusion, 
"Let's make Congress look as bad as possible and hope the electorate turns to 
us," the real losers are the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters certainly lose when the lobbyists and PACs win, but Common Cause 
will return to this fray, and Wertheimer, who has served his organization and 
the country well, will live to fight another day. Thanks in good measure to the 
efforts of Common Cause, this issue is not going to go away.

THE BIBLE AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Manipulating the Bible for Political Ends," Column Right, Oct. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Thomas' cynical denunciation of President Clinton's religious views 
reflects more on the pettiness of Thomas than the shortcomings of Clinton. 
Thomas berates Clinton for intentionally misinterpreting the Bible for 
political ends, and for promoting "bogus theology." He ridicules Clinton's 
assertion that he prays about difficult decisions. And he poses the rhetorical 
question, "Who elected Bill Clinton theologian in chief?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' religious arrogance serves not only to diminish himself, but 
unfortunately, may reflect negatively on the Bible as well: Readers might 
mistakenly assume that Thomas learned his caustic attitudes from the Bible 
itself. He did not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bible is a magnificent and diverse collection of ancient writings, the 
unifying themes of which are that God created humankind, and that people may, 
during the course of their lives, seek God. Everyone from private citizens to 
presidents has the right to read and interpret the Scriptures, and if we wish, 
to let them influence our political and moral convictions. As created by God, 
we are all theologians in chief.

</P>
<P>
 I am no theologian, but I must take exception to Thomas' article. He, like 
others of the extreme right, claims ownership on all Bible interpretations as 
long as it suits their purpose. If anyone differs with them, they call it 
"Bible revisionism." The country now has had a President who believes in God, 
and who has a history of attending church (not just for political ends), but 
his views are different than Thomas' extreme views, so that invalidates those 
views to Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Theology aside, once a person is elected to office, isn't that person supposed 
to serve all the people, not just those that hold one extreme viewpoint? Or is 
it just easier for Thomas to paint a lopsided picture of someone who does not 
agree with him politically?

 It's time to remind Thomas that the laws of this country are not derived from 
"his" Bible, but from the hearts and minds of Americans free from the 
ambiguities and prejudices of an ancient document translated in many different 
ways to suit the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, pandering to whichever group he happens to be addressing, 
mistakes the real moral high ground as the Baptist publishers and their narrow 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the American people, the majority of whom work hard each day, don't 
discriminate against anyone and feel medical conditions are the business of the 
doctor and his patient, that are the true moral strength of this country. When 
will the proponents of less government practice what they preach by keeping 
their religion out of my life, and minding their own business?

GENDER EQUITY ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suzanne Fields maligns the Gender Equity Act and the American Assn. of 
University Women ("Pork for the Female Chauvinist Pigs," Commentary, Sept. 29) 
for daring to want girls to receive an equal education. Fortunately her 
rhetoric was unconvincing to Congress and the act received final passage today 
(Oct. 5.) 
</P>
<P>
 Educators and parents recognize that despite the gains girls and women have 
made in recent years, they have not achieved equality in significant ways such 
as the earning power of their education. Even with a college education, a woman 
earns, on the average, only as much as a man with a high school diploma. Much 
of the comparative income gains women have made in recent years are because 
men's salaries have gone down. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAUW seeks substantive answers to the continued disparity and has found 
them in the classroom. "How Schools Shortchange Girls" summarizes over 1,300 
research studies to report that girls receive less qualitative and quantitative 
attention in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 If our country is to flourish in the 21st Century, we need a well-educated 
work force of both women and men. The Gender Equity Act will provide the 
resources schools and teachers need to assure all students an equal stake in 
the future.

 Fields quotes some woman from some group called the Independent Women's Forum 
who claimed the overwhelming support from both parties for the Gender Equity 
Act is based on "untenable data." What data is that? The fact that females are 
the only group in America to begin school testing ahead and leave having fallen 
far behind? Or perhaps the SAT data? That boys typically receive scores a 
meaningful 50 to 60 points higher than girls on this critical exam, which is 
required for admission to most colleges and often determines admittance? 
Untenable data? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a serious gender equity problem in our schools and, contrary to 
Fields' supposition, it goes far beyond any low self-esteem reporting. The 
Gender Equity Act is a welcomed step in trying to solve a difficult problem 
that seriously shortchanges half the population in our schools.

POLIO BANISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial "A Frightful Disease Is Banished" (Oct. 1) elicited memories of 
a terrifying day in 1950 when we rushed our 13-month-old son to the 
Communicable Diseases building at Los Angeles County Hospital, where we were 
given the dreaded diagnosis, "polio." After four months of daily visits, he was 
able to be removed from the iron lung and was breathing without 
assistance.Multiple surgeries and physical and mental anguish were part of his 
childhood and teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are memories, too, of many others -- the brave, young woman whose two 
young children and husband were patients there, the beautiful little girl named 
Claudia who stared at us from the iron lung next to our son's. They became 
parts of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 What a wonderful day when the World Health Organization declared the Western 
Hemisphere to be free from polio! Thank you, Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert 
Sabin, from our hearts. Thank you, too, to the March of Dimes; without it we 
could not have survived. Our son, who is now 45 years of age and enjoying life, 
thanks you, too!

OB/GYN SERVICES BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would hope that your paper would give some space to inform the public about 
an Assembly bill co-authored by Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) and Debra Bowen 
(D-Marina del Rey) and pushed by women's groups and the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It was recently signed by Gov. Pete Wilson and 
will become law on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 This bill will free the women who are covered under certain HMOs to go to 
their obstetrician/gynecologist for all services. Previously, these HMOs 
directed all female patients go to the primary-care ("gatekeeper") 
family-practice physician for women's services, despite the fact that most 
women already had a relationship with an obstetrician/gynecologist, most often 
of many years duration. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, all women in all HMOs will be able to designate their 
obstetrician/gynecologist as their primary care provider if they so desire. 
This bill is seen as a victory by women's groups and by gynecologists in 
righting a restrictive policy that forced women to seek personal services from 
someone they didn't know or want to see, or in many cases cost the patient 
extra since they were obligated to pay for uncovered services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, women can still go to their family practitioner for gynecological 
services if they desire.

IF 'THE END IS NEAR,' SO IS VIOLENCE; SOLAR TEMPLE: THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN 
APOCALYPTIC GROUPS; THE CHALLENGE IS HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM TO PREVENT TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID C. RAPOPORT, David C. Rapoport is a professor of political science and 
acting chair of religious studies at UCLA. His latest book is Inside Terrorist 
Organizations, (Columbia University, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are tragic and grotesque happenings in religious sects becoming commonplace? 
When 53 Solar Temple members were found dead in Switzerland and Canada this 
month, everyone remembered the fires that consumed more than 80 people in Waco 
and the 913 suicides in Jonestown. In all three, the leaders died too, and the 
groups shared a dominant theological conviction: the world was collapsing to 
make way for a perfect new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The events stimulate many questions. Why does this belief lead some to 
stockpile arms and suicide? Were the climaxes inevitable? Do many share the 
conviction? Where does the belief come from? 
</P>
<P>
 When God is seen as all-powerful and wholly benevolent, some ask why the good 
suffer. A conventional response is that when each person dies, justice will be 
meted out in heaven and hell. An apocalyptic answer, derived too from the Bible 
and Koran, is that God has promised the end will be a collective one, an awful 
day of carnage and retribution here, and the signs are that the process is 
beginning soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest apocalyptic groups, the Essenes and Zealots-Sicarri appear in the 
1st Century AD and ever since, apocalyptic groups have multiplied. Usually 
leaders are believed to have divine powers because scripture promises that a 
messiah will appear, or Christ will return. Ambiguous and unchangeable sacred 
texts of established religions constantly stimulate new apocalyptic groups. 
There may be 30,000 groups in the world today, 800 in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority are pacifist, seeking a sanctuary or base to 
separate themselves and prepare for the new world. Sometimes their behavior 
reflects the times; when society expects great tribulations, more people arm 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The late medieval era was such a period, and so is ours, perpetually buffeted 
by new secular predictions of world collapse. Religious ages produce larger 
apocalyptic groups able to expand; our secular era stimulates tiny ones that 
may stockpile arms for defense, always knowing that their effort is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Apocalyptic pacifists see all wars that states wage as serving evil interests, 
but violence to end the world is altogether different. Sacred texts teach that 
divine force is essential then, and the righteous may be called to participate. 
A group believing that the end is near and the day is knowable can be dangerous 
because so much anxiety is aroused about who will be saved and why. Violence is 
an option, but one rarely taken first. 
</P>
<P>
 The group aims to be saved and knows the righteous will be persecuted. When 
the apocalypse seems imminent, the group's lifestyle, always organized to 
challenge existing social conventions, makes more demands. Sometimes the 
demands become provocative and bizarre, especially when sex, property and 
clothing are affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skoptsi, a 19th-Century Russian group of about 10,000, convinced that the 
new world would be sexless, demonstrated their faith by castrating all males 
and cutting off all female breasts. Canadian Dukhobors regularly burn their 
possessions and make long nudist marches. Public outrage in response makes 
believers feel that persecution is increasing, bringing the end and salvation 
nearer. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate form of persecution is martyrdom. In some theologies martyrdom 
creates a new life for the martyr and a new world for others. Jesus called his 
dying a baptism, and the Gospel according to John describes martyrdom as the 
seed that must die so that the wheat will grow -- a theme found in Solar Temple 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Preaching used to be the road to martyrdom. A world that protects speech 
closes that path, which may help explain why the ancient Zealot-Sicarri 
practices of collective suicide appeal when all else fails. The aim is to 
blackmail God to fulfill his promise. The whole group must participate because 
that is the condition of the promise. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too easy to demonize apocalyptic groups. But only a small proportion 
becomes violent and many find scriptural reasons to turn back. The Quakers had 
violent origins and the peaceful, productive Pennsylvania Dutch were once 
Anabaptists, the most feared religious terror group of 16th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Adequate policies recognize that apocalyptic doctrines always provide choices, 
and our inability to acknowledge that contributed to the Waco tragedy, or so a 
Texas jury and many academic authorities believe. Canadian officials fearful of 
another Waco tried to convict Solar Temple leaders on a variety of charges. 
Their evidence was not convincing. Did their efforts encourage the group 
perception that the end was near, as its documents suggest? There will be other 
confrontations; do we know enough to cope?

PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNITY POLICING; A SAFER CITY IS WORTH A LITTLE WORK; THERE 
WON'T BE OVERNIGHT MIRACLES. BUT WE WILL BENEFIT LONG-TERM IF CITIZENS AND 
OFFICERS SHARE THE LOAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY A. OLIVER, Jerry A. Oliver is chief of the Pasadena Police Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a year or so ago, community-based policing was held out by academics and 
law-enforcement leaders as a preferred way to solve urban crime problems. Now, 
like "new math," it is being sent to the dustbin almost before it is out of its 
wrapping. A South-Central Los Angeles group named Agenda has attacked the 
community-policing priorities of the Los Angeles Police Department. Houston 
Mayor Bob Lanier brags about a 30% reduction in crime because of basic police 
work that avoids the "social worker" syndrome of "neighborhood-oriented 
policing."  
</P>
<P>
 What happened? How could a concept that seemed to hold so much promise present 
such disappointments, especially to the rank-and-file officer on the street? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is impatience. We live in a world of 22-minute TV sitcom 
solutions. The most complex of world problems are shrunk into 25-second 
commercials. When community-based policing didn't work miracles overnight, we 
were ready to move on. Guardian Angels, perhaps. Or Clint Eastwood-style, 
bare-fisted law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing holds as much promise as it ever did. In fact, it is 
the only formula that holds a prayer of long-term success in our democratic 
society. What is community-based policing? It is a philosophy of identifying 
and solving problems. It seeks to attack crime at its roots, rather than 
trimming its branches. It is a partnership of police and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing is not a new concept; it is a return to the 
philosophy of the cop-on-the-neighborhood-beat tradition. It is a return all 
the way back to Robert Peele's London "bobbies," the great-grandparents of 
modern police. It began to wane when police climbed into automobiles. The radio 
patrol car offered great mobility and fast response time in a widespread area, 
but the efficiency came at the expense of police-citizen acquaintance. Today, 
citizens talk to officers only when getting a ticket or reporting a crime. They 
see officers in coffee shops but don't know their names. Police see citizens as 
figures through windshields, divided into three castes: suspects, victims or 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's compare the public's relationship with law-enforcement professionals to 
the way people relate to health-care professionals. What if we stopped being 
responsible for our personal health? What if we smoked, gorged ourselves on 
cholesterol and fats, sunbathed and ate spoiled food and then held our doctors 
responsible? It wouldn't work, because we have the lion's share of 
responsibility for our own health. In the same way, we have the major 
responsibility for the safety of our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, community-based policing is our everyday way of doing business, 
from the decision-making of the department brass to the implementation by the 
street-level patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an example: After the first Rodney King trial verdicts were handed 
down, there was as much anger and frustration in Pasadena's large African 
American community as elsewhere in Southern California. Our police and 
community leaders met immediately after the threat became clear and formed a 
group known as We Care. Leaders and neighbors from the African American 
community rode throughout the day and night with police to keep the peace. One 
of these people approached a youth in a growing and volatile throng. "I know 
you," he said. "You're Mrs. Johnson's boy. Get along home now before there's 
trouble." That drama of neighbors calming neighbors was replayed throughout 
tense days and nights, and Pasadena was spared the destruction and violence 
that marred Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We tend to think of our crime problem in terms of front-page news: drive-by 
shootings, carjackings and murders. But the real threat to our way of life is 
the insidious tide of "silent" crime such as burglaries, vandalism and auto 
thefts. Controlling crime comes in three parts: Prevention and intervention are 
the first two, and citizens and police share the responsibility for both. The 
third part is tracking down and incarcerating wrongdoers after the first two 
stages fail. Police carry most of the responsibility here. Vigilantes are not a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Forging a citizen-police partnership is hard and will take many years. Police 
won't like it, because they'll be less independent and more accountable to 
"real people." Citizens will find it a nuisance to take the time and effort to 
share the responsibility. They'll be frustrated at times when they call the 
police only to have the police involve them in the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 As citizens become more aware, involved and trusting of the system, 
community-based policing will cause more calls for service, not less, and the 
involvement of police in the causes of criminal activity will result in more 
arrests, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing isn't an alternative to crime-fighting; it's the only 
way to permeate the community and identify evolving problems before they are 
full-grown. With ratios of about one police officer to 1,000 citizens, there 
can never be enough police to reduce crime in any other way.

PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNITY POLICING; AT LAST, WASHINGTON RECOGNIZES ITS ROLE; 
THE FLOW OF NEW FUNDING SHOULD PUT MORE COPS 'ON THE BLOCK' TO DEVELOP CITIZEN 
PARTNERSHIPS AGAINST CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK V. MURPHY, Patrick V. Murphy, former New York City police 
commissioner, is director of the Police Policy Board of the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorized "preventive" patrolling with minimal citizen interaction has been 
the almost-universal method of policing for 40 years. Research has shown it has 
no significant impact on crime. Yet it prevails. Myths die hard in a world that 
is not research-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste involved in unproductive patrolling cannot be justified. That time 
could be spent productively by becoming a friendly "member" of a neighborhood 
community, exchanging information with residents about crime and known 
criminals. Officers need the eyes, ears, information and influence of parents, 
neighbors, teachers, students and community leaders. The role of the police is 
to assist every neighborhood. The police alone cannot control crime. People 
control crime, mainly socially, while the police assist in a proactive manner.  
</P>
<P>
 Community policing works because it mobilizes the most necessary resource, the 
people. A village-sized neighborhood community is the crime-prevention machine. 
The best engine for empowering it is an individual patrol officer -- "cop of 
the block." A friendly officer of their own, assisting them to control their 
streets and protect their homes, motivates residents to learn crime patterns 
and the identities of criminals and delinquents. It is easier to report crimes 
and suspicious activities to a known officer than to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Without community policing, people in poor, high-crime neighborhoods cooperate 
less in protecting themselves. With it, they are empowered to take back control 
from the pushers and improve their lot.  
</P>
<P>
 As valuable as the additional officers funded under the new federal crime law 
will be, the transformation of officers from strangers to "cops of the block" 
throughout the country will have an even greater impact. It will not overcome 
the poverty and high unemployment rates that generate violence and other crime. 
It will, however, favorably change the relationship between police and people, 
especially the working poor. It is easy for a middle-class officer to 
stereotype minorities when she knows them principally as suspects and 911 
callers. On the other hand, an individual officer with responsibility for 
protecting 1,000 residents can empathize with them as law-abiding citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 We must never have a national police force. But 17,000 local departments 
cannot be effective without the assistance, coordination and leadership of the 
federal government. That support has never been given until now. For 30 years, 
the law-enforcement assistance programs have been too little and too late. 
Finally, with the recently passed law, some real money is coming from 
Washington. At last, a President has insisted on backup for the officers who 
will patrol the streets and alleys of every city and town tonight and tomorrow.

DEFENSE PUSHES RAMS AROUND CORNER, 17-10; PRO FOOTBALL: CONLAN'S PLAY AGAINST 
THE GIANTS EPITOMIZES L.A.'S EFFORT TO SALVAGE A .500 RECORD BY THE BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bloody and bruised Shane Conlan, the embodiment of the Rams in a season of 
hard knocks, drove his helmet into Giant running back Rodney Hampton Sunday and 
exorcised the second-half demons that have bedeviled his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton had run the same play in the first quarter for 27 yards and a 
touchdown but, with the Rams clinging to a seven-point lead on the Giants' 
opening possession of the third quarter, he was dropped for a one-yard loss on 
fourth and one from the Ram 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning how to win these games after letting a couple get away," said 
Conlan, after the Rams held tough for a 17-10 victory before 40,474 at Anaheim 
Stadium. "We approached this like a playoff game and -- thank God -- I think 
we've turned the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar situation a week ago, the Rams squandered a 17-3 halftime lead 
and saw the Packers score on their first possession of the third quarter on the 
way to rallying for a 24-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan stopped Hampton, safety Anthony Newman completed the second half 
shutout with an interception and the Rams (3-4) toppled the Giants (3-3) for 
the sixth time in their last eight meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atlanta made us mad," Newman said, referring to the Falcons' come-from-behind 
8-5 victory here two weeks ago. "On defense, we had the possibility to win the 
game and we let it get away. We wanted the ball in our court today . . . we 
wanted to be the hero, not the goat. We wanted to redeem ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, playing with his right hand wrapped into a club to protect a 
dislocated little finger, made a one-handed interception at the 50-yard line on 
a Dave Brown pass intended for Mike Sherrard with 1:06 remaining in the game. 
While his teammates yelled, "Fall to the ground! Fall to the ground!" Newman 
ran 16 seconds off the clock and returned the ball to the Giant 26-yard line to 
secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to win this game as a defensive unit," Newman said. "Look at 
Conlan; there's blood on his nose, he's limping, he's hurting and he's going to 
bust you in the mouth. . . . We just feel when it comes down to the nitty 
gritty, we can't be beat as a defensive unit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense had a streak of 10 consecutive quarters without giving up a 
touchdown before the Packers' second-half comeback, but they now have a new one 
started after yielding only a first-quarter touchdown against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They no doubt whipped us," said Giant Coach Dan Reeves. "When you lose three 
in a row, you certainly aren't doing many things right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton became the first back to gain more than 100 yards against the Rams 
this season, with 112 in 27 carries. But after gaining 74 yards in the first 
half in 16 rushes, Hampton managed only 38 yards in the second half in 11 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't run the ball that much," Hampton said. "You saw how Jerome 
Bettis got it in the fourth quarter. He got his tank going and kept the chains 
moving. I just wanted the ball, but the Rams kept the ball in the fourth 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran 30 times for 88 yards, including 42 in the fourth quarter, and 
played keep away from the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the ball much, but we're still supposed to do more with it 
when we get it," Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' touchdown came in the first quarter when the Rams were caught with 
only 10 defenders on the field. David Treadwell added a 24-yard field goal in 
the second quarter, but in the second half they were unsuccessful four times on 
third down and were unable to sustain an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, meanwhile, started as quickly as they had a week ago in Green Bay. 
Linebacker Joe Kelly's interception at the Ram 48-yard line and return to the 
Giant 21 set up Chris Miller's 19-yard touchdown pass to rookie Isaac Bruce 
three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams went ahead, 14-7, in the closing minutes of the first quarter with 
Miller completing a 12-yard pass to tight end Troy Drayton. It was Drayton's 
fourth touchdown reception of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making a great effort to get me the ball," said Drayton, who had 
three catches for 39 yards. "The touchdown play was something we saw on film . 
. . Howard Griffth ran underneath and I made a cut and the linebacker fell off 
me. Chris Miller stayed with me and it showed he has a lot of confidence in me 
that I could get open." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is battling to keep Chris Chandler on the bench, had time to throw 
behind a makeshift offensive line featuring first-time NFL starters Wayne Gandy 
and Chuck Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played well in the first half, but I had time to throw the ball," said 
Miller, who was 13 of 26 for 197 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. The 
bottom line is that we executed. We at least took a little pressure off the 
defense. But we have to score some points in the second half. I'm getting too 
many gray hairs and too thin up top to go through all this stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's 12-yard pass to wide receiver Jessie Hester on third and eight with 
less than three minutes to play not only extended Hester's streak to 69 games 
in which he has caught a pass, but kept the Giant offense on the sideline. Two 
costly Giant penalties -- directed at Miller -- also kept the Ram offense in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mistakes aren't just happening to us . . . finally, a good sign," Conlan 
said. "It was a must win if we were going to turn this season around. Our goal 
was to be 4-4 going into the break, and now we have that chance in New Orleans 
this week."

COWBOYS LEAVE CUNNINGHAM A BEATEN, BRUISED BELIEVER, 24-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after being added to a long list of victims who stumble from Texas 
Stadium with blue stars in their eyes and cowboy songs blistering their ears, 
Randall Cunningham admitted his biggest mistake Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't one of his four interceptions, or even his lost fumble, though all 
contributed to the Philadelphia Eagles' 24-13 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest mistake is one that probably will be repeated 10 more times this 
season, by those who have the misfortune of playing the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest mistake was believing his team actually had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come in here you, you think you're going to pull one out. . . ." said 
Cunningham slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, wham. The final score is 24-13, it should have been 24-0, and you 
wonder if you will stop hurting by Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Cowboys do," said Cunningham, as if describing an accident to the 
police, "is play sound football every single play ." 
</P>
<P>
 What they are doing, it became apparent in their toughest test to date, is 
exactly what they have done the last two seasons while winning consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 They are playing like the No. 1 team in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere below are the San Francisco 49ers and San Diego Chargers and still 
the Eagles. But you have to look hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you're supposed to be objective, but sometimes you've got to look at 
the obvious," said Cowboy guard Nate Newton. "We are kicking some butt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys (5-1) have outscored opponents 149-69 and own the top-ranked 
defense in the league. They proved again Sunday that they are so good: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They can win even though they gain six total yards in the first quarter, a 
mess that featured more deflected punts (1) than first downs (0) or completions 
by quarterback Troy Aikman (0). 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 7-0, the Cowboys calmly cleaned it all up in the second period by 
scoring two unanswered touchdowns while outgaining the Eagles, 137-9. 
</P>
<P>
 From the end of the first period until the end of the game, Aikman didn't 
bounce another pass, completing 12 of 19 for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have no idea how important it was that Troy kept his composure," said 
Dallas Coach Barry Switzer. "Everybody else can go nuts . . . if that guy goes 
nuts on you, it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I was battling any demons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No, merely the league's second-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They can win even though their star running back, playing with a sore 
hamstring, gets conked on the head during an important second-period drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith sat shakily on the bench for two plays, stuck his head in front 
of a sideline fan for one play, then returned to the field with the Cowboys on 
the Eagle five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he dove across the end zone to score a touchdown in his 
team-record eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who finished with 106 yards, said afterward he felt relieved because, 
"It's been a long time since I've had a 100-yard game." 
</P>
<P>
 Four whole weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They can win even though their opponents have the ball in Cowboy territory 
four consecutive times in the first 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 This game was decided then. The Eagles could score only once during that time 
because of a stunting, blitzing defense that confused Cunningham and frustrated 
his receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Cunningham, and same receivers, who helped the Eagles score 
40 points against the 49ers three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have as much talent as anyone in the league, and when we get going, it's 
like a chain reaction," said cornerback Kevin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles Haley and Leon Lett put on the rush. The safeties come up for the 
run. The cornerbacks get on the receivers . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And the result is that when the Eagles scored in the game's first 10 minutes, 
it was on a 32-yard screen pass that should not have been a touchdown -- 
Herschel Walker was clearly knocked out of bounds at the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles did not score again until the game's final six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They can win even though their exhausted defense is required to mount a 
goal-line stand in the final two minutes to keep the game from getting close. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Eagles on the Cowboy one-yard line, linebacker Robert Jones rushed 
through for two crushing tackles on rookie Charlie Garner, throwing him back 
six yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cunningham's last-gasp pass was intercepted by Larry Brown in the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, some of the Eagles, who fell to 4-2, were bold enough to predict 
revenge in their rematch with the Cowboys in Philadelphia on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Cunningham. He can confirm what the rest of the league has feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are no different than in the years they won the Super Bowl," he said of 
the Cowboys. "With all these guys who have played together for so long . . . 
they could be unstoppable."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS CORNERBACK A THROWBACK TO THE DAYS OF GORE AND GLORY

 Rod Woodson, the Pittsburgh Steelers' All-Pro cornerback, told Inside Sports 
magazine that he wishes he had played in an earlier era, when "you could throw 
a guy on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you kicked a guy, they (officials) would probably just say, 'Hey, watch 
it.' Nowadays, if you kick, you're thrown out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You used to be able to jump in a ref's face and call him anything in the 
book; now you cuss him out, he's going to throw you out of the game. This is 
not true football." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Woodson: James Washington, the Dallas Cowboy free safety who played 
for UCLA, told the Dallas Morning News that his teammate, strong safety Darren 
Woodson, is a silent killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is hard to find another player to compare him to because most of 
them at his position are real dirty players like myself, like Jack Tatum." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 She said it: Martina Hingis of Switzerland is 14, but she is beating older 
players in European tennis tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Hingis: "I'm sure it's not pleasant for players who have been on the tour 
for five or six years when a little brat wins against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Countdown: UCLA has lost five consecutive football games. The Bruins haven't 
lost six in a row since 1943, when they were winless in their first seven 
games. Next opponent: Pacific 10 Conference leader Arizona at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy bashing: Dallas defensive end Jim Jeffcoat on Arizona Cardinal Coach 
Buddy Ryan: "Buddy doesn't block. Buddy doesn't tackle. Buddy is just a big bag 
of wind."

 Outpost: GODFORSAKEN PLACE, N.M. That was Nick Canepa's dateline in the San 
Diego Union-Tribune for Saturday's game between San Diego State and New Mexico, 
which the Aztecs won, 20-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Canepa writes that former Aztec Coach Al Luginbill made that comment about 
Albuquerque two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who can ever forget Al standing by the locker room door shouting: 'Let's get 
out of this Godforsaken Place!' forever endearing himself to every New Mexican 
within earshot."

 Hard times: Charles Barkley is growling again, this time about the salary 
structure in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do something about rookies getting paid too much," the Phoenix Sun 
forward said. "What did Grant Hill get, nine years at $45 million? That's two 
million a year more than me. Something is wrong."

 Looking back: On this day in 1948 Bob Waterfield was intercepted seven times 
as the Rams lost to the Green Bay Packers, 16-0.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How embarrassing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, I mean. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's bad enough that a team that has enough talent to reach the Super Bowl is 
2-4 after losing to Miami in overtime Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Making it worse was the spat between Hoss and the Boss in front of a national 
television audience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard about the Raiders' pride and poise? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was a case of too much pride and too little poise on the part of the 
quarterback, Jeff Hostetler, and the coach, Art Shell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler had a right to be upset about suffering more knockdowns than a 
tomato can in a 12-round fight and being the victim of questionable play 
calling, but should have kept quiet until the team retreated to the privacy of 
the locker room at halftime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shell had a right to be upset about Hostetler voicing his opinions on the 
sideline, but shouldn't have insulted his highly competitive quarterback by 
removing him from the lineup late in the first half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That both handled the situation poorly is a reflection on the kind of season 
the Raiders are experiencing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They have performed reasonably well during their last two losses to San Diego 
and Miami after showing nothing during their first two losses to San Francisco 
and Seattle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's merely that they keep finding ways to lose. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The defense was superb much of the time at Joe Robbie Stadium, but wilted in 
the heat after getting little support from the offense and losing Chester 
McGlockton to injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 About the only way the Raiders masquerading as blockers could keep the 
Dolphins off Hostetler was to commit holding penalties. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those calls were apparent, but the Raiders got robbed when it was 
ruled that Tim Brown fumbled in the fourth quarter after a punt return. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Replays indicated the fumble occurred upon contact with the ground. Instead, 
the Dolphins got the ball and took advantage of the break by driving to the 
tying touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino didn't have a good game, but it sure beat Hostetler's afternoon. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Against the New York Giants, the Rams discovered the surest way not to blow a 
halftime lead is to hold their opponents scoreless in the second half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Reeves might be the best coach in the NFL, but the lack of a veteran 
quarterback has caught up with him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of these days, the San Diego Chargers might even convince the oddsmakers 
that they are for real. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If that was the "second season" that began for UCLA Saturday night at the Rose 
Bowl, it might make the "first season" look good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the return of J.J. Stokes will put some life into the Bruins next 
Saturday at Tucson, where they will need all the help they can get. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and early departures to the NFL have hurt UCLA, but still don't 
explain five consecutive defeats, including the yawner to Oregon State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 During his first 13 years as coach, Terry Donahue's Bruins lost as many as 
three games in a row only once. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the third time in the last six years that the Bruins have lost 
five in a row. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a major upset against nationally ranked Arizona on the road for 
UCLA to avert a six-game losing streak, its longest since the World War II 
season of 1943. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, USC appears to be improving. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have shown resiliency the past two weeks, winning at Palo Alto 
after trailing Stanford, 10-0, and at Corvallis after trailing Oregon State, 
13-2. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The young defense and the young tailback, sophomore Shawn Walters, are 
maturing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Brad Otton has performed admirably in relief of Rob 
Johnson and the Trojans will be OK at the most important position as long as 
Otton stays fit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I would pick Penn State, with its explosive and well-balanced offense, No. 1, 
but it would be hard to vote against Colorado the first week in January if the 
Buffaloes remain unbeaten despite a difficult schedule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan is the best 4-2 team in years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Think the networks are Eastern-biased? During the USC-Stanford game, which was 
televised only in the West, the graphic on ABC said the UCLA-Oregon State game 
would start at 10 p.m. EDT. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Actor Dennis Quaid and BYU quarterback John Walsh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Duke is a football factory. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Probation Power: Auburn, Texas A&M and Washington are a combined 18-1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised there was so much scoring in the Arizona-Washington State 
game.

 IT'S NOT NICE TO FOOL WITH MOTHER NATURE OR PRIME TIME 
</P>
<P>
 You don't tug on Superman's cape, spit into the wind or get Deion Sanders 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders returned to Atlanta on Sunday as a 49er, to be booed by a sellout 
crowd of ex-fans and reviled by ex-teammates. He treated them all to a prime 
Prime Time performance, including a fight with Andre Rison, followed by an 
interception, which he returned 93 yards for a touchdown in the 49ers' 42-3 
rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders finished his touchdown run with the usual high-step, pulling a groin 
muscle in the process, obliging him to leave before he could pop any more 
bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, off to a 4-2 start, led the NFC in interceptions -- four by 
Sanders' old backup, Vinnie Clark -- and obviously forgot who they were running 
their mouths about, with Sanders' friends, Rison and linebacker Jessie Tuggle, 
leading the choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuggle said Sanders had never been committed to the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison said Sanders' departure "might be one of the best things that ever 
happened to this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he might say to his old buddy, Rison replied, "I ain't into kissing 
up so, whatever he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A wounded Prime Time protested his innocence before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah it hurt," said Sanders. "I mean because I gave my all to these guys and 
then some. For them to say I wasn't a team player -- I mean, what else do I 
have to do, come and pick you up and take you to the damn game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders made his point in the game. Afterward, he embraced Rison on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to Rison: Before your next meeting, concentrate on the good times you and 
he had. BRING ON THE OILERS 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' four victories have come against the Rams (twice), Redskins and 
Buccaneers. AN AFTERNOON WITH THE BUNGLES 
</P>
<P>
 That victory teams get each week against the Bengals does come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is: Whatever they have might be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the Steelers, who struggled to a 14-10 victory in Three Rivers Stadium 
that almost had the winners fighting among each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell was sacked eight times by a defense that 
had three all season and ranked No. 26 overall. The Steelers didn't score in 
the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 "That team shouldn't even be on the ball field with us," Steeler linebacker 
Greg Lloyd said. "We've got to come out and hit them in the mouth and choke 'em 
and put them out of the game in a hurry. We let ourselves get in a dogfight 
with an 0-5 team and that's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Kevin Greene, trying to inspire the offensive unit, even went into 
its huddle to deliver a pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, it wasn't inspiration the offense was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Donnell: "John L. (Williams) yelled to him, 'Get the hell out of here!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Of the Bengals' eight sacks, top pick Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson had 
none. SHORT HONEYMOON IN K.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs' failure to score a touchdown in two games isn't going down well in 
Kansas City, where the natives are turning analytical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for Marcus Allen to take on a supporting role," wrote the Kansas 
City Star's Jason Whitlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 38, Joe Montana doesn't handle a pass rush, no matter how tame, like a 
28-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer says he'll split playing time 50-50 between 
the 34-year-old Allen and rookie Greg Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a positive step," writes Whitlock. "But not quite enough. The load 
should be about 75-25 in Hill's favor." TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City at Denver 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't exactly the way John Elway and Joe Montana would have liked to face 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been quarterbacks in seven Super Bowls. Only last season each led 
their team to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year they are on the edge of mediocrity. Montana (6) and Elway (5) have 
thrown as many interceptions as they have touchdowns. Three of Elway's 
interceptions were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (3-2) rolled to a 3-0 start before losing their last two without 
scoring a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos (1-4) won in Seattle last week for their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Russell had Denver's first 100-yard rushing game last week, gaining 
103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer, the former Browns coach, is 0-7 at Mile High 
Stadium. Two of those Brown-outs were in the playoffs. The Broncos have 
defeated the Chiefs 11 consecutive games at Mile High -- six of the last seven 
have been decided by six points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not coming," Schottenheimer joked. "I'm staying home. Bob Moore, our PR 
guy, will be in charge of all sideline operations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mile High is losing its mystique. Despite having the NFL's best 
home-record since 1976, the Broncos have lost their last three home games and 
five of their last eight. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Plugging the holes: When Miami held the Raiders to a field goal after the 
Raiders had a first-and-goal from the Dolphin three in the opening period, it 
marked the first time in 13 occasions this season that a Miami opponent did not 
score a touchdown after having a first-and-goal. . . . Man with a porpoise: 
Miami's Keith Byars caught a pass in his 110th consecutive game, the 
seventh-longest streak in history. . . . With 150 yards on the ground, Bernie 
Parmalee joined Terry Kirby as the second Dolphin running back to surpass the 
100-yard mark this year. It's the first time since 1981 that two Dolphins have 
had 100-yard games in the same season. . . . But think of all the frequent 
flyer miles: Counting preseason, this was the fourth road trip of more than 
3,000 miles, and the second in as many weeks, for the Raiders, who posted a 
21-17 victory in New England last Sunday. . . . With six receptions, Tim Brown 
increased his total to 257 and moved into fourth place on the list of Raider 
wide receivers. Next at No. 3 with 461 is Todd Christensen. . . . The Rams' 
highest point total of the season is 19. It is the first time in franchise 
history they have failed to score at least 20 points in their first seven 
games. . . . After 5,000 yards, you rotate your cleats: The Rams' Jessie Hester 
caught one pass for 12 yards in the final three minutes of the game, giving him 
exactly 5,000 career receiving yards and at least one catch in 69 consecutive 
games. . . . Now, if we could just schedule all our games against the Bengals: 
The Falcons are now 0-2 against teams with winning records, having been 
outscored 72-13. . . . The Bills are 0-3 when Thurman Thomas fails to rush for 
100 yards. . . . But we get so tired late in the game: Indianapolis has been 
outscored 73-13 in the fourth quarter. . . . Moving up the charts: Art Monk 
caught two passes Sunday, giving the Jet receiver a streak of 171 games with a 
reception. He is six short of Steve Largent's record. . . . The Bengals are 
2-19 in the AFC Central since 1991. . . . From the "I've got it, I've got it, I 
don't got it" dept.: On a strange play late in the third quarter, Bengals Carl 
Pickens and Corey Sawyer stood five feet apart signaling for a fair catch on a 
punt neither caught. The ball bounced off the helmet of defender Dwight Stone 
and finally was covered by Cincinnati's Fernandus Vinson. . . . Darrell Green 
had two interceptions, breaking the Redskins' team record for interceptions 
with 37. Brig Owens had 36 from 1966-1977. . . . With his second-quarter 
touchdown run, Emmitt Smith established a Cowboy record with eight consecutive 
games with at least one touchdown. The old mark was held by Frank Clarke and 
Bob Hayes. . . . Smith also assumed second place on the club's rushing list 
with 6,276 yards, moving past Don Perkins. Tony Dorsett is the leader with 
12,036 yards. Cutting them off with the pass: Troy Aikman has thrown a 
touchdown pass in 12 consecutive games, a Cowboy record. Roger Staubach and Don 
Meredith had the previous mark. HE REGRETS HE ONLY HAS ONE BODY TO GIVE THE 
EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
 Former Eagle Coach Dick Vermeil once estimated a running back's prime lasts 
about four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Eagle Coach Rick Kotite seems determined to hurry his rookie 
sensation, Charlie Garner, through his. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Tennessee, Garner, a tyke at 5-9, 180, averaged 14 carries a 
game. He averaged 7.3 yards a carry as a senior and might have gone in the 
first round if he hadn't tested positive for marijuana at a pre-draft camp. The 
Eagles got him in the second, although some scouts compared him to Marshall 
Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner also had a rap of being as injury-prone, which was quickly borne out. 
Hurt in an exhibition, he didn't play until the fourth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He then burst onto the scene, running for 111 and 122 yards in his first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite made sure he didn't lack for opportunity, running him 11 times by 
halftime of a 40-8 rout of the 49ers, 28 in a victory over the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite, once nicknamed Uptite by the Philadelphia press, then blew up when 
asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it because that's what you (reporters) always wanted me to have, a guy 
carry the load," said Kotite. "And if he steps on the field, that's what he's 
going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable. I've got to reflect on all the news conferences here. I 
mean, this is really unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 A skeptic might wonder if Kotite, a holdover from the Norman Braman days, is 
trying to save his job under new owner Jeffrey Lurie. Garner suffered a 
hairline fracture of a rib against the Redskins and took a shot of pain-killer 
to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner said he wouldn't take another shot but would take codeine pills. His 
shoulder pads were modified to afford more protection. An electronic monitor 
was placed under pads to stimulate his blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 17 times for 57 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. Medical science 
marches on. RAIDERS WILL BE RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's argument between Jeff Hostetler and Art Shell recalls other days in 
Raider history when such fights were more common. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Raider quarterback Jim Plunkett remembers when he screamed at one of 
his linemen, as Hostetler also did Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Plunkett's case, it was Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the quarterback," said Plunkett on his KFI radio call-in show, "so 
situations are a little bit different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the quarterback so I'm the boss on the field. That's how every 
quarterback should look at it. And we got into an argument and we were yelling 
and screaming at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett said he went to Shell later and told him it wasn't personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what hopefully Art Shell and Jeff Hostetler are going to do," Plunkett 
said. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Steeler Barry Foster, on a pace for 1,500 yards, twisted his left knee on his 
first carry against the Bengals and is expected to miss at least two games. 
QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, the coach stuck with me and I was able to redeem myself."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Arizona quarterback Steve Beuerlein, demoted, called a cancer and then 
reinstated by Coach Buddy Ryan, after throwing three interceptions, then a 
touchdown pass to tie the score with 19 seconds left, enabling the Cardinals to 
defeat the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five interceptions. Geez, that's tough. Three's the most I've ever thrown in 
a game, and that was when I was 11."

loss to Arizona.

</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (3-2) rolled to a 3-0 start before losing their last two without 
scoring a touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos (1-4) won in Seattle last week for their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Russell had Denver's first 100-yard rushing game last week, gaining 
103 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer, the former Browns coach, is 0-7 at Mile High 
Stadium. Two of those Brown-outs were in the playoffs. The Broncos have 
defeated the Chiefs 11 consecutive games at Mile High -- six of the last seven 
have been decided by six points or less and four of those have been decided by 
three points or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not coming," Schottenheimer joked. "I'm staying home. Bob Moore, our PR 
guy, will be in charge of all sideline operations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mile High is losing its mystique. Despite having the NFL's best 
home-record since 1976, the Broncos have lost their last three home games and 
five of their last eight. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 What's that Flipper? We finally stopped someone? When Miami held the Raiders 
to a field goal after the Raiders had a first-and-goal from the Dolphin 3 in 
the opening period, it marked the first time in 13 occasions this season that a 
Miami opponent did not score a touchdown after having a first-and-goal. . . . 
Man with a porpoise: Miami's Keith Byars caught a pass in his 110th consecutive 
game, the seventh-longest streak in history. . . . With 150 yards on the 
ground, Bernie Parmalee joined Terry Kirby as the second Dolphin running back 
to surpass the 100-yard mark this year. It's the first time since 1981 that two 
Dolphins have had 100-yard games in the same season. . . . But think of all the 
frequent flyer miles: Counting preseason, this was the fourth road trip of more 
than 3,000 miles, and the second in as many weeks, for the Raiders, who posted 
a 21-17 victory in New England last Sunday. . . . With six receptions, Tim 
Brown increased his total to 257 and moved into fourth place on the list of 
Raider wide receivers....That's because greed is one of the seven deadly sins: 
The Rams' highest point total of the season is 19. It is the first time in 
franchise history they have failed to score at least 20 points in their first 
seven games. . . . After 5,000 yards, you rotate your cleats: The Rams' Jessie 
Hester caught one pass for 12 yards in the final three minutes of the game, 
giving him exactly 5,000 career receiving yards and at least one catch in 69 
consecutive games. . . .Somebody stop me: San Francisco's victory ended 
Atlanta's streak of six consecutive triumphs over NFC West foes.... Now, if we 
could just schedule all our games against the Bengals: The Falcons are now 0-2 
against teams with winning records, having been outscored 72-13. . . . The 
Bills are 0-3 when Thurman Thomas fails to rush for 100 yards. . . . But we get 
so sleepy late in the game: Indianapolis has been outscored 73-13 in the fourth 
quarter. . . . Another monk heading up the charts: Art Monk caught two passes 
Sunday, giving the Jet receiver a streak of 171 games with a reception. He is 
six short of Steve Largent's record. . . . John L. Williams' four receptions 
for the Steelers gave him 493 in his career, moving him into third place on the 
NFL career list for running backs.... The Bengals are 2-19 in the AFC Central 
since 1991.... From the "I've got it, I've got it, I don't got it" dept.: On a 
strange play late in the third quarter, Bengals Carl Pickens and Corey Sawyer 
stood five feet apart signaling for a fair catch on a punt neither caught. The 
ball bounced off the helmet of defender Dwight Stone and finally was covered by 
Cincinnati's Fernandus Vinson.... Darrell Green had two interceptions, breaking 
the Redskins' team record for interceptions with 37. Brig Owens had 36 from 
1966-1977.... With nine, he gets egg roll: With his second-quarter touchdown 
run, Emmitt Smith established a Cowboy record with eight consecutive games with 
at least one touchdown. The old mark was held by Frank Clarke and Bob Hayes. HE 
REGRETS HE ONLY HAS ONE BODY TO GIVE THE EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
 Former Eagle Coach Dick Vermeil once estimated a running back's prime lasts 
about four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Eagle Coach Rick Kotite seems determined to hurry his rookie 
sensation, Charlie Garner, through his. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Tennessee, Garner, a tyke at 5-9, 180, averaged 14 carries a 
game. His totals were unspectacular but he might have gone on the first round 
if he hadn't tested positive for marijuana at a pre-draft camp. The Eagles got 
him in the second, although some scouts compared him to Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner also had a rap as injury-prone, which was quickly borne out. Hurt in an 
exhibition, he didn't play until the fourth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He then burst onto the scene, running for 111 and 122 yards in his first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite made sure he didn't lack for opportunity, running him 11 times by 
halftime of a 40-8 rout of the 49ers, 28 in a victory over the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotite, once nicknamed Uptite by the Philadelphia press, then blew up when 
asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it because that's what you (reporters) always wanted me to have, a guy 
carry the load," said Kotite. "And if he steps on the field, that's what he's 
going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable. I've got to reflect on all the news conferences here. I 
mean, this is really unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 A skeptic might wonder if Kotite, a holdover from the Norman Braman days, is 
trying to save his job under new owner Jeffrey Lurie. Garner suffered a 
hairline fracture of a rib against the Redskins and took a shot of pain-killer 
to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner said he wouldn't take another shot but would take codeine pills. His 
shoulder pads were modified to afford more protection. An electronic monitor 
was placed under pads to stimulate his blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 17 times for 57 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. Medical science 
marches on. RAIDERS WILL BE RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's argument between Jeff Hostetler and Art Shell recalls other days in 
Raider history when such fights were more common. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Raider quarterback Jim Plunkett remembers when he screamed at one of 
his linemen, as Hostetler also did Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Plunkett's case, it was Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the quarterback," said Plunkett on his KFI radio call-in show, "so 
situations are a little bit different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the quarterback so I'm the boss on the field. That's how every 
quarterback should look at it. And we got into an argument and we were yelling 
and screaming at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Plunkett said he went to Shell later and told him it wasn't personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what hopefully Art Shell and Jeff Hostetler are going to do," Plunkett 
said. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Steeler Barry Foster, on a pace for 1,500 yards, twisted his left knee on his 
first carry against the Bengals and is expected to miss at least two games.

CHARGERS GO TO 6-0 BY DEEP SIXING SAINTS; INTERCONFERENCE: SAN DIEGO SCORES ON 
EIGHT OF 11 POSSESSIONS AND ROLLS TO 36-22 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Bobby Ross wants the San Diego Chargers to know one thing about their 
perfect record -- it's only a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of the 6-0 start is that we can now be 6-10," Ross joked 
Sunday after the Chargers remained the NFL's only unbeaten team with a 36-22 
victory over the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Ross was being cautious, his players were celebrating the latest 
victory and not yet worrying about next week's game at home against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Charger team reminds me of the Saints when we were first learning how to 
win," said San Diego lineman Stan Brock, who played for New Orleans for 13 
years. "This team needed to win that game and we came out and made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was Natrone Means running for 120 yards and three touchdowns that 
counted -- plus two more scores that were called back because of holding 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never came easy," Means said. "The Saints weren't getting any penetration. 
Our guys were pushing them off the ball. I've had two good weeks. That's what I 
want to continue doing, become a consistent player." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there was John Carney, who kicked five field goals, including two after 
Means' apparent touchdowns were called back. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when Means wasn't finding holes to run through, Stan Humphries was 
finding receivers to throw to, completing 17 of 29 for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Added up, the Chargers are off to their best start since 1961, when they 
opened 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing real well right now," Humphries said. "I think this team can go 
as far as it wants. We're not only playing real well right now, we're playing 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Carney added a 28-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, San Diego 
had scored on eight of 11 possessions. The Chargers were not forced to punt 
until the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's bothersome," Saint Coach Jim Mora said. "We tried everything to get 
them slowed down and couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego dominated from the start, scoring on its first five possessions. On 
the sixth, Humphries knelt with the ball to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing almost flawlessly, the Chargers had only two offensive penalties, no 
turnovers and allowed one sack despite heavy pressure by the Saints (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego led, 27-7, at halftime, outgaining New Orleans 235 yards to 112. 
Means ran for 75 yards and his touchdowns that counted went for 16 and eight 
yards in the first quarter and one yard in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney kicked two second-quarter field goals, from 49 and 31 yards. He added 
scores from 29 yards twice in the third quarter and from 28 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team isn't a fluke," Saint linebacker Renaldo Turnbull said. "They have 
good players and they're playing great football." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Chargers were not as neat. Five pass interference calls set 
up three Saint scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' only first-half score came after a penalty gave them a first down 
on the San Diego 37. On the next play, the Chargers were again called for pass 
interference, a 27-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jim Everett was sacked for an eight-yard loss, he connected with Quinn 
Early for an 18-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans added another touchdown in the third quarter on a one-yard pass 
from Everett to Irv Smith following pass interference in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Lorenzo Neal plunged in from the one and the Saints 
added a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Morten Andersen missed field-goal attempts of 54 and 38 yards in the first 
quarter, giving him four consecutive misses going back to New Orleans' 17-7 
loss to Chicago last week.

PARCELLS' PLAN WORKS TO PERFECTION -- FOR THE JETS; AFC: NEW YORK USES STRONG 
RUNNING GAME AND OPPORTUNISTIC DEFENSE TO DEFEAT PATRIOTS, 24-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Strong running and a defense that forces turnovers form the foundation of Bill 
Parcells' teams. On Sunday, his New England Patriots learned why. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Johnson rushed for 122 yards in 21 carries, Brad Baxter had two 
short-yardage touchdowns and the New York Jets got three takeaways in a 24-17 
victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets overcame six sacks, two turnovers and a missed 32-yard field goal by 
the usually reliable Nick Lowery, although Lowery did make a 37-yarder with 
1:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mentioned two weeks ago that we said we were going to put the saddle on 
Johnny Johnson's back," quarterback Boomer Esiason said. "And today we rode him 
to victory." 
</P>
<P>
 They also got help from Baxter, who hadn't scored this season, even though he 
is the Jets' prime weapon near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get in short yardage or in deep, that is my time," Baxter said. "Nine 
out of 10 times, I get it. I'm supposed to get it in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets improved to 4-3 with their second victory after a three-game slide. 
The Patriots (3-4) have lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells, who coached the New York Giants to two Super Bowls with the 
Meadowlands as his home base, saw quarterback Drew Bledsoe struggle for the 
first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe came into the game leading the league in passing attempts, completions 
and yards. But the aggressive Jet defense, led by Ronnie Lott and Mo Lewis, 
held him to 242 yards, 45 coming after the game was decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnovers were monumental," Parcells said. "We dug a hole we just couldn't 
get out of." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots finally got untracked early in the fourth quarter, marching 77 
yards in 15 plays and converting twice on fourth downs before former Jet 
running back Blair Thomas scored on a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it 21-14 and the Patriots forced a punt. Bledsoe fumbled when 
sacked, though, and Paul Frase recovered at the New England 23. Lowery soon 
missed the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 New England couldn't take advantage and James Hasty got New York's third sack 
on fourth down at the Patriot 36, leading to Lowery's clinching field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bahr made a 40-yard field goal with 23 seconds to go, then the Jets 
recovered an onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those games that was a defensive game," said Lewis, who had 11 
tackles. "I'm glad most of it was on our side of the ball."

STEELERS TRY TO HELP, BUT BENGALS STILL LOSE; AFC: PITTSBURGH PULLS OUT 14-10 
VICTORY DESPITE MISTAKES. FOSTER IS HURT, OUT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals seem to bring out the worst in everybody -- most of all 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers lost Barry Foster to an injury on his first carry and 
probably should have lost the game, but the winless Bengals wouldn't let them 
as Neil O'Donnell's two second-quarter touchdown passes keyed a 14-10 victory 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers scored both touchdowns within a three-minute span, the second 
coming five plays after Levon Kirkland intercepted a pass by Bengal backup 
quarterback Don Hollas, a third-year player from Rice who had not thrown a pass 
this season. Hollas relieved David Klingler, who came out temporarily with 
blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers had their problems too. O'Donnell was sacked eight times by a 
defense that previously had only three sacks, and the Steelers couldn't score 
in the second half against the NFL's 26th-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 They were especially ineffective after losing Foster for two to three weeks 
because of a twisted left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's anything serious," Steeler Coach Bill Cowher said of 
Foster, the AFC's second-leading rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have all the confidence that Bam Morris will be a solid replacement. We're 
at the midpoint of the season and he's not a rookie anymore. He's been around 
here long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris had 82 yards in 21 carries, but almost all came between the 30s in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (0-6) couldn't capitalize on Alfred Williams' four sacks or Corey 
Sawyer's fumble recovery in the fourth quarter, losing their seventh in a row 
over two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals' lone touchdown came on a fake field-goal attempt with 10:57 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Johnson, the holder, shoveled the ball to blocking back Jeff Cothran for a 
seven-yard scoring pass to make the score 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler finished only 16 of 29 for 143 yards. O'Donnell was 15 of 22 for 190 
yards and no interceptions.

PARMALEE SIGHT FOR SORE DOLPHIN EYES; MIAMI: THIRD-YEAR RUNNING BACK SOLVES 
PROBLEM WITH CONTACT LENS, THEN TOTALS 30 CARRIES FOR 150 YARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only one thing could stop Bernie Parmalee on Sunday. And it wasn't the 
Raiders, or the humidity, or an expanded workload. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a contact lense. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmalee, who had a total of 10 carries in his previous two seasons with the 
Miami Dolphins before this year, carried 30 times Sunday for 150 yards in 
leading the Dolphins to a 20-17 overtime victory over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have even been that close if Parmalee, a third-year running back 
out of Ball State, hadn't had a problem with one of his contact lenses after 
gaining nine yards on the first play of Miami's second drive of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Out came Parmalee to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In came Mark Higgs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Higgs fumbled, defensive end Anthony Smith picking up the 
ball and going into the end zone for the first touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With his vision back in focus, Parmalee returned to focus on the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the 5-foot-11, 205-pounder come back to gain the most yards by a 
Dolphin back since Sammie Smith rushed for 159 yards against the New England 
Patriots in 1990, but Parmalee was also a star on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked Rocket Ismail out of the game in the second quarter with a tackle 
that left the Raider receiver with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when Tim Brown fumbled at the end of the third quarter giving Miami the 
possession that led to the game-tying touchdown, guess who recovered? 
</P>
<P>
 Parmalee. 
</P>
<P>
 He also gained 45 of the 65 yards the Dolphins amassed in the overtime drive 
that led to Pete Stoyanovich's winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Parmalee received two game balls, one for offense and one for 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He loved the extra work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," he said, "because, when you're out there, you want everyone 
to have confidence in you. They just kept giving me the ball and I was just 
doing everything I could to get a good feel for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Parmalee's second consecutive start. He gained 91 yards on 15 carries a 
week ago against the Buffalo Bills in his bid to prove that he could take over 
for fellow back Terry Kirby, sidelined because of a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins weren't so sure. They recently signed former Ram running back 
Cleveland Gary as insurance. "I told them that I can get it done," Parmalee 
said, "when we have to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 The last couple of years on the bench have not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he said, "it seemed disconcerting. But I was always a firm 
believer that, if you hang in there and continue to work hard, good things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Good things happened to Parmalee on Sunday at least partly because defensive 
lineman Chester McGlockton left the game in the third quarter when the bruised 
left shoulder that had bothered him all week flared up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely worse," McGlockton said. "If I would have continued to 
play, I would have embarrassed myself and my team." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton said he was also bothered by a bruised leg. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a busy day for the Raider trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the injuries to Ismail and McGlockton, cornerback Lionel 
Washington suffered bruised ribs, offensive lineman Gerald Perry an injured 
right ankle and receiver Tim Brown had leg cramps so bad in the humid weather 
that he had to receive intravenous fluid after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have been in," Brown said of the final minutes of regulation 
play. "On the last (catch), my legs locked up so bad, I just fell to the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Brown suffered cramps that severe was in 1987, when he played 
here for visiting Notre Dame against the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is about this Miami weather," Brown said. "You feel 
great at the beginning, but, by the end, you fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you are Bernie Parmalee.

BUDDY FINDS HIS MAN, BUT HE'S ON REDSKINS; NFC: ROOKIE SHULER'S FIVE 
INTERCEPTIONS HELP CARDINALS PULL OUT 19-16 OVERTIME VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Buddy Ryan found a quarterback who could help his team. Unfortunately for the 
Washington Redskins, it was Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's Arizona Cardinals intercepted Shuler five times on Sunday, and took 
advantage for a 19-16 victory on Todd Peterson's 29-yard field goal with five 
minutes left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning kick came immediately after Terry Hoage picked off a pass and 
returned it to the Washington 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Beuerlein, restored by Ryan as Arizona's starting quarterback, threw a 
disputed, tying touchdown pass with 19 seconds left in regulation. Beuerlein's 
pass was to Ricky Proehl, who had the ball stripped from his hands by 
cornerback Alan Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins argued that it should have been ruled an interception, but 
officials ruled it a touchdown. The Cardinals opted to kick the extra point, 
and Peterson tied the score at 16-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein also threw three interceptions, with Darrell Green returning one for 
a 27-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein, who began the season as Arizona's starter, was benched early after 
poor performances. Jim McMahon and Jay Schroeder took turns before Ryan gave 
the job back to Beuerlein this week. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 16 of 34 passes for 194 yards and helped Arizona (2-4) overcome a 
14-3 fourth-quarter deficit. The drive for the tying touchdown was kept alive 
when Beuerlein completed a pass for 17 yards on third and 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins (1-6) lost their fifth in a row and remained winless at RFK 
Stadium. They had a chance in overtime as Shuler moved them in position for a 
51-yard field goal try by Chip Lohmiller, but the kick was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler, who was 11 of 32 for 158 yards and one touchdown, was limping slightly 
after the game because of a sprained right ankle suffered in the second 
quarter. He said the injury gave him trouble during the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Redskin Coach Norv Turner said Shuler had made "a combination of bad throws 
and bad decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 With the score, 14-3, early in the fourth quarter, Shuler was picked off for a 
third time and cornerback Aeneas Williams returned it 43 yards to the 
Washington 22. Four plays later, Ronald Moore ran in from the 10 to make the 
score 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Levy tried to run around the right side for the two-point conversion, 
but was stopped a yard short by safety Darryl Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 With 4:57 left, the Cardinals took a deliberate safety, rather than attempting 
to punt from their end zone, giving the Redskins a 16-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Ryan had the Cardinals punt on fourth and one from the Arizona 
49. Two plays later, Hoage picked off Shuler, setting up the winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a real gut-check for everyone," Ryan said.

SENIOR TENNIS; CONNORS HOLDS OFF STRONG-SERVING CLERC, WINS ANOTHER TITLE

 Jimmy Connors and Jose-Luis Clerc engaged each other in a baseline duel before 
2,600 fans in the final of the Digital PC Champions tournament at Sherwood 
Country Club on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Connors captured his ninth title on the 10-stop Champions 
over-35 tennis tour with a 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 victory that took about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a grinder, whether we play 30 minutes or five hours," said 
Connors, who took home $40,000 in prize money. "If you're willing to stay out 
there you'll feel as bad as I do afterward, and I feel pretty bad right now." 
</P>
<P>
 As he did throughout the tournament, the fourth-seeded Clerc earned points 
with his serve, launching nine aces past Connors to put his three-match total 
at 24. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connors returned shots that eluded earlier Clerc opponents Larry Stefanki 
and Bjorn Borg. The five-time U.S. Open singles champion played consistent 
tennis that wore down Clerc in the final set, when Connors lost his serve in 
the first game only to break back for a 1-1 deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struggling a little bit and I wasn't hitting the ball well enough to 
take chances," Connors said. "He was swinging away and hitting some winners but 
I didn't think he could keep that up." 
</P>
<P>
 Clerc, who had back surgery last year, unleashed a number of winning backhand 
shots past Connors, but couldn't be consistent when the tour's 42-year-old 
co-founder began to charge the net late in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the doubles final, Clerc and Peter Fleming defeated Monsour Bahrami and 
Larry Stefanki, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3. TRIS WYKES

in European history, $240,000 -- and earned him plaudits as a golfer pegged for 
superstardom for many years to come.

<P>
 "It's nice to hear those kind of remarks," Els said. "But I don't think you 
want to start believing in that stuff. I've got a long way to go."

 After a fifth-place finish in the Fayette Stakes on Saturday, 1993 Kentucky 
Derby winner Sea Hero probably will be retired to stud, trainer Mack Miller 
said in Lexington, Ky., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed," Miller said of the race."He probably will go on to the 
farm. That's not etched in stone, but I think that's the next logical move." 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Hero will stand at Lane's End Farm near Versailles, Ky. Sea Hero, by 
Polish Navy out of Glowing Tribute, won six of 24 lifetime starts and earned 
$2,929,869.

 Pace-setter Lets Be Alert was second, seven lengths in front of 
Southland-based Miss Dominique. Southland-based Phone Chatter, last year's 
2-year-old filly champion and the 2-1 second choice, was never a contender and 
finished last in the eight-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispute covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4/5 and paid $4.40, $3.60 and $2.60. Lets

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; AUBE INDIENNE SURGES TO WIN THE LAS PALMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Rodney Rash ended a 16-year stint as Charlie Whittingham's assistant to 
begin a career of his own in 1991, the Hall of Fame trainer recommended Rash to 
several potential horse owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the know-how that Rash acquired from all those years at 
Whittingham's side, there's an unspoken debt there. Rash, currently racing more 
stakes winners than his 81-year-old former mentor, in part repaid the favors a 
couple of weeks ago when he shuffled a 4-year-old French filly over to 
Whittingham's barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddled by Whittingham for the first time, Aube Indienne won the $106,300 Las 
Palmas Handicap by a neck over Queens Court Queen at Santa Anita on Sunday. 
This hasn't been a vintage year for Whittingham, and Aube Indienne's was that 
rare stakes victory that didn't have Flawlessly's name attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, Aube Indienne had only one victory in six starts in the United 
States. Bon Point, another European import, had done worse than that -- one 
victory in nine tries -- but the 4-year-old British-bred colt won Sunday's 
other stake, the $107,050 Koester Handicap, after a stiff stretch drive with 
favored Journalism. The winning margin was a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-10 favorite in the Las Palmas, Corrazona carried high weight of 120 
pounds, five more than Aube Indienne, and after running last for the first 
half-mile, was caught behind horses in the stretch. After Laffit Pincay Jr. 
angled the Beverly Hills Handicap winner to the outside, she finished fourth in 
the five-horse field, beaten by almost five lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get out of there," Pincay said, "and when I did, she started lugging 
in with me the last sixteenth of a mile. I really think that if I had been able 
to get through, she would have been tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, who has won two Eclipse Awards as best grass female and earned 
$2.5 million, was once a possibility for the Las Palmas, but now the 6-year-old 
mare won't run during the Oak Tree meeting at all, skipping the $400,000 Yellow 
Ribbon on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't like this grass course and she loves Hollywood Park," Whittingham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly has won only one of five starts at Santa Anita and has been second 
in the Yellow Ribbon twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne, who ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 3/5, one of the slowest winning 
times in the history of the Las Palmas, paid $18.80. Under Rash, her U.S. 
career began at Santa Anita last winter and her only stakes victory was negated 
by a stewards' disqualification after the Modesty Handicap at Arlington 
International in June. Sunday's victory was worth $61,300, and Aube Indienne is 
now a candidate for the Yellow Ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux rode Aube Indienne for the first time. "I didn't know anything 
about this filly," he said. "I walked into the paddock, and Charlie gave me the 
first bit of confidence. He told me that she caught another horse in a workout 
the other morning who had been about 20 lengths in front of her, and she caught 
him from the eighth pole home." 
</P>
<P>
 With Skimble and Queens Court Queen ambling along up front, Desormeaux had 
Aube Indienne in third place early. Skimble faded in mid-stretch and Aube 
Indienne outfinished Queens Court Queen, who has been second in four of her 
last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Frankel, who trains Skimble, scratched Wharf, the other half of Saudi 
Arabian Prince Khalid Abdullah's entry in the Koester. Wharf will run 
Wednesday, in a $60,000 allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Eddie Delahoussaye, who was riding the 4-year-old colt for the first 
time, Bon Point led all the way. That was Frankel's idea. "He had been 
disappointing, so we changed the strategy and put him on the lead," Frankel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bon Point, running a mile on grass in a swift 1:33 4/5, paid $14.40 and earned 
$62,050. He capped a big day for the prince's Juddmonte Farms, which won the 
$1-million Rothmans International at Woodbine with Raintrap at 18-1 and also 
won a stake in France with Sunshack, a full brother to Raintrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Raintrap, who has been in the care of French trainer Andre Fabre, is headed 
Frankel's way. "We'll have to figure out whether to run him in the Breeders' 
Cup Turf (Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs) or bring him to California," Frankel said. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel has two probables for the Breeders' Cup, Pacific Classic 
winner Tinners Way in the Classic and Eagle Eyed in the Mile. . . . Alywow was 
second in the Rothmans, a length behind Raintrap and three-quarters of a length 
ahead of Volochine. . . . White Muzzle, the even-money favorite, was last in a 
field of nine.

RICE ENDS 28-YEAR WAIT BY DEFEATING TEXAS, 19-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, after all the lopsided losses, all the bad jokes and all the players 
who never thought they would get to see this day, Rice put the streak to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing 28 years in a row to Texas, the Owls stuck it to the Longhorns 
but good Sunday night, beating the nation's No. 13 team, 19-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all the Rice teams that have come close in the past, this will go down in 
Rice history for a long time," Rice Coach Ken Hatfield said. "I don't know of a 
bigger game with more riding on it than 28 years of losing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Owls prevailed behind a swarming defense that fought from start to finish 
and two touchdown passes by Josh LaRocca. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Southwest Conference favorite Texas (4-2, 1-1) was beaten by the 
Owls was in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longhorns almost salvaged the game, scoring on a 14-yard touchdown pass 
from Shea Morenz to Matt Davis with 1:27 to play, but the storybook finish 
belonged to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas tried an onside kick after that, but Ed Howard recovered for the Owls, 
who ran out the clock, triggering a jubilant celebration among the rain-soaked 
crowd of 34,700 at Rice Stadium. Fans overran the field and tore down the goal 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rice (3-2, 2-0) deserves a lot of credit," Texas Coach John Mackovic said. 
"They controlled the line of scrimmage, ran the ball well and held down our 
running game. Those were the things that worried us coming in."

JACK SMITH: RAISING A GLASS IN MR. GOMEZ'S MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. Gomez is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel obliged to pass this on to the many readers who may feel they knew him 
from the columns I have written about the house he built for my wife and me in 
Baja California and from the book I wrote about that adventure, "God and Mr. 
Gomez." 
</P>
<P>
 Romulo Gomez died of cancer the other day in a Duarte hospital. His wife, 
Delia, had died a few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Romulo leaves two sons, Sergio and Pepe; a daughter, Marisa, and several 
grandchildren. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was a bestseller -- No. 1 for several weeks -- but I always thought 
it would have sold even more if I had not presumed to use God's name in its 
title. Several people wrote that they found it on the religion shelves of their 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not religious, any more than I am religious or Mr. Gomez was religious 
in a conventional way. I called it that because it was sometimes hard to know 
who was running things in Baja -- God or Mr. Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gomez's mind, the source of anything in Baja that was inexplicable was God. 
I was especially concerned about water when we were planning our house, water 
being in short supply in Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about water?" I asked Gomez one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will provide the water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does the water come from?" I persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water, it comes from the reservoir," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But where does the water come from," I asked, "that is in the reservoir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The water it comes from the well." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a well?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes." That seemed to be his standard phrase for dealing with anxious 
questions. "Oh, yes," spoken like two musical notes, the oh rather high and the 
yes lower on the scale, and full of reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the well?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It is right here, of course. Behind the store." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "of course" was also a favorite of Gomez's, I had noticed, 
sometimes having the effect of making the most patent improbabilities seem 
perfectly credible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some readers have the impression that there was a streak of the con man in 
Gomez. Not so. Gomez was honest and trustworthy to the bone. It was his way of 
dealing with the truth that sometimes aroused suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 I quote from the book a revealing passage: 
</P>
<P>
 I opened the cervezas and we sat out on the porch in the folding chairs. It 
was a blameless day, as beautiful as the February day more than a year and a 
half earlier when my wife and I had first seen the bay.  
</P>
<P>
 "Romulo," I said, trying not to sound too inquisitorial, "when are we going to 
know the actual cost? It keeps going up."  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry, Jack," he said in his reassuring tone, "we will put it all down 
in writing."  
</P>
<P>
 "We put it down in writing once before," I reminded him.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's okay . We will put it down again."  
</P>
<P>
 "When?"  
</P>
<P>
 "When the time is ripe."  
</P>
<P>
 There was no point in that course. I decided to change directions.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the house is finished," I said, "if it ever is, how will we know it's 
ours? You aren't going to give us a deed?"  
</P>
<P>
 He laughed, a gentle laugh that expressed not ridicule but a nice appreciation 
of my humor. "You know, Jack, I can give you no deed. You are not a Mexican. It 
is against the law. Do you want for you and me to break the law?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not, Romulo. You know that. It's just that I want to know -- well, 
you keep saying the house will be ours."  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it is your house."  
</P>
<P>
 "How will I know that -- when the time is ripe?"  
</P>
<P>
 He spread his hands in a gesture that was at once humble and majestic. "I will 
give you the key."  
</P>
<P>
 It was beautiful. I had never admired Romulo more. He had circumvented all the 
laws and the clerical minds and the petty demands of vain and fearful men and 
reduced the issue of possession to its one essential. I would have the key. In 
the eyes of Dios what else mattered?

 One day when I was climbing over the rocks below our house, I noticed signs of 
erosion. It must be that the runoff from the rain was inching closer to the 
house. Every storm must carve its perch. Inexorably it advanced on our vain 
little pile of bricks. I wondered. Would the whole house fall? 
</P>
<P>
 That night at the store I asked Gomez about this unrelenting peril. "Someday, 
Romulo," I said, "our mansion is going to slide right into the Pacific Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," he said. "Someday. But five hundred years from now, Jack, you will 
still be living in that house." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe so," I said. "But isn't there something we can do about it now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Gomez said, "would you like to try a little tequila?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good idea. A tequila to Mr. Gomez.

BOOK REVIEW; TAKING A HIGH-ENERGY TRIP THROUGH A HIGH-TECH WORLD; ALOHA BY MARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a perverse way, Mark Christensen's dark, funny and hyper-technological new 
novel reminds us of "Witness," the movie in which Harrison Ford plays a 
big-city cop forced to hide out among Pennsylvania Amish whose technology 
hasn't changed in 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish put the brakes on progress in the interests of "plainness" and 
holiness, but, by accident or design, they also did it at the last moment in 
Western history when a person could carry his whole culture around in his head. 
Remember the scene in which the little boy explains to Ford how his farm's 
water system works? If everything there were obliterated -- by an H-bomb, say 
-- he could rebuild it from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the rest of us. Not anymore. As human beings' collective knowledge 
expands, the fraction of it that any individual can grasp becomes smaller and 
smaller. This breeds a sense of incompetence; hence, anxiety. It can seem, to 
give the Amish their due, downright unholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen, a Long Beach resident whose previous works include a novel, 
"Mortal Belladaywic," and a nonfiction book on television, "The Sweeps," is the 
latest writer to exploit our ambivalence about technology, our mixture of 
exhilaration and dread. He approaches it as most other current novelists do, 
both sci-fi and mainstream. His stock in trade isn't knowledge -- for who can 
claim much of that these days? Nor is it wisdom -- for that implies truths more 
durable than technological change seems to allow. It's expertise.  
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes "Aloha," besides its quirky narrative voice and slam-bang 
pacing, is the detail with which Christensen describes the early 21st Century, 
the gusto with which he invents grotesqueries that are plausible extensions of 
late 20th-Century trends. Violence has slipped its Cold War moorings. The only 
ideology left is business. Korea is a corporation, not a country. Casual lovers 
give each other HIV skin tests. The ozone layer has eroded so badly that nobody 
goes to the beach without 175-SPF sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Christensen wows us with his expertise just as Frank Crawford, 
billionaire scion of a construction empire, is wowing the narrator, his younger 
brother Tod. Tod is bright but mentally ill and woozy on medication; he can 
describe the mechanics of Frank's grandiose schemes -- just like the little 
Amish boy -- while remaining as befuddled as we are about what the big guy is 
up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank certainly has his sinister side. As a senior Air Force officer, he 
worked out the details of a nuclear first strike on the Soviet Union -- "a 
plan," Tod says, "just too hip for the room" at the Strategic Air Command. His 
new plan, to tap an undersea volcano and create a new Hawaiian island, is 
overkill in its entrepreneurial form: 
</P>
<P>
 "A square mile of magma, money and fax machines, it will ooze from the ocean 
13 miles off the Big Island of Hawaii and, as home of 700-plus . . . banks and 
booking centers -- and as an only-a-few-holds-barred resort -- be a penultimate 
tax and regulatory haven. And, given its location right outside territorial 
waters, it won't belong to the United States but to us . . . worth $50 billion 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tod distrusts Frank but is used to depending on him. Besides, Frank has 
expertise in so many fields that it looks a lot like wisdom. Tod (although his 
teen-age girlfriend, Roberta, tries to remind him) forgets that expertise can 
go deep only because it's so narrow, like the hole Frank's crews are drilling 
under the ocean. Neither brother is able to remember for very long that the how 
of technology can be divorced from any defensible why.  
</P>
<P>
 So Tod lets Frank send him to the former U.S.S.R., now a vast swap meet for 
rusty military hardware. Tod thinks he's buying film that telescopes can use to 
photograph the ends of the universe, but what he's really meant to smuggle back 
is an end-of-the- world item -- a surplus H-bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aloha" opens excitingly, with a chase. The bomb is stolen, perhaps by a 
thuggish business partner. Frank blames Tod, who feels he must run for his 
life. And it ends excitingly, with another chase, as Frank, in a last-ditch 
effort to unplug the volcano, aims to use the bomb as his corkscrew. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle sags a little. Tod struggles to manage a Waikiki nightclub. He 
fitfully tries to escape his brother's domination, to find love, to evaluate 
the dangers he faces -- although one drawback of a semi-schizoid narrator is 
that nothing he says is reliable. Christensen entertains us with raunchiness, 
cynicism and social commentary, but he's mostly just piling on the expertise 
here -- and his expertise, like Frank's, is often a substitute for something 
better that we miss. Something plain.

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; A SOUND STAGE DRESSED FOR A BIG SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Scene: Saturday's Aesculapians Ball on the 20th Century Fox lot. The 
benefit for UCLA's School of Medicine was immensely lucrative and extravagantly 
elegant. Louis XIV would have approved. "When Hollywood decides to help a 
charity, it's very impressive," said a guest. "It's like Bush deciding to help 
Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: One magazine writer described the stunningly transformed 
35,000-square-foot sound stage as "the set Barbra Streisand wanted for her 
concert." Done by Along Came Mary, the vast room was freshly carpeted and hung 
with 30 mission-style wrought iron chandeliers. Its 45-foot-high walls were 
covered in cream-colored fabric and Gothic tapestries. Two dozen Italianate 
pillars covered in autumn greenery lined the room. Subtle lighting suffused the 
space in an amber glow. Dustin Hoffman said this could have been the setting 
for "one of those 1940s, high bosom-low neckline, Linda Darnell movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Most of the 1,750 guests came from the medical profession; the 
money and glitz came from show biz. On hand were dinner chairs Mike Ovitz, Bob 
Daly, Barry Diller, Ron Burkle, Paul Junger Witt and Susan Harris; plus Steven 
Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Warren 
Beatty and Annette Benning, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Marvin and Barbara 
Davis, Dustin Hoffman, Rob Reiner and Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: As she watched the talent agents mingle among the doctors, one 
woman said: "What they've got in common is they both know where the jugular 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: Introduced by emcee Tom Hanks, Jerry Seinfeld was a major 
success with the crowd of doctors ("I wanted to have a waiting room so you 
could sit out there for 20 minutes with some old magazines before we started 
the show.") The evening peaked with a rousing eight-song mini-concert by Rod 
Stewart, backed by a nine-piece rock band, string section and three back-up 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: More than $3 million was netted for research and equipment not 
covered in the budget. (The sizable dinner expenses were underwritten by 
Guess's Maurice, Armand and Paul Marciano.) "Most donors give to specific 
targets," said Dr. Gerald Levey, the med school's dean. "This is the only 
source of discretionary funds I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This is a gem in the middle of Los Angeles," said Ovitz of UCLA's 
School of Medicine. "You're treated by teaching doctors who have the benefit of 
current research right at their fingertips. From top to bottom, these are truly 
selfless people."

A-PLUS GOES TO B SHARP AT SYSTEM M; JAZZ: THE QUARTET JUST SEEMS TO GET BETTER, 
ADDING INTENSITY TO LONG BEACH CLUB'S INTIMATE SETTING AS CROWD FOCUSES ON 
EVERY SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time we saw the B Sharp Jazz Quartet was in August, opening for 
fusion keyboard player Bobby Lyle at the Hyatt Newporter Hotel's outdoor 
amphitheater in Newport Beach. Drawing selections mostly from its eponymous 
first album, the quartet was wonderful, and though the set was short, it badly 
upstaged the headliner's. How could the foursome improve on that? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Saturday at System M, improve the foursome did, adding an extra degree 
of intensity in the club's more intimate setting. Indeed, the much-debated 
question came to mind once more: Is jazz better suited to clubs or to concerts? 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of concerts will tell you that despite the proximity of band to 
crowd, club patrons tend to talk through performances, creating a distraction 
one normally doesn't find in the concert format. 
</P>
<P>
 But talking wasn't a problem at System M. Even in the back of the packed room, 
people were focused on B Sharp's every sound, and the group responded very 
strongly with a varied program that featured each member in turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the intensity of the compositions seemed to diminish as the set 
progressed -- introspective moments came to replace the high-anxiety 
freneticism of the first few tunes -- the audience didn't let go but hung 
tightly to the band's changing mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophonist Randall Willis got the proceedings off on the good foot, blowing 
muscular tenor on Horace Silver's "Filthy McNasty," building lines like an 
angry discourse into shouts and chest-beating wails before slipping back into 
the theme line. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis shone throughout the proceedings, adding just the right touches of 
strength and intellect, taking cues from the rhythm section when improvising 
and making sure his phrases followed in logical progression. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was bassist Reggie Carson and drummer/band leader Herb Graham Jr. who 
took home the most valuable player awards. The BSJQ does its best work on such 
funk-flavored tunes as "Filthy McNasty" and Willis' "Almost Next," and it's 
because of Carson's solid bottom-end sound that these beat-minded numbers 
succeed. Add Graham's insightful timekeeping to the foundation and you can 
build something that would keep standing during The Big One. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson was especially agile Saturday, helped by amplification that let each 
tone stand on its own. Never content just to walk the bass through a song, he 
matches a tune's theme in note-for-note unison, or with a well-chosen harmonic 
blend that adds depth as well as beauty to the line. Behind the saxophone, he 
listens and responds, taking off from the horn's statement while filling in 
with echoes, pops and two-toned doublestops. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham is likewise an all-ears player, ready to add emphasis and accent while 
keeping the clock ticking. At one point during his own "How's That?," he 
produced a dynamic progression of drum rolls behind a repeated saxophone figure 
that prompted the crowd to erupt in cheers. Such excitement isn't easy to find 
in this reserved day and age. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliot Douglass' efforts on piano were hurt by weak amplification on the first 
number and a piano that badly needed tuning below middle C -- a difficulty 
managed to overcome in a lengthy introduction to his own "The Ascension," a 
subtle climb through a lush landscape that showcased his thoughtful, Bill 
Evans-influenced style. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass soloed with authority during "Filthy McNasty" and added a distinctive 
bump-and-grind flavor to "Father Knows This Best." In accompaniment, he 
provided a wide range of harmonic complements without cluttering anyone's solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Such teamwork is a large part of the reason why B Sharp stands head and 
shoulders above most of the young bands exploring the post-bop tradition. These 
guys work together as a unit; there is no clash of egos here. They also write 
music that fits the teamwork ideal, with each part contributing to a larger 
whole, rather than taking the usual find-a-groove-and-blow approach of so many 
emerging jazz figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in their favor: They extend the musical tradition, they don't just copy 
it. Even many of today's big name musicians are content to re-create the sounds 
of the '50s and '60s, but B Sharp puts a decidedly modern spin on its material, 
even though it springs from the period of Silver, Art Blakey and John Coltrane. 
Dare we say it? B Sharp is just plain sharper than most of the bands out there 
today.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 'COMBINACION': SALSA'S DREAM TEAM; SOME OF THE BEST OF THE 
GENRE SHOW UP FOR LIVE PRESENTATION OF ALBUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Salsa music has been steadily gaining popularity in Los Angeles in the '90s -- 
as evidenced by record sales and an increasing number of clubs devoted to the 
sensual, rhythmic style. The local salsa celebration moved Saturday night to 
the Hollywood Bowl, where a spectacular display of power and musicianship 
showed why fans are embracing the sound, which has long been associated chiefly 
in the United States with New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-star concert -- a virtual Dream Team of salsa music sponsored by RMM 
Records, the most challenging Latin music label in the country -- was the live 
presentation of "La Combinacion Perfecta," a 1993 RMM album featuring duets of 
today's best salsa singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the absences of some of the album's key artists (including Marc 
Anthony, Domingo Quinones and Van Lester), performers such as cigar-wielding 
India, Ray de la Paz, Ray Sepulveda and Johnny Rivera performed deftly. They 
were backed by the outstanding RMM orchestra led by Sergio George, who is also 
salsa's top record producer, and the lively RMM dance company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a night of exceptional performances, three stood out, starting with the 
duet by Tito Nieves and Tony Vega on "Tu por aqui y yo por alla" ("You Around 
Here and Me Around There"), which rapidly turned the Bowl into a massive dance 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Also memorable: a 20-minute version of "Soneros de bailadores" (roughly 
"Singing for the Dancers") sung by Cheo Feliciano and Pete "El Conde" 
Rodriguez, with Tito Puente on timbales, Giovanni Hidalgo on congas and Luis 
"Perico" Ortiz on trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 The other key moment was a rendition of "Llego el sabor" ("The Taste Is Here") 
by Oscar D'Leon and Jose Alberto, who is known as "El Canario." This latter 
number brought together Venezuela's D'Leon, arguably today's most gifted salsa 
singer, and the Dominican Republic's "El Canario," an underrated, but 
first-class performer. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Celia Cruz -- wearing a tall hairdo and dancing faster than India 
herself -- closed dynamically with "El Son de Celia y Oscar" ("The Son of Celia 
and Oscar"), sharing the microphone with D'Leon. 
</P>
<P>
 For the finale, the entire cast joined singing the evening's title theme, with 
the enthusiastic crowd yelling for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the singers had been stopped cold on stage during the night when 
spotting one member of that crowd -- Marlon Brando -- in the front row. They 
saluted him with words, stretching hands and even mentioning him in their 
soneos (improvisational lyrics). 
</P>
<P>
 Not sure if Brando was an extra motivation, but the concert -- aside from the 
attendance, which only about half filled the Bowl -- exceeded all expectations 
and did justice to an exemplary branch of the uneven world of Latin music.

MUSIC REVIEW; CHORALE OPENER PAYS TRIBUTE TO AIDS FALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Hall and the Master Chorale of Orange County opened their 39th season 
Saturday with a program intended to offer consolation and support to families 
and friends of those who have fallen to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 For many both on and off the stage at Segerstrom Hall, this seemed a very 
personal testament, whether to a lost friend or loved one -- who once gave so 
much and held even greater promise -- or to fear of the future, of the 
horrifying thought that the general populace might prefer to look elsewhere, at 
least until there is nowhere else to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's choice of music reflected a mixture of emotions and reactions. "Love 
Alone" is Ned Rorem's setting of poet Paul Monette's "Here," a grief-ridden cry 
written after the loss to AIDS of a cherished partner. For his "Alto Rhapsody," 
Brahms heightens the sense of isolation and the need for love in text chosen 
from Goethe's "Harzreise im Winter." Faure's Requiem closed the concert with 
its vision of death as transcendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The union of the men in the Master Chorale with the Gay Men's Chorus of Los 
Angeles, for the works by Rorem and Brahms, increased the impact of the message 
musically and poignantly (the Gay Men's Chorus lost its first music director, 
Jerry Carlson, to AIDS in 1987; Jon Bailey now leads). In "Love Alone," the 
combined ensembles achieved flowing declaration, in turn powerful and quietly 
anguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra McCune and Tania Fleischer complemented admirably in Rorem's four-hand 
piano accompaniment filled with bittersweet dissonance and angry clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the entreating protagonist of the Rhapsody, Wendy Hillouse used her rich, 
unfailing mezzo to create a dark mood at once lonely and uplifting. Hall kept 
the orchestra and male voices in neatly balanced sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Faure's unique Requiem received less consistent treatment, sometimes attaining 
a floating etherialism, other times emerging merely detached and unfocused. 
Baritone Douglas Lawrence and soprano Rebecca Semanie brought centered tone and 
general reliability to their roles but Lawrence required occasional pitch 
adjustments and Semanie's notes -- perhaps affected by her ninth month of 
pregnancy -- thinned as they ascended. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the message remained clear, and Faure's somber melodies and lush 
harmonies served as fitting parallels to the serious and far-reaching 
consequences of this disease on our community, as well as to the wealth of 
enduring contributions made by so many it has taken from us.

 Happy Birthday, Phil: Actor Michael York will sub for Gregory Peck as master 
of ceremonies at the Los Angeles Philharmonic 75th birthday concert on Oct. 24 
at the Music Center Pavilion. Peck had to withdraw because of foot surgery. At 
the concert, L.A. Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen and former 
music director Zubin Mehta will conduct the same four works that were played at 
the Philharmonic's inaugural concert at the Trinity Auditorium on Oct. 24, 
1919. The program begins with Dvorak's "New World" symphony conducted by Mehta. 
Salonen will conduct works by Liszt, Weber and Chabrier. TELEVISION

 From L.A. to Cicely: Actress Teri Polo has joined the cast of CBS' "Northern 
Exposure" as journalist Michelle Schowdoski-Capra, wife of Dr. Phillip Capra, 
played by another recently announced cast member, Paul Provenza. On the show, 
Polo's character will have some trouble adjusting to the rustic life in Cicely, 
Alaska, after she and her husband move there to escape the hectic life in Los 
Angeles. Polo starred in NBC's adaptation of "The Phantom of the Opera" and she 
appeared as Meryl Streep's daughter in the film "The House of the Spirits." 
Polo and Provenza will make their "Northern Exposure" debuts on the episode 
airing Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside 'Edition': Bill O'Reilly, the anchor of the syndicated tabloid show 
"Inside Edition," will leave the program when his contract expires in May. 
O'Reilly, who began working for the show just after it premiered in January, 
1989, said in a statement that it's time for him to move on.

 Out of This World?: Tired of daytime talk shows? Intrigued by the likes of 
"The X-Files" and "Sightings"? NBC hopes so. The network has axed Jane 
Whitney's talk show and today introduces "The Other Side," a program that NBC 
says will explore such "diverse topics as alternative medicine, dreams, 
near-death experiences and romantic ghost stories" -- subjects that, in the 
view of NBC daytime chief Susan Lee, are "incredibly relevant to today's 
daytime audience." The program, hosted by Will Miller, will air locally 
weekdays at 9 a.m. on KNBC-TV Channel 4. "Marilu," which had been seen at 9, 
moves to Whitney's old slot at 11 a.m.

 Hiring Forum: The California Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights will conduct a forum on minority and female employment in the 
broadcast industry Thursday and Friday at the Pasadena Center. Michael C. 
Carney, chairperson of the federal advisory body, said in a statement, "The 
Advisory Committee is very concerned with equal access and opportunity for 
positions in the entertainment industry." Employees at KCBS-TV Channel 2 and 
KNBC-TV Channel 4 have complained during the last year about what they feel are 
discriminatory hiring and promotion practices in the newsrooms. Philip Montez, 
regional director of the commission, said the forum will be the first in a 
series on hiring being sponsored by the commission.

 Morning News in Spanish: Starting today, the Spanish-language Telemundo

 An 'R' for 'The Wild Bunch': A restored director's cut of Sam Peckinpah's 
violent Western "The Wild Bunch" won back its original R-rating last week when 
the MPAA dropped its decision to give the film a new rating of NC-17. The 
latest move came after the MPAA met with officials of Warner Bros., who had 
found documentary evidence that the director's cut contained no more scenes 
than the version rated R for the movie's 1969 debut. "What happened was that 
everyone had a chance to really flesh out what versions we were all discussing 
and it ended up being the same version," said Warner Bros. publicity chief Rob 
Friedman. "It was all a big misunderstanding." The flap started in March, 1993, 
when Warner Bros. resubmitted a restored director's cut for release on the 25th 
anniversary of the controversial classic. The director's cut included 10 
character scenes that weren't violent -- Warner Bros. had snipped them to speed 
up the film. The confusion came because the studio made the cuts after the film 
was originally rated but before it was released. The studio plans to re-release 
the film in L.A. and New York in February or March, then spread out to other 
cities. QUICK TAKES

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; BY THIS TIME, 'BASEBALL' HAS GONE TO EXTRA INNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to Saul Halpert's Counterpunch, " 'Baseball' Ran On 
Interminably, Illustrating Why PBS Falls Short" (Oct. 3): 
</P>
<P>
 I come from a small town, Kimballton, Iowa, population 370, and my dad took 
the collections when the "All-Stars" came to town to play a gathering of our 
players.This was in the '30s. Plus, we were privileged to have Fellers All 
Stars and Satchel Paige's Royals go through our town. The memories that flooded 
my mind, and the tears that followed, told me that those times were relived in 
my memory and my heart watching "Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up knowing only baseball. I, and all my friends, had only the dreams 
that were portrayed in the papers and on the radio. The collectors' cards -- 
oh, how I wish I had kept them -- were something to cherish. Can you remember 
the old players that were on the news in the '30s and '40s? I can, and I 
remember how it thrilled me time and again as I watched the replays of some of 
those memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can replace memories like these, but Ken Burns' special was something 
I will cherish and hold dear to my heart. It wasn't boring to me. It thrilled 
me, time and again, and I didn't care if "Star-Spangled Banner" was played so 
much. I loved it. What a tribute to America . I say, God bless America and 
"Baseball."

 I'm afraid Halpert was too kind; the show was a disaster. The format was all 
wrong: The historians should have been discarded in favor of current or former 
players and managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The show seemed biased in favor of New York teams and seemed to fawn over them 
forever. It seemed to concentrate too much on the early teams, and we didn't 
need to know what these teams ate. And I can't remember seeing a front-office 
executive. The only interesting parts were the recollections of Negro League 
veterans. I'm sorry, Ken Burns, but you struck out.

 Halpert complained about hearing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" and 
"Star-Spangled Banner" again and again throughout the series. What he 
apparently did not notice was the giant difference between versions of these 
songs played on successive nights. As a student of musicology, I found it 
fascinating to hear the national anthem played each night in what were fairly 
authentic arrangements for the period of time being chronicled. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' epic show was never intended to be an 18-hour miniseries about 
baseball. It was intended to be a slice of American history, seen through the 
glasses of the great American pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the testimony of my wife, who hates baseball with a passion and 
rarely watches television. Guess what? She watched every minute of the 
miniseries, despite giving birth to our son three hours before the last 
episode. Now that's good television.

 Burns continues to challenge viewers to look more deeply and thoughtfully into 
a subject than the medium of television normally allows. In both his "Civil 
War" and "Baseball" series, he asked for a commitment from his audience and in 
turn rewarded them with an engaging and vivid retelling of history. Why does 
Halpert find fault with this?

COUNTERPUNCH: HOLLYWOOD IMAGE OF MILITARY IS WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT SCHLICHTER, Kurt Schlichter, a recent graduate of Loyola Law School, is 
a captain in the California Army National Guard and a Persian Gulf veteran. He 
has written on military-civilian relations and has consulted on 
military-related media projects. The views expressed here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the nightly TV news once again dominated by pictures of our troops 
deployed in a potentially hostile environment, would it be asking too much for 
the movies to accurately portray the American military? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think so. Yet, all too frequently filmmakers make a number of basic 
mistakes when Hollywood goes to war. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent example: the HBO movie "The Enemy Within," a story about a military 
plot to take over the government. (" 'Enemy Within' a '90s 'Seven Days in May,' 
" Calendar, Aug. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, while it makes a terrific visual in the film, someone needs to 
let Hollywood in on the secret that troops deploying for battle do not march in 
neat formations. That went out of fashion sometime around Gettysburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of military vehicles rolling down suburban streets is another 
powerful image the film offers -- I well remember the sick feeling I had seeing 
my own troops on the road during the Los Angeles riots. However, sponsors of a 
potential coup probably would be more interested in securing main freeway 
intersections, telephone switching centers, airports, power stations and City 
Hall. HBO's coup appeared to be aimed at the Hollywood Hills. While some in 
Hollywood may not believe it, not even the most left-wing movie stars' and 
producers' homes would make the target list. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of actors portraying soldiers was another problem. Jason Robards 
has the aura of a four-star general but he could have used a haircut. Forrest 
Whittaker is not only the youngest full-bird colonel in military history but, 
to be diplomatic, perhaps the largest Marine on active duty. Of course, 
sometimes Hollywood does get it right. Gary Sinese in "Forrest Gump" simply is 
a lieutenant, and, I must admit, Pauly Shore of "In the Army Now" does bear a 
startling resemblance to one of my former troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pet peeve of mine has always been movie uniforms. Happily, some 
costume designer mastered the arcane art of determining the proper precedence 
of the characters' ribbons. Still, one never sees an officer strolling about 
with his coat open and tie loose. One wears the uniform correctly, or not at 
all, even when being chased by assassins.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these are merely superficial errors, but the substance of the film 
is where the filmmakers truly failed. Rod Serling, scriptwriter of the film 
"Seven Days in May," on which this version was based, was an ex-paratrooper and 
was at least familiar with the military subculture. Nothing of the sort was 
evident here. 
</P>
<P>
 The generals and admirals of "The Enemy Within" are a Central Casting 
collection of right-wing nuts parading around in medal-encrusted uniforms 
spouting neo-fascist cliches. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, 
the model officer of today is recently retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. Not 
only is he tactically proficient, but he is a true scholar as well. In that 
spirit, advancement beyond major today requires that an officer earn an 
advanced post-graduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Still more irritating is the view of the grunts themselves. None but the 
heroic Whittaker utters so much as a peep when ordered to topple the elected 
President of the United States. Does Hollywood really have so little faith in 
the loyalty of those who defend their country? 
</P>
<P>
 The portrayal of servicemen and women as mindless robots does a great 
disservice. Even though the Cold War is over, under President Clinton Americans 
have been under fire in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia and Somalia. Troops are at 
risk in Haiti while the nation faces possible conflict with Iraq and perhaps 
even North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 By dehumanizing these men and women, Hollywood makes sending them off to war 
that much easier. By showing soldiers as the real people they are, Hollywood 
could be sending a far more important and meaningful message.

COUNTERPUNCH: ED WOOD -- THE FILM CULT THAT WOULDN'T DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY MEDVED, Harry Medved is the co-author of four books on the motion 
picture industry, including The Golden Turkey Awards and The Hollywood Hall of 
Shame. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Ed Wood," Tim Burton's delightful homage to the cross-dressing Grade Z 
movie-maker, ends with a brief written epilogue that describes the fate of this 
unique auteur. "Wood died in 1978," it reads. "Two years later he was voted 
Worst Director of All Time, bringing him worldwide acclaim." 
</P>
<P>
 How did Wood go from this anonymous status to becoming the center of a 
thriving international cult? And when did his rogues' gallery of eccentric 
collaborators emerge from the Wood-work? (As Wood's friend and frequent star 
Bela Lugosi bellows in "Glen or Glenda": "Da story mahst be tohld !") 
</P>
<P>
 I'll confess that I played some role in Wood's transformation, and thanks to 
Burton's biopic (" 'Ed Wood': '50s Blithe Spirit," Calendar, Sept. 28), I can 
finally say with dignity that I was his cult leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's "Worst" status was not the result of some universal poll of film 
critics -- there were only two "bad movie" mavens who determined the vote, and 
they happened to be Harry and Michael Medved. My brother and I gave Wood the 
life achievement award for worst director of all time in the pages of our 1980 
tome, "The Golden Turkey Awards," where we recognized for the first time Wood's 
monumental contributions to the world of bad cinema. Our decision was 
influenced by the surprisingly strong showing of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" in 
our readers' poll for the worst film of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We felt compelled to track down the mad genius-in-reverse who created this 
multilayered mess-terpiece. Rumor had it that Wood hung out at a 16mm film 
rental house in central Hollywood -- this was in the days before video stores 
-- where he rented his favorite Westerns and Lugosi horror movies. When I asked 
for help in contacting Wood, I was told, "Oh, you just missed him!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he leave a forwarding number?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. He just died. He had a heart attack while watching a football game." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite my heartbreak at his recent passing, I remained undaunted in my search 
to discover the "true facts" of his complex life and interviewed dozens of 
lovable lunatics who inhabited Wood's circle of Hollywood "fringies." 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 17, I had developed a fearless devotion toward my subject, 
somewhat akin to the relationship that Wood himself enjoyed with Lugosi, as 
depicted in the screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. (To 
further my connection with Wood, the personal assistant to TV psychic Criswell 
even offered the possibility of contacting Wood through one of their seances at 
the Hollywood YMCA -- and he reassured me that Criswell's pronouncements were 
"97% accurate . . . most of the time.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I journeyed into Wood's past, his co-workers reacted with muffled guffaws 
of disbelief. "Plan 9" star Gregory Walcott howled through the phone receiver 
when I first contacted him about "Eddie" Wood: "His was the most ridiculous 
film I have ever worked on in my life! Why in the world would anyone want to 
read a book about his god-awful movies?" 
</P>
<P>
 As if to answer his question, "bad film" fanatics came crawling out from 
underneath their rocks or from under their sinks in the early '80s, and a 
genuinely rabid Ed Wood cult began (notably at UCLA where an All-Day Wood 
Marathon was held at Melnitz Hall in 1981). My brother and I hosted screenings 
of the Wood Triptych ("Bride of the Monster," "Glen or Glenda" and "Plan 9") at 
Worst Film Festivals on four continents, developed a successful TV series in 
England devoted to Wood and other schlockmeisters representing "The Worst of 
Hollywood," and unveiled historically awful film clips from the Wood pile on 
"Today," "The Tonight Show," "The Evening News With Dan Rather" and more than 
400 talk shows around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 David Letterman and "Seinfeld" devoted segments to "Plan 9." Video 
documentaries, comic books and trading cards followed, but after eight years as 
Keepers of the Ed Wood Flame, we passed the torch to Golden Turkey fan Rudolph 
Grey, providing him with reams of unpublished interviews that he used for his 
Wood biography, "Nightmare in Ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary irony is that our epithet for Wood as "Worst Director of All 
Time" has helped make him a hot commodity. Like most of the misfit characters 
in Tim Burton's movies, Wood wanted desperately to fit into the mainstream, and 
now he has finally made it, 16 years after his death. The cult followers will 
see to it that the Wood fires will never flicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed, if you're up there in "bad movie" heaven with your angora wings fluttering 
and observing your long-overdue lionization as American popular culture 
phenomenon, I hope you're savoring every moment.

COUNTERPUNCH: IT'S TIME TO DUMP THE 'GUMP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM RELLING Jr., Novelist and short-story writer William Relling Jr. 
lives in Silver Lake, where he conducts a private workshop for fiction writers. 
His most recent novel was Silent Moon (Tor Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I realize I'm very much in the minority in my opinion that "Forrest Gump" is 
despicable. Oh, yes, "Gump" has recently become Paramount Studios' 
highest-grossing film ever, one of the Top 10 money-making movies of all time. 
The overwhelming majority of people I know who've seen it can hardly be more 
effusive in their praise. I'm not quite a lone voice crying in the wilderness 
--  
</P>
<P>
 thankfully I've noted a couple of reviews that take "Gump" to task for various 
shortcomings, and I have a handful of acquaintances who've expressed to me 
their distaste for the movie -- but I'm close. 
</P>
<P>
 However, just because I'm out-voted (even by so wide a margin), it doesn't 
mean I'm wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting aside that the movie is so rife with anachronisms it's difficult to 
keep straight what year it's supposed to be or how old the characters are, and 
that it's utterly mystifying why no one in the movie ever seems to recognize 
Gump for the celebrity he is, I was appalled by "Forrest Gump" mostly because 
the movie trivialized every large issue it was ostensibly dealing with. 
History, war, love, friendship, success, death . . . if you think carefully 
about what the movie actually says, you cannot escape the conclusion that these 
issues are dealt with in only the most slipshod and superficial way. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not speaking of the fantasy conceit that is the movie's central plot 
element -- that Forrest Gump, through a unique combination of luck, talent and 
good-naturedness, finds himself interacting with everyone from Elvis Presley to 
Richard Nixon and is witness to many of the major political and sociological 
events of the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about how Gump tosses off the assassinations of the Kennedys and 
Martin Luther King Jr. with nothing more than another of his flip "Gump-isms." 
I'm talking about how Gump becomes a millionaire while others suffer -- and how 
the audience is encouraged to cheer about that. I'm talking about the casual, 
off-handed manner in which are treated the deaths of the two people Gump loves 
most: his mother from cancer, and his girlfriend-later-wife Jenny from some 
"unknown disease," presumably AIDS; their passing has all the emotional 
resonance of a Hallmark card commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, why is "Forrest Gump" such a huge success, both critically 
and commercially? To tell the truth, that success doesn't really surprise me, 
for a couple of reasons. First of all, audiences find the character of Forrest 
Gump tremendously endearing, not so much because of his good heart, but because 
they feel intellectually superior to him -- he is mentally retarded. Whenever 
he cut loose with another of his inane, naive Gump-isms or reacted to some 
situation with wide-eyed wonder, the audience I was part of didn't laugh with 
him, they laughed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Second is the movie's implied message that individual success has nothing to 
do with hard work or study or having brains; it's all just luck. It is a 
promulgation of what the late William A. Henry III calls in his book "In 
Defense of Elitism" the "Vital Lie." As Henry wrote, too many people nowadays 
-- especially Americans -- seem to believe that: "Win or lose, their chance of 
success depends on the whims of fate rather than on their own hard work.  
</P>
<P>
 "Worse, (this) 'lottery mentality' often translates into an assumption that 
all life is a game of chance, all success accidental, the wealthy and powerful 
simply lucky rather than accomplished. When daydreams substitute for plans, 
when wishing seems more appropriate than work, when envy gains yet another 
rationale, (our) whole society is the loser." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say the violence-ridden "Natural Born Killers" is the most 
dangerous movie out there right now. No way. At best, it's a distant second to 
"Forrest Gump."

JAZZ REVIEW; AN APPEALING OUTING BY MARSALIS, FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since change is constant, why not expect it from Wynton Marsalis? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of interpreting music that was reminiscent of the '30s and '40s, as 
has been his wont, the acclaimed trumpeter delivered a first-rate program with 
his septet Saturday at El Camino College that emphasized jazz of the '50s, '60s 
and even '90s.This refreshing shift contributed to Marsalis' most appealing 
appearance here in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis, whose stunning technical playing has sometimes been inflicted with 
emotionally distant dissonance and tiresome corn, worked instead with a new, 
delightful tunefulness and warmth. His lines were composed of carefully chosen 
notes that caressed, rather than assaulted the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 The splendid repertoire, which was deftly orchestrated by the leader, ranged 
from Thelonious Monk's arduous "Four In One" -- played with zeal -- to 
Marsalis' bubbly "Buggy Ride" and his moody "Black Codes From the Underground." 
</P>
<P>
 On "Buggy Ride," Marsalis' solo was filled with darting-here-then-there, 
be-bop bent ideas. He was soft and understated on "Black Codes," an edgy, 
almost harsh work when first released in 1985 that this time had an alluring 
smoothness. "You Don't Know What Love Is" found Marsalis offering risky, 
emotional ideas, though he took fewer chances on "My Ideal," which was a bit 
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsalis' band was exemplary. Drummer Herlin Riley, bassist Ben Wolfe and 
pianist Eric Reed underpinned the entire concert with thoughtful support, and 
the front line of Wycliffe Gordon (trombone), Victor Goines (tenor sax, 
clarinet) and Wes Anderson (alto sax) played with verve. ZAN STEWART

ART REVIEW; UNDERPINNING THE ELEGANCE, FEROCITY OF 'MAYA UNIVERSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year AD 455 was pivotal in the course of world empires. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Rome was by then so weakened that the Germanic Vandals sacked its 
capital with impunity. Meantime halfway around the world a people called the 
Mayans established a temple complex on the Yucatan Peninsula known as Chichen 
Itza. As Rome crumbled, it marked the beginning of a new great civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Mayan pyramids, astrological observatory and dwellings were 
ceremonial ball courts. These played a role in the Mayan belief that the sun 
god must be regularly placated with the blood of human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos have reason to identify with both civilizations. Now they have the 
chance to contemplate rare treasures of each of their arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. County Museum of Art is showing "Painting the Maya Universe: Royal 
Ceramics of the Classic Period." Last week, the J. Paul Getty Museum opened "A 
Passion for Collecting; Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence 
Fleischman." This trove of classic Western art will be reviewed here 
separately, but the juxtaposition is provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 A culture's value system is embedded in its art. Classic Western art shows the 
Homo sapiens animal striving to transcend itself. Pre-Columbian art tends to be 
more earthy, dealing with the situation on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Greek painting, most surviving pictorial art of the Mayans is literally 
made of earth. But the 98 ceramic vessels and related objects on view at LACMA 
act as more than a display of ceremonial objects of use. The ensemble reveals, 
in small part, a great painting tradition whose scale could command massive 
wall frescoes. One is reminded pointedly of the great mural tradition of modern 
Mexican art. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized by Duke University Museum of Art curator Dorie 
Reents-Budet in cooperation with LACMA's Virginia Fields. It comes with a 
handsomely illustrated scholarly catalogue and will travel to Yale Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest number of objects are cylindrical vases. From any distance they 
look like particularly muscular abstractions in geomorphic shapes of black, 
white and earthen yellows, reds and tans. Like the opening strains of a 
symphony, they announce that what follows will be high drama. Their very 
physical presence speaks. Elegantly honed ritual shapes and lovingly massaged 
surfaces bespeak refinement. This is the art of an elite class, given to create 
an impression, so valued and magical that owners wanted to be buried with these 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the simplest and most truly abstract reveal the hands of artisans who 
were true artists. Numerous works are signed. A tripod vessel with three 
built-in sauce dishes is like a chip 'n' dip bowl made for a king. A shallow 
plate decorated with no more than nine small repeated motifs is so sensitively 
designed it becomes an exercise in cosmic wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Many vessels have bands of calligraphic motifs ringing their tops. Recently 
their meaning has been deciphered, revealing dedications to giver and receiver, 
the names of artists and even the sort of food and drink for which the 
container was intended. (Mayan aristocrats loved chocolate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Absorbing as this is, it pales a bit when one hones in on pictorial scenes 
telling the appearance, life and temperament of the Maya royals. Few women are 
shown. When they are their appearance is not greatly distinguished from the 
men. They were a stocky, hawk-nosed people with sloping foreheads, small, 
tightly pursed mouths and bulging eyes. They encumbered themselves with far 
less clothing than we do, except at the beach. Chests and legs are usually bare 
but loincloths were rich and headdresses sumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Exquisite Mayan drawing reveals all this down to the last ear ornament. It's 
spidery linearity varies from region to region but all of it has a property 
extremely rare in the history of art. Like great modern animators, Mayan 
draftsmen had the knack of making still drawings pulsate with incipient 
movement. This is quite tricky enough to do even when drawing a running figure. 
Considering the ceremonial stillness of most Mayan compositions their feeling 
of vivid life is borderline miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures wrapped around vases are not always easy to read. The exhibition 
eases the problem with numerous roll-out photos by Justin Kerr. Narratives vary 
from scenes of supplicants kneeling before the gods of the Mayan underworld, to 
images of a ruler collecting tribute from an underling. They have things in 
common. Actors human and supernatural are surrounded by magical animals. 
Jaguars for power. Bunnies for fecundity. Serpents for wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pervasive theme, however, is unabashed hierarchical power. Everywhere 
somebody is standing tall or seated on a dais while somebody else grovels. The 
artists' command of expression and body language is breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional bottom line hovers somewhere between violence and humor. This 
art will put some viewers off for the same reasons that ancient Assyrian, 
Indian or modern Expressionism does. It accepts violence and grotesquerie as 
part of a life that is so vivid and energized, it seems to writhe. What makes 
it worth a second look is its realism and ultimate humanity. These overarching 
masterpieces of world art are able to communicate immediate human experience 
across a span of 19 centuries.

DALTREY REVIVES SPIRIT OF WHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's a Who concert without the Who? A surprisingly satisfying evening of 
revitalized classic rock, it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Daltrey brought his "Daltrey Sings Townshend" show to the Greek Theatre 
on Saturday and energetically celebrated the songwriting of his former band 
mate, Pete Townshend, with two hours of revamped tunes associated with his old 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed with a rock band and a full orchestra, the golden-maned, iron-throated 
singer tore into hoary, familiar faves such as "I Can See for Miles" and "Baba 
O'Riley" with gritty conviction. The singer was also in fine form on rarer 
tracks like "Naked Eye" and "After the Fire," and proved throughout the night 
that he remains an unparalleled microphone-cable twirler.  
</P>
<P>
 Who bassist John Entwistle joined Daltrey for the second half of the show, and 
the Townshend gene pool was represented by Pete's brother, Simon, on rhythm 
guitar. But it was the lack of Who-reunion expectations and baggage that 
allowed the band's music to be fully and freshly appreciated.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who Are You" was played as a slippery blues tune. An extended section of 
material from the 1973 "Quadrophenia" album was particularly solid. And the 
ensemble's mix of raw power and orchestral flourishes perked up "Won't Get 
Fooled Again." 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask why I'm doing this, when I should be tucked in bed with a 
hot-water bottle," Daltrey told the crowd. "The reason is that I'm a giant Who 
fan." 
</P>
<P>
 That honest affection for the material turned what might have been a 
self-serving oldies show into a substantial heartfelt tribute to the landmark 
British band that called it quits for good after a 1989 reunion tour. CHUCK

DANCE REVIEW; A DECADE OF DANCE WITH LIVINGSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Highlighting creativity that actually spans more than a decade, the 10th 
anniversary program by Loretta Livingston and Dancers on Saturday at Japan 
America Theatre allowed a summary look at the modern dance choreographer's 
interests and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at nearly three hours, however, an overly generous program that often 
distanced the strong dancers' impact and energy from the audience by locating 
the action mostly mid-stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston marked the alpha and omega of her career so far by juxtaposing 
"Balances," a work made the year before she founded her own company in 1984, 
with a new piece, "Balances, Too." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally produced at Cal Arts in Santa Clarita, "Balances" presented 
Livingston in modest, ingenious solo explorations of weight and volume and, 
yes, various balances, in stillness or motion, with ease or difficulty, with 
elegance or edgy risk. Livingston danced it with firm control. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the new work, "Balances, Too," a duet for Livingston and Madeline 
Soglin, looked sprawling, spun out from accumulated short-movement motifs and 
only loosely if at all connected with the accompanying text -- prerecorded 
excerpts read by the choreographer from Pablo Neruda's "The Book of Questions," 
translated by William O'Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Neruda wrote the work, according to the program, only months before his death. 
Therefore, one would like to give him (and the translator) a charitable 
latitude for such questionable profundities as "In the end, won't death be an 
endless kitchen?" or "Tell me, is the rose naked or is that her only dress?" 
</P>
<P>
 Musings about the proper punishments of Hitler in hell only pointed up the 
airy, poetic illogic of so many of his other questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance began with the pose in which the earlier "Balances" ended: 
Livingston standing in a spotlight, precariously balanced on tip-toe, her arms 
extended overhead. Soglin tilted, maneuvered and even dressed her while she 
maintained the high tension of this iconic posture while lying on the floor. 
The tension quickly dissipated, however, as the two pursued parallel or 
separate movement interests that failed to accumulate weight and meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Livingston, who danced for a decade in Bella Lewitzky's company before 
striking out on her own, elsewhere presented work that ranged from intra-family 
drama to abstract movement study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Place Settings" (1984) used dream-like images and memory distortions to 
explore the linked influences among three generations of women (Soglin, Lynne 
DeMarco, and Stacia Voytek). 
</P>
<P>
 "Paper/Scissors/Rock" (1986) showed Livingston and David Plettner (her 
husband) expanding the familiar children's game into playful, imaginative, 
challenging partnering relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispersed over the program were three excerpts from "A History of 
Restlessness" (1992): "Drift," an eloquent and fluid solo for Livingston; "Ice 
Age," a pained and bitter power struggle between Michael Mizerany and DeMarco; 
and "Fault Zone," an allusive study in surging wave movements for Mizerany, 
Plettner and Soglin. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening ended with "The Archives" from "A Window in the Passage" (1991), 
an impressive group piece about the collapse of idols. Here, as elsewhere, Doc 
Ballard was the sensitive lighting designer.

COMEDY REVIEW; MOMMIES FIND HUMOR, HEART IN HOUSEWIFE'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was ladies' night out at the Alex Theater in Glendale Friday, and from the 
shrieks of delight that greeted the comedy duo the Mommies from a packed house 
of mostly white, youngish, suburban women, the random male interloper felt he 
was in for it -- that is, either direct assault by way of withering critique, 
or the claustrophobic sense of being trapped in a crowded powder room. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fears turned out to be well-founded and irrelevant. By evening's end, the 
male of the species saw himself in the eyes of two women dishing: hairy in the 
wrong places, horny, flatulent, impractical, wimpy, lazy, evasive, 
self-absorbed and uncommunicative. 
</P>
<P>
 And by evening's end, he had heard enough about fat, poop, skid marks, 
hemorrhoids, douches, tampons and PMS to sit immobile in front of a daylong, 
triple-dip NFL telecast with total guilt-free disinterest in what might be on 
his other half's mind as she vacuumed through the house in stony silence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Mommies delivered terrific entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Caryl Kristensen, 33, and Marilyn Kentz, 47, are two Petaluma housewives who 
met a decade ago as neighbors living in a cul-de-sac that was as metaphoric as 
it was real. They knew, like every woman in their devoted audience, that at the 
heart of a dutiful housewife's hectic life, with its endless laundry and 
car-pools and hassles with hubby and the kids, is a primal anxiety that hangs 
in like a low-grade fever. One gets old, one gets fat, kids can be ugly and 
hateful and the emptiness they leave behind after they too quickly "grow and 
go," as Kentz says, is as pervasive as weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than tear their raiments like Theban wives, the Mommies find 
endless ways to laugh at themselves and their conditions. They obey the 
writer's first maxim -- tell what you know. They're colorful and observant and, 
most of the time, very funny. Kristensen's anatomy of a domestic fight while 
she's feeling PMS, "I just tell my husband, 'We're gonna fight; you pick the 
topic,' " is a memorable gloss on domestic wartime strategy. And unlike most 
stand-ups, they know how to put on a show, with costumes, music, subtle shifts 
in tempo and a steady emotional core based on a fondness for lives that at 
bottom are not so dreary after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Their defunct NBC sitcom didn't do them justice. The show is about to be 
revived. Let's hope for better luck for them next time.

STERNBERG DOESN'T RISE WITH MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Sternberg chooses wonderful music for dancing -- rich, engulfing 
accompaniments borrowed from many cultures that immediately establish an 
intense theatrical expectancy in the listener. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether set to a soulful symphony by Gorecki, assaultive rock by Ministry 
or galvanic drums from Burundi, her choreography at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre 
in Santa Monica seemed curiously locked down on Friday: compulsively busy, 
unrelievedly tense, obsessed with formal patterning. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of deepening, extending or just plain riding the music, Sternberg 
would meticulously dissect it for brief, brittle movement phrases that her 
four-woman company could punch and pound and recombine until any hope of flow 
was gone. This locally based artist formed her modern dance company nine years 
ago, but her program included "In between" from 1977, a duet just as 
intelligent and overloaded in its way as her newest full-company vehicle, 
"Tight." 
</P>
<P>
 In the former, she explored conflicting impulses in a relationship -- the need 
for closeness versus the fear of being stifled. "Tight" inflated this premise 
into a study of societal overcrowding and rage. Both used realistic mime to 
define their themes, as did "Empty/Try Another," Sternberg's manic solo about 
addiction from 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In her three longest works, however, Sternberg distilled her concepts 
indirectly through structural gambits and a painterly sense of space. 
"Earthprints" (1990), for instance, developed percussive playoffs between Julia 
Felker and Susan Kawashima through alternating and then converging passages in 
which mirror-synchrony and cyclical buildups gave a coherent shape to 
relentless tests of technique and stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio "River of Life/River of Death" (1994) incorporated clusters of women, 
water imagery and the division of the stage into overlapping layers in a 
complex showpiece that touched on supportive women's relationships and a 
suggestion of their parallel lives. With Gorecki's third symphony on the 
soundtrack, it provided the only relief on the program from high-pressure 
choreographic manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-part, full-company "Pieces of Women" (1993) experimented with 
sensuous music by Zakir Hussain and a vocabulary based on undulation -- but 
ended looking just as driven and severe as the bulk of the repertory. 
Ultimately, it focused on physical contrasts: the quick, dry motion of three 
small, relatively skinny dancers framing the expansive solos of Susan Skrzycki, 
a tall, fleshy woman highly commanding in adagio choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg's eye and mind proved as sharp as ever, and, as a dancer, she could 
execute mesmerizing spinal ripples on the beat with perfect accuracy. But, as 
the music kept reminding you, another whole dimension in dance remained out of 
her reach.LEWIS SEGAL

GEORGE RAMOS: COIN LAUNDRY'S GOODWILL WASHES THROUGH LENNOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The grand opening of a coin-operated laundry isn't really big news. After all, 
there are 40,000 of them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday in a gritty neighborhood near the Century Freeway in Lennox -- 
a blue-collar community near the L.A. airport known mostly for hard times -- 
there was a throng of people who came and washed away at the grand opening of 
Lucy's Lavanderia. To them, the $1.4-million coin laundry is the biggest thing 
to hit Lennox in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other Laundromats around here, the money changers don't work and the 
dryers don't dry," complained Victoria Gonzales, who showed up at the 
ceremonial opening with five loads of laundry. "Here, there are attendants to 
help you and there's free restrooms. And everything works. Look, there are even 
TV sets. We need this place." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy's is big news in other ways too. Since it opened Oct. 1, its owners 
report it's already turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy's is the product of a group of yuppie thirtysomething investors led by 
Randy Landsberger and Bill Cunningham, who have spent more than 10 years in the 
coin-laundry industry. They want to establish a chain of Lucy's-type laundries 
in minority neighborhoods where there is a need for good, safe and clean 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure they can make a good living and at the same time be good neighbors 
by offering jobs to area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They target ethnic communities because they think customers will prefer larger 
coin laundries with attendant staffers to the smaller, aging ones with no one 
on the premises. Landsberger and Cunningham disdain references to the "inner 
city," but that's clearly the kind of area that attracts them. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't an accident that they picked Lennox for Lucy's. They looked at 
several sites before they decided to build the facility in the vicinity of 
Inglewood Avenue and Lennox Boulevard, learning that a new coin laundry in the 
neighborhood was needed. The area's housing patterns were studied. Cunningham 
was aware of the area's gang problems but decided that the chance to construct 
a brand-new lavanderia was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 The meticulous planning even extended to the name of the place. There is no 
Lucy. The name was picked because the customers might relate to it. And that 
has apparently worked too. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask me, 'Where's Lucy?' " laughed Jose Medina, the business's 
lead attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting to Saturday's big event wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks refused to finance the project because they thought it too risky. 
Many potential investors were afraid of Lennox. Cunningham, who heads a 
Torrance laundry development company, didn't even approach government agencies, 
especially those pushing post-riot and earthquake recoveries. He feared the 
bureaucrats would impose unwanted limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, 15 investors came up with the capital. In four months, after the 
site on Inglewood Avenue was purchased and prepared, Lucy's was built and 
opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
 In that time, no vandalism or graffiti was reported. Gang members steered 
clear of it, giving the place a nod of respect. And numerous passersby kept a 
watchful eye, hoping they could land a job. When that day came, 300 showed up 
in the first hour, looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 When I stopped by Saturday, it was clear Lucy's was a success. Kids crowded 
around the attendants and around a clown hired for the occasion, who gave out 
candy, sodas and tokens for free use of the restrooms. Some customers couldn't 
get over the daily hours of operation, 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., which are longer than 
most places. 
</P>
<P>
 The introductory prices didn't hurt either: 25 cents for a single-load wash 
and 50 cents to dry a full load. 
</P>
<P>
 As the soap and goodwill flowed, Cunningham was shaking his head at the steady 
stream of business. "This is a four-win situation," he said. "The customers 
win. The community wins. I win. And the investors win too." 
</P>

 The mostly Spanish-speaking crowd wasn't bothered that there's no Lucy. Or 
that monied gringos are behind the venture. Or that other coin laundries in the 
area might fail because of Lucy's.

 "I respect these people because they respect us," explained Jesus De Pino in 
between drying cycles. "They give us a clean building, good machines. They give 
some of our people a job. That is very good."

 Saturday's opening appears to be only the start of big things for Lucy's. 
There are plans to open three more like it in Hollywood, Downtown L.A. and the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Lennox, plans are under way to open a minimarket inside Lucy's by 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "That'll be bigger than this grand opening," Victoria Gonzales said.

 If your taste runs to Halloween costumes featuring a recent murder victim or 
the man accused of being her killer, forget the Halloween Adventure shops. 
</P>
<P>
 No Nicole or O.J. masks there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had about six people try to sell me this kind of merchandise," says the 
Halloween Adventure shops' Southern California owner-operator, Lennie Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them I don't want it, I don't want anything to do with it," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman says his refusal to carry the stuff is not because he lacks a healthy 
sense of gallows humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had Zsa Zsa prison suits with a golden tiara, and Mike Tyson behind bars 
outfits, but O.J. hasn't been convicted of anything yet, so give me a break," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, based in the San Fernando Valley, oversees a chain of shops including 
those in Tarzana, Canoga Park, Northridge, Valencia, Sherman Oaks and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his shops are open only from the end of August through Oct. 31, with 
repeat customers and word-of-mouth keeping his skeleton staffs busy. This makes 
it easy for him, he says, and cuts down on the time he spends scaring up 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the most popular children's outfits are the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you without children, a Power Ranger is someone who looks strange 
and saves the galaxy, not a noble Englishwoman who compulsively buys up 
everything on London's Sloan Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists may be pained to learn the little-girl version of the uniforms comes 
in daffodil yellow and pink.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the hot items on the adult hit parade this year is the Mrs. Doubtfire 
costume for men. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't wait to see guys wobbling around on their new high heels.

 Break a leg. The Talk Is of a Coverup at Palmdale Golf Tourney 
</P>
<P>
 Cover up if you are entering the Palmdale Chamber of Commerce golf tournament 
at Desert Aire on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the dress code rules for participants: 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women may wear slacks but no denim, even of the designer variety.  
</P>
<P>
 Shirts must have collars, no T-shirts or tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes must have golf spikes, not those rubber things. 
</P>
<P>
 The last dictum is that women's skirts must be not more than four inches from 
the top of the knee. (No word on how short men's skirts may be.) 
</P>
<P>
 When chamber President Bernie Longjohn was asked if someone was going to be on 
hand with a ruler to measure the length from knee to skirt tops, he said he 
didn't think so but, "it's a job I'd happily volunteer to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Longjohn says the tournament is traditionally a fun day for duffers and 
serious golfers with prizes awarded in a number of categories.  
</P>
<P>
 Turkeys will be presented to some winners. Holding Up Events Under the Big Top 
</P>
<P>
 A woman wielding a pistol held up proceedings at one performance of the circus 
at Valley Presbyterian Hospital last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 She demanded to be allowed to join the performances and to "run away with the 
circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards quickly disarmed her, calmed her and gave her some lunch.  
</P>
<P>
 This little vignette was definitely not on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patty Schilling, hospital marketing director, the performance was 
not a gag, although the weapon turned out to be a harmless squirt gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "The woman seemed to be serious about her demands, but she probably had an 
emotional disorder," Schilling says. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential stickup and hijacking didn't put a damper on the fun for the 
estimated 7,000 large and small community members who turned out for the fourth 
annual circus event featuring acrobats, elephant acts, jugglers and clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe performing was the L.A. Circus, which is supported by the city of 
Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the event -- which Schilling says is not a fund-raiser but more of 
a thank-you to this community -- featured a clown workshop, a classic car show 
and a bike rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest laughs of the day came when a clown holding a big parcel 
tripped and fell down. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectacular though the dive was, it wasn't meant to be in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "While everyone in the audience was laughing and applauding, other members of 
the circus troupe were rushing to the clown's aid," Schilling says. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in this lifetime."

 Opening Up the Books 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity-rich Dove Audio Inc. -- one of the pioneers in the audio book field 
-- last week published its own books. They're unlikely to attract much 
readership, but nonetheless contain some eye-opening narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 A prospectus for an initial offering of 833,333 shares filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission shows the Beverly Hills firm has been an 
erratic performer. Documents say Dove earned $107,000 in 1993 and $1.2 million 
in 1992, but lost $2.3 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove also lost $357,000 in the first six months of 1994; most of its sales, 
however, occur in the latter part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospectus also shows Dove has experienced "significant negative cash 
flows" from time to time, which has been offset by equity and debt financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will continue to experience negative cash flow 
periodically as it expands its production and distribution facilities, but it 
added that money from the offering should meet its working capital requirements 
of the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove, which also produces TV movies and publishes printed books -- including a 
new biography of Nicole Brown Simpson -- is led by entertainment executive 
Michael Viner and his wife, actress Deborah Raffin. Dove directors include 
best-selling author Sidney Sheldon, who owns 20% of the company, and 
entertainment executive Freddie Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Viner and Raffin, the prospectus shows Dove owes them $2.16 million in 
the form of deferred compensation, loans and compensation for production and 
other services. Some $300,000 of the stock offering proceeds are earmarked for 
them. Ideal for Insomniacs 
</P>
<P>
 There're laws on the books. Now there're laws on the disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by public interest in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Arcata, 
Calif.-based software developer Grady Ward is selling a computerized version of 
the California Penal Code on a 3.5" diskette for $14.95, marketing it to people 
following the case who are not familiar with the state's laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward is advertising the diskette with an ad that reads "OJ?" and highlights 
some of the questions he feels people following the case may have, including, 
"When can a jury simply ignore the law?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ward says he's sold several hundred copies, mostly to people out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he is exploiting the case, Ward said: "That's certainly true. Even 
though I may be a charlatan, it is still a good, useful product that will last 
even beyond O.J." And No Hassle With Credits 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can study to be a mogul. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Extension is launching a $250 seven-week course centered on the career of 
Mike Medavoy, who was ousted by Sony Pictures earlier this year as head of its 
TriStar unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheaper -- but arguably more provocative -- course comes courtesy of the 
Learning Annex in the form of "An Evening With Robert Evans." 
</P>
<P>
 The producer of such films as "Chinatown" and "Sliver" recently chronicled his 
hedonistic life in an autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Medavoy course, the Evans seminar is only $39 and promises 
to cover "a life of high drama and wild times."

THE END OF A LIFE ON THE EDGE; YOUTH: ABEL SILVA WAS A BUDDING POLICE EXPLORER 
WITH A TALENT FOR ATHLETICS; HE WAS ALSO A GANG MEMBER WITH A RAP SHEET. IN THE 
WAKE OF HIS BEATING DEATH, SOME WHO SUPPORTED HIM REMAIN UNSURE WHERE HIS LIFE 
WAS REALLY HEADED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When news of Abel Silva's death reached the police officer who thought he had 
rescued the 17-year-old from the streets, his first thought was to ask: "How 
was the kid dressed?" 
</P>
<P>
 No answer would bring Abel back to life, but Officer Frank DiPaola had to know 
anyway: Was Abel "dressed down" -- in gang garb -- when he was chased and 
stabbed by a mob of youths along the beach in Malibu? Had he flashed gang 
signals at the young toughs? Had he in any way provoked the attack? 
</P>
<P>
 No, DiPaola was told by investigating detectives -- Abel Silva appeared to 
have been an innocent victim of a marauding gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved," DiPaola explained later. "If it was gang attire, we blew it. 
It would have spoiled everything" -- everything being the months he and another 
LAPD cop, Kevin Scroggins, had spent trying to turn Silva from a gangbanger 
into a helper, a soon-to-be member of the Police Explorers, complete with a 
spiffy blue uniform -- and no more gang tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel's tattoos were being removed in a series of laser treatments donated by a 
Beverly Hills dermatologist, who had questions of her own when she learned of 
his murder: Why hadn't they finished the job quicker? Why hadn't they blotted 
out the last telltale symbols of Los Angeles' largest gang, etched on the neck 
and hand of Abel when he was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may have been saved," a distraught Dr. Adrianna Scheibner theorized, "if 
the tattoos were all gone and he wouldn't have been recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel's parents also had a question, but a more simple one: Could he be buried 
in his Explorers uniform? 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that Abel was in law enforcement blue as he lay in an open coffin 
for the funeral in Hollywood. Then, as the parents took the body to Mexico for 
burial last week, Los Angeles police and Los Angeles County sheriff's 
detectives continued to search for the killers who not only snuffed out a life, 
but put a tragic end to a battle over a soul. 
</P>
<P>
 For that's what it had been, a tug of war over Abel Silva that pitted the 
powerful pull of the streets against . . . well, there were those cops, the 
doctor, his probation officer, his school. All pulling for the kid, hope 
against hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the gang members were winning the battle," Abel's probation officer 
said the other day, still depressed by a relapse near the end, when the 
teen-ager flaked out for a while, cutting classes again and missing meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Officer Scroggins, who recruited Silva into the Police Explorers, would 
have none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy," he said, "is that when a kid comes up and says, 'I want to be 
a part of your group,' then we have won his soul. He's thought about it and 
decided he wanted to change. In that sense, we won. We showed him six months of 
the other side of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kid  
</P>
<P>
 The first record of Abel Silva in Los Angeles dates to 1985, when he was 
enrolled in local schools. He was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents had moved the family from Guadalajara, and found the jobs awaiting 
immigrants: his mother ironing clothes for a Downtown Laundromat, his father as 
a janitor at a clothing factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders who got to know the family later would comment on how sad it was 
that such hard-working people saw their eldest son sucked into the local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th Street gang has been a force for decades, supplied first by 
generations of Mexican-American youths, then newcomers from Central America. 
Starting like most gangs in a concentrated area -- the neighborhoods south of 
Downtown -- 18th Street grew like none other in the 1980s and dispersed 
citywide until it claimed thousands of members. It became notorious for 
collecting "rent" from street vendors and shaking down drug dealers for a piece 
of their take. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel began running with the gang almost as soon as he hit his teen years, all 
but abandoning school and beginning a rap sheet. In August, 1993, he and three 
companions surrounded a man at a bus stop, took his hat and, when "he tried to 
get it back," one law enforcement official said, took his necklace, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abel was picked up last spring as a passenger in a stolen car, police 
decided the slender suspect, with a wisp of a mustache, might be a candidate 
for an experimental program for "at risk" youths. Despite his record, he seemed 
polite, almost shy, when confronted one-on-one. He also had a hobby outside 
gang life, boxing, and idolized the clean-cut Olympic champ Oscar de la Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was offered a chance to "work off" the offense at the LAPD's Central 
Division, performing community service such as graffiti removal and attending 
group counseling sessions in which officers try "tough love" to steer kids away 
from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Many refuse to participate, wanting nothing to do with the cops. But Silva 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked him why in April, he said, "My mom was crying too many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cops  
</P>
<P>
 At 45, Frank DiPaola has "done it all and seen it all" in 20 years with the 
LAPD, and does not pretend there is any easy answer to youth crime. "We get a 
lot of failures," he said of the Central Area Juvenile Impact Program, launched 
in 1990. "They don't all of a sudden become angels." 
</P>
<P>
 At a session witnessed by a reporter in April, DiPaola confronted a group that 
included Abel Silva, ordering one of the youths to take off a boot -- then 
snatching it away. "How does that make you feel?" he taunted the kid. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't subtle, but the point was made: How did his victims feel? 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a flip side to such confrontations. The youths are offered trips 
to museums or car shows or scenic areas, or classes in theater or dance. And 
near the end of the program, each group is visited by Scroggins, a 6-foot-3 
Marine lieutenant who joined the LAPD four years ago and now heads the 
40-member Explorer unit. He describes his program's opportunity to work as a 
police helper and even get five weeks training at the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the pitch is not subtle: Let this become your gang. Let cops become 
your homeboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to say to me, 'I want to do it,' " Scroggins said. "By them 
reaching out, I usually grab them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 136 youths put through DiPaola's program this year, only about five or six 
have raised their hands and been accepted into the Explorers. Abel was one. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the highest score on the physical fitness test given applicants, 96 out 
of 100, and whizzed around the obstacle course in 31 seconds -- far quicker 
than most regular police recruits. He was not scheduled to begin Academy 
classes until March, but was in preliminary training at the police station, 
with Saturday meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also got the uniform with a breast pocket patch that looks like a badge. 
"When he put on the uniform, he was so good-looking," said his sister Rose, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel would wear it while walking from their apartment to the station, showing 
new colors, so to speak. He began turning up evenings, asking to go on 
ride-alongs. "We couldn't get rid of him," DiPaola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they trusted him to answer phones at the station. They helped him enroll 
in an independent study schooling program. And, on weekends, Scroggins would 
take the Explorer recruits into the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked different details," Scroggins recalled. "The Hollywood Bowl, the 
L.A. Marathon . . . traffic control, security for Little Tokyo, Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
 The helpers were given flashlights and radios. On May 1, Abel used his to 
alert police officials when a Cinco de Mayo celebration on Broadway turned into 
a bottle-throwing melee and officers were surrounded -- by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got new gang members (in the program) who turned off to me," DiPaola 
said. "I'd say, 'Abel, go talk to this kid in Spanish and set his mind right.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The others had only to look at Abel to know he'd been one of them. Then 
DiPaola decided that if the kid was going to make a permanent turnaround, those 
tattoos would have to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doctor  
</P>
<P>
 In most of her practice, Scheibner is pure Beverly Hills. A dermatologist 
specializing in using lasers to remove blemishes, she spends much of her time 
eliminating scars left by face lifts and breast jobs. She also has written a 
book on inner and outer beauty, and has a line of skin products with an 800 
number reminding callers to "radiate the amber glow." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Czechoslovakia native "old enough to remember the lack of freedom" 
also treats, for free, those imprisoned not by a political system but "their 
own skin." Her Brave Hearts Foundation ("because they have to be brave to do 
this") sees about 100 gang members a month in Los Angeles, Orange or Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPaola brought Silva to her office over the summer to begin treatments to 
remove 18th Street markings on his neck and between his thumb and index finger 
where "every time you shake someone's hand, it's there," Scheibner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children put themselves in self-imposed prisons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It amazed her how they could be so destructive in groups, then, "when you look 
at them individually, they're like little birds with broken wings. They don't 
want to be stuck in the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel was a classic case, she said. "He had an air of peace about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Murder at the Beach  
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department took the 911 call just after midnight Oct. 4, 
reporting a commotion off Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide Detective John Gentzvein said Abel, a friend and two girls had come 
to Malibu to enjoy the beach, only to have eight or nine young men ("a couple 
of carloads of gangsters," Scroggins called them) approach with baseball bats 
and knives. 
</P>
<P>
 Any hint of Abel's 18th Street ties posed a danger because the gang is hated 
by others. But he knew enough, when asked where he was from, to say, "nowhere," 
DiPaola said. "If 10 people are surrounding you, no matter how macho or stupid, 
I don't think you're going to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 As witnesses described the scene, Abel suddenly ran and the group gave chase. 
The obstacle course champ fled across Pacific Coast Highway, dodging traffic, 
but was caught on a hill on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers had fled by the time squad cars arrived. Abel died as he reached 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigned to investigate, Gentzvein was surprised when LAPD guys started 
calling to check on his progress and offering help. The sheriff's detective 
soon realized "they have a personal interest." 
</P>
<P>
 DiPaola came in on a vacation day to help the family make final arrangements. 
He got crime victim restitution funds to pay for a coffin, then personally 
carried Abel's Explorer uniform to the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50 people at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church on Oct. 8 included other 
Explorers and eight LAPD police officers, in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police," DiPaola noted, "don't normally go to gang members' funerals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legacy  
</P>
<P>
 Though the cops wanted the public to know of Abel's short life, they worried 
about "the slant" any report would take. The message, DiPaola insisted, was 
"the positive thing the cops are doing" and how one kid went from gangs to 
goodness -- as if the story would be spoiled if each and every one of the 
elements did not meet the Hollywood ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, of course, they did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel's probation officer, Carolyn Pryor, was the first to hint that the battle 
for his soul was far from won. "A young man may say he wants to change," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had grown concerned over the summer when one of Abel's relatives was 
released from juvenile camp. Two weeks later, Abel showed up for his regular 
probation interview in baggy shorts and a belt embossed with a number: 18. 
Pryor did not need it spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dressed down," she said. "He also stopped going to school." 
</P>
<P>
 After Abel stopped showing up for meetings with her, Pryor visited the 
family's South-Central apartment -- and found them gone. Neighbors said there 
had been a drive-by shooting after the young relative moved back in. The Silvas 
had fled to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pryor knew what the cops were trying to do with Abel, but thought another tack 
might be wise now, to write up a probation violation and "get Abel back in 
custody, so he could be gotten off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who had all but adopted the teen-ager later acknowledged that 
they too had not seen him for the last month. Scroggins had also paid a call to 
his home, looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was the kid 99.99% pure? No," DiPaola said. "He probably did go back and 
forth into the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he walked a fine line between two opposing worlds. One day, he walked 
into their territory, the next he walked into ours." 
</P>
<P>
 DiPaola worried that he could have done more. "If the kid could have moved in 
with (us) a couple of months. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So on which side was Abel at the end? 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to say for sure. But officials at Hollywood High School 
reported that he had begun attending classes there in September, a step up from 
the home-study program. And he told his sisters he was going to return to 
Explorer meetings the "next Saturday" -- the day that instead saw his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sad, huh? It goes on and on and on," said Hollywood High Principal Jeanne 
Hon. "Breaks your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Her heart went out not only to the boy, but to those who had tried to help him 
-- and who perhaps were too hard on themselves now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you think you have failed, but you're the 18th person who has 
talked with a kid. It may be that it's the 23rd person who really gets to him," 
Hon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back. He was trying," she said of Abel. "Maybe he just didn't live 
long enough to turn."

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS: A BANG-UP JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was physics that sent the physics professor spinning and his car insurance 
soaring. Those were the equal and opposite reactions to his action of blowing a 
red light and knocking his Toyota head-on into a Geo. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sgt. Ben Lee pulled up seconds later, the professor was dabbing the blood 
on his chin. His battered car still sat askew amid bits of shattered glass and 
plastic, its malfunctioning alarm still squealing. 
</P>
<P>
 As an accident investigator for the Los Angeles Police Department, Lee spends 
his afternoons and evenings at scenes like this. 
</P>
<P>
 By carefully measuring skid marks and picking through busted-up hulks, Lee and 
his officers can piece together a chain of events that unfold over fractions of 
a second. 
</P>
<P>
 In serious accidents, they are homicide detectives, tracking down hit-and-run 
drivers and collaring drunks. In simple fender-benders, they are mediators, 
making sure drivers swap insurance information. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often a technical job that is decidedly unglamorous. No one ever thanks 
them for a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they are the officers the average person is most likely to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will spend an estimated $800 million this year on anti-theft devices 
for their cars, such as alarms and steering wheel locks, according to the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau. But most will spend little time and almost no 
money improving their driving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the average person is more likely to die in a traffic accident than 
at the hands of a carjacker. And even minor collisions can cost thousands by 
the time repair bills and insurance hikes are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp accident investigator can piece together a simple crash like the 
professor's in a few minutes. Complicated collisions involving several vehicles 
or a fatality can take several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When a driver bolts, the investigation gets trickier. Detective Bob Uber said 
investigating traffic deaths can be more difficult than solving a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Murders usually have motives. Traffic accidents are random. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a bullet," said Uber, who investigates accidents that involve 
crimes such as hit-and-run or drunk driving. What they do have is evidence such 
as tire marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tires leave different skid patterns as they do different things. With the 
length of a skid, an investigator can determine how fast a car was traveling. 
Flat skids generally indicate a driver trying to stop by slamming on the 
brakes. Acceleration skids often leave heavier traces of rubber on the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 At a collision in Pacoima, Officer John Teetor traced skid marks on the 
pavement, pointing out different events as revealed by the tracks: Braking 
began here, impact occurred there, the car got pushed sideways to here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably where his axle broke," Teetor said, pointing to a wobble in 
an otherwise straight skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Other techniques are more conventional. In serious accidents, investigators 
comb through cars for clothing fibers or fingerprints or anything to connect a 
driver to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In simple collisions, the routine is simple. Officers check if drivers were 
wearing seat belts. On one Mustang, when Teetor and Lee clasped the belt 
together, only an inch or two was left between the buckle and the seat back, 
indicating it had not been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have to be pretty skinny to be wearing that belt," Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping out of his black-and-white at the corner of Saticoy Street and Variel 
Avenue in Canoga Park, Lee's first order of business is to make sure no one is 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The professor's jaw is covered with cuts caused by the inflation of his car's 
air bag, so Lee calls an ambulance. The other driver, a 17-year-old with no 
license and no insurance, is uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Uninsured motorists are a problem. Lee estimates as many as 40% of drivers in 
Los Angeles are uninsured. Many who forsake insurance also neglect to register 
their cars or to get a license. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have nothing to lose," Lee says. "But you better believe that if you hit 
them, they will somehow find a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 As he waits for the ambulance to arrive, Lee climbs into the front seat of the 
professor's still-squawking Toyota and nudges it out of rush-hour traffic. The 
front axle is broken so the few feet to the curb is as far as the car will go. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness tells Lee that the professor blew through the red light at Saticoy 
just as the teen-ager was starting a left turn onto Variel. The professor says 
he was on his way to class when the light changed yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance arrives and two paramedics examine the professor's jaw, 
peppering him with questions about age, height, weight, date of birth. "Hey," 
one of the paramedics says cheerfully, "you got a birthday coming up. An early 
happy birthday to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The professor smiles faintly and mumbles something about his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to be a little late," the cheerful paramedic says, 
wrapping up the exam. The professor's injuries are restricted to the minor 
cuts, not a more serious injury as Lee had feared. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ambulance pulls away, the tow truck arrives. The driver quickly hooks 
up the professor's Toyota and offers him a ride to the garage, where he can use 
the phone to call for a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after the crash, the street is clear again and traffic is moving 
swiftly. Lee's job is over.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW : HELMS MAN ALWAYS DELIVERED THE GOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back when Los Angeles' new neighborhoods really did look like a TV sitcom set, 
housewives who really did wear shirtwaist dresses listened daily for the 
two-note whistle of the Helms man, who meandered the streets in a bright yellow 
and blue truck. 
</P>
<P>
 For 38 years, the whistle announced the arrival of the more than 300 trucks 
that crisscrossed Los Angeles, delivering cream puffs, jelly doughnuts, breads 
and cakes to thousands of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some housewives placed a large cardboard "H" in their windows as a sign to the 
Helms man -- uniformed in tan pants, white shirt and blue bow tie -- to come to 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But what began in the Great Depression ended in the convenience-first era of 
postwar America. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, when the Culver City-based Helms Bakery ended home delivery, Paul H. 
Helms Jr., the founder's son, said the business had fallen victim to "the 
irreversible reality" of modern supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 But at its height in the 1950s, the Helms firm operated 950 sales routes 
between Fresno and San Diego. It offered 150 bakery items and employed 1,850 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The father of all these calories was Paul Hoy Helms. His father was a 
Methodist minister and his mother a schoolteacher who died in childbirth. He 
was shuffled among eight uncles. One would have a great impact on the boy's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Helms developed a passion for baseball, in great part from living 
with his favorite uncle, William (Dummy) Hoy, a center fielder for the 
Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both aunt and uncle were deaf-mutes, but William Hoy overcame that to become a 
pro ballplayer. He is credited with getting umpires to use hand signals to call 
balls and strikes because he couldn't hear them speak. Helms later said he 
learned not only sign language but compassion, and in later years hired more 
than threescore deaf-mutes as bakery employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1912, Helms began selling life insurance in Pennsylvania, where he met and 
married Pearl Ellis. Two years later, the newlyweds moved to New York, where 
Helms built up a small bakery from one route to 200. 
</P>
<P>
 But poor health forced him to retire at age 37 in 1926. Two years later, he 
moved his family to Los Angeles, where "within a few months, I was itching to 
get back to work." Helms figured this would be a good time to start a business, 
because people were eager to work. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15, 1931, Helms Bakery opened at Venice and Washington boulevards, 
with 32 employees and 11 trucks. Until his death, Helms remembered the first 
name of each employee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, he won the contract to supply bread to Olympic athletes here. For 
more than 20 years, Helms capitalized on the association by putting "Official 
Bread of Olympic Champions" on his wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after the Olympics, Helms agreed to showcase sports memorabilia and 
archives. In 1948 he expanded the bakery, making room for Helms Hall, where the 
Helms Athletic Foundation (now the Amateur Athletic Foundation) operated for 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lacked a business background, Helms possessed promotional flair. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, he came up with a catchy new radio jingle that school 
kids soon were singing: 
</P>
<P>
 "Toot! Toot! Here comes the Helms man,  
</P>
<P>
 Toot! Toot! Right to your door.  
</P>
<P>
 With Olympic bread and pastries,  
</P>
<P>
 Coffee cake and other tasties.  
</P>
<P>
 Toot! Here comes your Helms man now.  
</P>
<P>
 Save a trip to the store, just walk to your door. Toot!"  
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1950s, Helms bakeries were turning out more than a million loaves 
of bread a day and delivering about 150 custom-made wedding and birthday cakes 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helms, who also took part in civic matters and charities, died in 1957 at age 
67. His son, Paul Hoy Helms Jr., took over the business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heyday was past.  
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1969, the company began an aggressive marketing campaign. Helms' 
bread rocketed to the moon aboard the Apollo 11 capsule. Its bread wrappers now 
read: "First Bread on the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't enough. Supermarkets were too close, home delivery too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after its bread went literally out of this world, the bakery 
turned off its ovens. 
</P>
<P>
 The old bakery building will soon house a furniture store, with no food -- and 
especially no jelly doughnuts -- allowed inside. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

PARTING THE WATERS; SHE BRAVED THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AND BERING STRAIT. NOW LYNNE 
COX SWIMS FOR A WORLD WITHOUT WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HOWLETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynne Cox begins her final miles of training in U.S. waters by facing the 
shore and crashing backward into the surf. She is going against the current 
again, and she does it with a childlike grin visible from across the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars watching her from the Seal Beach Pier wave at the swimmer who, in 
22 years of setting international endurance records, has become something of a 
hometown hero in neighboring Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, she shattered the women's and men's world records for swimming the 
English Channel. She went on to become the only person to brave 40-degree water 
and swim Russia's Bering Strait, and she wrote history by stroking across the 
Beagle Channel between Argentina and Chile, the Spree River between former East 
and West Berlin, the shark-infested waters of the Cape of Good Hope, and 
Siberia's Lake Baikal -- the world's deepest and coldest freshwater lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Cox and her half a dozen crew members are in Israel, where, after a 
six-year quest, she is scheduled to attempt a 14-mile crossing of the Gulf of 
Aqaba, a symbolic "peace swim" in waters linking Israel, Egypt and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it's going to take to get into Jordanian waters," she says 
after ripping off blue goggles worn for the three-mile training swim. "It 
always comes down to the last minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But after all of the work, it's always great to finally get into the water. 
It's like being an artist. You've put out all the paint, and you've gotten 
everything ready, and you can finally pick up the brush." 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly articulate, Cox comes off as an interesting blend of political 
intellect and athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 She has thrown out the many medals and trophies collected over years of 
competitive swimming. She still lives with her parents, teaches swimming, 
lectures and does some writing. She is not the kind of American athlete who 
shills for running shoes or breakfast cereal. All she wants, she says with a 
bashful smile, is a world without war. 
</P>
<P>
 On this swim, she sees a special irony in the fact that she will be stroking 
all 14 miles of the two-day effort against the current. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if I wanted to change my course and swim the other way," says 
Cox, 37, who scheduled the event to celebrate the Camp David accords and the 
ongoing peace effort between Jordan and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "But against the current really describes the whole thing," she says, "and the 
whole peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just three years after Albert Cox, a radiologist, and his wife, Estelle, an 
artist, moved Lynne and her swimming siblings to Southern California from New 
Hampshire in 1970, she made her mark by swimming the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were a stable influence of encouragement," says Cox, whose brother 
David, 39, runs a recreation department. Sister Laura, 35, is a geneticist who 
coaches swimming, and Ruth, 32, coaches water polo and teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that they used to give us swimming lessons in the bathtub when we 
were really little," she says. "We started competing (in New Hampshire), but 
all of the good coaches were in California, so they moved us out here." 
</P>
<P>
 It was after the English Channel swim that Cox became intensely interested in 
the world around her. By her late teens, she was focusing on global peace 
efforts, not trophies and medals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember exactly why I threw (the trophies) out," she says. "We 
used to have them displayed all over the place, but I was done with that. They 
went into a box, and then in the trash. I don't swim for that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 As a history major at UC Santa Barbara, she learned about the give-and-take in 
attaining and maintaining peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the idea that a little compromise on both sides can build a bridge, and 
by allowing me to swim, they're all doing that," she says of her various host 
countries. "It takes a good many years to build a bridge and just seconds to 
blow it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents find it difficult to understand her drive and motivation. They 
just watch in awe as she pieces together each history-making swim, they say, 
and then fret about her. The Gulf of Aqaba swim is particularly worrisome, 
given Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's latest military maneuvering and the 
mobilization of U.S. troops to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about her safety because it's a very volatile part of the world 
today, with a lot of out-of-control people," her father says. "But we just keep 
our fingers crossed and hope everything goes smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's parents have other concerns, including their daughter's personal and 
financial future. Although she works once a week at Beach Physical Therapy in 
Seal Beach, delivers lectures to corporate executives, gives swimming lessons 
and picks up some free-lance writing assignments, her income is modest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for us to understand why she does this and why she keeps doing 
this," Albert Cox says. "Lynne is going to do what she feels she has to do. We 
don't push her; we just assist her." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is undecided about her future. And she hasn't had time to settle into a 
long-term relationship, she says. Marriage and children will come "maybe 
someday." When asked how long she intends to pursue her historic swims, she 
gets mildly defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that anyone's ever said that I'm too old to be doing this. 
You're old when you're old," she says. "Why should you be limited by someone 
else's expectations?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic as they may seem, Lynne Cox's swims have indeed led to political 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 When the borders were closed in 1948, Eskimo families from America's Little 
Diomede Island and the Soviet Union's Big Diomede Island were restricted from 
seeing one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months after Cox crossed the 2.7-mile Bering Strait in 1987, the 
gates were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The borders were open to them, and they were allowed to move and talk to each 
other, and to see what had happened to their families after (so many) years," 
Cox says. "That makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 She was toasted at the White House by then-President Ronald Reagan and 
then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the opening paragraph of Gorbachev's speech, he referred to Lynne by 
name," recalls friend and longtime supporter Barry Binder. "That was something 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day he met Cox at one of her speaking functions six years ago, 
Binder and his wife, Betty, have backed Cox's idealistic efforts. Working out 
of Binder's Los Alamitos Boulevard real-estate office, Cox calls and faxes the 
officials who must grant permission for her missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I first noticed was her enthusiasm, her spark and her willingness to do 
something different," Binder says. "She's very focused on what she does and has 
an air of innocence about her. When she's around, it helps people to keep 
things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Binder joined Cox and her support team two years ago for her swim across Lake 
Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake, in the Andes. It would leave Cox 
with mysterious, quarter-size welts -- bites from "some sort of organism" in 
the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know what bit me, but they sure itched," she says. "I never saw 
anything in the water; that's what was so perplexing." 
</P>
<P>
 People seem to be drawn to Cox, and not because of her record in the water. 
Surfers, beachcombers, parking attendants -- even the agents in Binder's office 
-- act as if she is their longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Her crew consists of Binder, as well as a Newport Beach physician, a pilot, a 
Los Angeles dress-designer friend and a shipbuilding couple from Northern 
California who maintain the tracking boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Lynne sees a limit to what she's doing in the next five or 10 
years. She sure has the ability to do other swims," Binder says. "It helps 
Lynne to have someone to talk to, someone who supports what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after slicing through the 65-degree ocean, Cox is home, packing meat 
tenderizer to treat potential jellyfish stings, drafting a letter to the mayor 
of Eilat, Israel, and cheerfully talking about the brightly colored swimsuit 
she plans to wear in the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 She's had her typhoid and gamma globulin shots and is bringing "major amounts 
of sunscreen." She will wait to decide if she will wear a swim cap, fearing it 
might retain too much heat with the 80-degree water and 100-degree air 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone involved in the swim -- which goes from Taba, Egypt, to Eliat, 
Israel, and then on to Aqaba, Jordan -- says that getting Cox permission to 
navigate Jordanian waters became a furious, fax-driven endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day before she left with her crew on Oct. 9, all the clearances were 
in place: a blessing from Jordan's Queen Noor; approval from Reuma Weizman, 
wife of Israeli President Ezer Weizman, and the nod from Ahmed Maher El Sayed, 
Egyptian ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult process, and you have to make sure you do everything right, 
down to the wording in each letter," Cox says. "One wrong word could cancel the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox rubs her eyes and thinks for a moment, never putting down her 
all-important address book. Then, changing the subject, she talks about the 
gulf as if it were a vacation destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "On hot, sweltering days, the heat creates this sort of distorted haze over 
the water, and on a clear day, you can see both countries from both sides. It's 
supposed to be spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox looks at the time, apologizes, and excuses herself to make a call to 
friend Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to Russia and an ardent supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to call him by a certain time, and it's so hard to get these time 
differences straight," she says with a childlike giggle. "You would think I 
would know by now." 
</P>

THE LATEST HOLLYWOOD TREND? HIGH FIDELITY; RELATIONSHIPS: AN EPIDEMIC OF 
MONOGAMY IS LOOSE IN THE LAND AND TINSELTOWN IS LEADING THE WAY. IS IT TRUE 
LOVE? SAFE SEX? NO, IT'S JUST THAT WARREN BEATTY'S GETTING SO OLD.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA T. ROESSNER, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shocking truth is out. Warren Beatty, that human monument to perpetual 
promiscuity, has acknowledged to the world and Connie Chung (and Vanity Fair, 
and USA Today, and a dozen other media outlets) that he is monogamous. 
</P>
<P>
 And surprise, surprise, according to an exhaustive new study by the University 
of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, so are the great majority of the 
rest of us married mortals. Seventy-five percent of married men say they're 
sexually faithful to their spouses, as do 85% of married women. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, an epidemic of marital fidelity is loose in the land, all the way 
from Hollywood (fantasy) to Hoboken (reality). What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious explanation is that there has always been a huge gap between 
Hollywood and Hoboken, N.J., but social researchers just never bothered to 
identify it before. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, all the big sex surveys over the past several decades (by Masters & 
Johnson, and Shere Hite, for example) have based their findings on people who 
sought to be guinea pigs. This latest survey is the first to use a random 
sample of average folks who might not consider their sex lives interesting 
enough to volunteer them for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also have something to do with the current 50% divorce rate. These 
days, if a husband and wife aren't happy, they split up rather than stay 
together and play around on the side. The married couples who are still married 
may actually lust to remain hitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it may be, as various sociologists contend, that some kind of 
post-sexual-revolution backlash is under way, spurred by a widespread fear of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warren may provide the best explanation. Warren and his liver spots. 
Warren and his bloated physique. Warren and his 57 years. The most striking 
thing about the Connie Chung interview was Warren's visible aging. No wonder 
he's settled down. He looks like hell now. He looks even worse when juxtaposed 
with his lithe, creamy-skinned, 36-year-old wife with the little-girl mouth and 
the pixie hairdo. One can only conclude that even men have their biological 
clocks, and Warren heard his ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 As he told an interviewer for USA Today: Family "keeps you from spinning out 
narcissistically into space." In other words, even Warren, who just had his 
second child with Annette Bening, felt the need to connect. 
</P>
<P>
 They say fidelity does not come naturally to the human species. Well, maybe 
not -- unless and until the species instinctively fears it may die out.

COMMITMENTS: MODERN LOVE; ON-LINE ROMANCES CAN LINK KINDRED SOULS THROUGH 
HEARTFELT WORDS, SAYS AUTHOR AVODAH OFFIT. BUT BEWARE OF GREAT PRETENDERS 
SURFING CYBERSPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Virtual Love," sex therapist Dr. Avodah Offit's novel of E-mail erotica, 
two psychiatrists kindle a transcon tinental cyberromance via computer 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc, on the West Coast, seeks professional guidance from Aphra, an older 
colleague in New York. Discussing Marc's feelings and treatment of a patient he 
is drawn to, the two gradually reveal more and more about themselves -- and 
begin to fall in love in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better you're on-line, you're in print, you hardly have a body anymore," 
messages Marc to Aphra. (Unlike many on-line lovers, these two have actually 
met -- once.) "i still remember your body, though the memory is fading . . . i 
remember the frailness of your wrists and ankles, the adolescent chest, the 
whiteness of your skin under black hair. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel was inspired after Offit, an NYU School of Medicine graduate who 
explored human connections in her nonfiction works "The Sexual Self" 
(Lippincott, 1977) and "Night Thoughts: Reflections of a Sex Therapist" 
(Congdon & Weed, 1981), spent time exploring software given to her by one of 
the originators of America Online in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an E-mail correspondence, communicating every two to three weeks," she 
says. "He was so bright, so entertaining, so intellectually stimulating. That's 
what stimulated me to work on a novel in this form." 
</P>
<P>
 She felt freed to write the novel by what she calls the "talk writing" of 
E-mail, which is a nice pace "between conversation and written words." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Virtual Love" has a postmodern edge, Offit says its roots are in 
literature such as Samuel Richardson's novels of the mid 1700s, which were 
written as exchanged letters. Written correspondence has been recharged by 
E-mail, she says. She believes her novel may help bring on-line relationships 
"out of the computer." 
</P>
<P>
 In her role as sex therapist, Offit has counseled patients on their E-mail 
relationships. She said cyberlove has some definite advantages over the 
real-world version -- as well as potential problems, such as deception and 
unrealistic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in "Virtual Love" the two characters transfer physical and 
psychological traits onto each other more freely than they could in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love at first sight has a different significance in the era of cybersex. 
You've met each other's minds, now you see each other's faces and a lot more 
besides. What are the odds that it will be love at first touch?" she asks. "I 
know one couple who got along well on-line, but got together and were 
completely incompatible." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet overall Offit finds E-mail a positive movement in linking kindred souls, 
whether romantically or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great virtues of virtuality is that it brings out the best, most 
heartfelt, most verbal of people's selves," she says. "I think as many 
friendships are forged in the keystroke community as lovers are linked. 
Intimacy is the new goal, one that many are trying to achieve as they travel 
the intense and heated paths of the emotional superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 Offit, formerly director of the Sexual Treatment Center at Lenox Hill Hospital 
in New York, is also clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Cornell 
University Medical College. She has been married to Sidney Offit for 42 years, 
and they have two adult sons. 
</P>
<P>
 In phone and E-mail interviews, Offit offered thoughts on the medium's 
development as a literary tool, as well as the expanding role of cyberspace as 
a backdrop for relationship development. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What are the virtues of E-mail communication? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is a human need to connect, to reach out. It's an intimate 
written correspondence and a form of literature. People love it because they're 
so hungry to be creative. E-mail encourages creativity and spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 I think too much is made of the phenomenon of cyberlove and cybersex as 
important only as the means for the unmet to meet or the unseen to perform 
their verbal antics. Cyberspace is very useful sexually and emotionally for 
people who know each other, who may want to have cybersex as part of their 
committed relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Cybersex is anything cyber writers want it to be . . . loving, explicit, 
X-rated, fantasy coupled . . . with or without self-stimulation during the act. 
It has gotten to be quite an art. I know a couple who write to each other from 
different rooms in the same house because they find it an erotic means of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the immediacy of E-mail contribute to its popularity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. You have instant access to someone's mind. E-mail is an intense, 
immediate connection. And that intensity and immediacy magnify whatever you're 
doing. Although E-mail content may not be erotic, there is an erotic quality to 
it because of the magnification. When you get a message, it's like getting a 
message from God. But you have to be careful with that. The magnification 
element can be wonderful when you receive a compliment. But if the comment is 
nasty, it can hurt you -- more than if it was said to you as a remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is flirting on-line so titillating? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can turn the (computer) off at any time. You feel totally safe. You can 
say dirty words. You can do everything you wanted to do when you were 12 years 
old and were forbidden to do anything. You can be as passive, aggressive, 
stupid or bright as you please. No one knows. No one cares.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is it easier to develop a relationship on-line? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In life it takes a rather long time to fall in and out of love. On E-mail 
it can happen before you realize it has happened and be over before you've 
become accustomed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Love develops more quickly in this fashion than it does when you can see a 
person, be with a person. Ecstasy is rather an act of imagination. As Freud 
said, "Falling in love requires frustration," and what frustration is greater 
than being able only to connect with a keyboard of absurdly placed letters? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is cybersex the ultimate safe sex? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Cybersex is better than single sex, I've heard tell, because it's the most 
fun you can have with your pants on. It's also the most fun you can have no 
matter what you look like. You don't have to dress for it. And most of all, 
it's safe. You can acquire absolutely no infectious disease from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the pros and cons of developing a relationship on-line? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The pros far outweigh the cons. Literacy compatibility is something we 
didn't think much about before cyberspace. A handsome letter may be just as 
important to being able to get along in this day and age as a great face or 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 The negatives include addiction; incredible expense if indulged carelessly; 
being deceived, being hurt, dropped or diminished; being insulted . . . 
anything that can go wrong will go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it easier to be more open, as well as easier to lie or misrepresent 
yourself, through E-mail? What are the dangers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's certainly easy to be more open -- there's a sense of anonymity. The 
written word is less threatening than the spoken one. I think it's the writing 
that makes people more open. We are used to seeing the unspeakable in print. 
Most talk is extremely limited. A study once showed that husbands and wives 
talked to each other 25 minutes a week. People have finally discovered that 
they can communicate in words without necessarily writing books. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying is all too easy -- that's my one quarrel with E-mail. I have a patient 
who seemed to have a wonderful relationship on E-mail, but detected a (minor) 
lie and broke up because of it. I heard of one man who had four women going 
on-line and had it set up to marry all of them. One woman detected something 
that bothered her and put a message out on a bulletin board and found the other 
women. People can have multiple identities; you can be taken in entirely by the 
identity of a person. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the proportion of men in cyberspace is said greatly to exceed that of 
women, a game men like to play is to change sexes, to write as women. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you recommend to people who meet on-line and want to take it a 
step further? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say get to know them, face to face, person to person, as soon as 
you can. People can be very different from their printed persona. There is the 
literary self, the vocal self and the visual self, and they are often out of 
sync. It's best not to invest yourself until you see all three.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; TREASURES FOUND IN A LIFETIME OF FRIENDSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEA MAXWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of my favorite friendships started out as a voice on the telephone, a 
warm smile on the stairs or a quick "Hi!" in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes years went by before an inner voice spoke up, urging me to take the 
next step. Reaching out seemed risky, but when I did, I found friendships that 
seemed fated to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these friendships go back longer than I can remember. For five years, 
in some cases, my phone acquaintances and I would take care of business, then 
move on to our personal ups and downs, our adventures, even our attempts for 
growth in our lives. We shared much of ourselves and our experiences and became 
closer with each call . . . an often supportive kind of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally one of us would say, "Hey, enough! We've got to meet. Let's set a date 
now to meet face to face. I feel like you're an old friend." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it happened last Saturday. Francy and I agreed to meet for brunch in 
Old Town Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 How would we recognize each other? We both described ourselves as short, with 
short curly hair (with a few, ahem, gray strands). I offered to carry a sign 
with the letter B. But then our intuitive selves decided, "We'll know." 
</P>
<P>
 And we did. 
</P>
<P>
 Two smiling faces converged amid passersby. For hours we enjoyed each other's 
company -- book-browsing in Barnes & Noble, scanning the clothes in J. Crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Our farewell this time was a hug instead of the "Take care. Talk to you later. 
(Click.)" So much richer this exchange, so much more meaningful this reaching 
out and sharing face to face. This friendship will go on, we know. There is 
much we have in common . . . our experiences with life. 
</P>
<P>
 Like me, many of my friends, too, are shy. Often I feel as though I'm out on a 
limb, but still want to reach out to others, let them know, "Yeah, life is a 
bitch sometimes, but you know we can share and talk about life and laugh about 
it together. Swoosh it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Life, I believe, was not meant to be lived in a vacuum, no matter what has 
shadowed our paths prior to our arrival to today. We need to reach out to one 
another. Sometimes, yes, we are rebuffed, but more often we're rewarded. 
Nothing can take the place of a smile, kind words, a touch or a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Another treasured friendship began more than 10 years ago with a neighbor and 
I exchanging half-smiling nods as we passed in our back-alley parking 
structures in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 I had two tickets for a play, the eight-hour "Nicholas Nickleby," at the Music 
Center. None of my friends could imagine sitting through such an ordeal no 
matter how enjoyable the play or comfortable the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Not eager to go alone or waste the other ticket, I decided to try my nameless, 
smiling neighbor. Gently I knocked on her door, slightly afraid she might even 
hear me and label me a tad "ditsy." Footsteps within. Her blue eyes gazed 
through the peephole into my nervous brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi," I said. "My name is Bea and I've got two tickets for the 'Nicholas 
Nickleby' play and I wond. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Jo," she replied, opening the door. "And I'd love to. I've been trying to 
get tickets for that play." 
</P>
<P>
 We spent a lovely day enjoying the play, a picnic lunch on the balcony, the 
water fountain ballet and getting acquainted during the breaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten years have passed. I no longer live across from her, but our friendship 
grows ever deeper. We seem to know each other so well. Know when to respect 
each other's privacy and our needs for aloneness. An acceptance of the 
knowledge of who we are, our uniqueness and knowing we give to each other some 
little treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Audrey too. How long since our first "hi" at the educational film 
company where we both worked? No, it can't be -- 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When our kaffeeklatsch was salted by the tears of my divorce, she sweetened it 
with words of new doors opening that turned into a celebration of my getting my 
master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 We've grieved together over other personal sorrows and losses (although we've 
not yet celebrated the loss of weight for the two of us). We've laughed a lot 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 She and I are meeting Sunday for a movie. The time and place is set, but not 
the movie. All that matters is that we're getting together. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest will fall into place.

'SPECIALIST,' 'PULP' DUKE IT OUT OVER NO. 1 SPOT; BOX OFFICE: DISTRIBUTORS 
BATTLE OVER WEEKEND GROSS ESTIMATES FOR THE HEAVILY ADVERTISED FILMS. 'WES 
CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE' TAKES THIRD PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on whose version proves accurate, Quentin Tarantino's new film, 
"Pulp Fiction," starring John Travolta and Bruce Willis, was either the 
weekend's top-grossing film or the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Miramax, which released the film, was engaged in a 
my-gross-is-bigger-than-yours contest with Warner Bros. The latter distributor 
claimed its movie, "The Specialist," starring Sylvester Stallone, was 
outselling "Pulp Fiction" and was still No. 1 in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Most estimates had the Miramax release taking in $8.4 million to $8.6 million. 
But Miramax was claiming $9.16 million on 1,338 screens. The lower figures for 
"Pulp" supposedly didn't include 72 theaters, mostly in Canada, that Miramax 
had neglected to mention earlier. An oversight, said Bob Weinstein, who along 
with his brother Harvey, runs Miramax. 
</P>
<P>
 That led Warner distribution chief Barry Reardon to respond, "Give me a break" 
and to increase his "official" $8.9-million estimate for "The Specialist" to an 
unofficial $9.3 million to $9.4 million. Weekend figures released Sunday are 
imprecise estimates made while box offices are still open, but are based on 
typical ticket-sale patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 John Krier of Exhibitor Relations, Inc., a firm that tracks box-office 
performance, expressed skepticism about Miramax's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinstein stood firm, saying, "Anybody is welcome to come in here and 
check it out if they like."  
</P>
<P>
 What is beyond dispute is that Miramax and Warner Bros. both advertised 
heavily to attract weekend audiences. Miramax competitors are claiming that the 
company spent well in excess of the $5 million reported to open the film. "In 
that ballpark" was as specific as Weinstein was willing to get. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the final gross, the Tarantino film's debut was notable in that 
it indicated break-out potential for the $8-million production. According to 
industry sources, "Pulp" performed well in all markets save for small cities. 
However, business was up only 27% from Friday to Saturday (box-office grosses 
can rise as much as 50% on a second day) simply because most houses were sold 
out, Weinstein said. But one competitor said "Pulp" was flat from Friday to 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The true test will be whether the film has enough pulp to sustain by word of 
mouth after the costly opening-week ad blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with the more than palatable opening performance of another 
independently made film, New Line's "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" which grossed 
about $7.1 million on 1,850 screens (and finished in third place), the major 
studios got a little run for their box-office share over the past weekend. (The 
term "independent" is a loose one. Miramax is owned by Disney, New Line by Ted 
Turner). Considering that it's the seventh installment in the "Nightmare" 
series, that was a pretty good showing, said Mitch Goldman, New Line's 
president of marketing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, business for the weekend was no better and no worse than last year. 
Regardless of its box-office standing, "The Specialist" dropped more than 30% 
from its $14-million opening plateau with the added competition of "Pulp" and 
"Nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Other weekend openings were less notable. The kid comedy "Little Giants" 
wasn't gigantic with about $5.4 million on more than 2,000 screens. Savoy 
Pictures' "Exit to Eden" was out the door with little more than $3 million in 
1,670 theaters. The likable "I Like It Like That" surfaced in 55 theaters with 
little hoopla (but some decent reviews). It was not enough to lift it past 
$250,000. The new version of "The Browning Version" played old with only 
$44,000 on 12 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the returning films, "The River Wild" drew $5.5 million in its third 
weekend. "Only You" got in an acceptable second weekend of $4.3 million and has 
grossed almost $12 million in 10 days.  
</P>
<P>
 And the indomitable "Forrest Gump" just keeps rollin' along. The year's 
top-grossing film should also be one of the best fall performers with $3.3 
million over the weekend for seventh place and $280 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth was "The Shawshank Redemption" with $2.5 million, and 10th was "Quiz 
Show" with $2.3 million.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; DON'T BLAME FOX TV FOR TRYING TO REACH OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson last month publicly excoriated television for its lack 
of cultural diversity, threatening the networks with viewer boycotts if they 
did not end their "institutional racism." Uh, did he say boycotts? 
</P>
<P>
 Although most minority group leaders have difficulty denting television's 
thick corporate curtain, Jackson's rhetoric appears to have a penetrating 
resonance. Especially when he deploys the feared "B" word, warning of punitive 
measures to be organized by the newly formed Rainbow Coalition Commission on 
Fairness in the Media. And especially when his words are followed up by a 
personal chat. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, is Jackson the super-hero who came to the rescue of 
"M.A.N.T.I.S."? 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Fox announced it was ordering nine additional episodes of 
"M.A.N.T.I.S.," its new black super-hero series whose ratings are a tiny blip 
near the bottom of prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came only three days after Jackson had met privately with Fox 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fox spokesman denied Friday that pressure from Jackson influenced its 
decision to keep "M.A.N.T.I.S.," which earlier had been faulted in some circles 
for cutting back on its black characters after the airing of its pilot. Despite 
overall dismal ratings, "M.A.N.T.I.S." has still outdrawn its Friday night 
competitors in male viewers, Fox insisted, and that demographic oddity was its 
reason for commissioning more episodes. "Creatively, this is a show the network 
believes in," a Fox spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the proximity of Jackson's meeting with Fox is a striking coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd get the impression from all of this that Fox is the network most 
responsible for barring black programs from prime time. In fact, just the 
opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it wasn't CBS that Jackson and other black leaders -- including the 
Congressional Black Caucus -- had earlier jumped on for dropping four series 
with predominantly black casts after last season. You can't cancel what you 
don't have, and CBS had no African American series (excluding "In the Heat of 
the Night," a drama with a black co-star). It still doesn't have any, although 
one is scheduled to be created for possible debut in early 1995, and the 
network says it has other black series in development. At the moment, the 
closest thing to a prime-time black star on CBS is Ed Bradley of "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It also wasn't NBC that Jackson and the others slammed for those black-series 
cancellations. It had only one black series last season (not counting "Getting 
By," whose co-star was black). With this season's addition of "The Cosby 
Mysteries," NBC now has two (excluding the new "Sweet Justice," whose black 
co-protagonist exists mostly amid whites). 
</P>
<P>
 It also wasn't ABC, which last season had three series with predominantly 
black casts. It still does, after replacing two it canceled with another pair 
of black comedies, one of them ("On Our Own") with ratings so low that death 
appears unavoidable (barring a visit to ABC from Jackson). 
</P>
<P>
 No, although other networks have also felt the sting of his criticism, the 
network that Jackson singled out for its cancellations was Fox, the network 
that has gone out of its way to design programs attractive to African American 
viewers. Fox began last season with six black series (plus the since-canceled 
"Bakersfield, P.D.," whose central character was black). After dropping four 
because of low ratings, Fox is left with two -- "Martin" and "Living Single" -- 
plus a couple of series with black co-stars in "New York Undercover" and 
"M.A.N.T.I.S." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony -- and injustice -- of Fox being criticized in this instance is that 
the only reason it was able to cancel so many black series was that it had them 
in the first place -- including the risk-taking "South Central," a series that 
CBS developed but decided not to air. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicable baseball analogy is a wide-ranging fielder who gets an error 
for bobbling a ball that lesser fielders would not even have reached. Hence, 
they get no errors. 
</P>
<P>
 It's curious that a network gets good P.R. for putting on black shows, bad 
P.R. for removing them -- as if their racial makeup alone should guarantee them 
immortality, even though every series ultimately leaves the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, quantity should be less an issue here than the character and texture 
of black series, with none of the present group being dramas that deploy 
African Americans in the kind of conventional family settings in which whites 
are routinely depicted. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly headline news. One of TV's biggest disgraces is that white 
programmers rarely extend the airwaves to black drama series and -- apparently 
because no one as persuasive as Jackson has lobbied TV specifically on behalf 
of other minority populations -- even less rarely to Latino or Asian series of 
any stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans are currently represented only in ABC's "All American Girl"; 
the situation with regard to Latinos may improve, at least in terms of comedy, 
with the arrival later this season of "House of Buggin'," a Fox series being 
touted as a sort of Latino "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, CBS and Fox say they are developing comedies and dramas with 
predominantly African American or Latino casts. The road from development to 
actual production is full of potholes, however, and few such ventures ever 
become series. A better bet is "Under One Roof," a worthy black family drama 
that has received a six-episode order from CBS with a possible premiere date in 
March, according to executive producer Thomas Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter is also creating a two-hour pilot for "Divas," a possible black drama 
series for Fox. "Divas" traces the activities of four African American 
entertainers and their manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it does get on the air, and is subsequently canceled because of low 
ratings, Fox may get an earful from Jesse Jackson.

THIS IS 'LIKE WATER' FOR REAL; MOVIES: THOSE LOVE SCENES WERE MORE THAN ACTING 
IN HIT MEXICAN FILM. THE TWO STARS FOUND ROMANCE AND NOW SHARE A SMALL FLAT IN 
HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG BARRIOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Audiences adored Alfonso Arau's luscious 1992 "Like Water for Chocolate" and 
its heady mix of star-crossed lovers, Mexican Revolution and sensual 
celebration of food.  
</P>
<P>
 But even though it grossed an amazing $22 million in the United States alone 
and became the highest-grossing independently produced foreign film of all 
time, there isn't likely to be a "Like Water 2" any time soon. And that's 
because its stars, Lumi Cavazos and Marco Leonardi, are busy living a real-life 
love story as compelling as anything they created on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the couple, who met and fell in love in 1991 on the set of "Like 
Water," have left their native Mexico and Italy, respectively, and now live 
together in a sparse Hollywood apartment with Ben-Hur, their docile pit 
bulldog, and, appropriately, two lovebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like it here for now," Cavazos says, standing on the small balcony crowded 
by a bird cage and dog house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here because I wanted to be with Marco and he wanted to be with me," 
she continues, walking back inside the apartment. "I've been to Marco's home in 
Italy and he's been to mine in Mexico. However, we'd both prefer to try our 
luck here, now that our film is still fresh in people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, we were friends, and the next, we were in love," says Leonardi, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our romance didn't affect our performance in the film," adds Cavazos, 25, 
"but the chemistry between us made our love scenes much better." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cavazos and Leonardi's real-life sequel, a few things have changed. For one 
thing, they have plunged into an intensive study of English. "In order to get 
roles and see agents, we have to know the language," Cavazos says. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met on the set of their film, Leonardi says, he spoke only Italian 
and she only Spanish. On a recent night out on Melrose Avenue, the couple 
ordered a meal in Italian, spoke to fans on the street in English and posed for 
pictures with Spanish-speaking tourists. At home, they generally speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's another difference since "Like Water for Chocolate": He does the 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never learned to cook as well as Marcos does," Cavazos says as Leonardi 
prepares a pasta dish for lunch. "It's never been my passion. My mom was right 
in telling me that I wouldn't learn cooking in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monterrey-born actress hadn't read Laura Esquivel's best-selling novel 
when she first interviewed for the role of Tita. "Afterward, I ran to a 
bookstore to get the novel," she says, "and read it several times to imbue 
myself in the character. I realized how much Tita was like me, coming from a 
conservative family and all."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardi shares his recipe for pasta carbonara with a guest and apologizes for 
the domestic wine. Then he makes a long-distance call to Italy to ask his 
mother in Rome for soccer scores. "I call every week. Football is another 
passion in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Leonardi had a chance to become a professional soccer player, 
but a starring part in "La Esposa es Bellissima" with Angela Molina and 
Stefania Sandrelli changed his life. His film credits also include Guiseppe 
Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso," winner of the 1989 Oscar for best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike Lumi's, my parents urged me to get into film," he says. "My father, 
who is a journalist, also worked as an movie extra. He got me into TV 
commercials when I was a kid. I was the youngest (of four siblings), but I 
never figured out why he never pushed me into show biz." 
</P>
<P>
 For Arau, Leonardi was heaven-sent.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Marco is an amulet, a lucky charm," Arau says. "The leading man (in 
'Like Water') had to be very handsome. That's why Tita is so in love with him. 
The Mexican actors I planned to use were unavailable. That worried me until I 
went to see 'Cinema Paradiso' and saw Marco." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavazos recently signed with ICM in hopes of pursuing mainstream Hollywood 
features as well as global opportunities. Peter Rawley, head of the 
international department at ICM, sees a bright future for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both are brilliant actors," Rawley says. "Lots of overseas actors are coming 
here, testing and working on language skills. Speaking perfect English doesn't 
mean you immediately get work -- it just puts you in a tougher category, 
competing with American actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavazos recently learned this firsthand when she auditioned for "A Walk in the 
Clouds," Arau's first English-language film, which stars Keanu Reeves. Her 
English was deemed adequate, but studio executives at the film's studio, Fox, 
weren't convinced of her chemistry with Reeves. Arau, however, says he hopes to 
work with her again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she hasn't been idle. She just finished "Tres Destinos," a Spanish 
telenovela, in Puerto Rico. While there, she also agreed to star in Joseph B. 
Vasquez's "Rice, Beans and Ketchup," a film about two Dominican immigrants 
searching for the American Dream. "She asked if her boyfriend could be in the 
film," says Vasquez, who also directed "The Bronx War." "We said yes and wrote 
a part for him as the Italian friend of the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Cavazos travels to Texas to begin filming a James L. 
Brooks-produced movie, "Bottle Rocket," a Columbia Pictures release revolving 
around three men; she plays the Cuban maid of one of them. ("Surprisingly, I 
don't have to speak that much English," she says). Leonardi has had preliminary 
discussions with an American producer about a film in which he would star as a 
young Italian visiting New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple will go back to Mexico next month to film "Viva San Isidro!," an 
Italian movie starring Leonardi. "The film is a fable with comedy," he says, in 
which he portrays -- appropriately -- a soccer player; Cavazos is his love 
interest. "The characters will speak Spanish, but they will be dubbed into 
Italian later. Lumi will get a chance to show how good her Italian is." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they walk to a nearby Hollywood park for Ben-Hur's daily romp. At a bus 
stop, Leonardi spots what he thought was a poster for the home video release of 
"Like Water." Instead, it advertises "Love Affair," starring Warren Beatty and 
Annette Bening, another on-screen/off-screen couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Both stare at the older lovers in a pose similar to their own on the "Like 
Water" poster. "It looks like an American remake of 'Like Water,' 20 years 
later," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 That evening, they watch a dubbed English-language video of "Like Water," 
marveling at English coming out of their mouths. Leonardi says he might take 
the tape to his language instructor and say: "I speak perfect English. Take a 
look." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavazos, seriously, says that the English version makes her realize that 
language is secondary to a good performance. Ben-Hur howls in agreement. "I 
don't think they dubbed the dog in the English version of 'Like Water,' do 
you?" she asks Leonardi.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course they did, my love," he says. "They had the dog say, 'Bow-wow' 
instead of 'Guau-guau' in Spanish. Great lip sync, wasn't it?";

'EXORCIST' STAR PUTS OWN SPIN ON CREEP FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hey, go meet "Exorcist" star Linda Blair at the Creep Festival! And when you 
do, be sure to ask her to rotate her head 360 degrees. No one's ever asked her 
that.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least she's an unflappable enough professional to give you that 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's two ways to go about it," she says of meeting with fans who still ask 
about "The Exorcist."  
</P>
<P>
 "I could either have been like a lot of other actresses who just go, 'Hey, 
man, that was years ago,' just being plain rude. I could have made my life 
really miserable by having a bad attitude like that, or I could realize that 
each time people see me they recall their reaction to the film, and I realize 
that it's much easier to go along with them and make them feel good, act like 
he or she is the first person to tell me to spin my head around or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 She was on the phone from a suburb of Philadelphia where she was appearing at 
another Creep Festival. The local one is at the Lion Country Center by Irvine 
Meadows; nightly through Halloween, it will feature a haunted castle and 
hayride, a Kiddie Krypt and sundry animatronic horrors. Blair is there tonight 
through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 She barfed her way to screen immortality in 1973 and reprised her role 
opposite Richard Burton in 1977's "Exorcist II: The Heretic." Since those 
splashy days, the Hollywood fates have not been exceedingly kind. While fellow 
'70s film sprite Jodie Foster has gone onto choice roles and best actress 
Oscars, Blair has had to brunt her way through TV movies and exploitation 
flicks. And now she's sharing a ghoulish midway with creatures like Toxic Waste 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's an injustice here, Blair, now 35, seems unperturbed by it. She 
remains thoroughly upbeat about her prospects and her present gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she ever worry that, like Orson Welles, she may have peaked at the 
beginning of her career? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if you consider that I never planned to be an actor, I'm doing all 
right. I think I'm lucky I was part of 'The Exorcist' and then got to do films 
like 'Born Innocent' and 'Sarah T. -- Portrait of a Teen-Age Alcoholic' 
(made-for-TV movies in which she gave strong portrayals of troubled teens). 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could have met all the people who have told me how I changed their 
lives through those and how grateful they are. . . . It touches you so much. 
It's something to realize: God, we really do effect people with our work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get jealous or envious about others getting roles. I was raised never 
to be that way. My feeling is everybody has her day in the sun and mine will 
come. Maybe my day won't be this year or next, but who's to say it won't be in 
five years?" 
</P>
<P>
 Which doesn't mean she's merely waiting for luck to spin her way. Displeased 
with the roles she has been offered, or not offered, she has formed her own 
production company and hopes to make films that appeal to her. If she has her 
way, they won't much resemble some of the B-movies she has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do more family-oriented films that are about the human spirit, 
about people achieving their dreams, feel-good movies. Anything other than 
violence , let's put it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business when you're hot you're hot, and when you're not around -- 
like me who took a lot of time having a life -- you don't get called. And in my 
20s the film business seemed to switch over to the 30- to 50-year-old market 
with the push on Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Jessica Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I worked out of the country, took whatever work was offered because I come 
from a background of 'We work for a living, that's what we do. Work is good.' 
But I was unhappy with a lot of the films. We were barraged with (production) 
money from the Middle East, some countries that don't look at women and life 
with kind eyes, would be a polite way to say it. And the result was movies that 
were B-grade T&A. It was a very disturbing time for me work-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I figure I do what I want to do and make the films I want to see, or it 
just doesn't interest me to stay in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 She is mystified by what people see in horror movies. "I know how some people 
want to laugh, some want to cry, some want a good love story. But I don't 
understand how so many people like to be scared. I don't get the concept, 
because I don't like to be scared. So the only thing I can figure is these 
people are able to separate themselves from reality and enjoy it. I personally 
don't like to get my heart rate going that much. Not like that. I'd rather be 
riding a horse." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she has several reasons (besides the money) for doing the Creep 
Festivals. First, there's the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have complete respect for the fans. People in Hollywood ought to realize 
that without their fans they are nothing. It's not about how special you think 
you are. But I really don't know many other celebrities who will put themselves 
in this position to actually greet and talk to their fans, outside of the 
people in country music, which is why I admire them so much." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't always so enthusiastic about meeting her fans. "The Exorcist" 
brought psychos out of the woodwork. "There were years I didn't go out much and 
someone said 'What happened to you?' and I said, 'If you'd met some of the 
people I have, you'd go into hiding too.' There are some very frightening 
people out there. Fortunately I'm meeting all the nice people now. 
</P>
<P>
 "That film has been a big cross to bear. To at age 15 have the world press 
looking in my eyes and asking, 'Well, what about the devil, and God, and what's 
it all about Alfie?,' and I'm like 15 years old. . . . These people are really 
asking me for the answer. I am religious. I am spiritual, but I certainly don't 
study the devil. I wouldn't waste my time." In recent years, she has played 
with her legacy, spoofing it in the film "Repossessed" and selling autographed 
cans of split pea soup for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason she appears at the Creep Fests, she said, "is I'd like to think 
I'm doing something to benefit the American public. You and I used to have fun 
as kids trick-or-treating, right? Well, some people had to take that joy away 
and make the streets unsafe, and make it unsafe for people to stay home and 
open their doors to trick-or-treaters. So I know that within the next few years 
trick-or-treating will be no more." 
</P>
<P>
 She initially turned down the Creep Fests, but then "I checked one out. And if 
you could see the looks on the faces of these people: adults with their 
teen-agers, with their children, grandparents. It's something where people of 
all types and ages are amused; it was one of the first times I'd seen all these 
people enjoying something together. I thought, 'Hey, there's something here. I 
can contribute to this.' I think the poor family structure is so disrupted in 
these times, it really needs something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of a touching image, isn't it? The fragile American family unit, 
brought together to gawk at gore-drenched monsters and oozing severed heads. 
It's nearly enough to make your head spin. 
</P>
<P>

 The Creep Festival continues through Halloween at the Lion Country Center, 
8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Linda Blair will be there tonight through 
Thursday. Hours: 7 to 11 p.m. daily (Fridays and Saturdays till midnight).

GANGSTA RAP: DID LYRICS INSPIRE KILLING OF POLICE?; POP MUSIC: TWO TEENS 
AWAITING TRIAL IN MILWAUKEE SAY TUPAC SHAKUR'S ANGRY LYRICS INFLUENCED THEM IN 
THE SLAYING OF AN OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over the social impact of gangsta rap music moves to a Milwaukee 
courtroom Wednesday, when two Wisconsin minors will be charged with murder in 
the country's second case of rap allegedly inspiring the killing of a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves two teens who told authorities they plotted a Sept. 7 sniper 
attack on a police van "because of a Tupac Shakur record that talks about 
killing the police." The assault resulted in the shooting death of 31-year-old 
Milwaukee Police Officer William A. Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old defendants, Curtis Lee Walker and Denziss Jackson, will be 
tried as adults in a case that is expected to reach trial before the end of the 
year. They have been held without bail at the Milwaukee County Children's Court 
Center since their arrest and were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Mark Williams declined comment on the case, but sources 
in the Milwaukee County Homicide Unit said Shakur's violence-laced rap music 
will play a pivotal role in the prosecution's attempt to establish a motive for 
the first-degree "intentional" homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, the alleged trigger man, told the police that Shakur's angry lyrics on 
South Central Cartel's album " 'N Gatz We Truss" "geeked him up" to stalk the 
officer, according to his court-appointed attorney Ann T. Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violent anti-police lyrics appear to have acted as command hallucinations 
which influenced his behavior," said Bowe, whose client has a six-year history 
of drug, burglary and weapons offenses. "This young man insists that certain 
passages in these songs are so much a part of his consciousness that it was as 
if they just kept playing over and over in his head that night." 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Walker told police he hid in a vacant field for 40 
minutes with a loaded weapon waiting for a police vehicle to pass by. After 
receiving a signal from Jackson that a police vehicle was approaching, Walker 
traced the movement of the police van in the scope of his .308 rifle and then 
fired a single shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet ripped through the rear of the van and struck Robertson, who died 
minutes before reaching the hospital. The two youths were arrested after a 
30-hour sweep of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second criminal case in which Shakur's music has been blamed for 
inciting the murder of an officer -- and it will most certainly renew criticism 
of the record industry and rekindle the free-speech debate over violent lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an Austin jury rejected a similar defense proposed by Ronald Ray 
Howard, a 19-year-old car thief who has been sentenced to die for the slaying 
of a Texas state trooper. Howard had claimed that "cop-killing" songs on 
Shakur's "2PACALYPSE NOW" album influenced his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While that case remains on appeal, a multimillion-dollar civil suit filed by 
the Texas trooper's widow against Shakur and his Interscope Records, a Time 
Warner subsidiary, is scheduled to go to trial in October, 1995. The suit 
charges that the label and the rap artist were "grossly negligent" in 
manufacturing and distributing music that incited "imminent lawless action." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Milwaukee case, the officer's widow, who is pregnant with twins, could 
not be reached for comment. Police sources said she has not indicated whether 
she intends to file a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest legal controversy surrounding Shakur, 23, who was convicted 
in L.A. seven months ago of battery and possessing a loaded and concealed 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Atlanta prosecutors dropped aggravated assault charges against 
Shakur, dismissing a case that stemmed from a 1993 incident in which Shakur 
exchanged gunfire with two off-duty police officers. He will stand trial next 
month in New York for allegedly holding a woman down while his friends 
sodomized her. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 3, police blamed Shakur for a disturbance that broke out at a 
Milwaukee rap festival when one of his security guards allegedly brandished a 
gun and frightened concert-goers during his performance. Murder defendants 
Walker and Jackson have told authorities they began plotting to kill a police 
officer after Shakur's concert in Milwaukee -- just days before the homicide 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Chokwe Lumumba, 
characterized the accusations as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Tupac is an artist, and his work is social commentary," Lumumba said. "It's 
unfortunate when anybody is killed, but Tupac has never told anybody to shoot a 
policeman. It's true that he raps about problems with the police, but those 
problems existed long before he was even born." 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of black church leaders, feminists and politicians have 
recently begun to call for the government to ban the sale of gangsta rap to 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. C. DeLores Tucker, chair of the Washington-based Political Congress of 
Black Women -- who encouraged African American lawmakers to convene 
anti-gangsta rap hearings on Capitol Hill this year -- said she hoped 
Robertson's slaying would serve as a warning to the record industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case confirms what many of us have long been saying: that gangsta rap 
encourages vulnerable youngsters to commit horrible acts of violence," Tucker 
said. "Gangsta rap may not be the root cause of the violence, but it's 
dangerous because it encourages young people to try to heal their pain in 
violent ways."

 HELPING HAND: What does it take to help community college students make the 
jump to four-year universities? At Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, a lot 
of hand-holding, including reminder calls to students at home the day before 
their appointments with recruiters and a transfer center packed with admissions 
information. The program has been honored by the state's chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 COLLEGE COPS: If you drive past Mission College in Sylmar and see a cluster of 
LAPD squad cars, don't think the worst: it's just The Law in the classroom. 
Mission has more than 50 LAPD employees enrolled in a special adult education 
program leading to associate of arts degrees. The connection began with 
now-abandoned plans to build a new Police Academy in the San Fernando Valley. 
The LAPD personnel are scattered among regular working adults in the college's 
Project Adult College Education (PACE) program. 
</P>
<P>
 SWEET OFFERINGS: Offer a piece of Jolly Rancher candy and students at Cal 
State Northridge will beat a path to your door. That's what CSUN student 
government senator Scott Blugrind hoped by pitching a tent on campus last 
Thursday and today to pass out candy and information about this week's student 
election. The main ballot item: a $49-per-semester student fee increase to 
support the campus' intercollegiate athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG BUCKS: Neil Yoneji, the new chancellor of the Los Angeles Community 
College District, has a good reason to be smiling. Yoneji will earn $125,000 a 
year, 33% more than he was paid last year as vice chancellor. But other 
districts pay more -- Saddleback Community College District in Mission Viejo 
was the highest, paying $145,000. 
</P>
<P>
 BOOM AHEAD: Amid all the talk about dropping college enrollments in California 
in recent years, is the nation's higher education business on the decline? No, 
says the U.S. Department of Education, which predicts enrollments will increase 
from 14.6 million in 1992 to 15.9 million by 2004.

EXILES KILL CUBAN BEFORE CAPTURE, AUTHORITIES SAY

<P>
 A group of seven armed and camouflage-dressed Cuban exiles shot dead a Cuban 
fisherman after arriving on the island in a motor launch from Florida, 
authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An Interior Ministry statement said the men were captured along with their 
vessel and arms Saturday after what the ministry called "this strange attempt 
at armed infiltration." 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, 34-year-old Arcelio Rodriguez Garcia, was one of four fishermen 
the group encountered after landing near dawn on a causeway under construction 
in the Caibarien area, about 200 miles east of Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, published in the Communist youth weekly Juventud Rebelde, said 
three of the "mercenaries" were slightly injured when they were captured.

CRITICISM OF VELTHOEN ON RISE; BACKERS ARE STEADFAST; PORT HUENEME: HIGHLY PAID 
CITY MANAGER IS SAID TO WIELD TOO MUCH POWER AND DISRESPECT THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE. HIS ALLIES CREDIT HIM WITH RAISING THE CITY'S QUALITY OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, Richard Velthoen managed the community of Port Hueneme in 
an atmosphere of quiet and political calm, helping transform Port Hueneme from 
a seaside town into a modern city. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned lots were converted into green parks, the beachfront streets were 
decked with modern homes and street medians were landscaped. It was a quiet 
little town in the shadow of Oxnard, with little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently the peace in Port Hueneme has been shattered. And the 57-year-old 
Velthoen, in turn, has become the target of growing criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 During heated City Council meetings, residents have accused him of squandering 
the city's revenues on high salaries for himself and other officials, wielding 
too much power over city affairs and disrespecting the will of the people.  
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Velthoen climaxed this summer when first-term Councilwoman Toni 
Young made public a memorandum in which Velthoen threatened her with 
"unpleasant consequences" if she continued to publicly discuss the possibility 
of his being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a persistent critic of Velthoen and Port Hueneme's four veteran council 
members, explained at the time that she had been joking when she told three 
Santa Paula city officials that the council was going "to get rid of Dick."  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless Young, who has had bitter arguments with Velthoen, continues to 
believe that Port Hueneme needs a new city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "His environment is too comfortable," she said. "He has been in the same place 
too long, and it's time for new surroundings, new challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Young is not pleased with Velthoen (pronounced vell-THONE), Port 
Hueneme's four more senior council members hold him in high esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who hired Velthoen, including Councilman Dorill Wright and Mayor 
Orvene Carpenter, continue to be strong supporters of the city manager and view 
the recent backlash against him as unfair.  
</P>
<P>
 "Port Hueneme used to be a regular seaside town. Velthoen came along and 
brought with him the knowledge on how to get financial funds to change the 
city," Wright said. "Redevelopment is what has made Port Hueneme into a 
desirable place to live, and that is due to Velthoen's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he believes some residents just want to see a change in the 
administration of the city, and recently they have scrutinized not only 
Velthoen but the senior council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of criticism," Carpenter said. "And some people just 
feel a need for new faces." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four long-term council members -- Wright, James Daniels and Ken 
Hess -- will step down after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Velthoen, who is not an elected official, will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, residents repeatedly have packed City Hall to fight two 
controversial proposals -- a recreational-vehicle resort on a city-owned beach 
and a "view tax" on beachfront residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They have accused Velthoen of authoring the RV resort plan and argued that he 
has failed to find other ways besides the resort and view tax to increase city 
revenues.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't view him as a good public and professional servant," said Dorothy 
Blake, a leading claimant in a lawsuit against the city challenging the 
legality of imposing a view tax on only a portion of the city's 22,000 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick is ruling this city," she added. "I hope the new council won't allow him 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, occasionally abrupt in public but friendly and charming in private, 
attributes the increased criticism of him to misunderstandings of the proper 
role of a city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says that the idea to build the RV resort came from the City Council 
and not from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't rule the city. I simply make recommendations and guide the council," 
Velthoen said. "The RV resort is by far the most contentious project in the 
history of Port Hueneme, and some people, who are too emotional about the 
project, hold me responsible. It was not my idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, who says that he has devoted much of his life to Port Hueneme, is 
disappointed by the recent attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, no one ever found fault with beautiful landscaped medians and 
parkways and many other amenities we created," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Port Hueneme built the RV resort, Velthoen said, the city would not need to 
impose a utility tax on water, electricity, gas and cable television, so it 
could raise the $500,000 it needs to keep its police department from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax, adopted by the City Council in July, is to go into effect by 
the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The council adopted the utility tax after a property tax measure fell just shy 
of the two-thirds majority needed in the June election. A staff report 
detailing how much the tax will be and precisely when it should begin is to be 
presented to the council Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen strongly recommended both proposed taxes to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics and even some of his supporters say one reason he has become 
increasingly controversial is that he tends to say whatever is on his mind 
without considering the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know city managers throughout the state of California, and I find Dick to 
do an excellent job," said Port Hueneme resident Penny Bohannon, who is also 
Ventura County's deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But "he does get emotional when dealing with citizens," Bohannon said. "He 
tries very hard to explain things from his point of view, and the citizens 
don't always agree. That creates problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brigham, president of Surfside III Condominium Homeowners Assn., which has 
vehemently fought the RV project, said Velthoen often condemns anyone whose 
opinion differs from his. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rigidity of his thinking is not good for the people of Port Hueneme," 
Brigham said. "I think he is the type of person when an idea comes to him, from 
whatever source, and he believes in that idea, any alternative is disregarded." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Often during council meetings, according to some critics, Velthoen ignores 
residents' comments and does not respond to their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have been dismissed by Velthoen," said David Kanter, a resident who 
attends the meetings often. "We have been told that we don't have the facts 
straight and that we should shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen agreed that he gets easily annoyed with comments that are not factual 
and that he can be opinionated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'm very decisive and have to change my mind because I'm wrong," he 
said. "But I'm honest and upfront about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their campaign against Velthoen, some angry residents -- most of them 
opponents of the RV resort -- have showed up at council meetings holding signs 
caricaturing the city manager as a crowned king, reading: "Dethrone King 
Velthoen" and "No Velthoen Clones in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have also circulated letters in Port Hueneme accusing Velthoen of 
being overpaid, disrespecting residents and dividing the city into opponents 
and supporters of the RV resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, what counts is not Velthoen's personality, but his 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the criticism, Police Chief John Hopkins said, Velthoen is the 
best thing that ever happened to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What matters to me, is what Dick has done to this city," Hopkins said. "Port 
Hueneme used to be a dirt hole 20 years ago. It was the worst part of the 
county. We had a lot of prostitutes, a lot of run-down homes and dirt. It was 
when he became city manager that we began to see an almost immediate change."  
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme is moving toward what may be the hottest political campaign in 
its history. Fourteen candidates are running for the three open council seats. 
Four have said that if they win, they will seriously assess Velthoen's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have asked me how the new council can get rid of Velthoen," 
said candidate Billy Kimberling. "If I'm elected, I would have to look at the 
total picture and find out whether he manipulates the council and runs the city 
or whether the council allows him to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony C. Volante, another candidate, said he believes Velthoen has done 
wonders for Port Hueneme but he would consider putting a freeze on Velthoen's 
salary.  
</P>
<P>
 "He may be making more money than a manager for such a small city would 
normally make," Volante said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates who said they would evaluate Velthoen's performance are 
Robert Turner, a dentist and president of the Port Hueneme Chamber of Commerce, 
and Jon Sharkey, a production manager and technician in entertainment services. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, whose yearly salary, including perks, amounts to $141,000, said he 
is saddened by the "absurd" charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vendetta against me," Velthoen said. "I've worked here for years and 
have done some great things. I don't understand how such accusations can be 
good for the progress of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James Daniels, one of the many city officials who strongly defend 
Velthoen, said the charges that he wields too much power are an insult to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick has no power other than to make suggestions to us," Daniels said.  
</P>
<P>
 A man who describes himself as driven by competition, Velthoen began working 
in Port Hueneme in January, 1975, as assistant city manager. He became city 
manager six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 While his critics have blamed Velthoen for Port Hueneme's current economic 
problems, he says the city is simply one of many in California that was not 
prepared for the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the recession and huge revenues losses from the state, we are still 
managing to do a good job," Velthoen said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Modesto, Velthoen attended Oregon State University and earned a 
master's degree in natural resources. He later joined the Air Force and went to 
Germany. While there, he married his wife, Linda, whom he had met in Oregon. 
They have three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, an Oxnard resident, said he realized he wanted to be a city manager 
while working as the director of personnel services at the Air Force base in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was responsible for organizing a lot of events in the base, and I enjoyed 
doing that," Velthoen said. "It gave me a feeling that I was making things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Velthoen became assistant city manager in Thousand Oaks, where he 
worked for seven years. During that time he obtained another master's degree, 
in public administration, at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Port Hueneme, he also worked for a developer in Newport 
Beach, where he gained a lot of the planning skills that later helped him as 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades later, Velthoen said he feels privileged to work for a 
council that respects and understands him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been blessed with a council which works well together and has had 
congruent goals. I am the luckiest city manager in California," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing he has had to learn in recent years in a city with an annual budget 
of $16 million is how to work with less money, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, the problem was not money," Velthoen said. "The problem was 
what to do with it." But now the city can barely maintain its own police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen concedes that the city has problems but defends his record as one of 
accomplishment. As for his influence, he says that frequent council approval of 
his recommendations is the result of his simply doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any city manager in the state of California is in a position of power and 
authority," Velthoen said. "But the council is in control of the destiny of the 
city because they are the policy makers."

BIRTHING BLUES; NEW PARENTS, INSURERS AT ODDS OVER ONE-NIGHT MATERNITY STAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Having a baby isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Tammye Martin of Oxnard. Pampered in the hospital for two days when 
her son was born 2 1/2 years ago, last month Martin had to go home just one day 
after she gave birth to her second child, a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Gladys Ramos of Oxnard didn't even get a full day in the hospital. After 
11 hours of labor, she gave birth to her first child at 6 p.m. and was sent 
home 18 hours later with her newborn daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 These women didn't leave the hospital quickly because they are uninsured, but 
rather because they have coverage. Like most women having babies these days, 
they find themselves affected by a new and widespread policy of insurance 
companies to pay for only one night in the hospital following a normal 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 While families and health care providers adjust to the new insurance payment 
rules, many of them decry the practice and warn that mothers and babies are put 
at potential risk by being sent home so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two years ago, most women who had health insurance could count 
on at least a two-day stay in the hospital after giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides giving the woman a little time to recover from childbirth, the 
hospital stay enabled nurses to instruct the mother on how to care for the baby 
and observe the infant for what can be subtle indications of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with hospitals discharging patients as early as 11 a.m., a child born 
close to midnight often is sent home when only half a day old. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is obscene and grotesque," said Dr. Kenneth Saul, a Thousand Oaks 
pediatrician. "There is a major risk to children who are going home so soon if 
the parents are not alert to the warning signs" of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several doctors said they could not cite examples of newborns who 
went home after one-night hospital stays and experienced serious difficulties, 
they say that potential problems include jaundice, dehydration, heart defects 
and breast-feeding problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many physicians emphasized the need to keep the babies hospitalized longer, 
adding that short stays are also hard on the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think from an emotional point of view, my mothers aren't ready to leave in 
24 hours," said Dr. Maynard D. Belzer, a Camarillo obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
 But the insurance industry defends its new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another managed-care technique," said Dan DiFonzo, spokesman for 
the Health Insurance Assn. of America, a Washington, D.C.-based organization 
that represents 250 small- and medium-size private insurance companies. 
"Mothers are just as healthy going home after one day as after two." 
</P>
<P>
 DiFonzo said an argument can be made for sending mothers and babies home as 
quickly as possible so they do not contract an airborne infection in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies have found it is less expensive and just as efficacious 
to have a woman go home after 24 hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who delivered her daughter at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, 
said she would have liked to wait an extra day before taking home newborn 
daughter Christina Marie. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this was her second child, she knew that the challenges of sleepless 
nights, diapers, laundry and caring for a newborn would be a major adjustment 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (the hospital stay) should be a little bit longer," said Martin, 
31. "Mentally, I'd probably be a lot more rested. I think I'd feel more 
prepared to accept the new challenges of being a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 That view is shared by many in the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be overwhelming for the mother," said JoLynn de la Torre, 
communications manager for Simi Valley Hospital. "You've gone through a 
tremendous change in your body, it's a very emotional time, you have a lot of 
things to remember. All of a sudden, someone says, 'Here, Mom. You're home with 
your baby. Carry on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Raymond I. Poliakin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, said some women have no trouble going 
home within hours after giving birth. Others, especially first-time mothers, 
are in desperate need of sleep after delivering a baby, and they are not going 
to get that once they go home. 
</P>
<P>
 If the baby is delivered in the evening, Poliakin said, a mother typically 
will not fall asleep until 4 or 5 a.m. the next day. For the woman to be sent 
home five or six hours later is unfair, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gotten no sleep, and then they go home to a house where they might 
not have someone to help them," Poliakin said. "I think one good night's sleep 
in the hospital is what the woman needs, and it's typically not the first 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortening the hospital stay for mothers and babies has been gradual, health 
workers say. At first it was just the health maintenance organizations, or 
HMOs, that dictated the one-night stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, other insurance companies changed their policies. Now, 
unless there is a medical reason to keep a woman longer -- such as an infection 
or excessive bleeding -- almost all mothers are sent home after one night in 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 For insurance providers, the shorter stays can translate into thousands of 
dollars in savings in a year. At St. John's Regional Medical Center, which has 
facilities in Oxnard and Camarillo, a second night's stay for the mother adds 
an average $400 to the bill, a hospital spokeswoman said. With 220 babies born 
at the two hospitals each month, the shorter stays allow insurers to cut 
$88,000 in monthly costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this puts an extra burden on hospital staffs, which are charged with 
educating mothers on the care of their infants as well as tending to the 
physical needs of babies and their mothers following childbirth. The hospitals 
say they give special emphasis to breast-feeding techniques and determining if 
a baby is getting proper nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to give (mothers) adequate education and make sure the baby is 
feeding correctly," said Dianne Saavedra, manager of the maternity department 
at Community Memorial. "It's a lot of education to give in a short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County hospitals have adjusted to the new insurance rules by 
offering more extensive education classes for expectant parents, as well as 
follow-up instruction by telephone or in person after a baby is born. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies really promote the mothers taking these classes, and a 
lot of them make it mandatory," said Vickie Lemmon, director of nursing for St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurance companies have contracts with the hospital and pay for their 
members to take the education classes, Lemmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've learned to cope by trying to get to the parents prenatally and 
offer a wide variety of classes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that alone is not enough, Lemmon acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education before the baby is born is very, very good, but it doesn't in any 
way, shape or form address all the situations that come up after the baby is 
born," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals in the county said their staff members try to call mothers a few 
days after they go home. In addition, mothers are encouraged to call the 
hospital day or night if they have questions or problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some pediatricians are concerned that parents might not know if their baby has 
a health problem that went unnoticed in the hospital during the short stay. 
Jaundice symptoms may not appear in the first few hours, and congenital heart 
defects also may go undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the baby is totally under the care of the parents, then you have to 
count on the parents," said Dr. J. Andrew Huang, an Oxnard pediatrician. "It 
just makes you more nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul said signs of dehydration and heart problems can be subtle and must be 
watched for closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to go into more detail educating the mothers about how to care 
for the new babies because we don't have the nurses to watch for things," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pediatricians see their newborn patients for the first time in the hospital, 
and traditionally, the next doctor visit is two weeks later. Saul, however, 
said he sees his newborns within a few days of the hospital discharge because 
he is concerned that health problems might go unnoticed at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemmon, St. John's director of nursing, said she does not have those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Healthy babies really transition very quickly and very well," she said. "I 
don't think the new insurance policy has diminished the care for babies. I 
think that is why the insurance companies have been able to revise their 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
 DiFonzo, the insurance industry spokesman, said many companies will pay for a 
nurse to make a home visit after the hospital discharge. But that visit does 
not necessarily address another concern of doctors -- that mothers will stop 
breast-feeding when they get home because they did not have enough help getting 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new mom is going to need a lot of encouragement along those lines," said 
Dr. Edward Gibson, an Oxnard pediatrician. "Those mothers are more likely to 
give up on the breast-feeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Poliakin, the Thousand Oaks obstetrician, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breast-feeding can be a very trying and traumatic experience for first-time 
mothers," he said. "A woman's expectations about breast-feeding can crumble 
very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huang said that despite his concerns about the short hospital stay, "I think 
we have to live with it because of the control of medical costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Belzer and Saul were not as understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Belzer, the Camarillo obstetrician, said his patients often get angry with him 
when they learn how soon they must leave the hospital. If they call the 
insurance company to complain, they frequently are told the dismissal date is 
up to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true at all," Belzer said. In fact, he added, a doctor who lets a 
patient stay longer than an insurance company would like will receive a severe 
scolding, at the least, and could find his services no longer covered by the 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not up to the doctor," Belzer said. "There are certain rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul was even more pointed in his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we have to deal with it. We just have to take the best care of the 
patient we can with the circumstances we're given," he said. "But a child is 
being put at risk for the sole benefit of insurance executives, who are making 
hundreds of millions of dollars off these short stays."

PLAN FOR NEW VENTURA TRAIL EXPECTED TO WIN APPROVAL; DEVELOPMENT: PROPOSAL 
WOULD LINK TWO ROUTES TO FORM 18.8-MILE PATH. A BIKEWAY THROUGH SANTA PAULA AND 
FILLMORE IS ALSO ENVISIONED. 
</P>

<P>
 Cyclists, hikers and maybe even horseback riders will replace railroad cars 
along miles of old train routes, according to a plan the Ventura City Council 
is expected to approve tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement paves the way for acquisition of the Ventura and Santa Paula 
branch train lines by Ventura, Fillmore, Santa Paula and the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city officials said buying the 5.8 miles of Southern Pacific 
Transportation Co. railroad right of way would allow them to create a Ventura 
River Trail, linking the existing Ojai Valley Trail and Omer Rains beachside 
trail to form an uninterrupted 18.8-mile path for bikes and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the ultimate California experience, going from the ocean to the 
mountains," said Gary Klein, an owner of Cycle Scene bicycle shop in Ventura. 
"It's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
 County planners said the 32-mile branch line running through Santa Paula and 
Fillmore could also be developed as a bicycle path later. 
</P>
<P>
 County and city staff members have identified $8 million in federal and state 
funds to spend on buying the tracks and surrounding land, and the city has 
assembled $1.75 million in state and federal grants for creating the river 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A master plan for the river trail was completed in 1992, calling for three 
parallel trails from Foster Park to Main Street in Ventura, to be used by 
cyclists, horseback riders and walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike path would be paved, the pedestrian path would be gravel or cinder 
and the horse path would be soil or wood chips, according to the master plan. 
The city will landscape the edges of the trail and build rest areas alongside. 
The master plan also calls for interpretive signs describing nearby oil and 
railroad history, plants and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura branch rail line, an offshoot of the main coastal railway, has not 
been used since the late 1980s. Its tracks and ties will probably be removed 
when the river trail is built. The Santa Paula branch is still used by freight 
trains and some short-line movie or dinner trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula tracks will be maintained so those uses can continue, said 
Christopher Stephens of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. He said 
bike and pedestrian paths may be built alongside the railroad tracks in the 
future, and that the tracks might someday be modified or replaced for commuter 
rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal legislative efforts to unclog freeways and clean up air 
pollution have included substantial funds for bike paths, and the county plans 
to take advantage of them, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure the City Council will consider tonight is a memorandum of 
understanding among Fillmore, Santa Paula, Ventura and the county. Each party 
agrees to contribute $50,000 for the preliminary administrative costs of buying 
the rail lines. After the land is assessed, the county will negotiate the 
purchase of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens said Southern Pacific was a willing seller, and a Southern Pacific 
spokesman said the company had agreed to give the county first dibs on the 
property, which it had begun to sell off piecemeal to adjacent landowners 
before the county stepped in last year.

STREET SMART: ROAD MAINTENANCE FOULING UP TIMING OF TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic light at Rose and Wooley in Oxnard has a left-turn arrow directing 
traffic toward Rose that functions inconsistently. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes traffic is forced to wait a whole cycle before the arrow kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be extremely frustrating. Can anything be done about this? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Something is being done, and that is the source of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have noticed some county maintenance workers in the area. They are 
doing roadwork that has caused traffic delays, Oxnard traffic engineer Joe 
Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the roadwork, some of the detectors that control the timing of 
the lights have been out of service, but they should be up and running in a 
matter of days, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who notice any signal timing problems can contact the Oxnard traffic 
department directly at 385-7866. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been following the letters concerning the need for a traffic signal or 
stop sign at Westlake Boulevard and Bridgegate Street in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a relatively inexpensive partial fix that I think could help. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the drivers going south on Westlake and turning right onto Bridgegate 
fail to use their turn signals. 
</P>
<P>
 If a right-turn-only lane with a raised divider were installed, turning cars 
could use this lane. This would improve the traffic flow and end the confusion 
for pedestrians and motorists waiting to cross the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the traffic engineers don't take a "not invented here" attitude on this 
suggestion, as they seem to do on other good ideas they don't come up with 
themselves. 
</P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your attempt to address concerns of residents over the lack of a traffic 
signal at the Westlake-Bridgegate intersection is admirable, but it would 
create a hazard at the intersection, traffic engineer Jeff Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he says, is that if you turn part of a straight-ahead lane into a 
turning lane, drivers will get confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not want to turn will continue going straight, creating a hazard 
for all the motorists who thought everybody in the right lane would be turning. 
</P>
<P>
 These lanes, called "trap lanes," are used only in extreme cases where they 
help alleviate some other major traffic problem, Knowles says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the city did install the right-turn lane, he says, it would not 
address the majority of concerns he has heard from residents about this 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are asking for is for us to make it easier to get across the 
street," Knowles says. "But if you compare it to other streets in the city, 
this is really not a problem intersection." 
</P>
<P>
 Some readers disagree, as the next letter indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I read Street Smart every Monday, so I've been following the requests for some 
type of traffic control for pedestrians at Westlake and Bridgegate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the city turned down the request, saying it doesn't meet their 
criteria, is a cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
 If the above is a valid reason for denying that request, then I think the 
manner in which a four-way stop sign was erected at the intersection of 
Pederson Road and Radcliffe Street bears closer scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned from the crossing guard there that a city official's grandchild was 
almost run down by a car at that intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later the stop signs were up. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no waiting for someone to get hit by a car or to meet some specious 
criteria for such control. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess if you are "somebody" in the city hierarchy, you can get things done 
just by saying so. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the rest of us? 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, city records show that the request for a stop sign at Pederson and 
Radcliffe came from the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the intersection does not meet state guidelines for a four-way stop, 
a study by the city's traffic department showed that a curve on Pederson 
created a visibility problem for cars and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years of pleading by the school district, the city agreed to install 
the stop signs in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no record of a complaint from a city official or anyone else about a 
near-accident at the intersection, traffic engineer Jeff Knowles says.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; SHOPPERS TAKE PARTING SHOTS AT TOY GUN SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Oxnard's Centerpoint Mall, Terry Griffin, 12, lifted a toy plastic rifle 
off the shelf in the Kay-Bee toy store, pointed it at his friend and fired 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Such play will be much rarer in local toy stores following last week's 
announcement by corporate officials from the Toys R Us and Kay-Bee chains that 
their stores would stop selling realistic-looking toy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of recent tragedies nationwide in which police officers have shot 
children carrying toy guns contributed to the companies' decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement notwithstanding, at the Centerpoint Mall Kay-Bee store on 
Saturday, shelves were still laden with plastic Supershot Rifles and Electronic 
M-16 Intruders, the cardboard packages inviting customers to "Try me! Pull 
trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry, who was testing out guns, said he opposed taking them all off the 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids like playing guns. You can run and hide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend and toy gun target, Patrick Gear, said some toy guns look so much 
like real ones that they pose a threat to the children using them. "If you're a 
cop driving by you wouldn't know," Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 A store manager said the toy guns would be taken off the shelves as soon as 
possible. Corporate officials said the guns will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Toys R Us, the guns will remain in the stores until they are sold out, but 
they will not be reordered, corporate officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at the Thousand Oaks branch of Toys R Us said there had been no rush 
by customers to buy the remaining guns Saturday. "All they're really looking 
for is Halloween costumes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oxnard Wal-Mart on Rose Avenue, most of the parents browsing in the toy 
department had heard the news about the decision by the two toy store chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great idea and more (stores) should do it, like maybe 
Wal-Mart," Cathy Manclus of Santa Barbara said, warily eyeing the wall of 
weapons in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents were less concerned about the dangers of the toys. Robert 
Valdivia of Ventura said he had no problem with his 4-year-old son playing with 
a plastic six-shooter in the back yard or his bedroom. Straying farther afield 
is strictly forbidden, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your kid is going around unsupervised, roaming the streets with a 
realistic-looking gun, of course he's going to get in trouble," Valdivia said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY TO WEIGH FUNDS FOR AQUARIUM PLANS

<P>
 Organizers of a proposed aquarium and marine education center at Ventura 
Harbor will brief the City Council tonight on their plans before the council 
decides whether to invest more in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Fiori, who initiated the project, is requesting an additional $30,000 so 
that he can begin soliciting more funds and estimating the final cost of the 
project.The funds will also go toward more detailed architectural, exhibit and 
landscape plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiori said plans call for the center to include an expanded Channel Islands 
National Park visitor center, an outdoor shipbuilding facility, indoor and 
outdoor aquariums, fish hatcheries, an Imax-Cinemax large-screen theater and a 
research center for Jean-Michel Cousteau, the son of oceanographer Jacques 
Cousteau. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already funded $10,000 of preliminary work on the project. The 
city's economics committee recommended last Wednesday that the city and the 
Ventura Port District each pay half of the additional $30,000. The port 
district owns the proposed site for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet with Fiori today at 6 p.m. and consider the funding 
request during its regular meeting at 7:30. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 Ventura County Crime Stoppers is offering up to $1,000 for information that 
identifies two men who robbed a Newbury Park gas station at gunpoint last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, one of whom held a handgun, approached an employee of the 
Chevron gas station on Camino Dos Rios, near the Wendy Drive on-ramp to the 
Ventura Freeway, when she was closing the cash booth about 11 p.m., sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 After entering the booth with her, the suspects collected the receipts from 
the cash register and demanded money from the other employee. They then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the suspects as short and slender Latinos, about 23 years 
old. The gunman wore a black baseball cap with a green bill, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime Stoppers, a private, nonprofit group, says callers can remain anonymous. 
The telephone number is 805-494-TALK. GREG RIPPEE

 Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter has endorsed county supervisor 
candidate Frank Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks councilman, is running against attorney Trudi Loh for 
the 2nd Supervisorial District seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk. The 
district covers most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said Schillo, who is also supported by the county's Deputy Sheriffs 
Assn., has had a solid working relationship with law enforcement for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has the strength, the backbone and the leadership to be a good 
asset to the Board of Supervisors and to me in trying to accomplish our goals," 
Carpenter said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

ENTHUSIASM FOR SCHOOL UNIFORM MAY BE DWINDLING; SIMI VALLEY: FEWER CHILDREN ARE 
GARBED IN THE BLUE AND WHITE, AND SOME PARENTS DRESS DOWN POLICY. BUT 
ADMINISTRATION SEES BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of classes at Garden Grove Elementary School, hundreds of 
Simi Valley children marched on campus in crisp blue pants and bright white 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the sea of uniformity, school officials preened. Garden Grove was the 
only Ventura County school taking advantage of a new state law allowing 
uniforms in public schools, and the response was tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 But five weeks later, the number of uniform-clad youngsters has dwindled, and 
some parents are calling the county's first uniform experiment a first-class 
blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it," said parent Angel Fils. "The kids are uncomfortable. There are so 
many other things this school should be working on." 
</P>
<P>
 But Principal Elroy Peterson said the voluntary uniform policy is improving 
student behavior and promoting a more professional learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had absolutely a decrease in 'junk' problems between children," he 
said of petty campus squabbles. And "we have not suspended a child yet this 
year because of discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is embraced by most Garden Grove parents, he said, with the 
exception of a handful of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wearing uniforms is optional, children who do not wear the 
parochial-style blue-and-white outfits must comply with the school's strict 
dress code, which bans oversize pants, hats, leggings not covered by skirts and 
combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy also forbids T-shirts adorned with writing or pictures, except 
those depicting the school's mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 An identical dress code at Valley View Junior High School is being challenged 
by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a federal lawsuit against 
the Simi Valley Unified School District this month. The suit alleges that the 
policy violates students' constitutional right to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, schools nationwide have adopted strict dress codes -- and now 
uniforms -- in part to stop street violence from entering classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the case, however, at Garden Grove, a small suburban school of 625 
students nestled in a residential neighborhood. The elementary campus has never 
had a history of violence or gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the need for uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson suggested the policy last spring to promote school pride and improve 
learning. A survey showed that more than 70% of Garden Grove families supported 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, some parents are saying the uniform policy and dress code are 
foolhardy requirements that are hindering -- not helping -- students' 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is necessary," said Shelley Mouzis, whose 10-year-old 
daughter was pulled out of class for wearing leggings without a skirt and 
forced to change into a uniform. "What's more important -- her education or 
what she is wearing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Fils agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much to be done to better the education of these kids rather than 
looking for kids with a 'Lion King' T-shirt on," she said. Fils' two children 
do not wear uniforms but adhere to the school's dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised to see the turnout in the beginning," Fils said. "But as 
the weeks have gone on, it's been less and less." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some students who are wearing uniforms don't like the white collared shirts 
and stiff blue pants required. 
</P>
<P>
 "They itch and they're not comfortable," said 10-year-old Kenny Bohannon, who 
would rather be wearing "baggy pants and a really long shirt and have it 
untucked." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students said they don't like being told what to wear by school officials 
and are teased by youths from neighboring schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not allowed to wear what we want anymore," said Frank Chinoski, 11, a 
sixth-grader at Garden Grove.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hate being the first school to have uniforms because people make fun of 
you," Kenny said. "They think you are a woosie or a wimp." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Fils shook her head in frustration as her 10-year-old 
son, Tony, quickly untucked his shirt as he walked off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfect example," she said. "He has to wear his shirt tucked in to school, 
and he gets to me, it's untucked. He doesn't feel good. If it is on his mind, 
there's something else he is missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony, a fifth-grader, said he doesn't like the new policy and doesn't know any 
kids who do. "They hate wearing their shirts tucked in," he said. "I don't like 
it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But like it or not, school officials across Southern California are beginning 
to adopt uniform policies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 schools in Orange County are trying voluntary policies this fall, and 
the Long Beach Unified School District recently adopted a policy requiring all 
57,000 students in its elementary and middle schools to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a single, bizarre approach by one school district," said Ronald 
Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake 
Village. "This is a movement across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Stephens acknowledged that there is no well-defined research to support 
the claim that uniforms make campuses safer or improve learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen studies. All I have heard is personal experiences and 
anecdotes," Stephens said. "This is an area that needs some definitive 
research." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Peterson said the uniform experiment at Garden Grove is working. "It gives 
(students) a sense of school pride and a sense of work ethic," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 And if parents and students don't like the idea? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have schools of choice," he said. "There are 19 elementary schools in this 
valley and they can go to any one they want." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the decrease in students wearing uniforms, Peterson said on the first 
day of classes about 75% of the students were dressed in blue-and-white 
outfits. Since then, the numbers have fluctuated between 50% and 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the children don't have enough uniforms yet," he explained. When the 
uniforms, he said, "are dirty or in the wash, they wear other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent and special education aide Julie Tindall has stocked her family's 
wardrobe with uniforms. Not only do her twins, Blake and Ashley, wear them, but 
Tindall wears a uniform to school as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as a family made up our minds that we would do whatever the school's 
decision was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Tindall, some teachers have not embraced the policy. Only 40 to 50% of 
the faculty wear uniforms, and Peterson knows he cannot force them to do so. 
But at least one parent has complained that by not following the school's 
policy, teachers are setting a poor example for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with her 100%," Peterson said. "The problem is, teachers have a 
contract."

BLACK CHURCH IN SIMI CELEBRATES 17 YEARS; RELIGION: TINY CONGREGATION SINGS, 
PRAYS AND SOCIALIZES TO MARK ANNIVERSARY. 'OUR JOB IS TO LOVE EVERYBODY,' SAYS 
PASTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a perfect Sunday afternoon in Simi Valley. Clear skies, sunshine and 
cool breezes lured hundreds of residents into back yards, parks and golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a tiny black church at the west end of the city, a few dozen 
parishioners were content to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 As the afternoon light filtered through simple pane glass windows, the 
congregation of True Spirit Community Church sang, prayed, socialized and dined 
on steak and fruit juice in celebration of 17 years of building community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to love everybody," said the Rev. Curry McKinney, co-founder and 
pastor of True Spirit, a nondenominational church. "To learn to see past the 
color of somebody's skin, to get rid of the hatred, that's been my job for 17 
years and more."  
</P>
<P>
 The task is not always easy in a city with an African-American population of 
less than 2% and a name that, for many, brings to mind the Rodney G. King 
beating trial that acquitted four police officers of using excessive force 
against King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is welcomed at True Spirit, but you can't get away from the fact 
that the racism is out there," said McKinney, who is also vice president of the 
Ventura County chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, McKinney said, apathy is a far greater curse. 
</P>
<P>
 One of four black churches in Simi Valley, McKinney has seen the congregation 
at the modest former schoolhouse on Sinaloa Street shrink from 150 to 40. He 
attributes the drop to a lack of interest in religion among young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have 40 or 50 young people in here every week, it was a real 
gathering place," he said. "But now they have other interests or they've moved 
away and we've had a difficult time drawing others in." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do attend True Spirit seem deeply committed to their church, 
traveling from Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and as far away as Oxnard to attend 
Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 They give McKinney much of the credit for keeping the church going. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when it must be hard to look out onto such a small 
congregation," one church member said. "I think a lot of other people would 
have given up a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-year-old McKinney, who towers well above six feet tall and speaks in a 
deep, commanding voice, shrugs off such praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really about the people who come here, week after week, month after 
month, year after year," he said. "That is what this place is about." 
</P>
<P>
 At 91, Alberta Whitfield is the oldest member of the church. She began 
attending after she moved to Simi Valley more than a decade ago to live with 
her daughter and never misses a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to find a church no matter where I am," Whitfield said. "I liked 
this place from the first moment I stepped inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Theo Green, 18, said he comes to church about once a month, when he can get 
time off from his job as a grocery store checker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a lot of kids my age around," he said. "But really not too 
much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Theo's mother, Jacqueline, a Moorpark resident who has been attending True 
Spirit with her husband for nine years, said the church offers her a kind of 
support she would not otherwise have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose to move here from Los Angeles because we did not want to expose our 
children to all the crime and gangs down there," Green said. "The trade-off is 
you go to a place where there is a lot of racism, but then you find a place 
like True Spirit, where you can get the strength you need to go on and live 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 For Margaret Busch, a Thousand Oaks resident who has been attending the church 
for seven years, the sense of community at True Spirit is especially important. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to the service and then we sit around for two or three hours just 
talking and having a good time," Busch said. "We may be a small church but we 
are a friendly, caring church." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance on Sunday was bolstered by a busload of visitors from St. Andrews 
Baptist Church in Los Angeles, where McKinney served before coming to Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Visits to and from other churches are an integral part of the worshiping 
experience at True Spirit. On this day, the St. Andrews Choir, clad in flowing 
white robes, was scheduled to make a guest appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping step with a rousing piano accompaniment, the choir swayed into the 
small church, where the audience jumped up from the wooden pews to clap and 
sing along to an old Baptist hymn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time, somber skies and 
howling tempests often succeed a bright sunshine. In that land of perfect day, 
when the mists have rolled away, we will understand it better by and by."

2 KILLED ON ROUTE 126 IN HEAD-ON COLLISION; FILLMORE: THE WRECK LEAVES THREE 
OTHERS SERIOUSLY INJURED. OFFICIALS SAY A LONG-SOUGHT CONCRETE MEDIAN COULD 
HAVE PREVENTED THE ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two motorists were killed and three others were seriously injured late Sunday 
afternoon following a head-on collision on California 126 in Fillmore, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 5 p.m. near Fish Hatchery Road after a westbound 
car swerved out of control, crossed over the center median and struck another 
car traveling eastbound, Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Renee Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The male adult driver of the westbound vehicle, believed to be in his 20s, and 
a male passenger seated behind him were killed instantly by the force of the 
impact, Robles said. A 16-year-old girl seated in the front passenger seat of 
the car suffered a broken leg and broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the eastbound car, a late-model Ford Thunderbird, suffered 
less severe injuries from the collision, Robles said. The unidentified woman 
driver suffered cuts to her head and the passenger, an adult male, suffered 
broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old girl in the first car and the driver of the Thunderbird were 
flown by sheriff's helicopter to Ventura County Medical Center, where a nursing 
supervisor said they were in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The male passenger in the Ford was taken by ambulance to Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital. His condition was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Identities of the dead men or the injured were not immediately available 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it was not clear how fast the vehicles were moving at the 
time of the collision or what caused the westbound car to swerve into the 
opposing lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said an air bag in the Thunderbird failed to activate despite the force 
of the collision. The front of the car was badly caved in while the other 
smaller vehicle was so badly damaged that firefighters had to use the Jaws of 
Life to clear through the wreckage to remove the deceased man from the 
vehicle's back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's collision was the latest in a string of fatal mishaps that have 
occurred on the highway in the past few years. Local officials have been 
working to get concrete highway dividers installed to lessen the severity of 
the accidents that occur there. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a perfect example of why I want those (concrete) dividers. I've been 
fighting Caltrans for over two years on this," said Fillmore City Councilman 
Roger Campbell, who doubles as the assistant chief of the city's volunteer Fire 
Department. "It would have saved two people's lives. The same sort of thing is 
going to keep happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the four-lane highway was backed up for more than an hour in both 
directions as authorities attempted to clear the mangled wreckage from the 
roadway.

SHOP TALK: FIRMS CAN BAN HOLIDAY WORK, REQUIRE MAKEUP TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: My husband works for a large company that makes its employees make 
up the time they take off for national holidays. Workers don't get the choice 
of working the holiday either. How cheap can a company get? Have you heard this 
before? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.L., Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Companies are allowed to prohibit work on a national holiday, to pay 
compensation for the holiday and to require employees to make up the time 
later. They are restricted, however, as to how the work is to be made up. 
</P>
<P>
 The employer cannot require a non-exempt employee to work more than eight 
hours in any day or more than 40 hours in any week, along with other 
requirements, without paying appropriate overtime compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt employees have flexibility in work schedules to meet productivity 
requirements of the employer. But there is a risk that the exempt status may be 
destroyed if an employer requires an exempt employee to make up a day's missed 
time on another day or to give credit on one day for excess time worked on 
another. If that happens, the employer might have to comply with all of the 
rules for non-exempt status, including premium payment for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 If an employee is not able to make up the time on a Saturday or a Sunday 
because of religious beliefs or family care commitments, the employer must 
reasonably accommodate such concerns to avoid legal liability.

 Question: I voluntarily quit a job under much duress. It's been about two 
years. Is there a time limit on trying to do something legally about the 
situation? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.S., Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The time limit for filing a lawsuit for employment discrimination is 
one year, so you are too late to file such a claim. You may still be able to 
file a lawsuit for "constructive termination" in breach of contract, but you 
face a number of significant hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
 First, you will have to show that you and your former employer had a contract 
under which you could not be terminated except for cause. This would not have 
to be an explicit, written contract, but you would have to be able to prove 
that your former employer had a policy or practice of not terminating people 
without a good reason.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, you would have to show more than that your job was stressful. You 
would have to show that your former employer's treatment of you was so 
egregious that a reasonable person in a similar position would have had no 
choice but to resign.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, if the duress to which you refer was your boss's criticism of your 
work, you would have to show more than just that you do not believe the 
criticism was warranted. You would have to show that your former employer 
deliberately made up false reasons to criticize you in an attempt to make you 
quit.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you may have a time problem as well. The time limit for lawsuits 
based on oral contracts is two years and though the limit for a lawsuit based 
on a written contract is four years, in order to qualify for the longer limit 
you would have to rely substantially on any written policies of your former 
employer to make your case.

 Question: When you leave a company before completing a full year, are you paid 
prorated vacation time? I'll be leaving one month short of my sixth year and 
should be entitled to two weeks' vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.B., Rossmoor 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no employer obligation to provide vacation benefits for their 
employees. It is, however, among the most common of benefits provided. Any 
legal rights to such benefits would depend on whether vacation benefits are 
included as a provision in an employment contract, a collective bargaining 
agreement or stated as a written employer policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacation policies vary, but typically employers establish vacation benefits 
that are earned or accrued over the course of a year of employment (e.g. two 
weeks -- 10 days -- of vacation for each year of service). If your employer has 
established such a policy, you need to determine the amount of vacation time 
provided for each year of service. You also need to determine how much vacation 
time you have already taken.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm assuming that you have exhausted allowable vacation for the first five 
years of service but have not taken any vacation time for the sixth year. If 
so, you would be entitled to receive a prorated portion of vacation for the 
sixth year (11/12 of the sixth year's vacation earned). Review your company's 
policy and practice on vacation benefits. If after careful review you determine 
you are eligible for partial vacation pay, discuss the issue with your employer 
and request payment.

 Question: For nine months, I have been allowed to work 10 hours a day, four 
days a week. No one else in my department does, although the option is there. I 
was recently told that I had to go back to a five-day-a-week schedule because 
it was illegal for me to be the only one in the department to work the four-day 
schedule. Is there such a law?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes, in a way. The California Industrial Welfare Commission Orders, 
which apply to virtually all employees in California, require employers to pay 
to non-exempt employees a premium pay of 1 1/2 times the regular rate for all 
hours over eight daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The orders contain an exception for employers who want to have a recognized 
work unit on a schedule of 10 hours a day for four days a week. But an employer 
is entitled to that exemption only if it conducts a vote among the employees 
affected. A two-thirds majority of them must then support that schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that your employer never held such a vote and that it has not been 
paying you premium pay for hours worked in excess of eight hours daily, your 
employer is probably correct in what it has told you. You may have a claim 
against your employer for overtime pay worked in the past under that schedule.

 Question: What exactly constitutes age discrimination and how do you prove it? 
I am a few months past 60 and have worked in a sales territory in Southern 
California for 33 years. My present manager told others that I was too old to 
be fired. This statement was made less than three months after we met. It was 
followed by statements to me such as, "If you can't change, quit."  
</P>
<P>
 She admitted making the statement about my age, but apologized -- not so much 
for saying it but because I found out she said it. I have seen a doctor twice 
because of the stress she has caused me this past year. She does not like to 
talk to me directly but uses voice mail or a district manager to pass on 
messages. What recourse might I have? 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.S., Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Workplace discrimination on the basis of age against those at least 40 
years old is prohibited. However, to sue for age discrimination you must show 
that you were let go, demoted or were the object of some other adverse job 
decision. You have not indicated whether any adverse change in your job has 
been made by your employer.  
</P>
<P>
 If such a change has occurred, you may have grounds for age discrimination. As 
an alternative, you may be able to argue that your manager is acting in an 
extreme and outrageous manner so as to cause you severe emotional distress.

 Question: To what degree is a major employer obligated to adjust work 
schedules to help a worker participate in a van pool? I'm usually scheduled to 
work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and every third month my shift begins and ends 
30 minutes later. The van pool at my company arrives at the office at 7:30 a.m. 
and departs at 4 p.m. I would need my supervisor to shift my permanent schedule 
in order to take advantage of the van pool. Only one other person in my 
department works an earlier shift, but that person would not trade with me. My 
boss says he can't afford to adjust the schedule. Is there anything I can do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.M., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The South Coast Air Quality Management District requires companies 
with more than 100 employees to adopt a ride-sharing program. However, it is up 
to each employer to devise and implement its own program. There are no 
particular requirements with respect to how such a program is implemented.  
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, this problem is one that you will just have to work out with your 
supervisor. Perhaps you could find someone else in your neighborhood who has a 
schedule similar to yours, and establish your own ride-sharing arrangement.

LAW FIRMS LEAVING WESTSIDE OFFICES AS THEY CUT BACK; REAL ESTATE: STAFFS BEING 
CONSOLIDATED DOWNTOWN, WHERE RENTS ARE A BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K.H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Unlike blue jeans, office space is not designed to shrink to fit -- a fact 
painfully clear to many Southern California law firms, which make up a 
significant chunk of the area's top-dollar tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of firms, having too much office space is only the beginning of 
the problem. The rest is that today, sub-lease rates for their excess space in 
Downtown Los Angeles office buildings are at rock-bottom, compared to 
peak-market prices they are paying on leases dating back to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And the costs of excess real estate becomes magnified as firms, despite some 
upturn recently in business, strive to operate in a new environment of 
much-lower margins and fee-savvy clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the way things are going, law firms just can't operate as loosely as 
they once did," said one law firm consultant. "They've got to be more careful, 
and if they can save money here and there, they've got to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which dropped in size from about 700 to 620 attorneys 
over the course of the recession, said last week that it is considering closing 
down its Century City office next year. The 75 attorneys and their support 
staffs now in the Century Plaza Towers would be moved Downtown, where the 
state's biggest law firm occupies 10 floors in the Wells Fargo Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another firm, Sidley & Austin, recently closed its Century City office, 
consolidating its staffs Downtown; Cleveland-based Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue 
also closed its Westside offices this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms that were experiencing unlimited growth during the boom years of the 
mid- to late-1980s -- and expected it to continue indefinitely -- locked 
themselves into leases with what today are very high rates. The deals also 
called for the firms to take on even more space over the terms of the leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many of these firms have slimmed down and -- like dieters stuck 
with big-waisted trousers -- faced difficult alterations. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gibson, Dunn's lease on its Century City office space does not expire 
for another eight years, the outlook for subletting that space is better than 
for its excess space Downtown. In Century City, where the best offices command 
a premium, vacancy rates are at 15%, according to the CB Commercial real estate 
firm. Downtown, vacancy rates are pegged at 24%, twice what experts consider as 
optimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably could sublease their space on the Westside at higher rates than 
Downtown," said Cathy Schloessman, senior vice president for CB Commercial's 
western division. "Another important consideration is that it's cheaper to have 
one office than two, because of efficiencies of scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for office space Downtown have dropped as low as $9 per square foot, 
with an average of $13 to $16, Schloessman said. Some of the law firms are 
paying as much as $30 to $35 for each of the tens of thousands of square feet 
they occupy Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 While other major firms that have offices both Downtown and on the Westside -- 
including Loeb & Loeb and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker -- in the past have 
discussed consolidating Downtown, none say they now are considering it. For 
firms that have significant entertainment law practices, a Westside office is 
pretty much a necessity, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "every firm is looking at its operating expenses with a magnifying glass," 
said Steven Bay, a senior vice president with the commercial real estate firm 
Julien J. Studley Inc. Office costs account for 7% to 10% of the average firm's 
budget, and those with too much space are working to fill it -- most often 
through subletting to other businesses. Where the Lawyers Are 
</P>
<P>
 While office space in Century City continues to command a premium, Downtown 
Los Angeles' vacancy rate has climbed into the danger zone, driving rental 
rates down. As they consolidate, law firms and other businesses are finding it 
more cost-efficient to fill up unused Downtown space and sublet their Westside 
offices. 05,22,15,14,09,08 *2*Available office space *2*(millions of square

BIG CELLULAR-PHONE FRAUD RING BROKEN UP; CRIME: GLENDALE POLICE ARREST OWNER OF 
LOS ANGELES STORE AND CUSTOMERS BRINGING IN 'CLONED' PHONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Relying on an impromptu sting operation, Glendale police have broken up what 
allegedly was one of the largest and most active cellular-phone fraud rings in 
Southern California, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting the owner of a Los Angeles cellular phone store Friday 
afternoon, police took control of the business' operations -- nabbing customers 
as they came in either to purchase illegal phones or bring phones back to be 
reprogrammed, according to sources familiar with the operation. In addition to 
a number of arrests, more than 50 reprogrammed cellular phones were seized and 
thousands of dollars in specialized computer and cellular equipment 
confiscated, said Steve Crosby, director of external affairs for L.A. Cellular, 
one of the main providers of cellular telephone service in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ring allegedly "cloned" cellular phones, a process in which the 
phone is illegally altered so that calling charges end up on the bills of 
legitimate subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Lt. Ray Edey acknowledged the operation but declined to 
comment further in advance of a news conference scheduled for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Cellular officials say "clone shops" set themselves up as mini telephone 
companies, charging $60 to $100 a month for illegal cellular phone service. 
When the illegal calls are discovered, the phone is deactivated. Customers then 
must return to the store and have the phone reprogrammed to enable the illegal 
phone service to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say cellular-phone fraud has reached epidemic 
proportions in Southern California, the nation's largest mobile-phone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Chris Christopher of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said law-enforcement agencies are making about one arrest per day of suspected 
cellular phone cloners and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody buys these cloned phones, from mechanics to doctors," he said. 
"It's across the map." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of cellular phone companies said some electronic countermeasures 
being put in service are only now beginning to stem the tide of phone cloning. 
Several such measures are not yet fully operational.

HOT JOBS: THE EYES HAVE IT FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When patients visit the ophthalmology practice of Blau, Kaplan & Secor in 
Huntington Beach, medical assistant Colleen O'Connell is often the first to 
help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to take the patient's medical history and conduct the basic eye 
tests that everyone who has ever had their eyes examined is familiar with, like 
visual acuity and peripheral vision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, 21, also answers basic questions and prepares the equipment the 
doctor will need to treat the patient. When a patient is scheduled to have 
surgery, O'Connell makes sure that he or she knows what lab tests need to be 
completed ahead of time and what medications to take afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I help with the paperwork and make sure they know when and where to go on the 
day of the surgery. Afterward, I call them to see how they are doing," said 
O'Connell, who has been a medical assistant for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this, I worked as an assistant manager in a restaurant. This is 
completely different, but I am still required to work under pressure. It gets 
very busy here sometimes," said O'Connell, who often assists with as many as 40 
patients a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical assistants need to be able to soothe anxious patients and make them 
comfortable during medical procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be friendly and answer as many questions as I can before the doctor 
comes in. Sometimes it helps just to have someone to chat with," O'Connell 
said. OCCUPATION: Medical assistant 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Duties in doctors' offices vary according to the type of 
practice but usually include gathering basic medical information, such as blood 
pressure, temperature, visual data and patient medical history. Assistants also 
sterilize and prepare instruments and have the basic materials needed ready in 
advance. They assist the doctor during office medical procedures and answer 
patients' questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: The minimum requirement is a high school diploma, but most 
have some college background. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of medical assistants in Orange County is 
expected to increase 12.2%, to 2,570. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $8 to $15 per hour 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Medical assistants report satisfaction from helping patients and 
making sure office visits go smoothly. Most work weekdays and have medical and 
retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: They must witness medical procedures and handle patients experiencing 
various degrees of pain and anxiety. Those working for a group practice assist 
more than one doctor and must be able to handle multiple tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Some become office managers or practice administrators, who 
oversee the overall functioning of a doctor's office, including scheduling and 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I like learning new things, and this job has provided the 
opportunity to see and observe all kinds of interesting things. I also like 
helping make patients comfortable." -- Colleen O'Connell, medical assistant

L.A. MARCH AGAINST PROP. 187 DRAWS 70,000; IMMIGRATION: AN ESTIMATED 10,000 
PROTESTERS COME FROM O.C. -- HEART OF PRO-PROPOSITION EFFORT -- TO OPPOSE 
MEASURE.

<P>
 In one of the largest mass protests in the city's history, an estimated 70,000 
demonstrators marched from the Eastside to downtown on Sunday in boisterous 
condemnation of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative, and 
its best-known advocate, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition is not against the illegal (immigrant), it's against 
children," declared Salvador Alendar, a 32-year-old textile factory worker and 
Mexican native who carried his 2-year-old daughter, Lisbeth, on his shoulders 
throughout the march's almost four-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sentiment repeated by other outraged marchers and by the dozens of 
speakers who took to the elevated podium set up at the corner of Spring and 1st 
streets, just across from City Hall, and addressed the multitudes assembled 
beneath an azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to send a message to the rest of the nation that California will 
not stand on a platform of bigotry, racism and scapegoating," declared Joe 
Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the 
black civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, president of the Santa Ana chapter of the League of United 
Latin American Citizens, estimated that as many as 10,000 protesters came from 
Orange County -- the heart of the pro-Proposition 187 movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always talked about the awakening of the Latino community," he 
said. "What 187 has done is awaken a tiger." 
</P>
<P>
 Montez and other activists predicted that the march would ignite an 11th-hour 
opposition campaign to defeat the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The march was the latest in a series of anti-187 demonstrations, but polls 
have shown continued strong support for the initiative. By contrast, 
proposition backers have run a near-invisible campaign from their Orange County 
base, mostly responding to news media inquiries and appearing at forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, among other things, would bar illegal immigrants from 
receiving public school educations and a range of other state- and 
county-funded benefits, including non-emergency health care and a variety of 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
 March organizers said more than 100,000 participated Sunday, but police 
estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 took part. Still, it was the largest protest 
gathering here in decades, surpassing Vietnam War-era demonstrations including 
the historic 1970 Eastside march for Chicano rights that turned violent and 
left three dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, who heads an advocacy group called Los Amigos of Orange County, 
compared the march Sunday to the historic civil rights marches of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was historic," said the Anaheim businessman. "It was a piece of 
history that needed to be written." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no serious injuries and no arrests on Sunday. Hundreds of 
volunteers helped to guide the orderly, regimented crowd, which formed a column 
more than a mile long, a roiling river of banners, flags and placards moving 
triumphantly down Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, named for the late United Farm 
Workers union founder. Eastside sidewalks were packed and impromptu vendors set 
up shop selling "No on 187" T-shirts. Another shirt declared, "No Re-pete," a 
reference to Gov. Wilson's reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's image was burned in effigy near City Hall during the speeches 
and placed in a coffin, and depicted elsewhere on placards, T-shirts and with a 
noose around his neck, as a pig, and in other pejorative images. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite participants' anger, the mood on Sunday was mostly exuberant, leavened 
with ethnic pride. Flags of Mexico, El Salvador and other Latin American 
nations were everywhere. The event had been heavily promoted in the 
Spanish-language media and at community organizations statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers converged across from City Hall where, before speakers addressed the 
throng, three horn players performed a mariachi riff of "The Star-Spangled 
Banner" to thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vast majority of participants were Latinos, reflecting the 
region's large immigrant population from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, 
non-Latino whites, Asian Americans, African Americans and others also took 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who says the immigrants of California are not working and are on 
welfare is lying," Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who made a spirited 
bid against Wilson in the Republican gubernatorial primary race, told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers included Assemblyman Richard G. Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and 
City Councilmen Richard Alarcon, Mike Hernandez and Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers called the protest part of a multiethnic campaign to reject growing 
anti-immigrant "hysteria" nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a parade, this is a social movement," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, 
an Eastside activist and leading march strategist, who noted planners' desire 
to turn around what he called an anti-immigrant tide and win official 
recognition of immigrants' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, attention is focused on next month's California 
elections and two critical contests: Wilson's reelection effort and the heated 
battle over Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was the favored target of Sunday's demonstration, depicted repeatedly 
in posters and speeches as a "racist" who has made illegal immigration a 
centerpiece of his campaign in a cynical effort to woo the non-Latinos who 
dominate California's voting rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson dismissed the harsh criticisms and downplayed the 
march's importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are demonstrating represent a relatively small minority of 
Californians," said Dan Schnur, a Wilson campaign spokesman. "Most Californians 
understand the innate unfairness of providing services for individuals who live 
in this state illegally at the same time services are being cut for those who 
live here legally." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson himself, during a 45-minute address Sunday to an audience of some 400 
in the retirement community of Leisure World in Laguna Hills, did not mention 
the protest when he blamed illegal immigrants for costing the state billions of 
dollars in services that should be reserved for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to provide services to our own legal residents," Wilson said. 
He declared that illegal immigrants absorb 10% of the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that is terribly unfair. . . . I say we should end those services to 
illegal immigrants. We are . . . rewarding people for violating U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from educators, medical groups, organized labor and others, 
polls have shown strong support for Proposition 187 among likely voters, 
including many Latinos. Proponents say it will deter new illegal immigration 
and force those already here to return home -- a premise disputed by opponents, 
who say the measure would leave hundreds of thousands of youths without 
education while contributing to the spread of disease by cutting access to 
non-emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's strong support, analysts say, underlines a widespread 
preoccupation about the fast-paced immigration that has drastically altered 
California's demographic mix since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 strategists acknowledge a difficult uphill battle, particularly 
because even though anti-Proposition 187 forces have apparently raised more 
than twice as much money as proponents, fund-raising efforts have so far fallen 
short of the kind of money needed for an all-out television blitz against the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the anti-187 coalition -- including mainstream Latino groups such as 
the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- argued that a 
massive march barely three weeks before the election was a bad tactic, and 
attempted to scuttle the event. Several Latino activists privately expressed 
fears that a sea of brown faces marching through Downtown Los Angeles would 
only antagonize many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, Taxpayers Against 187 -- the umbrella organization spearheading 
the campaign against the initiative whose member groups include teachers, 
medical professionals and union activists -- did not take part in organizing 
the march. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, march organizers -- a statewide coalition of activists grouped 
together as the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and Civic 
Participation -- opted to go ahead with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called the demonstration a success, as it provided a forum for 
opponents -- citizens and non-citizens alike -- to express their frustrations. 
They said it sets the stage for increased immigrant participation in future 
campaigns, electoral and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was concern and disagreement based on what was the best way of 
defeating 187, but I don't think you can deny people the right to participate," 
said Councilman Hernandez, who was among the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so impressed was Ron Prince, chairman of the pro-187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather's nice, they can do that if they want to," Prince responded 
when contacted at the campaign's Orange County offices. "I'm sure a lot of 
people were there to see the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The march, he predicted, would bolster his cause by focusing attention on the 
problem of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people look at the issue, they understand the problem and they tend to 
support Proposition 187," said Prince, an accountant in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 While the march turnout was impressive, many participants were foreign 
nationals unable to vote. Among them was Rafael, a 27-year-old illegal 
immigrant who hoisted a Mexican flag as he marched near the head of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives are here now, and we're not going back to Mexico no matter what 
happens," said Rafael, a factory worker and father of three, including two 
U.S.-born sons and an undocumented 6-year-old boy now attending public school. 
"I work hard, and I don't think it's fair that my son should be thrown out of 
school," Rafael said as he marched.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the many Asian Americans participating was Han Kyong Kim, who came with 
a group of Korean Americans. "If this proposition passes," said Kim, a 
businessman, "all immigrants will be suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's march follows a similar demonstration in May that drew between 8,000 
and 25,000 protesters to Downtown Los Angeles, before Proposition 187 was 
placed on the ballot.

GULF WAR LEAVES LEGACY OF HARD TIMES FOR IRAQI PEOPLE; MIDEAST: THE EFFECTS OF 
U.N. SANCTIONS AND INFLATION TAKE TOLL. CHILD MORTALITY RISES AS FOOD SHORTAGES 
PERSIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At dusk, as the minarets of its mosques are silhouetted against a rose-colored 
sun sinking in the autumn haze, this Mideast capital with its exotic skyline 
can still cast an enchanting spell. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the hot, gritty light of day, from the bleak Syrian desert in western 
Iraq to the banks of the Tigris River that bisects the city, a harsh reality 
takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the heady days filled with bellicose talk of Iraq's having annexed 
Kuwait as its 19th province. Gone from the street markets are the mountains of 
loot taken from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The souks no longer brim with bins of pistachios, almonds and raisins, sides 
of mutton and lamb, Western cigarettes and a profusion of consumer electronics 
equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the weekend flea market downtown has become nothing but a sprawling 
bazaar of old clothes and castaway household knickknacks that can be sold for 
food money. 
</P>
<P>
 From the empty open-air fish cafes along downtown Baghdad's riverfront to a 
forlorn outpost near the Jordanian border, the ravages of Iraq's Gulf War 
defeat and the ensuing, grinding economic sanctions are evident all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Abu Nawas Street, on one bank of the Tigris, is a line of normally 
popular restaurants that specialize in a dish called mazgouf , or spiced whole 
fish. But on Sunday, a lone operator sat staring vacantly over a tamarisk wood 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sidewalks, and in the narrow, dusty alleys, the baleful vendors are 
lucky to have a few open packs of cigarettes to peddle, one cigarette at a 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 Along busy Sadoun Street, a few fruit and vegetable stands remain, but most 
Baghdadis hardly even cast a glance as they grimly go about their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good, but all that is out of reach for most Iraqis," said one 
European diplomat here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such jarring contrasts between past affluence and present hardship are 
everywhere in this nation of 18 million people almost four years after Iraq's 
defeat, followed by the most severe international economic embargo in recent 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government made a new appeal Sunday for the lifting of sanctions, with a 
senior health official warning of "imminent catastrophe" for Iraqi children 
who, he said, are dying of malnutrition at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawi Murqus, the undersecretary of health, told the Iraqi News Agency that 
29,558 children younger than 5 have died this year -- compared to 8,903 in all 
of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at first glance much of Baghdad seems to have recovered surprisingly 
well from its devastating Gulf War defeat. Most of the bombed-out structures, 
including the towering International Telephone & Telegraph building, have been 
rebuilt. There are even new high-rises dotting the skyline. And all but two of 
the 11 bridges that span the Tigris have been completely repaired and are 
choked once more with automobiles and buses.  
</P>
<P>
 "In this aspect, they have done well," said another diplomat, whose embassy 
here has close ties to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk to an Iraqi here and there and a glimmer of another truth begins to 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 An ailing 60-year-old grandfather, call him Adnan, confided in the dark of 
night that he is working harder than ever. He would prefer not to. But he still 
has a wife and five daughters at home, the youngest only 8. Life has been 
especially tough, he sighed, after food prices shot up 300% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And just this month, the government reduced food ration packages of rice, 
flour, oil, sugar and the like by more than 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet, Adnan shuttles passengers between here and Amman, Jordan -- 
a rugged 12-hour drive across the desolate Syrian desert -- always stuffing his 
trunk on the return trip with goods regularly available in Jordan. The only 
thing that remains cheap in Iraq, he said with a laugh, is gasoline.  
</P>
<P>
 With rampant inflation, an unprecedented black-market currency exchange is 
flourishing, with transactions often conducted with all the furtiveness of 
major drug deals, complete with calls made from pay phones and late-night 
rendezvous in shadowy neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may not need a cart to carry all your dinars, but a sack helps," quipped 
one East European diplomat here.  
</P>
<P>
 Only four years ago, the Iraqi dinar commanded as much as $3; now $1 can fetch 
up to 600 dinars in the right places. Inflation has reached 24,000% a year, 
even by a recent official estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A restaurant meal (with no liquor, which has been banned) can cost 3,000 
dinars or more -- probably beyond the reach of most of Baghdad's 7 million 
residents, who subsist largely on fixed incomes. Two chickens, for example, may 
deplete an average schoolteacher's monthly income.  
</P>
<P>
 And crime has become a growing source of concern. One Baghdadi, a self-avowed 
good Samaritan, said the other night that he no longer stops after dark "for 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, foreign journalists on a government-sponsored bus trip to the 
southern port of Basra were beaten and robbed on a deserted highway by armed 
thugs.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the greatest wariness among Iraqis seems reserved for the possibility 
of new military confrontation with a U.S.-led coalition.  
</P>
<P>
 Near the Jordanian border crossing, a young Iraqi customs official, stamping 
entry approval on a passport, whispers to an American: "No war with Iraq. 
Please? War no good." 
</P>
<P>
 He leans forward from behind a grimy counter and is about to say more but 
pulls back as a co-worker passes. The clerk quickly returns to his task, 
scooping up the next batch of passports for processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such a pervasive clandestine aura, the tensions arising from Iraq's 
latest confrontation with the outside world seem nowhere near the level of four 
years ago, when war loomed.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, diplomats said Sunday, there has been very little tension here except 
for a day or two, and that was caused more by the Clinton Administration's 
quick show of force and aggressive talk than by the unexpected deployment of 
Iraqi troops near Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 One European official, who asked to remain anonymous, said that several days 
before the Iraqi troop movements were actually under way, Iraqi officials 
circulated "rumors" in diplomatic circles of the impending deployment -- with 
the caveat that it would be merely a "military exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I believe that, but that's what we were told," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is growing speculation among diplomats here that Hussein deployed his 
elite Republican Guard troops precisely as a gambit to refocus world attention 
on the plight of his nation. That assessment was shared privately by some 
officials in the Iraqi government working with foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life here may be hard," said one diplomat, "but it's rarely ever dull." 
</P>
<P>
 * WARNING FROM U.S.: Baghdad was cautioned against threatening Kuwait again.

L.A. MARCH AGAINST PROP. 187 DRAWS 70,000; IMMIGRATION: PROTESTERS CONDEMN 
WILSON FOR BACKING INITIATIVE THAT THEY SAY PROMOTES 'RACISM, SCAPEGOATING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In one of the largest mass protests in the city's history, an estimated 70,000 
demonstrators marched from the Eastside to Downtown on Sunday in boisterous 
condemnation of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative, and 
its best-known advocate, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition is not against the illegal (immigrant), it's against 
children," declared Salvador Alendar, a 32-year-old textile factory worker and 
Mexican native who carried his 2-year-old daughter, Lisbeth, on his shoulders 
throughout the march's almost four-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sentiment repeated by other outraged marchers and by the dozens of 
speakers who took to the elevated podium set up at the corner of Spring and 1st 
streets, just across from City Hall, and addressed the multitudes assembled 
beneath an azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to send a message to the rest of the nation that California will 
not stand on a platform of bigotry, racism and scapegoating," declared Joe 
Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the 
black civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The march was the latest in a series of anti-187 demonstrations, but polls 
have shown continued strong support for the initiative. By contrast, 
proposition backers have run a near-invisible campaign from their Orange County 
base, mostly responding to news media inquiries and appearing at forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, among other things, would bar illegal immigrants from 
receiving public school educations and a range of other state- and 
county-funded benefits, including non-emergency health care and a variety of 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
 March organizers said more than 100,000 participated Sunday, but police 
estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 took part. Still, it was the largest protest 
gathering here in decades, surpassing Vietnam War-era demonstrations including 
the historic 1970 Eastside march for Chicano rights that turned violent and 
left three dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no serious injuries and no arrests on Sunday. Hundreds of 
volunteers helped to guide the orderly, regimented crowd, which formed a column 
more than a mile long, a roiling river of banners, flags and placards moving 
triumphantly down Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, named for the late United Farm 
Workers union founder. Eastside sidewalks were packed and impromptu vendors set 
up shop selling "No on 187" T-shirts. Another shirt declared, "No Re-pete," a 
reference to Gov. Wilson's reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's image was burned in effigy near City Hall during the speeches 
and placed in a coffin, and depicted elsewhere on placards, T-shirts and with a 
noose around his neck, as a pig, and in other pejorative images. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite participants' anger, the mood on Sunday was mostly exuberant, leavened 
with ethnic pride. Flags of Mexico, El Salvador and other Latin American 
nations were everywhere. The event had been heavily promoted in the 
Spanish-language media and at community organizations statewide.

WHITE HOUSE SEES GLIMMER AMID ELECTION GLOOM

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a solid week of campaigning under their belts and just over three more to 
go before voters cast their ballots, White House officials have shed some of 
the gloom that hung over their view of this year's midterm election. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some glimmers that we're beginning to turn a corner," a White House 
official said Sunday. "At least," said another official, "we've gotten beyond 
the stage of feeling we had to just hide here and say nothing. We're back on 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 After seeming uncertain for weeks about what to say to voters in the wake of a 
disastrous congressional finale, President Clinton now has a theme he is 
comfortable with -- that voters should not allow Republicans to return the 
country to the economic policies of the 1980s -- and a clear target, the GOP's 
"contract with America" to shoot at. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a week of good news on the foreign policy front -- the 
apparent backing down of Saddam Hussein in Iraq coupled with the return of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti -- seems to have boosted Clinton, at 
least temporarily, in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as his short-term prospects begin to brighten a bit, however, Clinton's 
aides have begun to acknowledge just how grim the long-term view appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats may escape this fall's elections without the complete meltdown 
many of them feared, although even that prognosis remains clouded. And, looking 
ahead, Clinton himself may well be able to win reelection; his poll ratings, 
while bad, are not significantly worse than Ronald Reagan's two years before he 
overwhelmingly won a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's presidency, in the view of the President and his key aides, was 
always supposed to be about more than mere survival. Clinton came into office 
with a clear project in mind -- to rebuild American faith in government, a 
faith that had been shattered by the Vietnam War, Watergate, social decay in 
the cities and two decades of slow income growth for middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 By achieving that goal, Clinton believed, he could build a new, stable 
Democratic majority to replace the old coalition that was assembled under 
Franklin D. Roosevelt and crumbled under Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured by that standard, Clinton aides admit, their Administration so far 
has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really lost two years," said a White House official in a recent 
interview. "We're no closer than when we started." 
</P>
<P>
 That failure, so far, does not mean that voters in large numbers have begun to 
embrace conservative Republicanism. Rather, as has been the case for the last 
several years, large chunks of the electorate remain rootless and alienated 
from both parties. That alienation seems likely to lead to below normal voter 
turnout this year, although some pollsters predict that people will show up in 
large numbers to vote against all incumbents.  
</P>
<P>
 Some recent polls, and the experiences of candidates in disparate parts of the 
country, indicate that the GOP may have erred in trying to turn these elections 
into an ideological referendum instead of focusing simply on Clinton's 
unpopularity. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials hope that is the case. "It took through last weekend for 
the Republican tactics to begin sinking in" with voters, said Clinton aide 
George Stephanopoulos. But in recent days, he asserted, surveys by White House 
pollster Stanley B. Greenberg have begun to show Democrats regaining some 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Republicans concede that point, while still insisting their party is 
heading for an excellent showing in November's balloting. "They've gained back 
a point or two," said Republican pollster William McInturff, "but we're still 
going to end up with the highest number of seats we've had (in the House) in a 
generation. I'll go home happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although Democrats find they are doing better now that they are 
finally out of Washington and home campaigning full time, the party continues 
to face rough prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, for example, where Republicans need to pick up seven seats in 
order to gain a majority, six Democratic senators are retiring, vacating seats 
in Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arizona. As of now, the party 
cannot claim a solid lead in any of those contests. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the House, while Democrats point to local circumstances that might 
allow them to win many close contests nationwide, they concede that a strong 
Republican tide could still make such calculations irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, they admit that Americans have turned deeply sour on precisely the 
issue on which Clinton had hoped to make the most headway -- faith in 
government's ability to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls this summer and fall consistently have shown that two years after 
Clinton's election, Americans are more skeptical of government than ever. 
Indeed, in state after state, even Democratic candidates for high government 
office are running, not by promising that they can do more for their 
constituents, but by pledging to do less to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's own "outsider" image, which he carefully cultivated during his 
campaign, has seriously eroded. So too has the voters' belief that he 
personifies a "different kind of Democrat," one not wedded to the 
big-government solutions of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Clinton hoped to stabilize a new Democratic majority by winning over 
a significant share of the Americans who backed independent candidate Ross 
Perot in the last election, the President's support today stands at almost 
exactly the same 43% that he carried in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Clinton aides insist that part of their problem stems from an inevitable 
conflict between politics and policy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they argue, Clinton pledged in his campaign to reduce the size of 
the federal budget deficit. And in fact, as a result of the budget bill he 
pushed through Congress last year, raising taxes on well-off Americans and 
cutting spending on many programs, the deficit has gone down dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Clinton's political advisers had warned, while many Americans dislike 
deficits in theory, they dislike the practical steps needed to reduce them even 
more. The deficit -- an abstract accounting matter -- may have profound 
long-term consequences, but it has little immediate impact on people's lives. 
Tax increases and spending cuts, by contrast, cause immediate pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, successful initiatives such as the ban on 19 types of assault 
weapons and the Brady law, which requires a waiting period for purchases of 
handguns, reflect the political axiom that people who oppose an action almost 
always do so with more intensity than those who support an action. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Clinton's political problems are "the price we pay for keeping those 
promises," Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just say we failed politically without also noting that we have had 
some achievements on substance," another official said. "Eventually, I think 
those will begin to pay political benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say Clinton simply misjudged the political environment. "The 
general mood of the American electorate is quite skeptical that government will 
improve things. Clinton is just out of sync with that popular mood," said 
William Niskannen, a conservative theorist at the Cato Institute and a former 
economic adviser to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to change the public's mind on such a fundamental issue, "he 
over-reached," Niskannen said, "and that's a good bit of the reason why his own 
party's candidates are running away from him."

ARISTIDE QUICKLY GETS TO WORK RUNNING NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED and TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flags still waved, the troops remained on the streets and crowds milled 
about the Presidential Palace on Sunday, but President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
spent his first full day back in Haiti out of sight, attending to the dull 
routine of governing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to diplomats, Aristide advisers and Haitian political figures, his 
first tasks will be to name a new prime minister and Cabinet and find the money 
to restore a bureaucracy that had become the personal servant of the military 
over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who was accused of indecision and even sloth during the seven months 
he ruled before the Sept. 30, 1991, coup that sent him into exile, immediately 
went to work Saturday after an official luncheon, talking to political and 
parliamentary leaders well into the night and again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide told reporters on his Saturday flight from Washington to 
Port-au-Prince that he had selected a prime minister but had not decided when 
to announce the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he indicated, he wanted to point Haiti toward reconciliation and peace 
in order to convince the nation that his focus will not be the past and 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice words," said Franz Voltaire, an aide to caretaker Prime Minister Robert 
Malval, "and obviously the guiding principle of the government, but what he is 
doing now is looking at the hard work of translating words into action." 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister is a key figure in Haiti, actually more powerful on a 
day-to-day basis than the president, since he and his Cabinet set and 
administer policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aristide has selected someone from an original pool of six candidates, he 
has kept it a close secret, although many sources think it will be Smart 
Michele, a wealthy businessman who has maintained links with the generally 
anti-Aristide industrial sector while strongly backing the president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other key Cabinet nominations that diplomats say must come quickly are the 
ministries of finance and planning and the president of the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Aristide expects to get a quick infusion of money, then he has to name a 
financial team this week," said a U.N. financial expert. Most sources think the 
finance minister will be Leslie Delatour, a free-market advocate who has 
designed a long-range economic program approved by Aristide and the 
international lending agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning minister probably will be Voltaire's brother Leslie, an economic 
adviser to Aristide, while the Central Bank could be headed by Marie-Michele 
Rey, a veteran banker who was finance minister in Aristide's original 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Those selections would be accepted, even welcomed, by most of the business 
community, including those who approved if not actively backed the coup because 
of Aristide's alleged leftist political views. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible ministerial candidate who draws shudders of fear from 
businessmen, but also from diplomats and some moderate pro-Aristide Haitians, 
is Rene Preval, Aristide's original prime minister and current political 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 While Preval, a baker whose leftist views and vengeful politics led to a 
parliamentary conflict that finally led to the coup, was in the original list 
for prime minister, Aristide is said to have found a less controversial job for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Preval told reporters Sunday that he "will be in the government," a prospect 
that led one Haitian political consultant to Aristide to say: "Preval? Even if 
he is minister of sewage, that would be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 While Aristide virtually has to start from the beginning and concentrate on 
the essentials in forming a government and creating policy for a country left 
stripped bare economically by the military and its civilian henchmen, there are 
some emotional and philosophical issues he must settle soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most explosive are the related questions of amnesty, an 
investigation into the military rule and establishment of a new judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Schey, a Los Angeles human rights attorney who advises Aristide on legal 
matters, says the questions about amnesty concern how broad it should be and 
for what period. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey and other American advisers "are adamantly opposed to a blanket 
amnesty," he said, "particularly for crimes against humanity. That sends the 
wrong message," Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictions are that Aristide will issue a narrow amnesty covering the period 
from the coup to his return. A larger argument has developed over a "truth 
commission," an investigatory body that would probe human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Aristide advisers want the inquiry to be conducted by a government 
commission composed only of Haitians and to deal only with the coup and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Others prefer an international committee, probably organized by the United 
Nations and the Organization of American States, made up of foreigners. Its 
time frame would reach back to 1986 and the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier and 
finish with Aristide's return, thereby including Aristide's original seven 
months in office.  
</P>
<P>
 William O'Neil, another American human rights adviser to Aristide, said the 
decisions on amnesty and the truth commission would probably be delayed for a 
month or two "because the president wants to move cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, O'Neil said, having an investigation now would be pointless since 
there are no functioning courts or judges. "It will take at least a year before 
there will be any court system that could handle human rights cases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some slight indication Sunday that Aristide might move more quickly 
against military officers for human rights violations; an aide said some army 
and police personnel identified as those engaged in torture and murder might be 
arrested this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the expectations of many Haitians and journalists who drove from 
church to church hoping to pray with him, Aristide did not leave the 
Presidential Palace where he spent the night to attend Mass, attending services 
instead in a small chapel inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he has not left the palace since arriving there in triumph early 
Saturday afternoon to address the nation and pledge a government of peace and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the president's need to get to work, his private home is still being 
remodeled.

CALIFORNIA FIRMS ENJOY ROLLBACKS IN MEDICAL COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the city of Sacramento went shopping for medical insurance for its 4,000 
employees this year, it got a pleasant surprise: rate rollbacks of up to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other employers across the state -- from giant manufacturers to 
neighborhood retailers -- are also enjoying rate cuts, or significantly smaller 
increases. It is a striking turnabout from just three years ago, when 
California industry was bemoaning medical cost increases of 10% to 15% -- far 
higher than overall inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that almost all of our clients are seeing little or no increase in 
their cost of health care," said Robert B. Cliff, principal at A. Foster 
Higgins & Co., a Los Angeles employee benefits consultant. "It's remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 And a huge relief, especially in Southern California, where many companies are 
still struggling with the effects of a prolonged recession. Lower employee 
medical costs might provide companies with more money for other things, such as 
hiring more workers, developing new products or simply shoring up profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower rates "have very significantly taken the pressure off," said Paul 
Fearer, senior vice president at San Francisco-based Union Bank. "Health 
insurance is no longer the primary focus it once was. It feels a little more 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
 At some companies, lower insurance costs could mean $10 or $20 extra in 
paychecks each month, or additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But for hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, the cost 
advantages enjoyed by others are painful -- at least in the short term -- as 
they are forced to reduce their prices to win insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the breadth and size of insurance cost reductions in California are 
virtually unheard of in other parts of the country, but experts disagree on 
whether this achievement means that California is on the road to long-term 
reductions in the costs of health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is that in key California markets medical prices in the consumer 
price index are rising at a slower pace than the rate of increase for the 
nation as a whole. Nationally, medical prices rose 4.6% for the 12 months ended 
Aug. 30. If that trend holds for the rest of 1994, it would bring the lowest 
national medical cost increase in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, medical prices rose just 3.9% for 
the 12-month period. And in San Francisco prices rose 2.9% for the same period, 
according to the Health Care Price Index, a newsletter based in Santa Cruz. 
Overall, the U.S. inflation rate is about 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts point to several reasons for the California trend. One is the 
continued growth of thrifty health maintenance organizations and other "managed 
care" insurers, which promise cost-efficiency in exchange for limits on 
physician choice. About 12 million Californians -- or roughly half of all 
privately insured residents -- now belong to HMOs. Nearly 8 million others 
belong to other types of managed care health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, these insurers have been waging a fierce price war as they compete in 
bare-knuckled fashion for a piece of the nation's biggest health care market, 
experts say. That price war has spilled over into the hospital industry, where 
a severe oversupply of beds has left many hospitals hungry for patients -- and 
willing to sharply discount services to get them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, experts say many California employers have become more 
sophisticated, and tougher, negotiators when shopping for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care executives say the fact that many Californians are paying lower 
insurance premiums (or seeing smaller increases) is evidence that managed care 
and free market competition can reduce medical costs without government 
interference. Many of these executives opposed the large role that government 
would have had in President Clinton's moribund health reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us were very disappointed when we started to see government trying 
to get involved in reforming the health system," said Kurt Davis, head of 
investor relations for Foundation Health, a Sacramento-based HMO. "If Bill 
Clinton went to sleep for three or four years, I think he would wake up and 
find that reform of health care delivery was done." 
</P>
<P>
 HMO executive Roger Greaves says the California marketplace "is doing just 
what it's supposed to do. . . . It's called managed competition and if we can't 
(reduce costs), then we shouldn't be in business." Greaves is co-chairman and 
co-chief executive of Woodland Hills-based Health Systems International, which 
owns the Health Net HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some health care providers complain that insurers are not shouldering 
their share of the cost-reduction burden. Instead managed care companies are 
squeezing the profits of hospitals and doctors, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leonard Schaeffer (chairman of Blue Cross of California and its managed care 
subsidiary, WellPoint Health Networks) made more money last year than my whole 
hospital did!" said Gary Cottongim, chief executive of Redlands Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, two HMOs that the not-for-profit hospital has contracts with "put 
us on notice that they are looking for rollbacks on rates." One insurer, he 
said, has suggested that the hospital cut its daily room rate 10% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the 203-bed hospital was forced to announce its first layoff in 12 
years and has eliminated about 70 jobs -- or 10% of its staff -- overall. It 
has also trimmed costs by cutting some community service programs. 
Nevertheless, Cottongim says most expenses continue to grow, from employees' 
wages to utility bills to the cost of everyday supplies like surgical gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these cuts have directly affected the quality of care," he 
said. "But you reach a point where you do eliminate more services, you don't 
replace equipment and you can't improve your physical plant because the dollars 
aren't there. It hasn't happened yet, but it will if we continue to absorb the 
impact of these rollbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 As insurers demand price concessions, hospitals in competitive, urban markets 
are encountering a price war of their own as they vie for HMO patients to fill 
empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely competitive," said Glen Kazahaya, chief financial officer of 
St. Joseph Hospital-Orange. "If you don't reduce rates, the health plans tell 
you there is (another hospital) that can." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are also feeling the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Harlan Levine, a Los Angeles primary-care physician, said lower payments 
from insurers have cut his income and forced him to reduce his office staff. As 
more staff time is devoted to dealing with insurance company paperwork, he 
said, "that person can't answer phones and so there is less attention to 
patient services." 
</P>
<P>
 Most patients, he said, "are not informed about the insurance company cutbacks 
and they think the doctor is making the cuts. All this is leading to a schism 
between the patient and physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, huge premium rollbacks like the 22% cut negotiated by the city of 
Sacramento are highly unusual. Yet employers such as Hewlett-Packard Co., 
Safeway Stores, Stanford University, the University of California system and 
Pacific Telesis Group have struck deals to reduce medical premiums next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of California system will reduce its medical costs by $7 
million next year after negotiating rate cuts with its health plans. The 
90,000-employee system negotiated medical premium reductions of up to 10% for 
1995 after winning an 8% rollback this year, said Carole Swartz, director of 
employee benefits. The state system requires all health plans to bid on a 
standard package of benefits, and it pays 100% of the medical insurance costs 
for employees who select the lowest-priced plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have five grocery stores, you make sure they're all stocked with the 
same items, but then you tell them I'll only pay the lowest cost for those 
items. Suddenly, they all lower their prices," Swartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area Business Group, a private insurance-buying coalition whose 
members include Bank of America, Pacific Telesis and Safeway, recently 
negotiated medical premium reductions ranging from 5% to 10% with 16 HMOs. And 
earlier this year, CalPERS, the state employees pension fund, won a 1.1% 
decrease in premiums for its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree on whether many workers are benefiting from the slowdown in 
medical inflation in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Some point out that some employers have reduced their costs simply by trimming 
benefits and requiring workers to pay a larger share of the insurance premium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, employers are happy" about declining costs, said Robert Mofitt, deputy 
director of domestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington 
think tank. "They're lowering compensation without any increase in wages. . . . 
What that means (is that) employees are losing compensation arbitrarily." 
</P>
<P>
 But Glenn Melnick, a health policy analyst at the Santa Monica think tank RAND 
Corp., said workers stand to lose more when medical costs are escalating at a 
feverish pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers, when deciding whether to hire, take into account the total cost of 
those workers. If health insurance is going up rapidly, wages are depressed. If 
prices don't go up over the long run, more of those savings will show up in 
higher wages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Melnick and others believe California may be in for several more years 
of reduced medical premiums, no one knows for certain if the market changes 
occurring in the state will offer a permanent solution for achieving medical 
cost deflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me in the year 1999 that costs are still down and I'll believe it," said 
health care economist Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor at Princeton University. "I 
believe it's premature to say the California model is working and will be good 
for the rest of the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The California premium reductions are "all very tantalizing but the jury is 
still out . . . ," said Jack Rodgers, director of health policy economics at 
Price Waterhouse in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers noted that California still has to compete in a national market to 
recruit doctors and purchase equipment and drugs, "So there's a question how 
far one area can get ahead of the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 California still has a sizable share of the nation's uninsured: more than 6 
million residents lack health care coverage. And California is not immune to 
other forces that will help drive medical costs up, such as an aging 
population, which will increase demand for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor R. Fuchs, a Stanford University health economist, notes that prices are 
cyclical in the health insurance business, so the price slowdown in California 
may, in part, reflect the down side of a cycle. "We may be in a cycle where 
people are underpricing" to boost market share, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs added: "I'm not convinced that (health plans) know how to translate 
premium reductions into an actual lowering of health care costs. To do that, 
you either have to deliver fewer services, use fewer resources, or squeeze 
suppliers like the physicians, hospitals and drug companies. We really don't 
know yet whether true costs have gone down." 
</P>
<P>
 Alain C. Enthoven, a Stanford University business professor and the main 
theorist for the managed competition strategy for reforming health care, said 
insurance cycles may explain part of the cost reductions. But he said 
competition is forcing a restructuring of the state's health care system that 
is improving the cost-efficiencies to health plans, hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that enough employers are making the HMOs compete to 
provide value for the money, and giving them incentives to bring down costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of real restructuring and cost reduction in the health care 
system," he said. "I see hospitals actively working to re-engineer and simplify 
their work processes. And I think a lot more can be done."

<P>
 In a historic milestone in American Pentecostalism, an association of 
predominantly white Pentecostal denominations is poised to disband this week 
and erect a new multiethnic organization in its place.

<P>
 The new body, still to be named, would include the nation's leading African 
American Pentecostal denomination, the Church of God in Christ, as well as the 
Assemblies of God, the nation's largest predominantly white Pentecostal 
denomination. Between them, the two groups account for about 10 million of the 
estimated 15 million Pentecostals in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Pentecostals admit that the dismantling of the all-white 46-year-old 
Pentecostal Fellowship of North America is painfully late, coming as it does 30 
years after the tumultuous civil rights movement. However, they and outside 
observers call it the single most important development in the 88-year history 
of Pentecostal Christianity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dramatic. It's epochal," said Harvard University religion professor 
Harvey Cox, whose new book, "Fire From Heaven," traces the rise of Pentecostal 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Charles E. Blake of the West Angelus Church of God in Christ in Los 
Angeles said, "I cannot think of any comparable event in the life of the church 
that this would compare to." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the gathering, which opens in Memphis today, holds out the promise 
that a new generation of Pentecostals may now be willing to take their place in 
mainstream society and speak out on issues of pressing national importance, 
including poverty, racism and injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The) Memphis (conference) represents one kind of answer and (religious 
broadcaster Pat Robertson's) Christian Coalition represents another in a very 
different direction," Cox said. The coalition has maintained a high profile of 
political activism in conservative causes, from opposing gays in the military 
to arguing against President Clinton's health care proposal. The coalition has 
also fielded candidates for public office and Republican party posts at the 
county, state and national level. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism is the fastest growing Christian sect in the world, with 410 
million members, according to Cox. In the United States, they outnumber all but 
Southern Baptists, United Methodists and Roman Catholics. By the year 2010, Cox 
estimates, there will be more Pentecostals than all other non-Catholic 
Christians together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostals share with other Christians a belief in the Bible as the inspired 
word of God, in Jesus as son of God and Savior, and the need for evangelism. 
What sets them apart is their ecstatic worship, which can lead to glossolalia, 
or "speaking in tongues." Such utterances are seen as evidence that an 
individual has been filled with the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox cautioned that interracial cooperation among Pentecostals on the 
denominational level may take time to filter down to local congregations where 
there is great autonomy. Moreover, there are thousands of independent 
Pentecostal churches that are unaffiliated with any denomination. They will 
also be asked to join the new association. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, most congregations will remain black or white or Latin for a 
while, maybe for a long time. But you've got to start somewhere," said Cox. "I 
don't think this should be minimized. It is a very important step." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the months before this week's meeting, Pentecostal leaders said 
they were already seeing the first fruits of what they are calling a 
reconciliation strategy for 21st Century ministry. In areas such as Atlanta and 
Memphis, there are joint worship services monthly between white and African 
American Pentecostals.  
</P>
<P>
 New efforts are being made for annual joint worship and praise services on 
Pentecost Sunday, a major observance throughout Christianity when, according to 
the New Testament book of Acts, the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus' apostles 
following his Crucifixion and Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 The term Pentecost, which means fifty , is a Greek name originally applied to 
the Jewish Feast of Weeks, which came 50 days after Passover. According to 
Christian teaching, Jesus' followers received the baptism of the Holy Spirit on 
this day and the earthly church was born. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic, if belated, move toward racial reconciliation harks back to the 
beginnings of Pentecostal expansion in America after what is known as the Azusa 
Street revival. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Los Angeles in 1906 that William J. Seymour, a fiery African 
American preacher, began preaching to both African Americans and whites. His 
top assistant was a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
 From their small mission on Azusa Street in what is now the Little Tokyo 
district came reports of speaking in tongues, healings and other miracles. But 
the biggest miracle of all may have been the claim that the blood of Jesus had 
washed away the color line. 
</P>
<P>
 "One token of the Lord's coming is that He is melting all races and nations 
together, and they are filled with the power and glory of God," a Seymour 
leaflet proclaimed in 1906. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, the little mission was shaken by public ridicule and outrage -- 
as much over the mission's interracial character as its unconventional style of 
ecstatic worship. Within months, members of the mission succumbed to a 
prevailing social and political climate that fostered the spinoff of separate 
churches and denominations that still exist apart today. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial separation has been "a serious scandal and a barrier to what the Lord 
has wanted to do in the church," said B. E. Underwood, general superintendent 
of the Pentecostal Holiness Church headquartered in Oklahoma City and one of 
the leading figures in promoting the Memphis reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we missed something and gave in to the pressures of our culture 
and forfeited for a time our right to lay claim to be leaders in the church 
world of America." 
</P>
<P>
 While a rediscovery of Pentecostalism's roots is part of the explanation for 
the new drive toward racial reconciliation, experts said it is not the only 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, much of Pentecostal energy has been absorbed in growth, Cox 
said. In addition, Pentecostals -- once on the fringes of religious thought 
and, typically, poorly educated -- have moved into the mainstream.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Pentecostalism has taken root throughout the United States. Its members 
are generally middle class and educated. There are indications that 
Pentecostals are increasingly becoming socially conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for this, Cox said, is a growing sense that the end of the 
world is not as near as they once thought. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no thought of merging actual denominations. But by cooperating with 
each other through the new multiethnic association to be established this week, 
white and African American Pentecostal leaders hope to reclaim the promise of 
Azusa Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Some whites remain skeptical; some blacks remain embittered because of past 
slights and injustices.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Bishop Blake of the West Angelus Church of God in Christ has been in 
the forefront of reconciliation efforts, he has long lamented the failure of 
most white Pentecostals to engage in the African American struggle for civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who were closest to us theologically were most distant from us in the 
struggle," Blake said in an interview. "I've found individuals sometimes who 
are liberal in (Christian) theology or even Jewish in their heritage that were 
more dedicated to the cause of freedom for blacks than were those conservative 
Pentecostal Christians," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Robeck, a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena and a 
Pentecostal, said the vast majority of white Pentecostals were far more 
concerned with what they saw as threats to the status quo and the "American 
way" during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There were Pentecostal white ministers who really were pro-segregation, who 
saw Martin Luther King Jr. as a threat," Robeck said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of this history, Blake and Underwood said, there has been as much 
resistance among African Americans as whites to past attempts at interracial 
cooperation and fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some who cannot really believe that there is a depth of sincerity 
in the hearts of our white brothers," Blake said. "They are not enthusiastic 
about this coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood began thinking about interracial cooperation when he was elected 
three years ago as chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America, a 
voluntary association of 21 white Pentecostal denominations founded in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggested that if we really meant business, we'd have to be willing to 
totally disband Pentecostal Fellowship of North America and start fresh with a 
new organization," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said members of Underwood's own executive committee on the 
Pentecostal Fellowship of North America raised questions about whether they 
should disband. Others were said to have resisted. Underwood denied there was 
any foot-dragging. "No one knew what shape the new organization would take," 
Underwood said, "but there was never any serious opposition to it. That's been 
the surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The reconciliation initiative represents a coming of age of Pentecostalism in 
America, according to those who have closely followed developments.  
</P>
<P>
 After the devastating Northridge earthquake, for example, Pentecostal churches 
like the Church on the Way in Van Nuys mounted major efforts to feed and clothe 
the victims. Before the 1992 Los Angeles riots, efforts were under way to bring 
white and African American pastors together through a program called Love L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, unlike evangelical Christians, there is far less 
emphasis on overtly political issues or partisanship -- and far more emphasis 
on their common theological views. This makes reconciliation easier since white 
and African American Pentecostals are thought to view the role of government 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Darrel Anderson, director of field services for the National Assn. of 
Evangelicals, "They (Pentecostals) have no fish to fry except the Pentecostal 
distinctive. If you're a Pentecostal, you're going to get together and sing and 
shout and preach and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the National Assn. of Evangelicals -- which has lobbyists in 
Washington and takes positions on political issues -- is far more diverse 
religiously, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the prevailing social and cultural pressures that have influenced a 
new generation of Pentecostals, members of the churches say, the new efforts at 
racial reconciliation are grounded firmly in biblical truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a larger sense of racism as sin," said Daniel Hicks, senior 
associate pastor of the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, the mother church of the 
International Church of the Foursquare Gospel founded by Aimee Semple 
McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
 "For so many years racism was so cultural. . . . But I think as more truth 
unfolds, the knowledge of the Lord will fill all the Earth. When that begins to 
happen -- and I believe it is -- people must come to terms with what they know 
inherently: They have operated in what God would consider absolute sin."

 This is the gaping maw, the jaws through which convicts pass to be evaluated 
and processed before they are spit out once again and force-fed into 
California's swollen prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day of the week, buses from jails throughout Southern California roll 
into Chino to disgorge their forlorn and often dangerous passengers behind the 
faded beige walls of this Reception Center. And every day, buses roll out of 
Chino loaded with newly processed convicts bound for prisons throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a machine that will chew you up," lifer Luis Rodriguez said from Pelican 
Bay State Prison. "It doesn't care a damn thing about you. There is no sense of 
rehabilitation. It's a multibillion-dollar industry, and we're the 
commodities." 
</P>
<P>
 Prison guards are scarcely less bitter. Many view their jobs as dangerous, 
thankless and ultimately futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take all the responsibility away from them (prisoners)," said Correctional 
Officer John Baird, "then kick them out and tell them, 'OK, get a job, pay your 
bills.' We're not correcting a damned thing. The (Department of Corrections) 
should be renamed the Department of Confinement." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird, a veteran of 22 years who now transports prisoners, and Rodriguez, a 
convicted killer of two highway patrolmen, have little in common -- except the 
knowledge that prison time is largely dead time, filled with fear, scheming, 
monotony, hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate-on-inmate violence is down compared to a decade ago. But California 
prisons remain dangerous. Knifings are common. Convicts kill four or five of 
their fellows a year. Guards kill a like number. In the past decade, officers 
have shot 36 inmates to death while breaking up fights, more than three times 
the number killed by their counterparts in the other major U.S. prison systems 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an unprecedented construction program that has created 16 prisons, 
126,000 inmates are crammed into space for only half that many. Under "three 
strikes" sentencing laws, the real crunch is yet to come. As the prison 
population balloons, this already strained system will be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will grapple with tens of thousands of physically and mentally 
infirm inmates, contentious labor-management relations and felons who are 
likely to become more rebellious as their sentences grow longer, and privileges 
are revoked. For example, inmates at one overcrowded prison went on strike in 
July after the warden decreed that they had to give up their 13-inch 
televisions for ones with 9-inch screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the point where any individual has nothing to lose, they act out," said 
David Tristan, deputy director of corrections in charge of institutions. 
"That's human nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chino Reception Center -- one of six such facilities throughout the state 
-- processed 32,500 inmates last year and still the buses come. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day at Chino, newly imprisoned men in orange jumpsuits stood in a 
sullen line before an intake sergeant. The officer recognized many of these 
men. They had served time before. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who had just showered, stood in puddles. Nearby, a yellow plastic bin 
was piled high with clothing that the men had discarded. They would not be 
needing it anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials assign them a place to sleep, but virtually every space is 
filled: cells, day rooms, gyms. In the cells, one inmate sleeps in a bunk bed, 
the other on a mattress on the floor. In the summer, the heat is suffocating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gym, where more than 200 inmates sleep in rows, head-to-head, there's a 
swamp cooler. The inmates can spend their days watching TV, shooting the bull 
or playing cards. There is little else to do until they are assigned to a 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials make assignments based on criteria such as the type of crime 
committed, the length of sentence and family ties. Options range from Level I 
minimum security forestry camps to Level IV prisons such as Pelican Bay near 
the Oregon border for the hardest cases. Between these extremes is the medium 
security Correctional Training Facility at Soledad. Soledad: Bloody Past, Grim 
Present 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance is deceptively pleasant. The lawn is flanked by yellow and purple 
pansies and red roses. But beyond the grass and flowers is a double fence 
topped by coiled razor wire and studded with gun towers. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1946, Soledad once was one of the most notorious penitentiaries in 
the state. Its three-tiered cellblocks were home to the Soledad Brothers, 
convicts accused of beating a guard to death in 1969 after three inmates were 
fatally shot from a gun tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials have not torn down old, hard-to-operate joints like this 
Monterey County prison because of the burgeoning convict population. Instead, 
they have renovated them and filled them with lower-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration is proud of its vocational programs teaching such skills as 
furniture making, print shop and upholstery. But there are not enough training 
slots or jobs, and 40% of the inmates at the prison are idle. Some are on 
waiting lists. Others choose to do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soledad is not exceptional. Slightly over half the inmates in California's 
prisons are assigned to jobs or educational programs. And as "three strikes" 
takes effect, idleness is expected to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are only 71,500 assignments available for 126,000 inmates. 
More than 40,000 inmates are deemed either too sick or unruly to be given such 
assignments, or have no interest in them. This despite the fact that inmates 
can earn time off their sentences by working or studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our time clock goes from meal to meal," said Vincent Cervantes, a burglar and 
robber from the Los Angeles area who is back in prison for a parole violation. 
"That's when we know our day is over, when we finish our last meal." 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of judgments do Cervantes and his fellow prisoners make about the 
laws that are passed to keep them in longer? Or to keep them from coming back? 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes, who has spent nine of his 34 years in prison, says he was sentenced 
in 1985 to five years for robbery with a knife. Strike one. Soon after he got 
out, Cervantes was locked up again for first- and second-degree burglaries. The 
first-degree burglary -- breaking into an inhabited dwelling -- would have been 
strike two, but Cervantes says that conviction was set aside on appeal. 
Second-degree burglary doesn't qualify as strike two, but Cervantes doesn't 
know that. He thinks he will be sent away for 25 years to life if he is 
convicted of another felony. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, he says, makes him even more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say," he explains, "that I get out there and my kids get into a fight. 
Let's say I blow it and retaliate and hit someone. I wouldn't let them take me 
in. . . . If lives are at stake, it's going to be someone else's life, not 
mine." Problems in Lancaster 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 300 miles and light-years away in penal technology is the gleaming new 
state prison at Lancaster. It is the only prison that California corrections 
officials have managed to open in Los Angeles County, even though nearly 40% of 
the state's inmates come from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the high desert at the edge of dry brown mountains, the prison's 
off-white cellblocks with turquoise doors shimmer eerily in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster prison, which opened in early 1993, has not operated smoothly 
despite its electronically operated cell doors, its glassed-in control booths 
and its modular, semicircular cellblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been two wardens and two interim wardens at the prison in its first 
18 months of operation. Two lifers escaped but were quickly captured. At least 
four inmates were wounded by guards' gunfire during brawls or altercations last 
winter. One inmate, who has filed a claim for damages, was shot in the foot 
last February after allegedly taking an "aggressive stance" in the cellblock. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the inmates at Lancaster are idle. But one inmate who has 
tried to use prison to improve himself is Hector M. Aldaz, a 26-year-old 
illegal immigrant from Mexico City, one of at least 15,000 undocumented 
immigrants serving time for committing crimes. Aldaz is serving 11 years for 
attempted murder in a shooting on a San Bernardino County freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldaz learned to speak English in the prison's school program, and a few 
months ago, passed a high school equivalency test. He hopes to get out of 
prison in 1998. "If they don't deport me," he said, "I will try to get a 
college degree so I can progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the classrooms, under the hot sun that bakes A Yard, 300 inmates 
stroll, play cards or lift weights. They segregate themselves according to 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the iron pit with a group of white and Latino inmates was William 
S. Munson, in the last days of his sixth state prison term, a three-year 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson is a 41-year-old drug addict from the Los Angeles area, the kind of 
habitual criminal that legislators probably had in mind when they drafted 
"three strikes." He has served sentences for burglary and a number of armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson's mother was imprisoned for selling heroin when he was 2 years old, and 
he went from foster homes to juvenile hall to county jails, and finally to 
prison. "I'm a product of the state of California," he said lightly. "I'm 
literally a state baby." 
</P>
<P>
 If Munson is convicted of another felony, he faces 25 years to life under 
"three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to a state," he said, "that isn't set on locking up half their 
population and giving the other half the job of looking over them." 
</P>
<P>
 For all its problems, the prison at Lancaster is at least relatively close to 
a metropolitan area, an advantage for staff as well as the families of 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials recognize the value of visitation in maintaining the 
family and community ties of inmates, but point out that prisons are seldom 
welcome in metropolitan areas, which are home to most convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried diligently to place a prison in metropolitan Los Angeles," said 
corrections spokeswoman Christine May, "and the community fought us in the 
court system. We would love to have more prisons in metropolitan areas. They 
seem to be more difficult to site there." Newness No Relief at Calipatria 
</P>
<P>
 Most new prisons are in places like Calipatria, where one opened in 1992 amid 
cotton fields of the Imperial Valley. If there were no traffic, the drive from 
Los Angeles would take five hours. The nearest town of any size is El Centro. 
Temperatures commonly hit a humid 110, and there are swarms of insects. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's hot, your level of patience is limited," said Officer John 
Childers, who recently transferred to another prison. "Your temper is limited. 
You get grouchy. You get angry. You get fatigued. You're just miserable. And 
the whiteflies. My God." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that an unruly group of 3,800 convicts. Gangs are engaged in war. 
Fights are vicious. In July, one inmate kicked another in the head so hard that 
the victim went into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 A sergeant tried to break it up, but his gun misfired. A second officer tried 
to fire, but forgot to pull the bolt back, according to a prison report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers are inexperienced. The supervisors are inexperienced," said Dave 
Moschetti, local president of the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
"The inmates are violent, and they've been around a while. No one wants to come 
here (to work)." 
</P>
<P>
 The union at Calipatria is enmeshed with prison administrators in bitter 
disputes over disciplinary actions, pay and job safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Incident reports offer a guard's-eye tour of a hellish side of prison life. 
Between April and July, Calipatria officers found 17 weapons: darts made of 
sewing needles and pen barrels, deodorant containers melted into knife blades, 
sharpened pieces of plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 They found nine stashes of drugs, including a shipment that came in a package 
with a lawyer's return address, 10 balloons of heroin concealed in a bar of 
soap, and hand-made hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers fired eight warning shots to break up fights. Still, 13 inmates were 
stabbed or slashed. In one attack, two prisoners rushed to a neighboring cell, 
and stabbed their targets 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-week period this summer, two officers were stabbed. Officers endure 
bites, kicks, punches, and being doused by a brew of toilet waste that is 
tossed through cell door openings. Officers call it "gassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Moschetti said dozens of Calipatria officers want transfers. Many have already 
moved across Imperial County to the newly opened Centinela State Prison. There, 
Warden Rosie Garcia said three-fourths of her officers are fresh from the 
academy. Most front-line supervisors have three or four years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, Garcia sighed, "It's going to get a lot harder." Prison's 
Feminine Side: Chowchilla 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for the coiled razor wire, the nation's largest women's state 
prison might be mistaken for a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates, in street clothes or prison-issue blue, lounge on the lush green 
grass of the big yard. Others walk toward dormitories trimmed with cheerful 
magenta awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in touch with our feminine side here," said prison spokesman Toby Wong. 
"The only thing we don't have is curtains." 
</P>
<P>
 The Central California Women's Prison at Chowchilla in Madera County is a 
world apart from the violent state prisons for men, but -- beneath the pastels 
-- it is plagued by severe overcrowding, isolation from inmates' families and 
allegedly substandard medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" sentencing legislation is not expected to have as great an 
impact on women's prisons as on those for men because females are not as likely 
to commit the most serious felonies. Even so, corrections officials estimate 
that with "three strikes" and other get-tough legislation, the statewide total 
of women prisoners will grow from 7,900 to more than 13,000 over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Padilla is determined not to be among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old woman from East Los Angeles said she was at the end of her 
second prison term for robbery and spoke of her fears of "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time, if I ever do it," she said, "I'll never, never, never be able 
to set foot in society again." 
</P>
<P>
 The short, tough-looking inmate with "Jackie" tattooed on her neck had just 
spent three years without seeing her two children who live in Los Angeles, 240 
miles away. The prison is too remote, she said, for her family to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ever coming back," she vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison is already operating at twice its design capacity of 2,000. Each 
room, designed to hold four women, is jammed with eight inmates who share one 
toilet, one shower and two sinks. The prison gymnasium has been converted into 
a dormitory for 112 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prisoners' most common complaint appears to be health care. Prison 
officials acknowledge that an inmate might wait as long as three months to see 
one of five physicians who serve the 4,000 convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of inmates' rights attorneys allege that medical care here is 
dangerously substandard. And last year the Department of Corrections paid 
$360,000 to settle a suit over the death of inmate Diana Reyes, 42, who died of 
acute pancreatitis in 1991, four hours after medical staff found her lying on a 
mattress on the floor of her isolation cell, caked with feces. 
</P>
<P>
 Teena Farmon, warden at Chowchilla, denied that Reyes died because of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We supply a higher level of medical care," she said, "than most of these 
people got before they were incarcerated." The End of the Line at Pelican Bay 
</P>
<P>
 The last stop in California's penal system -- Pelican Bay -- sounds like a 
tourist destination, surrounded by redwoods near the picturesque fishing and 
lumber town of Crescent City in Del Norte County. But no prison has harder 
inmates -- or officers. Here are some snapshots from prison and court records: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jay Jackson attacked his cellmate, and when guards arrived to remove the 
bloodied victim, he demanded to know: "Is he dead yet? Well, I tried to do him. 
Are you sure he isn't dead yet?" Motive: Jackson was upset that he had been 
served pancakes. He hates pancakes. He got seven more years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Hunter, a hulking man with tangled and matted hair, was doing time for 
petty theft when he became angry with a guard who shut his thumb in his cell's 
food slot. He splattered the officer with "unidentified liquid." Convicted of 
assault in the incident, Hunter told his sentencing judge that, by way of 
mitigation, the concoction contained no blood. He got six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a brutality suit, a correctional sergeant sparred with a prisoners' 
rights lawyer, saying: "Contrary to what you may believe, an inmate losing four 
teeth is not a major injury."  
</P>
<P>
 Behind Pelican Bay's walls, exercise yards are immaculate. Not a cigarette 
butt or a scrap of paper sullies them. The grass is green. There are softball 
diamonds, weight piles, a sweat lodge for Native American inmates, meandering 
walkways, and steel-mesh cages the size of shower stalls for inmates who get 
out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 From vantage points above the yard, officers with rifles look down. When 
fights break out, as they often do, guards use a public address system to order 
combatants to stop. If that fails, they fire warning shots. And if that doesn't 
work, they shoot at the inmates. Four prisoners have been fatally shot since 
the prison opened five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult inmates are locked up in the Security Housing Unit. 
Prisoners live one to a cell, separated by three locked doors from a control 
booth officer armed with an M-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Locked in the unit are leaders of the Mexican Mafia, the Aryan Brotherhood, 
the Black Guerrilla Family and lesser-known gangs, as well as the most unruly 
inmates, and a smattering of others like Luis Rodriguez, who was convicted of 
killing two highway patrolmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SHU is no place nice," said Rodriguez, 39, who has since moved from the 
unit to the general population. Inmates in cells next to his ranted into the 
night, making it impossible to sleep. "You aren't seeing any sunlight, no 
trees, no people, nothing other than TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a day, the control booth officer pushed a button and the cell door 
opened, allowing Rodriguez to spend an hour and a half in an exercise space 
measuring 28 by 12 feet, with 20-foot walls. He would run in circles, counting 
up to 635 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners' rights lawyers have sued, hoping to convince a federal judge that 
imprisonment in security housing should not go on indefinitely as it does now. 
A ruling is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tristan, the director of corrections, defends the policy of keeping gang 
leaders isolated in the Security Housing Unit for their entire terms, saying: 
"We know there are individuals so violent and so predatory that as soon as they 
got to mainline population, they would begin preying on other inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 However, prisoners and psychologists testified last year that after months and 
years in solitary, some inmates begin hallucinating. A few become so disturbed 
that they smear feces on themselves -- like Vaughn Dortch. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 days in 1992, Dortch lay in his own waste, until other prisoners began 
complaining, and officers extracted him. As he struggled to bite them and 
ranted that he was a killer bee, they took Dortch to an infirmary and forced 
him into a bath. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical technician, Irven McMillan, was near the end of the shift when a 
sergeant asked him to help. McMillan had never given a bath before, and asked a 
supervisor to help. She refused. So McMillan went about washing Dortch. The 
waste was embedded in his skin, McMillan recalled. When the bath was over, 
Dortch stood up and his skin peeled off in sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dortch sued and won a settlement of $972,000 last year. McMillan was fired, 
but is suing to reclaim his job, and the guards union is supporting the action. 
McMillan is convinced the temperature of the bath water had nothing to do with 
Dortch's injuries. He said he believes the inmate's skin came off because he 
had a rash from lying in his wastes or from disinfectant used to clean his 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Warden Charles Marshall blames such problems on inexperienced staff and the 
difficulties of opening a new prison. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried to tighten procedures. But as more prisons open, he predicts, 
wardens will face similar problems: "As long as (inmates) keep coming, and 
they're coming at a rate faster than we can build, we're going to be in that 
situation, and probably we'll be looked at critically by the courts." A Day In 
the Life 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a typical daily schedule for prisoners: 
</P>
<P>
 5:00 a.m.: Inmates counted 6:00: General population wakes up. Inmates with 
jobs in the kitchen have been up since 4 a.m. 6:15--Breakfast 6:45--Prisoners 
on medication line up for pills 7-7:30--Inmate maintenance workers, students 
report to work or classes. 8:00--Medical call 9:15--Cells unlocked, prisoners 
with no program go to exercise yard, day rooms or counseling. 11:00--Yard ends. 
Inmates return to cells. 11:30--Lunch (sack lunch) Noon--High security inmates 
counted 2:00--Work day ends for inmates with jobs in Prison Industry Authority 
2:30--Cells unlocked, prisoners return to the yard, day rooms. 3:30--Classes 
ends for inmates in education or job training 3:45--Inmates return from yard, 
cells locked 4:30--Mail is distributed, inmates counted 5:00--Dinner 
6:30--Cells unlocked, inmates return to yard or day rooms 9:30--Inmates return 
to cells Midnight--Inmates counted 
</P>
<P>
 PERSONAL BELONGINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the items prisoners are allowed to have or use: 
</P>
<P>
 CLOTHING: Denim jeans, blue work shirts, leather work shoes. Authorities are 
considering switching to soft shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 CANTEENS ITEMS: Cigarettes, soda, vitamins, candy, ice cream, canned food, 
personal care products, stationary, pens. 
</P>
<P>
 CATALOGUE ITEMS: Two mail-order firms specialize in sales to inmates of 
Corrections-approved clocks, small televisions, radios, tape players, 
earphones, approved clothing, and personal care items. 
</P>
<P>
 EQUIPMENT: Guitar, typewriter, no more than two plug-in appliances, including 
television, radio, electric shaver, fan, a heating element for warming food or 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
 READING MATERIAL: Law books, most general interest books, magazines. 
Authorities are considering limiting material deemed pornographic or racist. 
</P>
<P>
 CABLE TELEVISION: Reception is poor in most prisons, so the state provides 
cable. Prisons rent and broadcast movies via cable to inmates' sets. 
</P>
<P>
 EXERCISE YARDS: Weight piles, softball or soccer fields, handball and 
basketball courts, a running track, body bags. 
</P>

70,000 MARCH THROUGH L.A. AGAINST PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: PROTESTERS CONDEMN 
THE INITIATIVE AND BURN AN EFFIGY OF GOV. WILSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In one of the largest mass protests in the city's history, a more than 
mile-long column of nearly 70,000 demonstrators marched from the Eastside to 
Downtown on Sunday in boisterous condemnation of Proposition 187, the 
immigration initiative, and its principal advocate, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition is not against the illegal (immigrant), it's against 
children," declared Salvador Alendar, a 32-year-old textile factory worker and 
Mexican native who carried his 2-year-old daughter, Lisbeth, on his shoulders 
throughout the march's almost four-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sentiment repeated by other outraged marchers and by the dozens of 
speakers who took to the elevated podium set up at Spring and First streets, 
just across from City Hall, and addressed the multitudes assembled beneath an 
azure sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided as a family that we needed to come and express our feelings on 
this 187," said Samuel G. Perez, 60, a retired auto worker from San Fernando, 
who marched with his children. "They are playing games with us and that's not 
right. Politically, it's wrong and it's racist." 
</P>
<P>
 The march was the latest in a series of anti-187 demonstrations, but polls 
have shown continued strong support for the initiative. By contrast, 
proposition backers have run a near-invisible campaign from their Orange County 
base, mostly responding to news media inquiries and appearing at forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, among other things, would bar illegal immigrants from 
receiving public school educations and a range of other state and county-funded 
benefits, including non-emergency health care and a variety of social services. 
</P>
<P>
 March organizers said more than 100,000 participated Sunday, but police 
estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 took part. The crowd included nearly 100 Cal 
State Northridge students and instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the largest protest gathering here in decades, surpassing Vietnam 
War-era demonstrations including the historic 1970 Eastside march for Chicano 
rights that turned violent and left three dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no serious injuries and no arrests on Sunday. Hundreds of 
volunteers helped to guide the orderly, regimented crowd, which formed a column 
more than a mile long, a roiling river of banners, flags and placards moving 
triumphantly down Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, renamed for the late United 
Farmworkers Union founder. Eastside sidewalks were packed and impromptu vendors 
set up shop selling "No on 187" T-shirts. Another design declared "No Re-pete," 
a reference to Gov. Wilson's reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's image was burned in effigy near City Hall during the speeches, 
placed in a coffin and depicted on placards, T-shirts and elsewhere with a 
noose around his neck, as a pig, and in other pejorative images. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Antonio Rosales, 21, of Burbank, and Alberto Ibarra, 28, of Granada 
Hills, vented their anger at Wilson through a bit of street theater, depicting 
Wilson as a man on a short leash who is controlled by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to bring out the crowd spirit and berate Wilson in a humorous 
way," Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Garcia, dean of the school of humanities at CSUN who took part in the 
march, said the turnout was a response borne of the frustration of "being 
dumped on" for too long. "It's time to challenge them openly and publicly. And 
this is just a little town meeting among a few people," he said as he marched 
with another educator from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the practice of blaming illegal immigrants for economic woes isn't 
new in the United States. Latinos, he said, are the latest targets of a cycle 
of scapegoating that has been around since the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, it was the Chinese, then the Okies," he said. "Now it's us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite participants' anger, the mood on Sunday was mostly exuberant, leavened 
with ethnic pride. Flags of Mexico, El Salvador and other Latin American 
nations were everywhere. The event had been heavily promoted in the 
Spanish-language media and at community organizations statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchers converged across from City Hall where, before speakers addressed the 
throng, three horn players performed a mariachi riff of "The Star-Spangled 
Banner" to thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the vast majority of participants were Latinos, reflecting the region's 
large immigrant population from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, 
non-Latino whites, Asian Americans, African Americans and others also took 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who says the immigrants of California are not working and are on 
welfare is lying," Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who made a spirited 
bid against Wilson in the Republican gubernatorial primary race, told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents a portion of the east San 
Fernando Valley, dressed in crisp white shirt, walked arm in arm with event 
organizers and other politicians in the first row of the procession. He joined 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and City Councilman Mike Hernandez 
as a speaker on the podium at the end of the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers called the protest part of a multiethnic campaign to reject growing 
anti-immigrant "hysteria" nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a not a parade, this is a social movement," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, 
an Eastside activist and leading march strategist, who noted planners' desire 
to turn around what he called an anti-immigrant tide and win official 
recognition of immigrants' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, attention is focused on next month's California 
elections and two critical contests: Gov. Wilson's reelection bid and the 
heated battle about Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson was the favored target of Sunday's demonstration, depicted 
repeatedly in posters and speeches as a "racist" who has made immigration a 
centerpiece of his campaign in a cynical effort to woo the non-Latinos who 
dominate California's voting rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson dismissed the criticisms and downplayed the march's 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are demonstrating represent a relatively small minority of 
Californians," said Dan Schnur, a Wilson campaign spokesman. "Most Californians 
understand the innate unfairness of providing services for individuals who live 
in this state illegally at the same time services are being cut for those who 
live here legally." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson himself, during a 45-minute address Sunday to an audience of about 400 
in the retirement community of Leisure World in Laguna Hills, did not mention 
the protest when he blamed illegal immigrants for costing the state billions of 
dollars in services that should be reserved for legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to provide services to our own legal residents," Wilson said. 
He declared that illegal immigrants absorb 10% of the state's general fund. 
"Now, that is terribly unfair. . . . I say we should end those services to 
illegal immigrants. We are . . . rewarding people for violating U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from educators, medical groups, organized labor and others, 
polls have shown strong support for Proposition 187 among likely voters, 
including many Latinos. Proponents say it will deter new illegal immigration 
and force those already here to return home -- a premise disputed by opponents, 
who say that measure would leave hundreds of thousands of youths without 
education while enhancing the spread of disease by cutting access to 
non-emergency medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's strong support, analysts say, underlines a widespread 
preoccupation about the fast-paced immigration that has drastically altered 
California's demographic mix since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 strategists acknowledge a difficult uphill battle, particularly 
because even though anti-Proposition 187 forces have apparently raised more 
than twice as much as proponents, fund-raising efforts have so far fallen short 
of the kind of money needed for an all-out television blitz against the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the anti-187 coalition -- including mainstream Latino groups like the 
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- argued that a massive 
march barely three weeks before the election was a bad tactic, and attempted to 
scuttle the event. Several Latino activists privately expressed fears that a 
sea of brown faces marching through Downtown Los Angeles would only antagonize 
many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, Taxpayers Against 187 -- the umbrella organization spearheading 
the campaign against the initiative whose member groups include teachers, 
medical professionals and union activists -- did not take part in organizing 
the march. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, march organizers -- a statewide coalition of activists grouped 
together as the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and Civic 
Participation -- opted to go ahead with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called the demonstration a success, as it provided a forum for 
opponents -- citizens and non-citizens alike -- to express their frustrations. 
And they believe it sets the stage for increased immigrant participation in 
future campaigns, electoral and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was concern and disagreement based on what was the best way of 
defeating 187, but I don't think you can deny people the right to participate," 
said Councilman Hernandez, who was among the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so impressed was Ron Prince, chairman of the pro-187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather's nice, they can do that if they want to," Prince responded 
when contacted at the campaign's Orange County offices. "I'm sure a lot of 
people were there to see the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The march, he predicted, would bolster his cause by focusing attention on the 
problem of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people look at the issue, they understand the problem and they tend to 
support Proposition 187," said Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's march follows a similar protest last May that drew between 8,000 to 
25,000 protesters to Downtown Los Angeles, before Proposition 187 was 
officially placed on the ballot.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: ATTORNEY GENERAL; RISING STARS OF THEIR PARTIES TRADE 
CHARGES OVER CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this were Windsor, he'd be first in line of succession. Among friend and 
foe, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren is considered the Republican prince in waiting, the 
man who by decade's end could rise to become California's governor, or a U.S. 
senator if he'd prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 But first this ascendant hope of GOP conservatives must go about the 
cumbersome process of getting reelected in November. It could prove testy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's opponent is Assemblyman Tom Umberg, a telegenic Democrat from Orange 
County who is widely regarded as one of his party's promising newcomers on the 
statewide scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A former military prosecutor and assistant U.S. attorney, Umberg has more 
courtroom experience as a criminal litigator and could prove a worthy match for 
Lungren both in charisma and brains. A rarity among Democrats, Umberg is the 
only member of his party from Orange County holding state or federal elected 
office. Like Lungren, he is a death penalty supporter and backs the 
"three-strikes" criminal sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 With crime one of the hottest issues in the 1994 election, Lungren would seem 
to have a solid advantage as an incumbent Republican, the party typically 
perceived by voters to be tougher on law-and-order matters. A recent Times poll 
showed Lungren, 48, holding a 15-point lead among likely voters. He also has an 
edge in campaign cash heading into the race's final weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, however, is hopeful that he can run well in liberal strongholds in Los 
Angeles and the Bay Area while cutting into Lungren's support in Orange County, 
which has historically provided an avalanche of Republican votes to push GOP 
candidates over the top in statewide contests. 
</P>
<P>
 The race could tighten in the coming weeks as Umberg, a 39-year-old political 
moderate little known by voters outside his Assembly district, rolls out a 
slate of hard-hitting television commercials. In debates and appearances on the 
campaign trail, the feisty challenger has already begun to pelt Lungren on 
several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that the conservative incumbent has tilted at ideological 
windmills instead of handling important "nuts-and-bolts" issues of the job. 
More pointedly, Umberg charges that Lungren has "sold his office to the highest 
bidder" by compromising on cases involving campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, such broadsides have not gotten a huge rise from Lungren, who has 
promised to run on his record. In debates, Lungren has counterattacked by 
calling Umberg a protege of Willie Brown, the powerful Assembly Speaker from 
San Francisco, and labeling the challenger a greenhorn who would require 
"on-the-job training." 
</P>
<P>
 On the TV front, the attorney general's campaign is going for a well-packaged 
look: Lungren's advertisements are being handled by a marketing company more 
seasoned at peddling products than politicians. The themes are bedrock, 
philosophical, almost Reaganesque. This race, after all, is not just about four 
more years in office; it's also Lungren's chance to lay the groundwork for 
bigger elections to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's political prospects are little wonder given his background. His 
father was Richard Nixon's physician on the campaign trail during the 1950s, 
and the former President became something of a mentor, providing occasional 
advice and encouragement. Lungren displayed an early taste for politics. At age 
6, he began leafleting on behalf of a neighbor running for Congress in his 
hometown of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A devout Catholic and product of parochial schools, Lungren graduated cum 
laude from Notre Dame in 1968 and later got a law degree. In 1976, he made an 
unsuccessful run for Congress, but came back two years later to ride the crest 
of the Proposition 13 tax revolt into office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Lungren earned a reputation as a passionate yet pragmatic 
conservative and garnered a spot on U.S. News and World Report's short list of 
politicians under 40 with national promise. His biggest legislative success was 
in helping win passage of the landmark immigration bill of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Gov. George Deukmejian picked Lungren as the nominee to fill 
the treasurer's post left vacant by the death of Jesse Unruh. Democrats, 
fearing that the job would serve as a springboard for Lungren in the 1990 
election, scuttled the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren turned that defeat into victory. He ran for attorney general in 1990 
and eked out a reed-thin win over San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state's top cop, Lungren numbers among his top achievements the 
successful effort, in 1992, to see capital punishment carried out in California 
for the first time in a quarter of a century. His first term produced record 
drug seizures, prosecutions of companies for lead content in dinnerware and 
wine bottle caps, investigations into auto insurance fraud and an $8-million 
settlement with Sears auto repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 He pushed the prosecution of former state schools chief Bill Honig on felony 
conflict-of-interest charges and has railed against what he calls the "culture 
of violence" perpetuated by video games, rap music and professional football. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lungren has prodded California's conscience, Umberg dreams of saving the 
state's teen-agers. Among the principal planks of his election challenge has 
been a promise to revamp the juvenile justice system, which Umberg believes is 
a culprit in the explosion of crimes committed by children. His wish list 
includes the creation of a network of rock-hard boot camps. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Illinois, Umberg came to California to attend UCLA in the 
mid-'70s. He got a law degree, then served a five-year Army stint. He later 
joined the U.S. attorney's office in Orange County, prosecuting cases involving 
white-collar crime, drugs and a well-publicized cross-burning incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg jumped into politics in 1990 with an expensive, mud-slinging Assembly 
victory. In Sacramento, he impressed colleagues as a friendly, hard-working 
moderate and won reelection in 1992 with 60% of the vote after running another 
negative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger is using the same tough campaign tactics this time, employing a 
broad brush to paint Lungren as a rigid, ideological conservative. He notes 
that Lungren is an abortion-rights opponent and campaigned for last year's 
unsuccessful school voucher initiative, a stance that has put the attorney 
general on top of the enemies list of the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg has also hit on a personal note. While highlighting his own military 
credentials, the challenger has criticized Lungren for getting a medical 
deferment during the Vietnam War because of football knee injuries and major 
childhood kidney surgery. Later, however, the attorney general took up tae kwon 
do. Lungren counters that he has remained physically active to help strengthen 
his damaged knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although crime in the state declined sharply in the first six months of 1994, 
Umberg cites statistics showing a rise of 2.1% since Lungren took office, with 
violent crime swelling by 7.8%. "People understand that they don't feel as safe 
today as they did four years ago," Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticizes Lungren for slashing Department of Justice divisions 
handling environmental enforcement and consumer protection. Umberg notes that 
the attorney general's program to keep tabs on sex offenders can account for 
only one of four rapists and child molesters, and that fingerprint 
identification in the attorney general's office is running 80 days behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg also charges that Lungren failed to adequately fund a statewide 
computerized database that might have helped law officers to early on snag 
Richard Allen Davis, who is charged with the Northern California kidnap and 
murder of young Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger's harshest allegations involve Lungren's decisions on cases 
that helped campaign contributors.

 Umberg notes that Lungren's deputies recommended a $3-million settlement in a 
case against the wine industry, but the attorney general dropped it to 
$900,000. Since 1990, Lungren has collected more than $68,000 in contributions 
from the wine industry. Umberg also argues that Lungren has used the power of 
his office to help Surety Insurance Company of the Pacific ($67,500 in 
contributions since 1990), Bank of America ($11,000 from the company and top 
employees), the California Manufacturers Assn. (more than $200,000 in campaign 
cash) and two Southern California utility companies that have given $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren counters that each of his decisions was based on sound legal reasoning 
and, insharp contrast with Democratic predecessors, sprang from a philosophy 
that is not spitefully anti-business. In the wine industry case, Lungren said 
he felt that it was more important to get the vintners to stop using lead in 
the foil covering bottle tops than to press for the bigger monetary settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't run across too many people in California who believe we ought to use 
the heavy hand of government when a more appropriate approach is required," 
Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggested it is inevitable that a few cases involving contributors 
would be handled by his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 55,000 active cases in this office, and we regulate about 70,000 
charitable trusts," Lungren said. "If I were to say that I wasn't going to take 
contributions from an individual or business who has something to do with our 
office now or in the future, frankly I couldn't run a campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the programs trimmed during his tenure, Lungren said the cuts were 
necessary amid the state's harsh fiscal climate to ensure that his office 
continued to perform well its mandatory appellate work and other legal tasks. 
He also takes credit for slicing into management. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many issues cited by Umberg -- including the delay in fingerprinting 
and lagging sex offender registration -- are inherited problems that Lungren 
himself brought to light and is working to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he is proud of the stands that he has taken on issues both as a 
congressman and attorney general. "If he's accusing me of being a Reagan 
Republican, I am," Lungren said.POLITICAL CA

 Nivia Burmudez is in the midst of an animated conversation, recounting to 
visitors a rocky, unhappy marriage that nevertheless produced a happy, 
beautiful daughter, when a loud rap echoes from the screen door of the small 
Eastside apartment that mother and daughter share. 
</P>
<P>
 A truancy official has come by to ask why 8-year-old Crystal, playing with her 
pet parakeet on the front room floor, is not in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The account Burmudez gives -- ill health that hampers her ability to get the 
child off to school, underemployment that barely meets her family's needs, lack 
of money for day care or baby-sitters, an inner-city school in a rough area 
that her daughter resists attending -- reflects many of the challenges faced by 
California's expanding population of poor and low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plight has proved a stubborn thorn in the side of state leaders, who 
once again this election year must grapple with the dilemma of expanding 
poverty and a growing demand for services amid a long-depressed economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The protracted fiscal and social problems besieging the state seemed at their 
worst two years ago as Los Angeles erupted in rioting that became the worst 
U.S. civil disturbance of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of that upheaval, plans to reform welfare and health care, 
improve education and schools, retrain the work force and rebuild inner cities 
remain elusive goals, the stuff of campaign rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent census estimates, 18.2% of Californians live 
below the poverty level, struggling to maintain families, homes and dignity in 
an economic and social climate that has buffeted even the most well-off. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the poor resonates up and down the state, with poverty infecting 
the soil of California's rural heartland as well as its cities like a 
drug-resistant disease. While Los Angeles County, California's most populous, 
has a staggering 1.3 million poor residents, Imperial County has the highest 
poverty rate of all, with one quarter of its residents living below the 
threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 The plague that has afflicted poor residents, urban and rural, is persistent 
unemployment and underemployment that has exacerbated housing, food and health 
problems. And as the state's economic climate has worsened, health and social 
service programs that serve the state's most vulnerable populations have been 
targeted for deep cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents like Nivia Burmudez, a native New Yorker who migrated to 
California more than 18 years ago, the upcoming governor's election pitting 
incumbent Pete Wilson against state Treasurer Kathleen Brown provokes both hope 
and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates talk of improving the economy, which Burmudez knows will help 
the overall condition of people like herself. Yet she also has the sense that 
no one is really interested in addressing her concerns, that the everyday lives 
of the poor barely register on the political radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians have never had to live at the level that I have and survive, so 
they don't understand," says Burmudez, a small woman whose feisty energy and 
accent announce her New York roots. 
</P>
<P>
 She is sitting in a waiting room of a clinic in Long Beach, her first visit to 
the doctor in about two months because of complications with her medical 
coverage. Medi-Cal will not cover some of the medications she has been 
prescribed -- one of which costs up to $150 a month -- so she has tried to pay 
out of her pocket or has simply gone without. 
</P>
<P>
 In the examining room, Burmudez tells the doctor her mood has been down, that 
she can't sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depression amplifies pain a lot," he tells her. "I want to work on that. If 
we can, I think we will have success." 
</P>
<P>
 Burmudez's circumstances in recent years have fostered enough emotional 
turmoil for a lifetime, but also have stirred a fierce survival instinct and 
sense of political awareness she had not known before. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with a lot of reforms that are being proposed is that the 
children suffer," she says, sitting now in her small living room cluttered with 
boxes of clothes, shoes and papers. She moved into the apartment five months 
ago after living in a succession of homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are not the ones taking drugs or having babies," Burmudez 
continues. "Children need to be protected in California. This is such a rich 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a warm, pleasant morning, and Burmudez has her door open to let in a 
breeze, when the tap, tap is heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman at the door, Margarita Rojas, is from Sheridan Street Elementary 
School, only a few blocks away. Crystal, she says, is frequently absent, and 
when she does go to school, she is often half an hour to an hour late.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see if we can improve attendance and tardiness," says Rojas. What time 
does Crystal get to bed, she wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal -- a shy but bouncy third-grader with expressive brown eyes who 
already has attended five different schools -- says she stays up late sometimes 
watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 "9:30 p.m. or 10? That's too late," says Rojas, grimacing. "You have to be 
able to study. Go to bed at 8 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Rojas leaves, she tries to explain some of the problems she faces. The 
school's Boyle Heights neighborhood is a "hard-core area," a recruiting ground 
for local gangs. "There are a lot of drugs and dysfunctional families." 
</P>
<P>
 Burmudez is neither offended nor embarrassed by Rojas' descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a certain amount of dysfunction in my life, but I'm trying to 
find ways to overcome that," she says. "It's so much easier when you have two 
people in the home, because the other one can pick up the slack. On the surface 
it looks like negligence, but not when you get into somebody's life and see 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of California's poorer residents, finding a good job, decent health 
care or even a home is increasingly beyond their reach. The state's protracted 
economic slump has allowed more and more people to slip into poverty, while 
seeming to suffocate those already at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1988 and 1992, the percentage of California's children living below 
the poverty line rose by more than a quarter, to 25.3% from 20%. The percentage 
of two-parent households receiving welfare jumped 12% in 1993 from the previous 
year. In Los Angeles County, 24% of all children were on welfare in 1992, the 
latest year for which data is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last three years, meanwhile, California officials have cut grants 
under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program by nearly 13%. In the 
same period, federal Supplemental Security Income benefits for the low-income 
elderly and disabled have been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers do not tell the personal stories of people like Burmudez, one 
of seven children born to a factory worker father and homemaker mother in a 
Pentacostal home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents parted when she was 13 and Nivia lived a nomadic life, running 
away often and hanging with Manhattan street gangs. At 16, she moved to 
California, married a serviceman, but was divorced after a troubled marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Burmudez modeled for a while, went to beauty school and tried to sell her own 
designer clothing. She met Crystal's father and stayed with him for 10 years, 
hoping to create a stable environment for her daughter. But last year, he left 
and Burmudez -- with few resources and unable to afford rent -- took Crystal to 
live in a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has been sporadically employed, forced onto welfare and has 
suffered bouts of sickness and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has struggled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Burmudez found a part-time job with a local homeless organization and began 
working Saturdays at a salon. She got housing assistance and saved enough money 
to buy an '86 Chevette. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she still is mostly dependent on the state's largess -- aid that is 
subject to economic constraints and the will of politicians. Both gubernatorial 
candidates, for example, support increased job training for the poor. Brown 
also proposes allowing those on welfare to accumulate money to start small 
businesses. But both candidates favor further cuts in welfare grants and 
freezing cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Burmudez's job poses a dilemma familiar to the poor. She could work 
longer hours at higher pay, but that would jeopardize her Medi-Cal health 
insurance and Section 8 housing aid, which pays all but $100 of her $760 
monthly rent.  
</P>
<P>
 It is not a question of wanting to stay on welfare, says Burmudez, but of 
common sense. Even with a full-time job, her wages would not cover rent, health 
care, baby-sitting and food bills. She'd be back where she started. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Burmudez has chosen stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still going through a lot of trauma and turmoil from the past," she says. 
"It's like recovering from alcohol or drugs. It will always be there, but I 
have to learn how to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that is relearning how to balance her life and set priorities. One of 
the most important is Crystal. And soon after Rojas leaves, Burmudez decides to 
visit school to talk to the principal about her situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan Street Elementary has a student body of 1,800 that reflects the 
mostly Latino makeup of its community. Principal Joan Mezori, a 
scholarly-looking woman with twinkling eyes, greets Burmudez warmly. Indeed, 
the meeting goes much more smoothly than Burmudez had expected. Instead of 
taking her to task for Crystal's absences, Mezori offers ways to help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several other children in Burmudez's apartment complex also attend Sheridan, 
the principal says, and the school may be able to work out an arrangement for 
the students to walk to school together, with adult supervision. The school 
also has after-hours programs for children with working parents, one of which 
Crystal quickly joined. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Mezori is reflecting on the problems of the poor.  
</P>
<P>
 At Sheridan, she says, "there are about 40 homeless kids that we have 
identified, but that only touches the surface. We're working hard to create an 
atmosphere where parents can feel safe enough to come to us and seek 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Mezori has been with the Los Angeles Unified School District for 25 years, all 
of it on the Eastside. "It is a wonderful place, and (there is) nothing quite 
like the children," she says. "The parents are very generous with their 
children. They want the same things for them that everyone else wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Burmudez, too, is optimistic. She had a recent setback when her baby-sitter, 
beset with her own problems, had to stop caring for Crystal. She's looking for 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm trying to establish a life," Burmudez says. "I'm sick of 
poverty. I've had too much of it." STATE OF THE STATE: POVERTY REALITY 
</P>
<P>
 * CHILDREN: More than one in five children in the state lives below the 
poverty line, as does one in five residents of Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura and 
Riverside counties. Statewide, the number of children living in poverty doubled 
from 1969 to 1989. * LIVING STANDARD: In Los Angeles, a family of four 
receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamps has only 42% 
of the income needed to maintain a minimum standard of living, Consumers Union 
says. * INCOME: Adjusted for inflation, the incomes of the poorest fifth of 
California families declined 8% during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 RHETORIC KATHLEEN BROWN: "I believe the single best anti-poverty program is a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 "California's welfare rolls are filled with people who come from broken 
families. If California's families are going to stay together and be 
successful, the twin problems of teen-age pregnancy and deadbeat dads must be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Make jobs and job placement the primary focus of the state's GAIN 
welfare-to-work program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transform welfare offices into employment referral and placement centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impose a two-year limit on welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the state Franchise Tax Board to collect child support. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow welfare recipients to accumulate assets needed to start 
micro-businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PETE WILSON: "Welfare must not just be a dead-end of despair and dependency; 
it must become the path to a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't begun to reform welfare, the system would still penalize those 
who choose the dignity of a job over the dependency of welfare. But we did 
reform welfare to finally make work pay." 
</P>
<P>
 PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Require teen-age mothers who go on welfare to live at home with parents or a 
guardian, rather than move out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impose a two-year limit on able-bodied adults receiving welfare, after which 
they must find a private-sector job. MORE POOR 
</P>
<P>
 The current federal poverty line -- based on a family's ability to purchase an 
adequate diet -- stands at $11,522 for a family of three. The percentage of 
Californians living in poverty has steadily grown. 02,06,20 Year Percent in 
poverty 1988 13.2% 1989 12.9% 1990 13.9% 1991 16.3% 1992 16.4% 1993 18.2%

CAPITOL JOURNAL: OF PRIVACY, POLITICS AND PUBLIC PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California gubernatorial debate of 1994 will be remembered as the time a 
candidate announced on statewide television that her daughter had been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Date raped," the candidate later told reporters. Her "middle daughter. It 
happened many years ago." No, a police report wasn't filed. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all she wanted to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, others -- mainly ordinary people -- will have much to say 
about it because this is a very human story of some sicko bully boy and a 
tragic victim that touches real lives. It is a story with legs, as we say in 
the news business -- if for no other reason than it is great grist for talk 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 These are topics ripe for listener call-ins after Friday night's debate 
between Gov. Pete Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown: 
</P>
<P>
 * How far should a politician go in exposing the secrets of his/her family? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did Brown have her daughter Sascha's permission to tell the state she had 
been date raped? 
</P>
<P>
 * Was Brown's disclosure calculated or spontaneous? 
</P>
<P>
 * What effect will it have on her campaign, which until the debate had seemed 
in free fall? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for divulging family secrets -- and perhaps violating a daughter's privacy 
-- hardly anything seems off limits in this era of baring one's soul for Sally, 
Geraldo or Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington, debating Sen. Dianne Feinstein, talked emotionally of 
his wife Arianna's previous miscarriage when asked why he kept living in 
Houston after buying a house in Santa Barbara; his business was in Texas, but 
his pregnant wife needed to rest in California after she became pregnant again. 
Feinstein accused him of avoiding California taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opined Saturday that it's "perfectly legitimate" for a candidate to 
cite personal tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this is a family matter. So did Sascha, now 25, tell her mom it was 
OK to broadcast the rape? It seems so, but we're not 100% sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown -- a politician's daughter herself -- periodically has touched base with 
her three children to ask, according to a close aide, "what they feel is out of 
bounds and what isn't." She did so again early last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation with the rape victim went something like this, according to 
the aide: "You know, Sascha, it's getting hot, getting ugly. This kind of thing 
could come out. Are you prepared for it to be made public?" "Yes, but this is 
very painful, and not something I personally want to describe or discuss." 
</P>
<P>
 The aide added, "The implication was it was OK. But that was not the point of 
the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 After the debate, the aide said, Brown phoned Sascha to tell her of the 
revelation. They talked for half an hour. "Sascha said she understood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So was it scripted or impulsive? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aides swear it was not planned; they'd never even heard of the rape. Not 
even Brown's husband knew she would mention it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her post-debate explanation was that she had just gotten "sick and tired" of 
Wilson "misrepresenting my position on crime . . . and suggesting that a woman, 
a mother, can't be tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 But I talked to two veteran consultants, both Democrats, who found this very 
hard to believe. "I don't think anything was spontaneous," said one. "Remember 
how she said, 'My campaign is just beginning?' This was an ace they were 
holding back." 
</P>
<P>
 The other consultant agreed: "The first thing you say to a candidate who is 
perceived to be soft on crime is, 'Has anybody in your family ever been 
victimized by a crime?' If this was so private that you wouldn't even tell your 
campaign manager, why would you talk about it for the first time on television? 
She wasn't even asked about rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had been asked whether she would wrestle with her conscience when 
imposing the death penalty. Anybody would, she replied, then tore into Wilson: 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot possibly imagine what it's like to be a woman at night, leaving 
the office, going to your car, worrying about your safety . . . what it's like 
to be a mother, waiting for your daughter to come home . . . and having (to) 
comfort her, because she's been raped. Or your son call while I'm working, to 
say come home because I've been robbed and mugged. . . . Don't question my 
commitment to be tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Zebediah, 23, was mugged in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Myself, I don't believe her disclosure was actually scripted, but think she 
had been rehearsing the ad-libs for some time in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 This should help Brown get back some Democratic women who had abandoned her. 
She looked sincere and related to people. Many voters may take another look. 
Many will have to in order for the debate to be remembered also as the time a 
candidate instinctively rescued her losing campaign.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: PROPOSITION 184; 'THREE STRIKES': A STEAMROLLER DRIVEN BY 
ONE MAN'S PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 184, the "three strikes" initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, would 
make no change in the law. Yet nearly every politician in the state embraces it 
-- and the few who have doubts keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition campaign is all but broke. A Times poll shows that likely 
voters favor the measure 58%-32%. But the prime sponsor, Mike Reynolds, on a 
nonstop crusade to avenge his daughter's murder, barnstorms the state as if 
legions of well-financed foes were attacking his initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Reynolds' most visible foil is a single individual -- Marc Klaas, 
who, if this were not one of the fall's most unusual campaigns, would seem to 
be a natural ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas is the father of another murdered girl, Polly Klaas. The 12-year-old's 
kidnaping and slaying last year ignited Reynolds' drive to place "three 
strikes" on the ballot. The initiative, like the "three strikes" law already in 
effect, calls for substantially increasing prison terms for repeat felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with Klaas fighting to defeat Proposition 184 -- he says it goes too far 
and costs too much -- the campaign features the spectacle of two fathers of 
murdered children arguing about how best to stop career criminals from preying 
on the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 At a debate last week in this Bay Area suburb, Klaas accused promoters of 
Proposition 184 of engaging "in a cynical, insensitive attempt" to win votes 
with his daughter's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of 184 shot back, saying that if the law had been in place last 
year, the habitual criminal charged with Polly's murder never would have been 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds knows that whether or not Proposition 184 passes, his version of 
"three strikes" already is law in California. The initiative is word-for-word 
the same as the "three strikes" bill Reynolds pushed through the Legislature 
early in the year. Gov. Pete Wilson signed it into law in March. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the substantial lead in the polls, and thousands of felons 
facing charges under its harsh provisions, Reynolds tirelessly travels the 
state stumping for "three strikes" as embodied in Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived for the debate in San Ramon at night, by plane piloted by a friend, 
having begun the day with a morning talk show appearance in Fresno and a 
lunchtime forum before judges and lawyers in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he campaigns so hard is simple. Reynolds, a Fresno wedding 
photographer who buried his daughter when she was 18, trusts almost nothing 
that goes on in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask these guys for a hand, they'll take your arm," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reynolds sees it, a statute passed by the Legislature is one thing. 
Politicians could undo such a law. But if the electorate approves "three 
strikes," politicians will see it as political suicide to tinker with the 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
 "When 'three strikes' passes by the voters, the Legislature will be much less 
inclined to water it down," says Charles Cavalier, Sacramento political 
consultant for Reynolds and Proposition 184. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of the "three strikes" campaign date to June, 1992, when Kimber 
Reynolds stepped from a restaurant in Fresno, and two armed robbers with prison 
records sped up on a motorcycle. One shot her in the head. As doctors removed 
Kimber's life support, Mike Reynolds vowed to find a way to keep repeat felons 
locked up until they no longer pose a danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds sought help from friends and contacts, including judges, lawyers and 
experts in the state attorney general's office, to devise a law aimed at 
habitual criminals. The result is the nation's most sweeping "three strikes" 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the legislation, the initiative doubles prison terms for criminals 
convicted of a second felony, if they already have been convicted of one prior 
serious or violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The law lists about 30 serious and violent felonies, including murder, rape, 
attempted murder, armed robbery, hard drug sales to minors and one property 
crime: residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals who commit a third felony, and have been convicted of two serious or 
violent felonies, will receive sentences of three times the prison term now in 
the law for the particular crime, or indeterminate sentences of 25 years to 
life, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial provision places repeat felons under the tough 
provisions if they commit any felony on their second or third strikes. 
California law encompasses more than 500 felonies, including such common crimes 
as petty theft and passing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts already are filling, and state prison officials forecast that the 
prison population, now 126,000, will hit 232,000 by the turn of the century, 
requiring 25 more prisons -- at about $200 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti already has filed 9,000 "three 
strikes" cases since Wilson signed the bill into law. Garcetti takes no 
position on the initiative. But like many prosecutors, judges and defense 
lawyers, he believes "three strikes" will add major costs to the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative is going to pass," Garcetti said. "This law is going to be the 
law for the foreseeable future, and we're simply going to have to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The costs will come in future years, and go largely unmentioned as political 
candidates almost uniformly extol "three strikes" in their campaigns. 
Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) appears alongside Reynolds at debates, hoping 
his role as lead author of the "three strikes" legislation will help him become 
the next secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), the one-term congressman running for 
U.S. Senate, is the largest donor to Reynolds' campaign, giving $350,000, a sum 
that bought him the title of "co-chair" of the initiative and that amounts to 
more than a third of the $1 million-plus Reynolds has raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalier, the consultant for the Yes on 184 campaign, said the wealthy 
congressman attached no strings to the money. Cavalier also recalled that 
Huffington said early in the campaign: " 'You've got to put this on the 
ballot,' " adding that Huffington "wanted very much to use it as a campaign 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the No on 184 campaign raised $13,855 through September, scarcely 
meal money in California politics. The one check of any size, $10,000, came 
from the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running on my credit card," said political consultant Leo McElroy, a 
former Los Angeles television news reporter who is steering the No on 184 
campaign. "I'm hoping we raise enough money that I get reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless he finds a vein of gold, McElroy says he has no hope of defeating 184. 
His goal is to prevent a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this passes with a substantial margin, there is no way the Legislature 
will buck the tide," McElroy said. "If it passes 51%-49%, we have a chance to 
reopen the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 For some future Legislature to try to amend Proposition 184, it would take a 
two-thirds vote of both houses. With only the present law in effect, for 
amendments to pass would require simple majorities. Legally, that is the sole 
difference between Proposition 184 and the law that has been in effect for the 
last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy's campaign consists mainly of dispatching volunteers to every forum 
and debate on 184. McElroy's volunteers are primed to give the message that 
Reynolds' version of "three strikes" puts the wrong people in prison, and that 
it costs too much. His most potent weapon is Klaas, a fact that Klaas and 
others involved in the campaign see as ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, as Reynolds gathered signatures for his initiative, Polly Klaas' 
body was found in rural Mendocino County. Within hours of the horrible 
discovery, Reynolds was in Polly's hometown of Petaluma, at the invitation of a 
San Francisco radio talk show host, circulating petitions for his initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, the grieving Marc Klaas was a prominent backer of Reynolds' idea. 
In the following weeks, however, Klaas concluded that Reynolds' version went 
too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaas endorsed legislation pushed by the California District Attorneys Assn., 
which sought to imprison only repeat violent felons for life. The competing 
bill's backers named it after Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Reynolds' "three strikes" bill swept through the Legislature without so 
much as a comma being changed, the Polly Klaas bill stalled in the state 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's driving Mike is his passion," Klaas said. "Mike doesn't want to be 
reasoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds knows the Klaas murder fueled his petition drive. "It would have been 
difficult for us to get the high velocity headlines that the Polly Klaas murder 
accomplished," he said. But he also believes his initiative would have 
qualified anyway, because he raised $800,000 for the paid signature-gathering 
drive to place it on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds says he does not understand Klaas' opposition. "I'm sorry to say 
this, but I think it has come down to a personal animosity. Whether it's the 
success we've had on this, a me-too syndrome, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Ramon debate, Klaas pointed out that Reynolds' idea could send 
thieves to long prison terms for stealing basketballs, pizzas or car stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had my stereo stolen. I have had my daughter murdered. I know the 
difference. Stereos can be replaced," Klaas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his law, Reynolds said: "If a person has been convicted twice of 
serious or violent crimes, we'd be crazy to afford him another chance to do 
another violent crime. If we can take him out on a low-level felony, by all 
means, we should do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds cites a state Justice Department report that crime fell 7.7% in the 
first six months of the year and that homicide dropped 11.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 While most criminal justice experts say it's too early to explain the drop in 
crime, Reynolds believes "three strikes" is having a deterrent effect. He also 
is convinced that "three strikes" won't cost the state much after all, and may 
end up saving money, because crime-caused medical bills, lost wages and 
property damage all will decrease, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give it a chance to work," Reynolds says. "Give this five years to do what we 
say it will."

HEIR APPARENT APPEARS IN N. KOREA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The son and heir apparent of North Korea's late President Kim Il Sung appeared 
in public Sunday for the first time in nearly three months, and top military 
and Communist officials swore allegiance to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il did not speak at the memorial service for his father, and he was 
identified by his old government titles, indicating that he has not yet 
formally assumed the positions of president and Communist Party leader that his 
father held until he died in July. 
</P>
<P>
 But his appearance could end speculation that health problems or political 
opponents are preventing him from succeeding his father, who ruled the 
reclusive Communist state for 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "His appearance at a ceremony officially ending 100 days of mourning for 
President Kim Il Sung shows that the North is ready to usher in a new era under 
Kim Jong Il," said Kim Kook Chin, a senior official at a state-funded South 
Korean research institute.

FINNISH VOTERS APPROVE JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION; POLITICS: REFERENDUM RESULT 
CHANGES NATION'S COLD WAR STATUS AS BUFFER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. SWEDEN, 
NORWAY VOTE NEXT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Finnish voters Sunday gave a clear "yes" to European Union membership in a 
development that will alter the political map of Europe and open a new era for 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, intensely debated campaign, Finns voted 57% to 43% in favor of 
joining the EU in January under terms negotiated by the Finnish government 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second national referendum in the country's history (the 
first, in 1931, repealed prohibition) and was widely perceived as the most 
important single decision the Finnish electorate has ever been asked to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 The result reduces a mandatory parliamentary vote on the issue to little more 
than formality. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time ever, the Finnish people have decided for themselves which 
road the country should follow at this crucial stage in the history of our 
continent," Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said in a televised address to 
the nation. "The result is politically and morally binding on the Parliament, 
the president and the government."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's vote brings the Nordic nation of 5 million people into the mainstream 
of European political events for the first time, effectively ending its long 
and unique Cold War role as a buffer between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, Sunday's result marks one more step in the gradual dismantling of the 
order that shaped Europe for 4 1/2 decades between the end of World War II in 
1945 and the collapse of communism in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnish "yes" vote carries other important ramifications for Europe. Among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 * It radically alters the geography of the European Union, extending its 
borders well into the Arctic for the first time and giving it its first common 
frontier with Russia, a border running for more than 700 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Together with Austria, which voted to join in a referendum in June, it 
provides an important psychological boost for advocates of a more unified 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * It heightens the prospects that Sweden and Norway might vote to join the EU 
in similar referendums scheduled for next month, and the prime ministers of 
both countries welcomed the Finnish result, saying they hoped that it will 
encourage a "yes" vote in their nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Austrian and Finnish votes were purposely scheduled first in hopes of 
undercutting opponents of EU membership who have a far stronger base in Sweden 
and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 A "yes" vote in all four nations would boost the number of nations in the EU 
from 12 to 16, increase its land mass by half and add 25 million consumers and 
$500 billion to the annual gross domestic product of what is already the 
world's largest, richest single market. 
</P>
<P>
 More important for American exporters, the addition of a group of 
traditionally free-trading nations would tilt the balance of power within the 
EU, where debates on greater openness on trade issues have traditionally split 
between the more liberal northern countries and those in the Mediterranean 
south that tend to advocate more restrictive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews outside polling stations in suburban Helsinki indicated that, 
despite the clear "yes" majority, many had agonized until the last minute 
before making their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about it a lot last night, and this morning I still didn't know, 
but in the end I voted yes," said Birgit Lindstroem, a retired librarian and a 
member of the country's Swedish minority. "It's better for Finland because we 
won't be alone." 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly half of Finland's trade is with the nations of the EU, pure 
economic factors seemed to play a secondary role in the Finnish decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was the issue of national security that seemed to be decisive. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU, with its commitment to developing a common foreign and security 
policy, seemed to offer a rare chance to escape Russian influence for a nation 
that has lived in Moscow's orbit for most of the last two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's politics and security that's driving us," said Hannu Olkinoure, editor 
of the country's largest business newspaper, Kauppalehti. "Something in me says 
there is a certain momentum, a chance for us to point out that we belong to the 
Western Hemisphere before Russia gets stronger."

ISRAEL TO REOPEN GAZA STRIP, RESUME PALESTINIAN TALKS; MIDEAST: CABINET VOICES 
APPROVAL FOR ARAFAT'S HARD LINE TOWARD MILITANTS. BUT HE FACES CONTINUED 
UNREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to ease tensions with the Palestinian self-governing authority, 
Israel's Cabinet decided Sunday to end the closure of the Gaza Strip, imposed 
last week after an Israeli soldier was kidnaped, and said that peace talks with 
the Palestinians will resume Tuesday in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat continued to 
feel the political heat from his decision last week to crack down on Hamas, the 
militant Islamic movement that claimed responsibility for abducting Cpl. 
Nachshon Waxman, who was killed Friday during an Israeli rescue attempt. Hamas 
leaders say they will not deal directly with the Palestinian Authority that 
Arafat heads until all of the estimated 200 Hamas supporters arrested last week 
are freed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred Hamas supporters blocked Netzarim, a main junction in northern 
Gaza, and threw stones at Jewish settlers and soldiers Sunday morning. Israeli 
soldiers reportedly fired shots in the air, then retreated to form a defensive 
ring around a nearby settlement. They left it to the Palestinian police to 
disperse the demonstrators peacefully. No casualties were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Cabinet ministers expressed satisfaction with Arafat's decision to 
confront Hamas, the main Palestinian group opposing Israel's peace accord with 
the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and other ministers reportedly 
urged that Israel move forward rapidly to expand its accords with the 
Palestinians in the wake of the kidnaping and death of Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no bigger prize to Hamas than stopping the talks with the 
Palestinians," Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians living in Gaza will be allowed to cross into Israel again today, 
the government decided. The 30,000 Palestinian workers who normally cross daily 
into Israel have been barred from doing so since Wednesday, after Hamas 
revealed that it had kidnaped Waxman the previous Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, insisting that Waxman was being held in Gaza, Israel abruptly 
recalled its chief negotiator, Danny Rothschild, from talks in Cairo with the 
Palestinians on holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin held Arafat personally responsible for Waxman's safe 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday morning, the Israelis learned that the 19-year-old Waxman, a dual 
U.S.-Israeli citizen, was being held by members of the Izzidin al-Qassam armed 
unit of Hamas in a West Bank Village just north of Jerusalem. Rabin ordered the 
rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault by an elite army unit failed, and Waxman and another Israeli 
soldier, Capt. Nir Poraz, were killed during the firefight that erupted when 
the unit stormed the house where Waxman was held. Israel said that Waxman was 
shot by his captors as the assault started.  
</P>
<P>
 In a late-night news conference Friday, Rabin accepted full responsibility for 
the decision to try to free Waxman through a military assault. 
</P>
<P>
 He charged that Waxman's captors were directed and led by militants inside 
Gaza and said that Arafat must prevent Gaza from becoming a launching pad for 
terrorist attacks on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, some Cabinet members criticized Rabin for failing to consult with 
them before ordering the rescue attempt, but they supported his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehuda Waxman, Cpl. Waxman's father, told Israel Radio that he too supported 
Rabin's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prime minister is the one who decides," the elder Waxman said. "He has 
information that we don't have."

THE ARTS; AT 104, FLORIDA AUTHOR STILL COMING ON STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas, godmother of the environmental movement in 
South Florida, is not planning a national tour to promote her latest book, 
which is unusual for a best-selling author. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, throughout her 104 years, Douglas has rarely done anything the usual 
way. "I think it's a big mistake to goad yourself into doing a lot of things 
that aren't really in your nature," she explained in her autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in an interview recently in the Coconut Grove cottage where she 
has lived and worked since 1926, Douglas insisted that she would attend as many 
local autograph parties as possible, and visit area schools to talk about 
"Freedom River." The novel, aimed at young readers, was first published in 1953 
and has been reissued after being out of print for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the 1840s, it describes the adventures of three boys -- one black, one 
Miccosukee Indian and one white -- in the days just before Florida joined the 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas had hoped to travel to Massachusetts last month for a reunion at her 
alma mater, Wellesley College. While there, she said, she intended to present a 
copy of "Freedom River" to the college and leave another for 14-year-old 
Chelsea Clinton, daughter of another Wellesley alumna, First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors nixed her plans, but she directed her secretary to send to the college 
the Medal of Freedom that President Clinton draped around her neck in a White 
House ceremony last November. "What else would I do with it?" she asked. "I 
have no relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas secured her place in history with "The Everglades: River of Grass," 
the 1947 classic that called attention to the unique role Florida's wetlands 
play in the delicate ecosystem of South Florida. Largely because of that work, 
Everglades National Park was established a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although blind and frail, Douglas remains acute, strong-willed, occasionally 
cranky. When asked what she likes about "Freedom River," she snapped: "That's a 
silly question." 
</P>
<P>
 For years Douglas has remarked that living to such an advanced age also seems 
somewhat silly, but she continues to enjoy life, lending her support to 
environmental causes, answering her mail and being kept up on local issues by a 
couple of secretaries who read to her daily. "She is also well aware of her 
royalty arrangement," said Charity Johnson, owner of Valiant Press, the book's 
publisher.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom River" is not the last book Douglas hopes to see in print in her 
lifetime. She is looking for a publisher for a 200,000-word manuscript on 
19th-Century English writer W.H. Hudson, a project she began in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharyn Richardson, a college administrator who has spent years helping Douglas 
finish the Hudson book, admits that the subject is obscure. "Yet it is 
fascinating, and I think there is a market for it," Richardson said. "And I 
can't stand the idea that Marjory wouldn't be here to see her final work in 
print." 
</P>
<P>
 By Douglas' own estimation, that may mean she has only three years to get the 
Hudson book published. On the occasion of her 100th birthday in 1990, she 
opined: "I have a feeling I won't live beyond 107. Why? I don't know. It's just 
one of those numbers."

GOVERNMENT; PARTISAN POLITICS SWAMPS ENVIRONMENTALISTS; CONGRESS BLOCKED 9 
MAJOR BILLS THIS YEAR. ACTIVISTS WORRY ABOUT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, POWERFUL 
MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To environmental officials and activists who started 1994 with soaring 
expectations for new legislation, the year was one of dashed hopes, sobering 
political realities and, in recent weeks, commitment to a fresh approach in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine major environmental bills were shelved or rejected by the 103rd Congress. 
Only one survived the partisan wars -- a bill President Clinton has signed to 
set aside millions of acres of California desert as wilderness and national 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Acres of forest were razed to supply paper for the many legislative summaries, 
position papers, faxes and press releases generated for the proposed 
environmental bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, environmentalists brushed close to victory. Some proposals, 
backed by coalitions of normally feuding interests, were passed by both houses 
of Congress only to be shot down by powerful minorities or strangled by 
partisan squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers on all sides agree that the experience bodes ill for the future of 
environmental legislation, especially an expected showdown over reauthorization 
of the Endangered Species Act next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the role of government, in the role of democratic systems," said 
one weary Administration official with a critical role in environmental 
policies. "But this is the first time I've ever worried that we're in big 
trouble as a country, that our institutions are broken. These people are 
elected to pass laws, to be responsive to the needs of the American people. And 
apparently the Republicans are more interested in gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and environmentalists are crafting strategies to avoid Congress 
where possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For environmental activists, this year's legislative debacle has rekindled a 
commitment to reform Congress and to energize support for environmental causes 
at the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Administration, the experience has prompted interest in bypassing what 
it sees as an obstructionist Congress and to instead bring about change through 
the regulatory process, where the broad language of existing law is translated 
into the fine print of policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have problems, and the environmental groups have problems," said one 
senior member of the Administration's environmental team. "To some extent, our 
problems are mutual, and we need to figure out how to improve our ability to 
effect changes. The (environmental) community is beginning to go through some 
self-examination. . . . Meanwhile, we will be examining our options for moving 
forward" through the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledged that using regulatory powers to make policy has its 
drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the process is exhaustive and can tie up federal workers' hours for 
months or years. It can take months to draft a new rule, hold rounds of public 
hearings and sift through the mountains of public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the regulatory process does not allow for sweeping changes because 
its purpose is to carry out existing laws. And finally, rule changes may last 
only as long as an Administration is in power. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule-making process in the past has been seen as a forum for brawling 
among groups on different sides -- the kind of partisan wrangling most often 
seen these days on Capitol Hill. But Administration officials now view Congress 
as more fractious than the various interests that have feuded over 
environmental policy for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials believe that the rule-making process can be used 
particularly to make some of the changes sought in failed bills to overhaul the 
Superfund toxic cleanup law and to reform mining laws.

 "Next year, we will return on two tracks: We will again pursue legislation, 
and we will also explore the full range of regulatory authority we now 
possess," Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said after the mining reform 
legislation was scuttled. 
</P>

<P>
 But if this year's session has prompted the Administration to avoid Congress 
where possible, it has goaded environmentalists into a head-on fight with their 
legislative nemeses. Americans want stronger environmental protection, they 
say, and lawmakers just don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists are split over why that is so and what they should do 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many leaders of the nation's largest environmental groups argue that Congress 
does not heed environmentalists because they have not made themselves a potent 
political force back in lawmakers' districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Those organizations, which include the environmental community's umbrella 
lobbying arm, the League of Conservation Voters, have sought to make 
environmentalists bigger givers and better political organizers out in the 
hustings, rather than better infighters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, led by the Sierra Club, argue that Congress does not heed 
environmentalists because the institution has broken down under the weight of 
influence peddlers, monied special interests and partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have majority rule anymore," said Carl Pope, president of the Sierra 
Club. "In the face of major obstacles, this Congress voted for a significant 
environmental agenda. But every piece of this agenda has been blocked by a 
minority, and in many cases, by 10 to 15 members of the Senate. There's been a 
collapse of majority rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope and others have called for major campaign reform that would break the 
bond between lawmakers and big contributors. Cut Down in Congress 
</P>
<P>
 Among this year's environmental victims of congressional wrangling: * Mining: 
House and Senate both passed bills designed to overhaul laws governing mining 
on federal lands. The two chambers could not agree on a compromise, and the 
measure died. * Superfund: House leaders discontinued efforts to get a package 
to overhaul the Superfund program passed after Republicans insisted on floor 
debate and votes on amendments that would have splintered support. Original 
backers were an unusal coalition of environmentalists, manufacturers and 
insurance industry representatives. * Safe Drinking Water: Both the House and 
Senate passed bills reauthorizing the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, which sets 
purity standards for tap water. Both bills would have stiffened some purity 
requirerments and eased others. The bill foundered when House Republicans 
demanded amendments that would have diluted the bill. * Clean Water: A bid to 
reauthorize the Clean Water Act foundered this summer largely over a proposal 
to revamp the federal government's wetlands-protection program.

U.N. LEADER RECOMMENDS ENDING SOMALIA MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended ending the ill-starred 
$1-billion-a-year U.N. operation in Somalia on March 31, but he says the 
15,000-strong force will need naval and air reinforcements in case it has to 
pull out under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the worst-case scenario, UNOSOM (U.N. Operation in Somalia) forces would 
have to withdraw in face of hostile action by Somali factions and/or widespread 
banditry, which would prevent the use of commercial air and sea transport," he 
said in a report over the weekend to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have accordingly approached several member states who possess the naval and 
air assets required to reinforce UNOSOM during the critical withdrawal phase, 
whether or not such withdrawal is carried out under hostile conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said a secure and orderly withdrawal would take between 60 and 
120 days, depending on security conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinforcements would have to include naval elements with fire support and 
sea-lift capabilities, as well as military aircraft.

U.S. DEFENSE CHIEF AIMS FOR MORE TIES TO CHINA'S ARMY; ASIA: PERRY'S BEIJING 
VISIT IS FIRST BY PENTAGON OFFICIAL OF HIS RANK SINCE 1989. HE STRIKES A 
CONCILIATORY NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry arrived Sunday in China for a four-day 
visit that he hopes will help forge a closer military relationship with the 
world's largest army.  
</P>
<P>
 His visit is the first to China by an American defense chief since most 
military contacts were severed after the bloody 1989 crackdown by People's 
Liberation Army troops in Tian An Men Square. The official New China News 
Agency described it as "marking that the military relations between China and 
the United States have been resumed to a new level." 
</P>
<P>
 In his toast at a banquet hosted by Defense Minister Chi Haotian, Perry struck 
a tone of reconciliation five years after the Tian An Men episode. "These 
meetings will help our two militaries to build understanding and trust that 
have been missing for too many years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Western diplomat here, Perry's agenda includes asking Chinese 
military officials to increase pressure on China's longtime ally North Korea on 
the issue of nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry flew to Beijing from Kuwait, where he told American troops that they had 
averted another Gulf War by facing down Iraq. During the flight here, Perry 
told reporters that he intends to raise issues of China's human rights policies 
and its recently renewed series of underground nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will stress that the military relationship is bounded by the political 
context, which includes human rights," Perry said, according to Reuters news 
agency.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. defense industry representatives based in Beijing hope the secretary's 
visit will pave the way for eventual sales of military-related technology to 
the huge Chinese market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want technology that can be used for civilian purposes but that can also 
have military applications," the Western diplomat said. Included on the Chinese 
technological wish list are air-traffic control devices, automated 
command-and-control communications systems and robotic production systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are interested in anything in the area of automation," the diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rumors that China's 90-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, is near 
death, the visit also comes at a propitious moment to establish relationships 
with top officials, both military and civilian, who are likely to play a role 
in the post-Deng succession period as China struggles to find a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some Chinese officials are hoping the Perry visit foreshadows an 
eventual visit to China by President Clinton. Supporters of Chinese President 
and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin argue that a Clinton visit would help 
cement Jiang's position as Deng's successor in the uncertain period that always 
follows the death of a Chinese leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the banquet hosted by Chi at the Great Hall of the People, Perry met 
with most of China's top brass at a military museum reception. Although the 
official purpose of his visit is to attend a session of a joint Sino-U.S. 
Commission on Defense Conversion, Perry will also meet with Premier Li Peng and 
Jiang. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, on Tuesday he is scheduled to deliver a speech and answer 
questions from Chinese senior military officers at the National Defense 
University. Wednesday, after meeting with Jiang in Wuhan, Perry is scheduled to 
preside over a ceremony at the Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell Museum in Chongqing, the 
former U.S. World War II military headquarters.

U.S. WARNS IRAQ ABOUT FURTHER THREATS; PERSIAN GULF: SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REMAINING 
TROOPS APPEAR TO RETREAT FROM KUWAITI BORDER. THEIR RETURN COULD MEAN IMMEDIATE 
RETALIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Iraq appeared to be pulling the last of its elite Republican Guards out of the 
"no-fly" zone near Kuwait on Sunday, but the Clinton Administration kept the 
pressure on, warning Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that the United States may 
retaliate immediately the next time the troops threaten Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution ordering the 
Iraqis to withdraw from the border area with Kuwait, Pentagon officials 
reported troop movements indicating that the second of two Republican Guard 
divisions sent south two weeks ago was pulling out and moving northward. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the divisions left the area several days ago, but another had remained 
camped around Nasiriyah, south of the 32nd Parallel, prompting the Clinton 
Administration to press, over initial Russian objections, for a new Security 
Council resolution warning the Iraqis that they faced "serious consequences" if 
they did not withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution was finally passed unanimously late Saturday after a day of 
intense negotiations that, for the time being at least, appeared to paper over 
the Administration's differences with Moscow over Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev's mission to Baghdad last week. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Saturday, Pentagon officials said that the 10,000 Iraqi troops 
camped around Nasiriyah were showing no signs of leaving. But although the 
troops were still in the area Sunday, officials said there were signs that the 
division was preparing to move north. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have indications that the Republican Guards in the Nasiriyah area are 
beginning to pack their stuff," one senior Pentagon official said, adding that 
details were still sketchy but that the preliminary "indications are that 
they're moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials declined to elaborate, citing the sensitivity of intelligence 
information, but an Administration source said after a White House meeting 
between President Clinton and his senior military and foreign policy advisers 
Sunday that the President was "cautiously optimistic" that the Iraqis were 
finally complying with the U.N. ultimatum. "But we continue to watch the 
situation closely to make sure this is not a Potemkin pullout," the source 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not announcing that it's finished yet . . . but (Hussein) does seem to 
be moving in the right direction," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."  
</P>
<P>
 But as the latest Gulf crisis began to recede, it seemed apparent that the 
Administration had only temporarily bridged a widening gap with Moscow over 
what to do about Hussein. The Iraqi president has continually refused to comply 
with a series of Security Council ultimatums that the United States insists 
must all be met before it agrees to ease any of the trade sanctions that have 
crippled Iraq's economy and cut off all its oil exports. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear departure from the Clinton Administration's position, Kozyrev 
announced in Baghdad last week that Russia would work toward an easing of the 
U.N. sanctions in return for what he said was a promise by Hussein to recognize 
Kuwait and respect its borders. Kozyrev was scheduled to arrive at the United 
Nations today, and Russian officials sought to delay a vote on the resolution 
until he had reported to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But arguing that Iraq should receive no reward for withdrawing its troops, 
U.S. officials strongly opposed the Russian initiative and pressed the Security 
Council to approve a diluted version of the resolution, which warned only that 
Iraq would face unspecified "consequences" if it failed to withdraw, without 
specifically threatening or authorizing the use of force. In the end, the 
resolution passed unanimously -- but only after the Russians were given some 
face-saving language acknowledging the usefulness of Kozyrev's mission without 
endorsing its results. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving aggressively to counter the impression that the council was divided, 
Christopher and other senior Administration officials called the resolution a 
strong warning that puts Hussein on notice that he faces immediate retaliation 
the next time his troops violate the "no-fly" zone in southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the next time we'll probably not wait. We will take action, strong 
action, against him," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is clear," Clinton added in a statement released Sunday. "Iraq 
must complete its withdrawal. It must not threaten its neighbors in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The warnings were echoed and amplified by U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, 
who said that the United States felt it already had the authorization under 
previous U.N. resolutions to use force against Iraq and that it reserves the 
right to do so "multilaterally when we can and unilaterally when we must." 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of the Security Council vote, she said Sunday on ABC-TV's 
"This Week With David Brinkley," is that "the international community agrees 
with us that Saddam Hussein cannot keep being a repeat offender." 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of all these remarks, other officials conceded privately, was aimed 
at discouraging Hussein from trying to take advantage of what still seemed to 
be U.S.-Russian divisions over how to handle Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kuwait, however, officials said they were satisfied that the resolution 
gave the U.S.-led allied force in the area the authorization to reply with 
force if the Iraqis fail to complete their withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives a clear mandate to the coalition here to see that there will not 
be any repetition of such activities by Iraq," Kuwaiti Information Minister 
Saud al Sabah told The Times. "It's so wide open that the coalition now can 
decide exactly where to draw the line in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 The "whole picture has turned now," he added, "and . . . any possibility that 
Iraq might pursue other ways of lifting sanctions is going to be very futile." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Scott Kraft in Kuwait City contributed to this report.

RAMPAGE OF 35-TON FRONT-END LOADER RUINS CAR DEALER'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A giant unoccupied front-end loader rumbled out of control for half a mile, 
crunching 16 cars at an auto dealership and just missing a video store and some 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said someone started the 35-ton loader Saturday after construction 
workers left a nearby demolition site.The unidentified person drove it a short 
while before jumping off. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt as it thundered over railroad tracks, just missed two sets of 
power lines and passed within 15 feet of a Blockbuster Video Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers said the loader disappeared in some underbrush, reappeared climbing 
a hill and headed toward the auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge piece of equipment moved down a line of new and used cars, climbing 
over them, crunching them flat or ripping off their back ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the casualties was a fully loaded $32,000 Oldsmobile 98 that had arrived 
from the factory a few hours earlier. The car was flattened into a 3-foot-high 
metal pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 The front-end loader then plowed a $28,000 Oldsmobile into the wall of Corbo's 
service garage, its treads gouging a 3-foot trench in the lot. Someone finally 
jumped on and shut it off.

3 ARE KILLED IN GANG-RELATED SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three people were killed Sunday in gang-related shootings, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A transient, estimated to be 45 years old, was shot by an unidentified 
passenger in a car at Yucca Street and Wilcox Avenue in Hollywood about 1 a.m. 
when he and a group of gang members approached the vehicle and "exchanged 
words" with the occupants, according to a Los Angeles Police Department 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The car drove off and the transient died at a nearby hospital 30 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, across town near Exposition Park, two youths were killed in a 
two-story apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the building at 4036 Broadway Place heard gunshots and saw men 
and women hurrying from the scene, Officer Daniel Ruelas said. The body of 
Edgar Flores, 18, was found at the base of the stairs leading into the complex, 
with a single gunshot wound to the head. The bullet-riddled body of Rupert 
Lopez, 17, was found a few steps up, Ruelas said. Both were declared dead at 
the scene.

KEY DEMOCRAT SEES MODERATE LOSSES

<P>
 Democrats will lose only three seats in the Senate and keep majorities in both 
chambers of Congress in the coming elections, Democratic National Committee 
adviser Tony Coelho predicted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders, backed by polls showing a surge in support for Republican 
candidates, predict that the GOP will win control of the Senate and have a 
chance of capturing a majority in the House for the first time since 1954.To do 
that, Republicans need to pick up seven seats in the Senate and 40 in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coelho, on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," predicted that his party's strength 
will drop by only three in the Senate and 20 to 25 in the House, "normal 
historic numbers" for the party in power to lose in midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who would become Speaker if the Republicans gain a 
majority, has predicted his party could pick up more than 70 seats in the 
House.

THE HIDDEN PROBLEM OF RURAL POVERTY; ECONOMICS: DESPITE A LIFETIME OF WORK, 
JACQUELINE IVORY FINDS HERSELF SUBSISTING AS SHE DID IN HER DEPRESSION 
CHILDHOOD.

 Jacqueline Ivory remembers the Red Cross clothes. They were usually made of 
red cloth. And they were usually ill-fitting; everything was one size, and she 
was just a small girl of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Bakersfield during the Depression. When her oil-worker father lost 
his job, Ivory began working, living summers with more well-to-do families as a 
mother's helper to support her own kin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 63 years since, through two marriages and three children, she has 
rarely stopped working. But despite the passage of years and a lifetime of 
experience, Ivory has not been able to escape the poverty of her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives now near Marysville, in a low-income, subsidized housing project for 
the elderly, subsisting on a monthly Social Security check of barely more than 
$600. A Medi-Cal recipient, she can't find a doctor in town who will treat her 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I look at it, here I am at 75 with no residuals," she says softly. 
"But I made my own choices, and my quality of life was always rich."

 The problems of rural poverty are rarely addressed by politicians and the news 
media, and they remain largely invisible to most Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid some of the richest agricultural land on earth, there lives a large 
population of poor Californians beset by double-digit unemployment, abysmal 
housing conditions and fierce competition for scarce farm jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking 1991 study by the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Foundation found rural poverty and hunger to be serious and overlooked 
problems. Unemployment in many Central Valley counties, for example, remains 
more than twice the statewide average. Kern, Stanislaus and Merced counties 
have among the highest infant mortality rates in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weather conditions, the seasonality of agricultural work, plant closures and 
mechanization all contribute to frequent layoffs, insecurity and joblessness," 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 In her high school years, Ivory worked at a printing business, then got into 
newspaper work in Marysville, even running her own little farm weekly until it 
went broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she worked with emotionally disturbed children in San Francisco. And 
then, at age 58, she decided to pursue her dream of a college education. She 
earned a psychology degree at UC Santa Cruz but never was able to find a job 
utilizing her skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I manage to get by," says Ivory, who despite setbacks is trying to start a 
desktop publishing business from her home. "But there are other people who live 
here, women, whose Social Security is practically nothing and their income is 
decimated."

INMATE JOBS HARDER TO FIND AS PRISON POPULATION SOARS; CORRECTIONS: REPORT 
CRITICIZES DEPARTMENT FOR LACKING A 'CLEAR VISION OF GOALS FOR WORK PROGRAMS.' 
OFFICIALS SAY PRISONERS ARE ARRIVING WITH FEWER SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the prison population swells, the Department of Corrections finds it ever 
more difficult to find jobs for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report this year, the Little Hoover Commission criticized the department 
for "lacking a unified structure and a clear vision of goals for work 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The department," said the report, "has placed illiterate inmates in jobs 
without first raising their education level, created an employment demand for 
lower-level inmates while high-security inmates wait for assignments, and 
wasted state resources on unproductive job programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Prison Industry Authority is the main division responsible for providing 
jobs to inmates, putting them to work at prison farms producing milk, eggs and 
beef for inmates, in factories making clothing worn by prisoners, and at prison 
laundries. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison Industry workers help the state by fighting wildfires and making car 
license plates, eyeglasses for Medi-Cal patients and furniture used by 
government agencies. Their pay averages 50 cents an hour. Inmates on fire crews 
get 95 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prison population is at record highs, the number of working 
inmates has fallen to 6,300 from almost 8,000 in 1991. Sales dropped by $20 
million to $127 million between 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials blame declining sales on the recession and state budget 
cuts. They also say efforts to put inmates to work are hindered because 
prisoners are arriving with fewer skills than in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the program is being assailed in a federal class-action suit in 
which inmates contend that their hourly pay violates the federal minimum wage 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are confident the lawsuit will fail. But a victory by inmates 
could cost the state millions of dollars in back and future wages. 
</P>
<P>
 California law prohibits goods made in prison from being sold on the open 
market in the United States. The prohibition dates to the 1800s, when labor 
campaigned against inmates being allowed to do work that might cost law-abiding 
people their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something called free enterprise," said Robert Burton, a veteran 
member of the board that oversees prison industries. "Here, the workers and the 
entrepreneurs have something in common. They don't want a convict taking their 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, no prohibition against selling prison-made goods outside 
the country. The Prison Industry Authority has been testing export markets for 
denim jeans in Asia and Europe for a year. But it has been slow in starting and 
only a few thousand pairs have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 One exporter trying to develop a market for California prison-made jeans in 
Japan is calling the product Gangsta Blues, said Andy Parks, marketing director 
for prison industries. The authority obliges by stenciling on labels saying the 
jeans were made at Folsom or Soledad prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has kind of a fascination with crime in California. It's kind of 
strange," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's prison industry is in the export business, selling denims to Japan 
and Italy, bringing in several million dollars. With no law in Oregon 
prohibiting domestic sales, that state's prisons also sell garments in retail 
stores. Oregon even has its own advertising agency and logo: "Prison Blues, 
made on the inside to be worn on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon prisoners make up to $7 an hour. They pay taxes, give 5% to a victims 
fund, 5% to family support, 50% for room and board, and put 25% into savings. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a 1990 initiative sponsored by Gov. George Deukmejian and 
approved by voters created a limited exemption to the prohibition against using 
inmate labor to produce goods sold in general commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a separate program called Joint Ventures, prisoners at Folsom make neon 
signs for hospitals and casinos. At San Quentin, inmates bake cookies. At 
Avenal, inmates run a pig farm, and they recycle garbage at Chino. They make at 
least minimum wage, with most of it going to victims, taxes, room and board, 
family support and mandatory savings. A total of $1.37 million has been paid to 
inmates since the program began. 
</P>
<P>
 Joint Ventures director Noreen Blonien said her goal was to have 500 inmates 
working by now. There are 200. She cited the poor economy for hindering 
expansion, along with businesses' fear about operating from prisons, and prison 
officials' concerns about security. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Prison Industry Authority, Joint Ventures has bold plans and calls 
itself "the future of corrections."

A COSTLY BURDEN FOR STATE; SICK, DISABLED INMATES ARE MOST EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE; 
SOME SAY THEY SHOULD BERELEASED IF NO LONGER A THREAT, BUT JUDGES USUALLY FREE 
ONLY THE TERMINALLY ILL

<P>
 In his wheelchair, he looks benign, almost pitiful -- this man who was 
convicted of methodically shooting to death four people in a dispute over drugs 
five years ago in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Fonseca was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, and was dispatched as a strapping 28-year-old to Pelican Bay State 
Prison, the place reserved for the worst of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 His incarceration was supposed to be a custodial no-brainer: Keep him fed, 
clothed and locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 But two years ago his Pelican Bay cellmate gouged out Fonseca's right eye and 
bashed his head against a concrete floor, causing severe brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Fonseca languishes in a hospital cell at the California Institution for 
Men. He is unable to stand up on his own and is incontinent. He is in therapy 
to learn how to manipulate his arms and legs after three surgeries released the 
contractures in his limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonseca is one of about 200 state prisoners who receive acute hospital level 
care in California prisons or at nearby community hospitals. More than 1,000 
others receive long-term nursing care behind bars. Another 3,000 inmates are 
being treated for acute mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled inmates include amputees, paraplegics, the blind. Some are 
debilitated by strokes or by AIDS, heart disease or old age. They are the most 
expensive and burdensome of California's 126,000 state prisoners, and under the 
"three strikes" sentencing law, their numbers are expected to increase as the 
prison population mushrooms and grows older. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deepening prison crisis, debilitated inmates such as Fonseca are 
kept behind bars at considerable taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is neither humane nor productive for our society to keep people in prison 
when their physical condition has deteriorated to the point that they are no 
longer a threat," said Alison Hardy, an attorney with the reform-oriented 
Prison Law Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation to release such prisoners is under study by the Assembly Judiciary 
Committee staff, but it is doubtful that such a measure could survive the 
tough-on-crime political climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials say that judges, who must approve early releases, are not 
likely to let out debilitated inmates who are not terminally ill. The 
Department of Corrections recommended only four such releases during the past 3 
1/2 years and, in three cases, the judges refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the limited track record we have with these kinds of inmates shows 
that the courts are not inclined to grant these releases," said corrections 
spokeswoman Christine May. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates who are expected to die of their illnesses sometimes do get out of 
prison through a "compassionate release" procedure that excludes prisoners 
sentenced to death and those serving life without parole. But corrections 
officials are cautious about approving compassionate releases for fear that an 
inmate will unexpectedly recover and commit a new crime or that the public will 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure requires that prison doctors determine that an inmate has less 
than six months to live. The director of corrections may then ask the 
sentencing judge to free the prisoner. Sometimes the procedure is so slow that 
the candidate for release never gets out alive. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 3 1/2 years, prison physicians recommended compassionate 
releases for 208 inmates, most of them dying of AIDS or cancer. The director of 
corrections approved 113 of the recommendations and, of those, judges released 
69. 
</P>
<P>
 But prisoners suffering from non-terminal illnesses almost never receive such 
releases, no matter how debilitating the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 In a first-floor locked medical wing at Vacaville prison, nurses and doctors 
tend to men who can barely get out of bed -- let alone escape. One man suffers 
from dementia and another from a chronic heart problem. One is paralyzed from a 
gunshot wound, another from a stab wound. A stroke victim appears oblivious to 
the glowing television screen on the wall above him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes sentencing judges are approached by attorneys or politicians seeking 
the release of such inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), the outgoing chairman of the Joint 
Committee on Prisons, has tried without success to persuade a judge to release 
a 28-year-old multiple sclerosis patient who is serving 25 years to life for 
robbery and murder. Since entering prison, Craig Lundy has gone virtually blind 
and his body is twisted into a fetal ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is making sure he won't hurt anybody," said Susan Wallace, 
Presley's chief counsel. "He won't fall out of bed on you and hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 The only inmate suffering from a non-terminal affliction to be granted an 
early release from prison was Troy Christian Davey. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 26, Davey was involved in the stabbing death of a friend in Yolo County 
five years ago. An acquaintance of Davey's wielded the knife and pleaded guilty 
to manslaughter; he was sentenced to seven years. But Davey refused to 
plea-bargain and was convicted of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 15 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Davey later attempted to kill himself by drinking cleaning fluid in the Yolo 
County Jail. He was sent to the California Medical Facility at Vacaville where, 
in January, 1990, he again tried suicide with an overdose of medication. 
Shortly afterward, he was placed in a small cellblock where prisoners are 
evaluated for possible placement in the prison psychiatric hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prisoners in these special units receive group therapy, others are 
considered too psychotic to interact with anyone. In one unit visited by a 
Times reporter, inmates were so mentally ill that they lay on the floor and one 
had crawled under his bunk. Outside, others paced in one-man, kennel-like 
exercise cages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials are under court order to improve care for mentally 
disturbed inmates at Vacaville, but continually fail to meet the standards set. 
Earlier this month in Sacramento, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton 
threatened to jail corrections officials if they do not make the improvements 
agreed to in a legal settlement with prison reform attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that corrections officials apparently are "not serious" about 
improving mental health care, Karlton urged that they consider the volume of 
criticism and ask themselves, "Can everybody be wrong but us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reformers say conditions will grow even worse as a result of 
"three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect it's going to deteriorate even further," said Meena V. Meenakshi, 
who quit her post as chief psychiatrist at Vacaville in protest of conditions. 
"They're not geared to taking care of the people who are there already." 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Davey, who was locked in a unit reserved for the most 
deranged inmates. In bare concrete cells behind a double set of steel doors, 
they are guarded by correctional officers who wear armored vests and goggles as 
protection against attacks and hurled feces and urine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after overdosing, Davey tried to hang himself with a sheet. The 
suicide attempt left him a quadriplegic with the mind of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Davey's mother, Alice Harris, said that during the next three years she wrote 
to prison officials and politicians attempting to get her son released as his 
limbs contracted from atrophy. State records indicate that prison medical 
personnel stopped giving him physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Yolo County Superior Court Judge James Stevens, the jurist who 
sentenced Davey to prison, intervened. "Prison wasn't having any effect on 
him," the judge recalled, "because he didn't know where he was." Stevens also 
believed that releasing Davey was a "question of common decency." 
</P>
<P>
 After an inquiry from the judge, a state investigator found Davey barely able 
to speak. In response to a question, he managed to say, "I've been a good, good 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sent home to Sacramento in March, 1993, Davey is now on probation for life and 
under the care of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by attorney Christopher T. Cody of Oakland accuses prison 
officials of failure to take steps to prevent Davey's suicide attempt, failure 
to provide proper medical care, and operation of substandard medical facilities 
at Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department denies the charges and says Davey was under close 
supervision before the hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chino, 400 miles to the south, the once-ferocious killer Carlos Fonseca is 
kept in a locked prison hospital cell, where he is diapered like an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Janice, clings to the hope that someday she will be able to take him 
home and care for him. She says he is no longer physically or mentally capable 
of crime and has no idea why he is in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "He continually asks me why," she said.

MTA CUTS CABLE; HUNDREDS LOSE PHONE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MTA workers digging a subway station in Hollywood hit two underground 
telephone cables this weekend, shutting off phone service to as many as 2,400 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Full service was expected to be restored by noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers for Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the MTA's contractor for the Red Line, were 
digging the foundations of the station at Hollywood Boulevard and Western 
Avenue when they drilled through the cables around 3 a.m. Saturday, MTA 
spokesman Steve Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chesser said the MTA had thought the cables were not in use, and was checking 
to see whether it was given inaccurate information. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell received 350 "trouble reports" from customers, spokeswoman Linda 
Bonniksen said. And "it doesn't matter if the lines are live or dead. . . . We 
don't want our facilities damaged in any way, whether they're live or not," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Line project has been plagued by setbacks, and Hollywood Boulevard has 
been a particular trouble spot. In August, tunneling caused parts of the 
boulevard to sink by as much as nine inches.

WILSON BLAMES ILLS ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; ELECTION: GOVERNOR HITS FAMILIAR 
THEMES IN LAGUNA HILLS STOP; FAILS TO MENTION MASSIVE PROTEST EARLIER IN THE 
DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, failing to mention a massive protest earlier in the day 
against the immigration ballot initiative he supports, blamed illegal 
immigrants Sunday for costing the state billions of dollars in education, 
prison and health services. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 45-minute address, Wilson told a largely supportive, elderly audience of 
about 400 people at the Leisure World retirement community that illegal 
immigrants soak up 10% of the state's general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But he avoided saying anything about one of the biggest protest marches in Los 
Angeles in decades. About 70,000 people marched in opposition to Proposition 
187, which would bar most state health, education and welfare aid to illegal 
immigrants. The governor's image was burned in effigy near City Hall amid 
speeches and protest slogans that vilified him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to provide services to our own legal residents," Wilson said in 
support of Proposition 187. "Now that is terribly unfair. . . . I say we should 
end those services to illegal immigrants. We are . . . rewarding people for 
violating U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
 He showed no sign of concern about the protest as he portrayed himself as 
law-and-order governor who led the state's welfare reform effort, promoted a 
pro-business climate and responded effectively to such crises as the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Running hard for reelection, the governor reserved much of the bite in his 
speech for his Democratic opponent, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, accusing 
her of taking soft positions on both illegal immigration and crime. Brown 
opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor estimated that illegal immigration costs the educational system 
alone $1.5 billion annually. He reiterated that the money would be better used 
to put thousands more youngsters in preschool, buy computers for every fourth 
grader and expand the state health care program for children known as "Healthy 
Start." 
</P>
<P>
 He derisively dismissed the argument made by Proposition 187 opponents that 
the state owes an education to children no matter where they come from. The 
government that owes an education to illegal immigrants "is the government from 
whence these children came," Wilson said, drawing applause from his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson criticized the federal government for forcing states to absorb the 
costs of what he called a federal problem. He reminded the audience that he had 
sued the government twice over the issue, and vowed to do it a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking out at Brown on crime issues, Wilson charged that she cannot be 
trusted to appoint judges who will uphold the death penalty -- or hold firm 
herself when asked for clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson compared Brown to her brother, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, 
reminding listeners that her brother appointed Rose Bird as chief justice on 
the state Supreme Court. Bird was recalled by voters in 1986 after she voted 
consistently to overturn death-penalty rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said she is personally opposed to the death penalty, but would 
enforce it as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I believe Kathleen Brown will appoint tough judges?" Wilson asked. " I do 
not." The governor said he ran for governor four years ago to make the state a 
"much safer place," and he believes he has done that. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the difference between Ms. Brown and me," he said. "She's out of touch 
with the real people and the real issues. . . . To me, (crime) is the No. 1 
issue, the paramount concern."

VOTERS TO DO DOUBLE DUTY, THANKS TO RECALL; CAMPAIGN: FULLERTON RESIDENTS WILL 
ELECT THREE COUNCIL MEMBERS TUESDAY, THEN RETURN TO POLLS IN JUST THREE WEEKS. 
THEY WILL CHOOSE FROM 24 CANDIDATES IN UNPRECEDENTED CONTESTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Residents may be forgiven if they are confused about the upcoming City Council 
elections, which will take them to the polls twice in the next few weeks to 
choose new leaders from a total of 24 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, voters will elect one person to serve a two-year council term and 
two others to serve terms lasting about a month. Then, on Nov. 8, voters will 
return to the voting booths to choose two council members for four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 This unprecedented election schedule was prompted by June's successful recall 
of three council members who last year approved a 2% utility tax. Tuesday's 
special election was called to fill the seats of recalled Mayor A.B. (Buck) 
Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead will remain in office until Oct. 25, when 
Tuesday's winners will be inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald F. Tanney, Orange County's registrar of voters, said he cannot remember 
another situation like Fullerton's back-to-back elections.  
</P>
<P>
 Holding two elections was not the idea of the City Council. City officials 
originally consolidated the special election to replace those recalled with the 
general election but were sued by the Fullerton Recalls Committee and forced to 
hold separate elections. The cost of the dual elections is about $117,000, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Catlin's and McClanahan's terms were to expire in November regardless 
of the recall, their seats will be contested again in November. The City 
Council later this month will set the inauguration date for the November 
winners, so those elected to the two short-term seats will serve between three 
and six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Bankhead's term expires in 1996 and whoever replaces him in 
Tuesday's election will remain in office until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates vying Tuesday for Bankhead's two-year seat are: attorney Peter 
Godfrey, 49, administrative office assistant Brent Hardwick, 50, data 
processing supervisor Claudia M. Keller, 37, stock broker Dreux D. Valenti, 25, 
software engineer Jacob Spaargaren, 35, and business owner Dave Zenger, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. McNutt's name will also appear on the special election ballot for 
the two-year term, but the 50-year-old manufacturing company owner said he made 
a mistake when he registered for that election. Instead, he has asked his 
supporters to vote for him in the November election; his name is on the ballot 
then as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the 11 candidates vying for the two short-term seats are not running 
in the November election, when the seats' four-year terms will be contested. 
Those in it just for the chance of being on the council for a month are: David 
H. Jerome, 29, publisher of a comedy newspaper, Bradley M. Kimball, 33, a 
systems analyst, and Armand A. (Vic) Victoria, 65, a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 The other eight on Tuesday's ballot are all running in the general election 
also, for four-year terms. They are: business people Jack Dean, 46, Conrad 
DeWitte, 46, Gary E. Nouskajian, 43, James Tanaka, 37, Michael J. Wagner, 46, 
and Bahia Wilson, 44, attorney Jan Flory, 50, and real estate agent Leland C. 
Wilson, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Running just in November for the four-year terms are Bankhead, 62, a former 
police captain; Edith J. O'Donnell, 65, a librarian; McNutt; Michael J. 
Mummert, 35, a free-lance writer; Stuart Stitch, 25, a political campaign 
consultant, and Carole E. Wink, 55, a transportation administrator. Dick 
Logemann, 51, is on the ballot but has stepped out of the race, saying it is 
too expensive to run a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 If they win, Bahia Wilson, a former grand juror, and Tanaka would become the 
first African American and Japanese American, respectively, to serve on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick, who is endorsed by the police officers' union, has portrayed himself 
as the anti-recall candidate. He was against the recall effort and backed the 
three recalled council members when they voted for the utility tax because it 
saved the city from possibly having to cut jobs in the police and fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most controversial issues in the back-to-back elections are whether 
the utility tax should be repealed and whether the Redevelopment Agency should 
be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee, which led the successful recall campaign, 
says voters ousted Catlin, McClanahan and Bankhead because they approved the 
utility tax. The group has endorsed DeWitte, Dean and Spaargaren, candidates 
who promise to vigorously pursue a repeal of the 2% levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates -- Wink, Keller, Victoria, Stitch, Godfrey, Mummert, Valenti, 
Wagner and Zenger -- have also pledged to repeal the tax, as long as it can be 
done without seriously impacting city services. The tax is expected to provide 
$4.6 million in revenue to the city in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 fiscal years, 
and balance the city's $81.2-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates said they would favor allowing the tax to expire on schedule, 
Sept. 30, 1995. Bahia Wilson said, however, that she would like to put the 
issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 An overwhelming number of candidates said the Redevelopment Agency should not 
be abolished because it helps prevent blight and keep businesses and city 
streets attractive to visitors and also generates tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of the agency -- such as DeWitte, Dean, Spaargaren and Valenti, who have 
pledged to vote to abolish it -- said it creates unfair advantages for business 
within the city's redevelopment areas. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials defend the Redevelopment Agency, which was created in the 
mid-1970s, saying it has made possible several projects, including badly needed 
parking structures downtown, the Marriott Hotel and Sports Complex at Cal State 
Fullerton and the Metro shopping center. Redevelopment money also was used to 
help renovate some historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is scheduled to be phased out by the year 2018. Abolishing it 
sooner may be illegal, City Manager James L. Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large field of candidates has been facing off at a series of community 
forums, sometimes engaging in fierce debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolutely critical with all the confusion regarding issues in 
Fullerton that voters attend forums and find out what candidates are saying to 
be able to make an informed choice," said Diane Ross, a League of Women Voters 
spokeswoman and long-time Fullerton resident.

AUTUMN MAKES ITSELF AT HOME AS FRONT ARRIVES; WEATHER: COOL, BRISK BREEZES 
PROMPT MANY TO HUNT UP SWEATERS AND LIGHT FIREPLACES. CHOPPY WAVES AFFECT 
BOATERS AND THE FEW BEACH-GOERS.

 Sweat shirts went on, windows went down and log fires were lit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure as football and falling leaves, a chill dose of fall weather visited 
Orange County over the weekend -- courtesy of a passing cold front that offered 
the year's first taste of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Firewood business was as brisk as the air, while windy conditions and choppy 
waves kept the usual beach crowd at home and prompted the Coast Guard to issue 
a small-craft advisory for the offshore area beyond Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting that time of year again," said Joanne TerBush, co-owner of A&L 
Firewood in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the autumn weather is not expected to last long. The cold front was 
already past the region, and meteorologists said temperatures that fell to the 
upper 50s should start rising again, possibly as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm betting on a warming trend," said Kris Farnsworth, a meteorologist for 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. Monday, though, is 
"the hardest day to figure out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight temperatures dipped Sunday morning to lows of 56 degrees at the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station and 57 degrees in Santa Ana -- cool but normal 
levels for this time of year. The temperature reached a high of 76 degrees in 
Santa Ana on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farnsworth predicted that temperatures would rise slightly Monday and creep 
into the 80s by Tuesday. He said a new cold front could pass into Northern 
California by the end of the week, but doubted it would have much effect on 
Southern California weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas company officials saw little increase in the number of people calling to 
have their furnaces turned on, but Trudy Crawford, a supervisor at Southern 
California Gas Co., noted that the early birds took care of that during rainy 
weather two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't gotten our first flood of calls yet," she said.

UNICEF KNOCKS ON NEW DOORS FOR SUPPORT; CHARITY: WHAT BEGAN AS A HALLOWEEN 
TRADITION TO HELP CHILDREN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TACKLES SAME PROBLEMS AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 People remember the little orange boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, American children have carried them door-to-door on Halloween 
night, collecting donations for UNICEF instead of candy. The box was a bridge, 
linking children of the world's most wealthy nation, with needy children in 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, the line that separates them from us has blurred, forcing 
UNICEF's American supporters -- particularly those in Los Angeles -- to sharpen 
their approach to fund-raising and advocacy, aiming their efforts for those at 
home as well as abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just talk about children 'over there' because those children live 
here now," said Marilyn F. Solomon, executive director of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the U.S. Committee for United Nations International Children's 
Emergency Fund in Los Angeles. "We have the same problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming executive director in January, Solomon has dedicated much of 
her time to refining the city's understanding of the 47-year-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities throughout the city, Solomon is spreading the message: UNICEF 
is alive and well and concerned with issues facing children in East L.A. as 
well as those in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now is that we're getting on the street and meeting 
face-to-face with community people," said Solomon, a longtime community 
organizer who began her work in the northeast San Fernando Valley. "I think 
that's very different." 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, the Los Angeles chapter has been busy forming partnerships with 
community-based organizations, part of an effort to increase public awareness 
of UNICEF and to forge the gap between local and international efforts for 
youth, Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the Los Angeles committee is co-sponsoring the Third Annual 
Pan-African Film Festival, a two-week event that will raise funds for UNICEF's 
Africa project and two local, predominantly African American private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a relationship between the status of children in our own back 
yard and children in other places," Solomon said. "With these partnerships we 
feel we can make a difference globally and locally." 
</P>
<P>
 The local organization's new slant coincides with a national movement aimed at 
broadening the focus of the organization to include children in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the now-famous orange boxes, American children over the years have 
collected more than $100 million for UNICEF on Oct. 31, National UNICEF Day. 
The money collected on Halloweens past has been used to buy medicine, supply 
freshwater and provide primary education to children around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, for the first time in its history, the organization has 
declared the entire month of October as National UNICEF Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will American children collect money for others, now they will have 
an opportunity to learn about the people who benefit from their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's goal is to have trained volunteers and staff members visit 
schools nationwide during October, sharing their knowledge of other cultures 
and places with American schoolchildren in hopes of fostering a respect for 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need help understanding global diversity, which is not across the ocean 
anymore," said Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, president and chief executive officer 
of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF, based in New York. "So much of it is in the 
classrooms sitting right next to them and on the playground." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the world, conflicts based on cultural, ethnic, religious and political 
differences cause the death of countless children every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a way to break that cycle in how we work with children and 
help them to grow beyond that," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In multicultural Los Angeles, building that kind of understanding among 
schoolchildren, and forming alliances with churches, community groups, 
businesses and schools is critical -- and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Back-to-back disasters in recent years have stretched "our giving capacity," 
Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report ranked Los Angeles 48th out of 50 large U.S. cities for 
charitable giving per capita. Add to that, the city's changing demographics -- 
which translates into a change in giving patterns and habits -- and the task of 
creating an interest in international giving and advocacy is even more 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the challenges . . . is to understand that situation," Solomon said. 
"To look at a country like Rwanda and try to find a link between what's 
necessary to revitalize our own community and also excite this community to 
reach beyond itself." 
</P>
<P>
 So Solomon spent a recent weekend visiting churches in the African American 
community and throughout the city, encouraging ministers to invite their 
congregations to the two-week film festival. 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be other events this month to introduce the community to UNICEF 
and to raise funds: a concert featuring singer Maxine Weldon at Lunaria 
Restaurant and Jazz Club, a reception at the Alitash Kebede Art Gallery 
featuring the work of artist Herbert Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know we're here and the kinds of projects we're involved 
in," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the UNICEF donors "who have always been with us," her 
multicultural outreach aims to create a new tradition of giving and involvement 
in other communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the organization hosted an evening in Los Angeles with Julio 
Iglesias, a national UNICEF spokesman, and invited members of the Latino 
community "to get acquainted with Mr. Iglesias and the work of the U.S. 
committee," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayuko Babu sees a parallel between the goals of the Pan-African Film Festival 
and those of UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to bring an awareness and consciousness about black people 
around the world," said Babu, executive director of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness leads to understanding and concern -- which then leads to action -- 
but all too often Americans possess only vague sketches of people in other 
places, Babu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sketchier still is Americans' understanding of the relationship between their 
lives and the lives of people abroad, how the hot cocoa Americans drink to feel 
cozy on cold winter days comes from Ghana, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the people who pick (it) are poor and don't have enough money" to enjoy 
it themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film festival "fits right in with" UNICEF's and Solomon's goal of "letting 
folks have a better sense of what's happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Extraordinary Place, one of the schools that will receive funds from 
the festival, educators say UNICEF's involvement in local issues will 
"contribute to the effort to keep children (in America) on the forefront of 
people's minds" -- a contribution as valuable as the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes me feel very hopeful because so much of the attention tends to 
be on the children abroad who are without," said Ernestine Washington, who is 
program coordinator of the Crenshaw-area, nonprofit educational cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed by UNICEF's outreach to the community. My prayer would 
be that it continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether meeting with heads of corporations spreading the message of the U.S. 
Committee for UNICEF or with members of the Latino community, Solomon can fall 
back on the relationships fostered during her nearly 30 years of organizing and 
community building in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the 1960s, she worked with the Latin American Civic Assn. and 
started a Head Start Program in the basement of a Pacoima church. While raising 
six children in the Valley, she taught preschool, worked with the Fair Housing 
Council, and numerous other organizations. And she currently sits on the board 
of directors of RLA, the Los Angeles Art Festival and others.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's been a real leader in the black community and the larger Los Angeles 
community," said Babu, who has known Solomon for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 30 years she worked at KCOP-Channel 13, where she was director of 
corporate relations and executive producer of information programs. Over the 
years she won five Emmy Awards and numerous others for documentaries and 
children's programs, including "Whatever Happened to Childhood?", a look at the 
changing lifestyles of American children. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the organizers of the film festival, Solomon knows the power of images. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the festival films focus on the lives of children in countries where 
UNICEF has been a benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man By the Shore" by Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck, is the story of a Haitian 
child whose life and struggles "become a metaphor for a people," Babu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Hands," by Flora M'mbugu-Schelling tells of the conditions facing women 
in Tanzania, who, with babies at their sides, make a living crushing rocks used 
to build beachside tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The films help people draw a connection between real life, Babu said, "and 
that time you dropped your quarter in that little box for Halloween."

STREET SMART: CRASH INVESTIGATORS PUT IT ALL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was physics that sent the physics professor spinning and would probably 
send his car insurance soaring. Those were the equal and opposite reactions to 
his action of blowing a red light and knocking his Toyota head-on into a Geo. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sgt. Ben Lee pulled up seconds later, the professor was dabbing the blood 
on his chin. His battered car still sat askew amid bits of shattered glass and 
plastic, its malfunctioning alarm still squealing. 
</P>
<P>
 As an accident investigator for the Los Angeles Police Department, Lee spends 
his afternoons and evenings at scenes like this -- streets and sidewalks 
littered with twisted metal and, all too often, with twisted bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 By carefully measuring skid marks and picking through busted-up hulks, Lee and 
his officers can piece together and make sense of a chain of events that 
unfolds over fractions of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 In serious accidents they are homicide detectives, tracking down hit-and-run 
drivers and collaring drunks. In simple fender-benders they are mediators, 
making sure drivers swap insurance information. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often a technical job that is decidedly unglamorous. No one ever thanks 
them for handing out a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they are the officers the average person is most likely to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will spend an estimated $800 million this year on anti-theft devices 
for their cars such as alarms and steering wheel locks, according to the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau. But most will spend little time and almost no 
money improving their driving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the average person is more likely to die in a traffic accident than 
at the hands of a carjacker. And even minor collisions can end up costing 
thousands by the time repair bills and insurance hikes are tallied up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp accident investigator can piece together a simple crash like the 
professor's in a few minutes. Complicated collisions involving several vehicles 
or a fatality can take several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When the driver bolts from an accident, the investigation gets even trickier. 
Detective Bob Uber said investigating traffic deaths can be more difficult to 
solve than murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Murders often have motives. Traffic accidents are random. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a bullet," said Uber, who investigates accidents that involve 
crimes such as hit-and-run or drunk driving. What they do have is evidence like 
tire marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tires leave different skids as they do different things. With the length of a 
skid, an investigator can determine how fast a car was traveling. Flat skids 
generally indicate a driver trying to stop by slamming on the brakes. 
Acceleration skids often leave traces of rubber on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it seems like reading tea leaves to the uninitiated. At a collision 
in Pacoima, Officer John Teetor traced skid marks on the pavement, pointing out 
different events as revealed by the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Braking began here, impact occurred there, the car got pushed sideways to 
here. "That's probably where his axle broke," Teetor said, pointing to a wobble 
in an otherwise straight skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Other techniques are more conventional. In serious accidents, investigators 
comb through cars for clothing fibers or fingerprints or anything to connect a 
driver to an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On simple collisions, the routine is simple. Officers check to make sure 
drivers were wearing seat belts. On one Mustang, when Teetor and Lee clasped 
the belt together, only an inch or two was left between the buckle and the seat 
back, indicating it had not been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have to be pretty skinny to be wearing that belt," Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping out of his black-and-white at the corner of Saticoy and Variel streets 
in Canoga Park, Lee's first order of business is to make sure no one is 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The professor's jaw is covered with cuts caused by the violent inflation of 
his car's air bag, so Lee calls an ambulance. The other driver, a 17-year-old 
with no license and no insurance, is uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Uninsured motorists are a problem on the streets. Lee estimates as many as 40% 
of drivers in Los Angeles are uninsured. Many who forsake insurance also 
neglect to register their cars or even bother to get a license. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have nothing to lose," Lee says. "But you better believe that if you hit 
them, they will somehow find a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 As he waits for the ambulance to arrive, Lee climbs into the front seat of the 
professor's still-squawking Toyota and nudges it out of rush-hour traffic. The 
front axle is broken so the few feet to the curb are as far as the car will go. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness tells Lee that the professor blew through the red light at Saticoy 
just as the teen-ager was starting a left turn onto Variel. The professor says 
he was on his way to class when the light changed yellow. The teen-ager claims 
he was just going to the grocery store when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash left both cars undrivable, so Lee requests a tow truck over his 
radio. Minutes later, the teen-ager's mother arrives. She opts to push the 
family car the block or so home instead of paying the tow truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambulance arrives and two paramedics examine the professor's jaw, 
peppering him with questions about age, height, weight, date of birth. "Hey," 
one of the paramedics says cheerfully, "you got a birthday coming up. An early 
happy birthday to you." 
</P>
<P>
 The professor smiles faintly and mumbles something about his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to be a little late," the cheerful paramedic says, 
wrapping up the exam. The professor's cuts are just cuts, not a more serious 
injury as Lee feared. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ambulance pulls away, the tow truck arrives. The driver quickly hooks 
up the professor's Toyota and offers him a ride back to the garage, where he 
can use the phone to call for a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after the crash, the street is clear again and traffic is moving 
swiftly. Lee's job is over. 
</P>
<P>
 For the teen-ager, who was cited for not having a license or insurance, the 
accident means he may not get a license until he turns 21. For the professor, 
who was ultimately determined to be at fault, the accident means a pricey trip 
to the body shop and probably an insurance hike.

<P>
 The Orange County Central Labor Council submitted a letter to Measure A 
proponents Friday, announcing its support of the initiative to build a 
commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The air base is scheduled to close in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the council's executive board voted unanimously to back the 
initiative, said council spokesman William Fogarty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's going to be good for creating jobs and job retention in Orange 
County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is an umbrella organization representing about 95,000 Southland 
laborers. NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; HOMEOWNERS SAY SMELLY PLANT 
OFFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Residents of an upscale neighborhood want a nearby composting plant shut down, 
saying it emits a strong odor that has made life outdoors unbearable at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have rights as homeowners to smell clean, fresh air," Melanie 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operating the plant, Browning-Ferris Industries, has until 
Wednesday to submit a plan to the county showing how it will fix the malodorous 
situation, which residents contend has affected up to 500 homes on the eastern 
edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the houses -- less than a mile west of the composting operation -- 
cost between $400,000 and $500,000. Residents enjoy equestrian trails and other 
trappings of rural living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, we live in the country, where there are odors," Anderson said. "But 
there is a difference between horse manure and this pungent odor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Larkey, project manager for the plant, said the company intends to remedy 
the composting smell. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant has been in operation for about six months and is refining its 
operations, Larkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents met last week with officials from the county and 
Browning-Ferris Industries, a Houston-based company that is leasing 10 acres on 
La Pata Avenue for the composting site. The company handles about 200 tons of 
yard waste per day. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say that if the odor problem can't be resolved -- or a health 
risk is discovered -- the plant's permits will be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, county officials say, there is no evidence to suggest that the plant 
presents a public health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of an obnoxious odor," said Patti Henshaw, supervisor of the solid 
waste program for the county's Environmental Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Henshaw said there are three other composting businesses in the county, but 
none are as close to homes as the La Pata Avenue site. The other composting 
businesses are in the process of getting permits, Henshaw said. JEFF BEAN

A FINELY TUNED TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away in a sunlit corner, Rick Turner is balancing an exotic East Indian 
sitar-like instrument on his knee, quietly plucking its strings and awaiting 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes quickly and easily to Turner, a serene man with a ready smile, 
twinkling periwinkle eyes and a wisp of gray goatee to offset his long gray 
ponytail. For he is far more than an accomplished guitar player seeking new 
melodies. Turner knows musical instruments inside and out; as often as not, he 
plays instruments that he has made himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is one of a small cadre of artisans who spend their days and nights 
keeping alive the centuries-old tradition of the luthier, or guitar maker. 
While guitars, basses and other stringed instruments are being mass-produced by 
the millions in factories from here to Korea, he is making them by hand, one by 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 He acquires such instruments as the Rudra Vina in an effort to incorporate 
into his work unusual guitar-making methods and sounds from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he finishes his plucking on the strange-looking Hindustani instrument 
and ambles back across the street to his studio to resume work on another 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, Turner has been designing, modifying and making instruments for 
musicians such as David Crosby and other former members of Crosby, Stills, Nash 
& Young, blues legend Ry Cooder, studio master David Lindley and Lindsey 
Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac fame. Other clients included the musicians of Led 
Zeppelin, the Who, the Allman Brothers, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane 
and Santana. 
</P>
<P>
 The current work in progress has a tag bearing another famous name: 
guitarist/singer Steve Miller, who plans to take the $1,650 nylon string 
fretless bass with him on his next tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 51, has been churning out guitars and refurbishing instruments for 
such internationally renown artists as Indian guitar legend Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has blessed my being the only guy in the West to work on and measure his 
guitars," Turner says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the guitars, Turner does it all -- the woodworking, the wiring, even 
assembling the machine parts that keep the guitar strings in tune and in place. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Turner's interest in Eastern instruments has expanded along 
with his clientele. He has made a practice of restoring ornate pieces, and is 
even reworking a 1920s vintage Gibson guitar into an Indian classical guitar 
known as a Mohan Vina for ex-Beatle George Harrison. When finished, the guitar 
will have three melody strings on bottom for slide guitar, five "drone" strings 
for plucking and 12 "sympathetic" strings underneath, for harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who frequently plays local coffeehouse gigs with another musician, 
says he has a leg up on the many guitar makers who don't know what it's like to 
play their finished products. "I don't know how they can do it," he says. "You 
need to know what musicians need." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner should know. He has been involved in every aspect of guitar making, and 
playing, for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s, he "dropped out of Boston University and into 
coffeehouses," playing alongside Taj Mahal, Joan Baez, Jeff and Maria Muldaur 
and other stars of the emerging rock and blues scene. 
</P>
<P>
 As a touring musician with the folk duo Ian and Sylvia in the mid-60s, he 
played the Hollywood Bowl and Boston's Symphony Hall. Then there was a stint as 
a sound mixer for the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Turner says, he joined other craftsmen to work at an idyllic music 
workshop in the Bay Area, initiated by countercultural icon and drug guru 
Augustus Owsley Stanley. By 1970, he and some other graduates of the Grateful 
Dead scene went into business for themselves, but later split in a bitter 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 When Turner first began making his own instruments, he advertised by hanging 
around with the entourages of famous guitarists and bassists when they came to 
San Francisco, where he was living. Soon he was asked to bring his instruments 
to studio sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the instruments were in great demand. When bassist John Paul 
Jones from Led Zeppelin came to his Sonoma County shop at the height of the 
super group's popularity in 1973, Turner knew he was onto something. By 1979, 
Fleetwood Mac decided to leave all its Gibsons and Fender Stratocasters at 
home, and bring just Turner instruments on a world tour, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, however, financial setbacks forced Turner to abandon the business and 
make ends meets crafting wood cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a terrible time in the music business," he said. "Things were really 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, Turner moved to Los Angeles to open a West Coast office for Gibson 
guitars, keeping an eye out for musicians to whom he could give guitars in 
return for endorsements. But even though he was an exclusively signed 
independent designer of guitars, basses and other instruments, Turner became 
frustrated by the corporate mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dealing with big company politics," he said, "it was impossible to get 
anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 So by 1991 he began putting all his energy into making guitars again. This 
time, he kept the business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner makes several unique kinds of guitars, including a $2,500 electric 
prototype known as the Picasso that uses nylon strings, much like a classical 
guitar. His most popular model is, not surprisingly, the Turner guitar, another 
electric guitar that he sells as fast as he can make them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has never made one specifically for himself -- "It would take too 
much time," he says -- Turner has so many guitars he has lost count. Among his 
collection: turn-of-the-century Howe-Orme mandolins from Boston, guitars and 
basses of all kinds and exotic instruments like a one-of-a-kind meditation 
instrument used by the Tantric Yoga and Kali sects. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner met his wife, Jessica, playing music. "We became musical friends, and 
fell in love as an afterthought," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner says he is finally turning out enough instruments to make the business 
profitable. Each instrument takes 30 hours of laborious work, and customers as 
well as guitar aficionados say that the result is a beautifully finished 
product that resonates with sounds unlike anything that can be mass-produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Used to merely trying to make ends meet, Turner of late has been dealing with 
cash flows, large purchases of parts, and hiring new employees and apprentices. 
His goal is to finish and sell 15 guitars a month by year's end, and up to 20 a 
month by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how fast the business grows, Turner says he will remain a 
craftsman at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want people to buy my instruments unless they're very sure they want 
them," he says. "I want my guitars to go to good homes."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; PLANNERS OK LARGER SIGN FOR PHONE DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has granted an exception to the city sign ordinance to 
a mobile telephone dealer.  
</P>
<P>
 The 3-2 decision Friday allowed Mobile Line Communications to put up 
147-square-foot signs -- about 43 square feet larger than recommended by city 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Curtis, who owns the firm on Swartz Drive, told commissioners that a 
lucrative contract with AirTouch Cellular, a major portable phone manufacturer, 
depended on its getting the larger sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis said customers have a hard time finding his business because the Swartz 
Drive cul-de-sac, set back off busy El Toro Road, is barely visible from the 
major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, 42 customers have complained about not being able to find the 
storefront. Curtis added that AirTouch Cellular is hinging approval of a 
five-year contract on approval of the larger sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Richard Neuland, David Carter and Tim Hughes favored granting 
Curtis' request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of sympathy for the applicant," Neuland said. "I've lived here a 
long time, and that is a hard spot to find." 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like an alley -- Swartz does," he said. "It doesn't look like a 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Richard Goacher and Commissioner Peter Burrows felt that granting the 
exception to Curtis might open the door for other businesses to ask for 
variances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a tough time with precedent-setting here," Burrows said. FRANK 
MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; KIDNAPER APOLOGIZES, RELEASES VICTIM, POLICE 
SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fullerton woman was released unharmed by a man who apologized for abducting 
her at gunpoint from a Beach Boulevard supermarket parking lot early Sunday 
morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two witnesses saw the kidnaper surprise the woman as she was loading groceries 
into her car at 3 a.m. at the Ralph's market at 5400 Beach Blvd., said Sgt. 
Jeff Kingsbury of the Buena Park Police Department.Witnesses said the man had a 
handgun and put it to the woman's head before ordering her to get in the 
passenger side of her car. He then drove the car away, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two witnesses tried to follow the car but the kidnaper eluded them by 
driving without headlights on Beach Boulevard, Kingsbury said. They then called 
police, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later the woman, whom police did not identify, called police and 
said her abductor had taken her back to the parking lot, apologized for 
kidnaping her, gave her a hug and ran away, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had handed him her jewelry, but he threw it back at her and said he was 
sorry and then fled," Kingsbury said. "She was upset, but she didn't lose 
anything but a little time and a sense of security."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BUILDING OF CLUB IS FINALLY UNDERWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a vision for nearly a decade -- a dream supporters never gave up on. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, workers finally began construction on the new home of the Boys & 
Girls Club of Huntington Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an elephant giving birth -- it's been a long gestation period," 
said Mayor John Collins. "It will be fulfilling when we see the first kid go in 
and bounce a basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking on the nearly two-acre site in Mile Square Regional Park took 
place three years ago, but then work was halted because of unexpected work to 
stabilize the ground. That added $250,000 to the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Schneider, executive director of the Boys & Girls Club, which operates 
the clubs in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley, said that about $1.2 million 
has been raised toward the $1.7-million cost of the new facility. About 
$500,000 more is needed to finish the interior of the 19,000-square-foot 
building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club currently operates out of vacant Arthur D. Neiblas School and has 
about 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising has been a major undertaking. Collins has called Friday night 
bingo games for the last 8 1/2 years to support the goal, raising about 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George B. Scott is among those who have spearheaded fund-raising 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait" for the project to be done, said Scott, 62, one of the club's 
founding board members. "I just want to live long enough to see this Boys & 
Girls club up in operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider hopes that the sound of construction will bring forth contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is that once the community sees that the project is going to 
succeed, we'll generate the balance needed before year's end so we can continue 
with the last phase," Schneider said. "Our goal is to open by spring if the 
money comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long struggle. But the end of the road is definitely in 
sight." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DETACHED HOMES PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ALAN EYERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A request to construct small, single-family residences instead of townhouses 
as part of the 50-acre downtown redevelopment project is on the City Council 
agenda this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1991 agreement between the city and Baywood Development Group, 146 
townhouse units were planned for Ash Street and Walnut and Madrona avenues in 
the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 But subsequent declines in the real estate market, especially in townhouse and 
condominium prices, persuaded the developer that it would be more economically 
feasible to construct detached dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Baywood is proposing to build 96 units that are described as a "hybrid" 
between townhouses and single-family dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the homes would proceed in four phases, starting in early 
1995.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY BACKS REFORM OF UNFUNDED MANDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Congress passes a law aimed at cities, it should also pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message the City Council is sending to California's members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously voted last week to join other cities throughout the 
nation in attacking "unfunded mandates." 
</P>
<P>
 Such mandates are federal laws or regulations that require spending by cities 
but are not reimbursed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Darrell Essex, in memo to the council, recommended that Mayor 
Richard Partin be authorized "to transmit letters to the appropriate federal 
legislators, urging the passage of the Federal Mandate Accountability and 
Reform Act." 
</P>
<P>
 That measure is designed to halt unfunded federal requirements imposed on 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Partin's letter, urging federal lawmakers to pass the reform act before 
adjourning this year, says: "Federal mandates require compliance regardless of 
other pressing local needs and priorities affecting the health, welfare and 
safety of our citizens. Mandates require us to raise local taxes and fees or 
cut services to meet federal priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The National League of Cities, based in Washington, is coordinating nationwide 
efforts to pressure Congress for relief from unfunded federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the City Council, the league said: "We must continue to 
increase the public's awareness about (unfunded) mandates and organize at the 
grass-roots level to force the federal government to respond to our concerns."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; WOMAN DENIES THAT SHE WAS ABDUCTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old woman who had been reported kidnaped denied Sunday that she was 
taken against her will. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Jane Melson said in an interview that she had contacted police and 
notified them several times that she was fine, despite a previous report to 
police that she had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never kidnaped. I'm fine and I told the police that," Melson said. 
"This is more like they have a vendetta against my boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police reported Saturday and Sunday that Melson had been abducted 
from her home by boyfriend Joseph Ray McBath. 
</P>
<P>
 Melson's family told police in an emergency call that the window of her Monroe 
Street apartment had been smashed and that she was taken from the apartment 
against her will. According to the call, which was taped, police had talked to 
Melson but couldn't locate her.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; PRIVATIZATION IDEA BLASTED AT MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and union representatives blasted trustees of the Orange Unified 
School District last week for suggesting that some of the district's operations 
be privatized. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of you are trustees of a public education system and that means you must 
be committed to public education -- anything else would be outright fraud," 
said David Reger, president of the teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the trustees broached the concept, saying they were intrigued by 
the proposals of a company that has privatized whole school districts in other 
states. The firm, Education Alternatives Inc., began talks with trustees about 
six months ago, said school board President Maureen Aschoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Robert L. French told board members at the meeting Thursday that 
California law prohibits privatizing any school service except transportation, 
and he urged them to first look to their own employees for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hired the best possible, so let's try to improve before turning 
outside the district," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Martin Jacobson and Max Reissmueller continued to argue for a full 
study of privatization. The only legal means of doing so would be through the 
charter school process -- which gives schools relative freedom from local 
boards and some state codes -- but French noted that any one district can have 
only 10 of the chartered schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller said that the Department of Education can give waivers for 
districts such as Orange Unified, which has 36 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Robert Viviano suggested the board pinpoint areas that need 
improvement, noting that the private school idea is a "solution looking for a 
problem." He was applauded when he told Jacobson: "Where I come from, if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 They ended the tense meeting by directing French to compile a list of areas 
that could be improved and a variety of alternatives, such as privatization, to 
improve services. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; BOARD POSTPONES DEAL TO SELL SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District board has postponed signing a final 
agreement to sell the vacant John B. Bushard School site to a home developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim Supt.Robert G. Sampica said that trustees in an executive session 
discussion wanted additional information from Kaufman & Broad-South Coast Inc. 
of Newport Beach, which has offered to buy the site for $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 58 single-family homes planned for the 10-acre property. Demolition 
of school buildings has also been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said that the parties are "working 
on the final details, and we're hoping to finalize it soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampica said that no date has been set for trustees to take final action on 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting last week, trustees did approve a sales agreement for the 
vacant James O. Harper School property. Costain Homes Inc. of Newport Beach 
will buy the property for $8.26 million. Not more than 59 single-family homes 
will be built on the 14-acre site. DEBRA CANO

MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was found shot to death in the parking lot of a large Westminster 
apartment complex, and police said they have few clues about his assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Si Van, 20, of Santa Ana, was found at 8:10 p.m. Saturday lying in the parking 
lot of the Cal Espana apartments at 15200 Magnolia St., said Lt. Richard Main 
of the Westminster Police Department.The man had been shot "numerous times" in 
the head and body and died at the scene, Main said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no motive in the shooting and were having trouble getting 
consistent information from witnesses, Main said. Witnesses gave differing 
descriptions of the suspects and the car in which they fled, Main said. Some 
said it was a blue or brown car, others said it was white or light-colored, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it was a four-door sedan, a Honda-type vehicle," Main said. "We 
have either one or three suspects outstanding, believed to be in their 20s." 
</P>
<P>
 The parking lot serves several hundred apartments on Magnolia just south of 
Bolsa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no random drive-by," Main said. "It looked like these people were 
obviously intent on making this guy the target."

BARBER SETS WORLD RECORD FOR HAIRCUTS AT A FAST CLIP; SANTA CLARITA: WYNN 
WALTER SNIPPED AND STYLED THE HEADS OF 133 PEOPLE IN 24 HOURS TO RAISE FUNDS 
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Others have bounced on pogo sticks, married each other dozens of times and 
even eaten bicycles to make the book. Wynn Walter used his barber's shears to 
prove he is a cut above. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Santa Clarita resident snipped his way into the Guinness Book 
of Records on Sunday by setting the world's record for giving the most haircuts 
in 24 hours. He trimmed, styled -- and shaved bare in one case -- the heads of 
133 men and boys who volunteered to be a part of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter said he performed the haircut marathon primarily as a fund-raiser and 
gathered nearly $10,000 in pledges for the Assn. to Aid Victims of Domestic 
Violence. But, he admitted, he has also been a fan of the Guinness book since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, the record I always was interested in breaking was for the world's 
biggest sport-caught fish," he said, adding that the record at the time was a 
2,666-pound great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter began his haircutting effort at 12:30 p.m. Saturday inside a giant tent 
at the Santa Clarita Valley Business Expo. He kept a relatively low profile 
among the dozens of other booths. Walter's subjects waited in groups of twos 
and threes to receive their free haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 His fiancee, Debbie Shreve, kept track of the customers, passed out domestic 
violence literature from a display table and kept a cellular phone nearby to 
wake early morning volunteers. Walter's father, Manny, who cuts hair for $30 a 
head at the Beverly Hills Hilton, swept hair off the floor and put aprons on 
the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter started with plenty of adrenaline, cutting six or seven heads an hour 
and trading jokes with those in the chairs. He teased 19-year-old Alan Schwartz 
that he would turn his shoulder-length do into a crew cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even want to hear the sound of that razor," Schwartz retorted. 
Instead, he opted for a trim and, after a parting handshake from Walter, said 
the cut was worth twice the $10 the barber would have charged at his 
old-fashioned Canyon Country shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the American dream," Schwartz said. "I'm becoming part of the world's 
record for free and I'm getting rid of my split ends at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter took his first break, a brief trip to the restroom, at 6:30 p.m. as the 
rest of the business expo vendors headed home. After six hours at the chair, 
though, Walter didn't have quite the same spring in his clip. Filling several 
empty slots in the wee hours of the morning was a growing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anybody else whose going to wander by now and sign up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few pleasant surprises were still in store for Walter. Just before 1 
a.m., five members of the Saugus High School varsity football team walked in 
and signed up for haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a party at a friend's house," said James Aardahl, 17, an offensive 
guard. He said his mother, who is president of the board of the domestic 
violence association, suggested during the afternoon they stop by when they had 
a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Four or five of them were wandering around outside the tent, making sure no 
trespassers vandalized the cars or other items on display at the event. By dawn 
they were all sporting fresh haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go in there at about 3 a.m., or whenever they need me," said 
Anthony Guatemala, patrolling the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards lent their heads to Walter in more ways than one. At 3:20 a.m. the 
generator powering the lights and barber tools ran out of fuel in the middle of 
a haircut. Nobody had much experience filling and restarting generators, but 20 
minutes later the lights were back on and the snipping resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature dropped into the 50s overnight and Walter's fingers were 
ice-cold. His fiancee was shivering inside a heavy coat by the time the sun 
came up Sunday morning. At 6:30 a.m. the unthinkable happened -- a man stood up 
to leave and nobody was left to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
 But within 15 minutes, the chair was occupied. And it stayed full throughout 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you have a good night's sleep?" Walter asked his new customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fair, actually," the man replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me all about it," the sleepy barber said as he began trimming his 103rd 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, 8-year-old Charles Spann walked in the door. His mother 
explained she signed up to have her son's hair cut at dawn so he would look 
sharp for church at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it because it's freezing cold and I had to wake up when I didn't 
want to," Spann confided in a groggy voice. "I went to bed late last night and 
I wanted to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter, fueled only by a few gulps of coffee and some fast food fed to him by 
his fiancee, slowed to three or four people an hour as the morning progressed. 
His hands were chafed with scissor marks, and his manner grew increasingly 
tense. 
</P>
<P>
 With an hour to go, he admitted: "I'm ready to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 But at 12:10 p.m. he moved to a podium in front of the tent where hundreds 
gathered to watch him cut his final customer, Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of 
Commerce President Gary Johnson. What Johnson didn't know until he took the 
stage was that his family, friends and co-workers had agreed to donate $400 if 
Walter shaved Johnson's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had my head shaved since I was in the service 20 years ago, so this 
feels weird," a cringing Johnson told the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a few minutes before 12:30 p.m. Walter put down his clippers for the 
last time and sat limply on the edge of the podium, his work completed and 
record secure. But he vowed to try to break his own record next year -- this 
time perhaps with a team of local barbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can get a competition going," he said.

MIKE PENNER: THEY'RE BACK IN THE SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The events of Sunday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium were enough to send a Ram 
nodding off right there on his locker stool. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams beat the New York Giants, same as they always do, and failed to score 
20 points, same as they always do, and got the ball to Jerome Bettis 30 times, 
same as they always do, and began talking wistfully of one day climbing back to 
.500, same as they always do. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there was absolutely nothing new under the Big A this day, postgame 
conversation naturally wandered, all the way to New Orleans and next week's 
reunion with yesterday's quarterback, Jim (Don't Call Me Chris, Don't Call Me 
Jittery, But You Can Call Me 2-5) Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Lyght promised to stop by and say hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, he'll be on his back after somebody sacked him and I'm standing 
over him when I say it," Lyght said, grinning at the thought. "That's how I 
want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young said he "wouldn't mind running into Jim on the 
field. Maybe for a minus-eight, a minus-10." 
</P>
<P>
 And Anthony Newman, the Ram defensive captain who suffered the Everett dog 
days so intensely that he began turning his back to the field whenever the 
offense had the ball, insisted times have changed and, therefore, "Everett will 
be fun to face. Nothing against Everett . . . but we'll try to change some 
things up and try to rattle him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to try to get into the pocket and get those happy feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, to be 3-4 and riding the crest of a one-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams ever figure out how to put two victories back-to-back -- something 
they haven't accomplished since 1991 -- these interviews are going to become 
insufferable. 
</P>
<P>
 But back-to-back is on the Rams' agenda, especially since they now get to play 
a team with a worse record than their own (Cincinnati isn't on the schedule 
this year) and now, in linebacker Shane Conlan's words, "have something we 
didn't have last year -- an offense that can put up some points." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. Seventeen of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoo boy, pass the oxygen mask around. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given Sunday, the 1994 Rams can score 17 points at the drop of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Except two Sundays ago, when they scored five. 
</P>
<P>
 But 17 points -- 17 points represent major improvement. Ten times last season, 
the Rams failed to reach that magic number. Conlan was new to the Rams then, 
fresh out of Buffalo, where 17 points were a decent 10 minutes' work for Jim 
Kelly and Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan's first season in Anaheim was culture, filled with 35-10 defeats and 
the first Ram quarterback controversy ever spawned by default. All year long, 
Chuck Knox could do nothing but shut his eyes and pick his poison. Do I lose 
with Everett or do I lose with Rubley?  
</P>
<P>
 "I was only with him one year," Conlan said of Everett. "I don't know him that 
well. Obviously, his leaving for New Orleans is the best thing that could have 
happened for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems to have resurrected his career down there. You know, he dragged a 
little here last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be fun, facing him. I know a lot of the guys are looking forward to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Everett and then some. Allegedly, the Rams have completed the most 
difficult part of their schedule -- no more Atlanta, Kansas City done, Green 
Bay done, one of two San Francisco poundings already out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up, New Orleans, followed by a bye, followed by the Broncos and the 
Raiders, both in Anaheim. Then, after the obligatory defeats to San Francisco 
and San Diego, the Rams close against New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Chicago and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 NFC playoffs, here they come. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a glimmer of hope," defensive end Fred Stokes assessed. "It's 
time to dash for the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played seven games and still don't have much of a playoff picture. Look 
at Kansas City, San Francisco, New York. Teams that were at the top last month 
have slipped a little. You never can tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like running a marathon. You run a race that long and maybe somebody 
ahead of you passes out. You get to the finish line and they're giving the gold 
medal, putting the ribbon around your neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're saying, 'Oh, I won?' and they say, 'Yeah, five guys passed out.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we got to keep running." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght cautioned against looking ahead. "I don't think this team is good enough 
to look three, four weeks ahead," he said. Yet, the wild card is out there, 
dangling, and even Lyght can't resist a glance or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still early, but things are starting to shape up," he said. "There are a 
lot of teams right now hanging around .500. We still have a decent shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is put two wins back to back. I haven't done it, and I've 
been here four years. We have to start it right here. New Orleans is a team we 
can beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett vs. the Rams. For the first time in years, we have before us a Ram 
game worth planning one's weekend around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Stokes said, "Jim and I have become pretty good friends. We used 
to go horseback riding together. I wish nothing but the best for him down 
there. I'm looking forward to seeing him again." 
</P>
<P>
 Pause, and then a smile that simply could not be suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially up close."

MIKE DOWNEY: THE LEVEE HAS BROKEN FOR REEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disorganized, reckless, complacent, incapable of making the big plays -- no, 
not the Rams. Look, it's the New York Giants. Yes, the same Giants who looked 
so good in September that it made one wonder whether Lawrence Taylor and Phil 
Simms should have retired from football sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrecognizable from their 3-0 start, the Giants have slipped to 3-3 and their 
glassy-eyed coach, Dan Reeves, now stands there wearing a dazed expression and 
says, "I don't know if I'd call it a slip. It's more like a flood coming toward 
us. And it's goin' real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 You can almost picture today's New York scare headlines: 
</P>
<P>
 GIANT FLOOD! 
</P>
<P>
 or 
</P>
<P>
 WASHED UP! 
</P>
<P>
 or 
</P>
<P>
 RAMS BURST DAM! 
</P>
<P>
 Getting smaller by the week, the Giants scored a skimpy 10 points Sunday and 
couldn't beat a Ram team playing without Jackie Slater and Sean Gilbert. Wonder 
of wonders, the much-ridiculed Rams now have as many victories or more than 
(start spreading the news) the Giants, the Raiders, the Chiefs, the Broncos, 
the Oilers, the Lions, the Redskins, the Saints, the Colts, the Patriots, the 
Seahawks, the Buccaneers, the Bengals and the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning three games feels wonderful -- except when you haven't won one since 
Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves is reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I've been saying, we've got a chance to get beat by anybody if we don't 
play well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graciously including even the Rams in that Anybody class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever felt lower?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I can't remember being any lower than this," Reeves said. "I was pretty 
low when San Francisco beat us in the playoffs, but this is pretty low." 
</P>
<P>
 Something has gone terribly amiss for the Giants since they put down 
Philadelphia, Arizona and Washington over the first three weeks. OK, so they 
didn't exactly bury any of those opponents beneath the Meadowlands like a 
gangster. Everybody in the New York/Jersey area was excited anyway, because 
both the Giants and Jets were on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 They went from being on a roll to getting knocked on their buns. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Giants lost to a bad team, New Orleans. Next, they got thumped on 
"Monday Night Football" on their home field. Six days later, they flew to the 
Coast and got toasted, 17-10, turning so inept that they managed only one first 
down in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown, the quarterback, shrugged and said, "I thought our offensive line 
played well. I thought (running back) Rodney Hampton played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Dave. They really exploded for those 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't sustain a drive," Brown said. "When we were 3-0, we felt 
like we had the world beat. This is a terrible stretch we're having right now. 
We're playing just well enough to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown being an alumnus of Duke, we will assume that he said "playing well 
enough to lose" tongue-in-cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst plays of the day for the Giants came midway through the third quarter, 
in a rare visit to L.A.'s side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Third and one, from the Ram 35: Brown sent Hampton up the middle, where 
linebacker Shane Conlan popped him for no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth and one: Brown gave a deep handoff to Hampton, who was met again by 
Conlan for a one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened?" someone asked a Giant offensive lineman, and we do mean 
giant, 6-foot-7, 308-pound John (Jumbo) Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I was on the bottom of the pile, so I don't know," 
Elliott said. "All I heard underneath the pile was, 'Conlan made a great play.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Giant left guard William Roberts said, "I can't question the call, because our 
job's just to block. Just nobody blocked Conlan." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves was disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Third and a yard and don't make it. Fourth and a foot and don't make it. 
We're not doing the job, period," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 His guys are 3-3 and going backward. They gained one yard Sunday on their 
first possession before punting. They gained two yards on their next possession 
before Brown got intercepted. He got intercepted again on their only offensive 
play of the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we'd be denied, but you've got to give it to the Rams," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have three victories and feel good about themselves. The Giants have 
three and have fallen into a deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-year veteran, Giant safety John Booty, kept insisting, "We're a real 
good football team. I'm telling you. We're a real good football team. The 
talent in this room, I'm telling you. We'd be foolish to hang it up now. We 
can't be quitters. We got to reevaluate ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Or else what?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or else, you know," Booty said. "Big trouble."

IT'S A MAD, MAD WHIRL FOR THE RAIDERS; PRO FOOTBALL: SHELL BENCHES HOSTETLER 
BRIEFLY AFTER ARGUMENT ON SIDELINE OVER QUARTERBACK CHANGING PLAYS DURING 20-17 
OVERTIME LOSS TO MIAMI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler was mad. Mad about the mounting losses. Mad about 
his errant tosses. Mad about the holding calls. Mad about the dropped balls. 
Mad about all the sacks. Mad about the opposition's relentless attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, it all boiled over in an ugly, loud, face-to-face confrontation 
with his head coach in full view of a crowd of 69,380 at Joe Robbie Stadium for 
Sunday's Raider-Miami Dolphin game and a national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, sources said, was Hostetler's inclination to change the play 
selection of Coach Art Shell and his staff. Hostetler engaged in an animated 
shouting match with Shell near the end of the first half after the quarterback 
had appeared to yell at offensive tackle Bruce Wilkerson. The result was 
Hostetler's removal from the game, an unusual action for Shell to take with his 
team in the lead and the game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler came back for the second half, but, unfortunately for the Raiders, 
so did the Dolphins, overcoming 10-0 first-quarter and 10-7 halftime deficits 
to pull out a 20-17 victory in overtime. The keys for the Dolphins (5-2) were 
Bernie Parmalee's 150 yards rushing and Dan Marino's two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, which drops the Raiders to 2-4, was personified by Hostetler, whose 
outburst of temper came on an afternoon when he completed only eight of 23 
passes for 95 yards, was sacked three times and was pummeled by onrushing 
linemen all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the benching of Hostetler for the final two series of the half, 
Shell would only say, "Coach's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler warned reporters before he started talking that he wasn't going to 
address the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to ask (Shell) about that," Hostetler said. "That's about all I 
have to say about it. I'm doing the best I can. And I thank the Lord for my 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't talk about the confrontation, but he had no problem talking about 
the frustration that caused it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we turned around," Hostetler said, "what did we have, five or six 
pass plays called back? We had big gains called back. We were constantly first 
and 20 and first and 30. That gets frustrating for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he expected to start next week, Hostetler angrily replied, "Game 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 End of interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of Hostetler's problems, the Raiders led, 10-7, when he was 
pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 They had taken that lead on a 19-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger and yet 
another defensive touchdown. Cornerback Terry McDaniel tackled running back 
Mark Higgs hard enough in the first quarter to force the ball loose from the 
Dolphin back. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Anthony Smith picked it up on two bounces and went 25 yards into 
the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to tell the kids about," Smith said of his first 
regular-season touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing new for the Raiders, however, who have now scored a defensive 
touchdown in five consecutive games, three of those by McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 15-yard touchdown pass from Marino to Keith Jackson late in the second 
quarter, Hostetler suffered through a series of plays that summed up the 
afternoon, and many of the long Sunday afternoons he has endured this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It went this way: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On first down, Ty Montgomery was called for illegal motion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On first down again, James Jett dropped a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On second down, Jett dropped another pass, allowing Miami to decline a 
holding penalty against Gerald Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On third down, Hostetler was forced to throw the ball away under heavy 
pressure from linebacker Bryan Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fuming Hostetler reached the sideline, Shell stepped in, pointing to 
himself as if to say he would do the disciplining and he would call the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 With Vince Evans taking over at quarterback, Hostetler engaged in a heated 
conversation with assistant coach Mike White, then walked along the bench, 
exhorting the defense to hang in there as if he were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, helmet in hand, made it to the 40-yard line before teammates 
Chester McGlockton and Eddie Anderson put their arms around Hostetler and 
calmed him down. Assistant coach Arthur Whittington joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be all right," Anderson told Hostetler. "You are our leader. I 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 By that point, Hostetler had dropped his helmet, put on his baseball cap and 
moved back to the center of the sidelines behind Shell. Hostetler didn't join 
the sideline discussion with Evans during the timeouts -- the normal role of a 
backup quarterback -- but Hostetler also didn't look like he was ready to leave 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys get frustrated," receiver Alexander Wright said. "When you see 
teammates blow a play you know they are capable of making because you see them 
do it in practice, it's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 So what exactly happened between Shell and Hostetler? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ask and I don't want to know," Wright said. "Words were exchanged. 
One party was calm (presumably Shell) and the other was not." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson of Hostetler: "He was just heated. Competitors get like that." 
</P>
<P>
 One person who was determined not to get like that was Evans, who had to 
concentrate on taking over the team. "As a professional, you are taught to 
respond," Evans said. "I didn't want to get in the middle of anything else that 
was happening. I was just going to go in there and do what I was told to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami opened the second half with a 21-yard field goal from Pete Stoyanovich 
to tie the score at 10. But when the Raiders took over possession, Hostetler 
was back out there, ready to take out his frustration on the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed his first pass, drove the team 55 yards and into the lead on a 
seven-yard touchdown pass to Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the fourth quarter, Miami tied the score again, Marino going to Keith 
Byars with an 18-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime was short and not so sweet for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins won the toss, Parmalee rushed for 45 yards, and Stoyanovich 
kicked a 29-yard field goal 5:46 into the extra period, enabling Miami's 
players to shout their cries of joy in the locker room at moving into first in 
the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
 It was silent in the Raider locker room. They had done their shouting on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>

teams against the Raiders. C12

PENN ST. SKIPS UP TO NO. 1 SPOT AHEAD OF COLORADO, NEBRASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't need a pair of Coach Joe Paterno's inch-thick glasses to see how 
impressed the poll voters are with Penn State these days. Simply locate the No. 
1 ranking and point -- that's where you'll find the Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since January 1987, Penn State is atop both the Associated 
Press and coaches' polls. Paterno's team jumped from the No. 3 spot to No. 1 
Sunday, thanks to two unlikely sources: Auburn and Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, a 16-point underdog to then-top-ranked Florida, upset the Gators at 
dreaded Florida Field, where no Southeastern Conference had won in 15 tries. . 
. . until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that featured four fourth-quarter lead changes, the Tigers defeated 
Florida, 36-33, on a last-minute touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Nix to 
wide receiver Frank Sanders. Bye-bye, Gators, who had occupied the No. 1 AP 
ranking this season in every week but one. Now make it two. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, surprising Kansas State tried to pull off a similar upset against 
Nebraska, which began last week ranked No. 1 in the USA Today/CNN coaches' poll 
and No. 2 in the AP ratings. The Wildcat victory didn't happen -- Nebraska, 
down to its second- and third-string quarterbacks, won, 17-6 -- but it was the 
thought that counted. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss by Florida, coupled with the struggle by Nebraska, combined with Penn 
State's 31-24 victory against Michigan at Ann Arbor convinced enough voters to 
bump the Nittany Lions to the top spot. As it turned out, Penn State needed 
almost every vote it could get. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP rankings (first-place votes in parentheses): 1) Penn State, 1,487 
points (19); 2) Colorado 1,474 (15); 3) Nebraska 1,463 (25); 4) Auburn 1,402 
(3); 5) Florida 1,1196. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches' rankings: 1) Penn State 1,504 (22); 2) Nebraska 1,498 (31); 3) 
Colorado 1,458 (9); 4) Miami 1,283; 5) Alabama 1,271. 
</P>
<P>
 A mandate, it wasn't. But Penn State isn't complaining. In fact, Penn State 
isn't saying much of anything. Asked about the polls shortly after the win 
against Michigan, Paterno said he had more important things to worry about than 
his team's rankings in mid-October. Ask him in January, then he'll talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since 1985 have the Nittany Lions occupied the No. 1 ranking during the 
regular season. They stayed there for the final four weeks of the season and 
then lost to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. And for those hoping for a Rose Bowl 
that actually means something, Penn State is the first Big Ten Conference team 
ranked No. 1 since Michigan in October 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the AP poll, which includes teams on NCAA probation, featured its 
share of mild surprises. For instance, despite its one loss, Florida remained 
ahead of undefeated Texas A&M (No. 6) and Alabama (No. 8). Of course, none of 
that mattered to Gator Coach Steve Spurrier, whose team committed six turnovers 
in the loss to Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there should be a playoff," Spurrier said. "Until there is, it's just 
a popularity contest." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then the Gators had better start turning on the charm. That's because 
the four teams ahead of them are undefeated, though Colorado, which has beaten 
four top 25 teams this season, faces Nebraska Oct. 29 in Lincoln, Neb., and 
Auburn is ineligible for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, which has won an NCAA-best 18 consecutive games, was hoping for better 
than a move from No. 6 to No. 4. Campaigning hard was Tiger Coach Terry Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are any unbelievers. . . . and I know there are a lot of them, I 
hope there are none now about this football team," Bowden said. "For once, I 
want to be recognized as a team that's a really great football team that ought 
to be No. 1 in the Associated Press." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, No. 4 will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 After Florida and Texas A&M, Miami moved into seventh place, followed by 
Alabama, Washington and Florida State. Texas A&M has won 25 consecutive 
Southwest Conference games and owns the nation's longest home victory streak 
(24). 
</P>
<P>
 No team moved up more than unbeaten Duke, which finds its way into the 
football polls every decade or so. The Blue Devils, coached by newcomer Fred 
Goldsmith, climbed five places, from No. 25 to No. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame should be so lucky. The Irish started last week ranked No. 17, but 
didn't end it there. Brigham Young beat the Irish at Notre Dame Stadium, 
dropping Coach Lou Holtz's team to 4-3, the worst start since 1986, and out of 
the polls.

FINDING RELEASE WITH CLIPPERS; AFTER SERVING TIME IN PRISON, FREE AGENT ORLANDO 
VEGA TRIES TO REVIVE BASKETBALL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Ron Harper, former shooting guard on the Clippers' chain gang, couldn't wait 
to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just doing my jail time," inmate Harper complained in February as he marked 
off calendar dates until he was "freed" this season to sign a $19-million 
contract with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Vega, former shooting guard for Sandstone Federal Correctional, 
couldn't wait to get in. Last week, he signed a free-agent contract with the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 During three years spent in federal penitentiaries, sweating out a sentence 
for cocaine possession, Vega never tipped a limo driver, cashed a 
million-dollar check or made a bounce pass to Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's prison was different from the one Harper knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega cried a lot in his. Ached for his wife and young son. Beat himself up for 
derailing one of the most promising and self-destructive basketball careers 
this side of Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega stared at walls, talked to himself, got in scrapes. The worst was in 
Colorado, when he belted and bloodied an inmate who picked a fight with him on 
-- where else? -- a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 That earned Vega a transfer to Sandstone in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind walls, Vega played solitaire as contemporaries signed on the dotted 
line for NBA fortunes: Alonzo Mourning, Chris Jackson, Billy Owens, Shawn Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 From prison, Vega watched via satellite the Puerto Rican national team win the 
1991 Pan American Games in Havana without him. Vega, whose father is Puerto 
Rican, would have been on that team. "I sat inside and watched those guys win 
the gold medal and it almost broke me down," Vega said, sitting sprawled on a 
folding chair in UC Irvine's Bren Center, during Clipper training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, 6 feet 2, 190 pounds, is a long shot to make the Clippers, yet outside 
shooting happens to be Vega's forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting guard is not exactly a Clipper strength. Terry Dehere, who averaged 
5.3 points in 64 games last season, inherits Harper's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds are against him making it," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch says of Vega. 
"The odds are against anyone coming in undrafted and unheard of making it. But 
he's got some skills that make him a legitimate NBA candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't think Vega wants to make good? He was tired of getting his news from 
jail-house rats. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inmate, not a teammate, who broke the news to Vega that his idol, 
Laker Magic Johnson, had announced he was HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew Magic was my man," Vega says. "That's all I talked about. Some 
guy came over and told me that, I said 'Get away from me, quit playing with 
me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Vega? 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy was one of the top high school players in the country at one time," 
Clipper assistant coach Barry Hecker says. 
</P>
<P>
 You could look it up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1988 Dapper Dan Classic, one of the nation's premier showcases for high 
school basketball talent, Vega walked off with the most valuable player trophy, 
beating out teammates Jackson, Owens, Mourning and Kemp. The opposing squad 
featured LaPhonso Ellis and Anthony Peeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the nose dive. It would be easy to blame it all on Vega's past. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of New York. His mother was a 
drug addict, his father a vague recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to his house when I was 5 or something," Vega says, "but I 
can't remember actually being with him. I can't actually picture me looking at 
his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega hasn't seen Dad since. Orlando's mother had her own problems, so young 
Orlando moved in with his grandmother. When he was 12, Vega's mother re-entered 
his life and took him to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega had misgivings: "It was like, 'Where you been all this time? And you're 
trying to take care of me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She couldn't, so she sent Orlando off to a group home, where he was educated, 
so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was around older guys, who would go out and rob, do all that type of 
stuff," he says. "I wasn't no goody-goody. I was right there with them, doing 
those things. Somehow, the ball, though -- the basketball -- seemed to take 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said the street thugs encouraged him to pursue basketball at Washington's 
McKinley High. 
</P>
<P>
 To get him away from the city in his senior season, a coach had Vega placed at 
Oak Hill Academy, a prep boarding school in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 A solid year earned Vega a scholarship to the University of Arizona, but he 
soon became a Proposition 48 academic casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 He transferred to Providence but never played. Instead, he returned to Puerto 
Rico and became a star on the country's professional circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In June 1990, he returned to Washington to renew old acquaintances. Vega was 
in the apartment of a reputed drug dealer when the police raided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never used any drugs, anything like that," he explains, "but I did sell. It 
was a thing, I had to. I had no money and I didn't have no family with me. My 
mother wasn't around. My father, I didn't know where he was and I was in a 
group home. Basically, I got myself through high school. Mom didn't take care 
of me at the time. Me and Mom are cool now. Like brother and sister. Back then, 
it was a different thing. She was doing her thing. She had a little drug 
problem. I had to take care of myself. I had to make the decisions. I didn't 
have no father figure telling me no, or looking out for me, or getting me 
clothes. So I turned to the streets a little bit. I take responsibility for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said he was not in possession of drugs the night of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was innocent that time, but I was there," he says. "I have to blame myself 
for that. In the law, if you're there, you're just as guilty. I take 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, jail was the best thing that ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends died," Vega says. "I could have been right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega was sentenced to five years. With good time, he cut the sentence to 
three. Inside, he decided a mind was a terrible thing to waste, so Vega became 
a model prisoner, read books and helped other inmates obtain their high school 
diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his basketball skills, Vega won respect from most inmates, although 
there were always a few willing to take him on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wake them up quick," Vega says. "Go dunk on them, shoot a couple of treys 
(three pointers)." 
</P>
<P>
 One guy in Colorado pushed his luck when he pushed his way into a discussion 
that was none of his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I beat the guy really bad," Vega admits, "because he didn't have anything to 
do with it. There was blood running down his face. I kept whupping him. Not 
because he did that. Because I was up there getting visits every day from 
(wife) Donna. She flew up to be with her sisters. . . . That cost me my visits. 
That's why I kept hitting him so many times. I was so frustrated. I couldn't do 
nothing but that." 
</P>
<P>
 After the fight, Vega was relocated, away from Donna and their young son, 
Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he says Donna stuck with him, "every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying alive wasn't the toughest part about prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much the physical aspect of jail, the rumbling you'll have to 
do," he says. "It's the little things. Being away from your family, that's what 
kills you." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 26, six years after Dapper Dan, equipped with jump shot and a plea -- 
guilty, with an explanation -- Orlando Vega arrived on the Clippers' doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else could he go, really? The Clippers signed Vega to shore up the lack 
of depth at shooting guard since Harper's defection. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega is a novelty -- someone who wants to play for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's looking out for me, that's the bottom line," Vega says of his 
opportunity. "I never thought anything like this would happen when I got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega was released Dec. 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "People start counting your days for you," he says of the leaving process. 
"The shorter it gets, the worse it gets. You wonder what's going to happen when 
you get out. I never wanted to count my days. I never even looked at the 
calendar." 
</P>
<P>
 After discarding his prison garb, Vega walked out of Sandstone and caught the 
first flight to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got out. Didn't look back. To the airport, bam , right there." 
</P>
<P>
 The road back was surprisingly swift. Vega first sought out Hectin Reyes, head 
of the Puerto Rican basketball federation, and asked if he could return to the 
Quebradillas Pirates, the team for which he played in the Superior League. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe it all to Mr. Hectin Reyes," Vegas says of his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega had a cult following in Puerto Rico, having averaged 34.5 points and 6.3 
rebounds per game in 114 career games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the whole island wondered when I was coming back," Vega says. "I 
never knew how many fans I had until I got back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's play last season -- he averaged 26 points per game -- earned him a spot 
back on the national team. There, he would cross paths with his idol when 
Puerto Rico faced Magic Johnson's traveling all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to tell him how much I love him, how much he meant to me over my life," 
Vega remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Later came the thrill of Vega's life, when Johnson actually barked on the 
court, "Someone cover Orlando!" 
</P>
<P>
 From there it was on to the Goodwill Games, where Vega's Puerto Rico captured 
the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecker, the Clipper assistant who had Puerto Rican contacts, had been tracking 
Vega all along. He met with the player in August at the basketball World 
Championships in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the United States trashed Puerto Rico, 134-83, Vega made his presence 
known when he blocked a Shaquille O'Neal shot and generally held his 
trash-talking own against Dream Team II. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's outside shot has made believers of his friends on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 He still gets letters from pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Dog," one began, "I didn't believe, man, but I seen you on TV getting 
your money. You're all that. I thought you were just busting everybody in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega came to Clipper camp alone, leaving his wife and son behind in Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate leaving because I hate seeing her face," Vega says of Donna. "Because 
it's like the day I left (for prison). I see that same face. I see it in her 
eyes, and it hurts me. I don't like leaving but she understands." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega left Donna with encouraging words: "I'm coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega's NBA future is hardly a lock, but Fitch seems to be offering more than a 
cursory look. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a DKH," the coach says. "Doesn't Know How. He's got to learn it all, 
from the standpoint of a full game. But he's one of those guys, there's enough 
innate ability that given the right opportunity and enough chances, he might 
make it in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega can't play a lick of defense, a cause for concern, yet Fitch believes 
Vega has a stronger will to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a carryover from that situation that gives him a better chance," Fitch 
says. "The discipline he has. He's a very disciplined person. And the respect 
he has for authority. He has a great deal of that. His desire for success. All 
those things are probably greater for having been put in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega says he'll keep shooting until they kick him out of the gym. He contends 
no one will outwork him. Vega thinks there's a reason he's with the Clippers 
and not a coroner's statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man upstairs," Vega says, pointing skyward. "Only thing I can say. I prayed 
to Him for another chance. And I was just talking in general. He gave me the 
whole pot back. I just asked for a chance to play basketball again. He gave a 
chance and more."

NEW STATUS MIGHT AID PLAYERS; HOCKEY: THE NHL'S LABOR DISPUTE COULD OFFICIALLY 
BECOME A LOCKOUT TODAY, PROMOTING ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>

 Wayne Gretzky in line at the unemployment office? 
</P>
<P>
 According to California's state unemployment insurance laws, workers who are 
locked out by management are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits. 
Although the NHL has deliberately called its work stoppage a postponement and 
has disputed the use of the term "lockout," the league is expected to concede 
-- perhaps as soon as on today -- that the 17-day-old stoppage is a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 20 states, that means hockey players would be eligible to file for 
unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that many would take advantage of that status. But the official 
declaration of a lockout might give them stronger legal footing if they want to 
pursue other temporary playing opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the whole thing is based on (NHL officials) calling it a 
postponement," said Ron Salcer, an agent who is looking into placing players 
with European clubs and in the International Hockey League. "The league (has 
maintained) it will be a full 84-game season. Once you say they're locked out, 
if you get before a court of law, I think it will be different." 
</P>
<P>
 From Oct. 1, when the season was scheduled to start, NHL officials insisted 
the stoppage was merely a delay and not a lockout because games would be made 
up later and wouldn't be lost. A strange line of reasoning, say those familiar 
with labor law, and not very strong. It didn't matter what the NHL called it, 
and it didn't matter that there are no padlocks on arena doors. From the 
beginning, it has been, in effect if not in name, a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players are being told they can practice, but the only way they get paid is 
if there's a game, and they're not letting them play any games. I've done this 
for 17 years. That's a lockout," said William S. Waldo, who is a partner in the 
Los Angeles firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker and represents management 
in labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way, I'm not saying the management strategy is wrong or ill-conceived. 
I think it's a good strategy that puts maximum pressure on the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Al Latham, a partner in the same firm and a teacher of labor law at USC: 
"Legally, a lockout is when the employer does not allow employees to work. 
There does not have to be a notion that there are literally locks on the gate . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "You can certainly say it's an unusual situation. People talk about lockouts 
and strikes, but I'm unaware of anything in between. The fact that they're 
compensated only for playing and they're not being allowed to play when they 
normally would be allowed to play, it certainly has the features of a lockout, 
let's put it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if a company says, 'We're shutting down the factory now and we'll 
eventually resume regular hours (without lost pay), is that a lockout? The 
concept is different. It doesn't quite fit the usual mode. Their argument is, 
'We'll play the whole season, but we're not going to do it now.' . . . It's 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the NHL's last bit of pretense is about to disappear. With its 
original starting date long past and its second proposed opener wiped out 
Saturday because of a bargaining stalemate, games are certain to be lost. 
Players pledged to play and not strike if the NHL would not lock them out, but 
the NHL refused to let the season begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they officially cancel games, a lot of things change," Salcer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players will have more time to pursue other jobs, but only a few are expected 
to do so because of insurance concerns. IHL clubs are reluctant to sign 
high-priced NHL talent, but the Kings' Marty McSorley is negotiating with the 
Las Vegas Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rene Fasel, the International Ice Hockey Federation's president, said 
last week he won't let European clubs sign idled NHL players, some say they 
will do so anyway. However, if the lockout is prolonged, players are expected 
to say they are being unfairly denied employment and challenge those 
obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Canceling games will also obligate NHL clubs to refund money to ticket 
holders. The league, in a memo sent last week, said it will provide refund 
guidelines by Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 By delaying the change in terminology, not only did the NHL allow owners to 
hold onto that money a while longer, it gave the league a chance to solidify 
its bargaining stance. The labor lawyers interviewed also say the NHL kept the 
upper hand by rejecting the players' Sept. 29 no-strike pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, you see the traditional lockout where the workers are locked out 
of the plant. In effect, from what's been said here, they're able to come to 
the plant but there is no production taking place and they're only paid for 
production," said Linda Deacon, a management-side specialist in labor law in 
the Los Angeles office of the St. Louis-based Bryan Cave law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, (management is saying), 'We're not going to be held hostage by 
you, you guys are being held hostage by us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting the no-strike pledge, she said, "is not going to help if what 
management really needs is concessions. They need to put pressure on the 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldo agreed that NHL negotiators have devised a solid strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players have offered status quo for a year (with their no-strike pledge). 
Accepting that proposal is totally in the interest of the players and 
accomplishes nothing," he said. "My sense, with no inside information, is they 
will postpone (starting the season) until the players get ready to accept 
something very similar to what management wants." 
</P>
<P>
 As in California, when a work stoppage in Massachusetts is termed a lockout, 
workers are eligible to file for unemployment. However, those who file for 
unemployment in Massachusetts and are offered a job must take that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Which could lead to some amusing scenarios if members of the Bruins applied 
for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if some guy picks up your bag at Logan (Airport)," Harry Sinden, the 
president and general manager of the Boston Bruins told the Boston Globe, "you 
might be saying, 'Hi, Cam (Neely). What are you doing here?' "

THREATT'S ABSENCE LEAVES ANGRY LAKERS IN THE DARK

<P>
 The Lakers late Sunday night were still awaiting an explanation for Sedale 
Threatt's sudden unexcused departure from training camp in Honolulu early 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for him," said an obviously angry executive vice president 
Jerry West, who returned to Los Angeles on Sunday night after the end of the 
team's camp in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to know what is going on because we have no clue. . . . But, 
obviously, we have tried to run him down and have gotten no return calls back 
so we assume it is something he will have to work out. He knows the 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be fined. Period. If he had a problem we would have helped him try to 
resolve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt will earn $2.4 million each of the next two seasons, considerable 
salary for a reserve guard. Threatt is expected to be a key member of the team, 
primarily as a back up to starting point guard Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt, an 11-year NBA veteran, apparently flew back to the mainland before 
the team's second exhibition, a 125-120 victory over the Sacramento Kings on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his absence, Threatt slid a note under West's door at the team's 
Honolulu hotel asking to speak with him, but did not call West. 
</P>
<P>
 West said he spoke with agent Jim Sexton, but said Sexton had not talked to 
Threatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexton could not be reached for comment on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's preseason opener, Threatt played 17 minutes and scored six points, 
all on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt was drafted by Philadelphia in the sixth round in 1983. He also played 
for Chicago and Seattle before being traded to the Lakers in 1991.

PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS 17, NEW YORK GIANTS 10; FARR, GANDY AND BELIN LOOK 
IMPRESSIVE IN FILL-IN ROLES; RAMS: PRESSED INTO DUTY BECAUSE OF INJURIES TO 
STARTERS, THEY STEP IN WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.

<P>
 In a typical case of rookie panic, Ram defensive tackle D'Marco Farr headed 
out of the Anaheim Stadium locker room for the parking lot, only to be stopped 
by assistant head coach Joe Vitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronting a rookie free agent who was an hour away from making his first NFL 
start, Vitt figured he had to make the play. No way was Farr going AWOL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait, you can't leave," Vitt told him. "What are you running from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Farr laughed. "Nothing," he said, "I'm just going to my car to get my gym bag. 
I left it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitt's response: "OK, you better be back here in five minutes. You're not 
running away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Farr came back, suited up and played admirably in a fill-in role 
for Pro Bowl tackle Sean Gilbert in the Rams' 17-10 victory over the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr, a rookie free agent from Washington, finished with three tackles, 
deflected a Dave Brown pass and helped hold Giant running back Rodney Hampton 
to 44 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my Lord," Farr said of tackling the 230-pound Hampton, "he's a big man. 
That should be illegal. It (a running back's weight) should be limited to under 
200 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr, 6 feet 1, 270 pounds, was one of three young Ram players pressed into 
starting duty Sunday because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Wayne Gandy made his first NFL start, replacing right tackle Jackie 
Slater (torn triceps) and second-year guard Chuck Belin started at left tackle 
for Tom Newberry, who moved to center in place of Bern Brostek (broken leg 
bone). 
</P>
<P>
 "They hung in there and made the plays, especially when we had a lot of new 
people in there," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "I thought the people who went in 
there and played for our starters did an outstanding job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not going to be denied today." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy wasn't. The Rams' top draft pick (16th overall), Gandy had been a bust 
so far this season. He was called for several foolish holding and offside 
penalties, including a key holding penalty on second and goal at the Green Bay 
two-yard line last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a chance to get a lot of people off my back and show them I can play 
at this level," Gandy said. "I've had some rough times, and I'll have some 
rough times in the future. Hopefully, I can keep struggling and struggling and 
get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy was called for holding once in the second quarter, but did a good job 
blocking Giant end Keith Hamilton, who had 11 1/2 sacks last season. But was 
one good game enough to get the monkey off Gandy's back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any monkeys in my career," Gandy said. "I don't have any at my 
house, and I haven't seen any at Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 10 games and had five penalties called on me in one 
(exhibition) game. What else can happen? I've had all the bad . . . happen to 
me. What else can happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another start, perhaps? Slater is expected to be out through the bye week, 
meaning Gandy will be protecting Miller again Sunday in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne showed his versatility today," Slater said. "He's a natural left tackle 
and came over to the other side and did a hell of a job against a very talented 
defensive player (Hamilton). He should be awfully proud of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Ram quarterback Chris Miller praised the play of Belin and 
Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job," he said. "We had a couple sacks in the second half but 
that was mostly because of a scheme we weren't prepared for. I had a lot of 
time to step up and find my guys and throw. It's nice to have guys who can step 
in and get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr was waiting for just such an opportunity. He wasn't drafted last spring, 
mainly because he was small for an NFL lineman. But the Rams took a chance on 
him and he made enough of an impression in training camp to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a talk with myself and said, well, this proves that my life is not 
finished, this is not where it will end," Farr said. "I kept pushing and made 
the team and I figured when the time came that I had to start and I'm not going 
to run from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr's performance Sunday drew rave reviews from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Todd Lyght: "D'Marco got in there and started yelling at us like he 
was the captain. He was trying to be a leader. I got to look up to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, who drew most of the double-teams with Gilbert 
out of the lineup: "I kept talking to him, trying to get him lined up right. He 
knew they were going to run at him. I said, 'They're coming at you, you make 
the plays.' He did." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Fred Stokes, who lined up on the right side next to Farr: 
"D'Marco had some exposure and a little time coming in and out so this wasn't 
like it was the first game he was thrown in. It wasn't a Tommy Maddox 
situation, where he hadn't been in at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked our side a little bit. I told Sean, 'Hey, I didn't realize how 
much I missed you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Farr replaced the injured Gilbert in the first half last week in Green Bay. 
And when Gilbert was forced to miss a start for the first time in his 
three-year NFL career, Farr was ready to take over the starting role. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was like a dream come true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Farr met with reporters, showered and changed quickly and left 
for a post-game celebration only a true pro wrestling fan could love. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr had backstage passes to wrestling bouts at The Pond, and was eagerly 
awaiting a chance to see his longtime idol -- Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to meet the man," Farr said. "The Hulkster."

 Rookie Wayne Gandy made his first NFL start, replacing right tackle Jackie 
Slater (torn triceps), and second-year guard Chuck Belin started at left tackle 
for Tom Newberry, who moved to center in place of Bern Brostek (broken leg). 
</P>
<P>
 "They hung in there and made the plays, especially when we had a lot of new 
people in there," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "I thought the people who went in 
there and played for our starters did an outstanding job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not going to be denied today." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' top draft pick, the 16th overall, Gandy had been a disappointment so 
far this season. He was called for several foolish holding and offside 
penalties, including a key holding penalty on second and goal at the Green Bay 
two-yard line last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a chance to get a lot of people off my back and show them I can play 
at this level," Gandy said. "I've had some rough times, and I'll have some 
rough times in the future. Hopefully, I can keep struggling and struggling and 
get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy was called for holding once in the second quarter, but did a good job 
blocking end Keith Hamilton, who had 11 1/2 sacks last season. But was one good 
game enough to get the monkey off Gandy's back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any monkeys in my career," Gandy said. "I don't have any at my 
house, and I haven't seen any at Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 10 games and had five penalties called on me in one 
(exhibition). What else can happen? I've had all the bad . . . happen to me. 
What else can happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another start, perhaps? Slater is expected to be sidelined through the bye 
week, meaning Gandy will be protecting quarterback Chris Miller again Sunday in 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne showed his versatility today," Slater said. "He's a natural left tackle 
and came over to the other side and did a hell of a job against a very talented 
defensive player (Hamilton). He should be awfully proud of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Belin got his first NFL start, taking over at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to get a victory after you've been working so hard all week," 
Belin said. "There was much more stress this week than a typical week." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller praised the play of Belin and Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a great job," he said. "We had a couple of sacks in the second half, 
but that was mostly because of a scheme we weren't prepared for. I had a lot of 
time to step up and find my guys and throw. It's nice to have guys who can step 
in and get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr was waiting for such an opportunity. He wasn't drafted last spring, 
mainly because he is small for an NFL lineman. But the Rams took a chance on 
him -- and he has made it pay off.

PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS 17, NEW YORK GIANTS 10; RAM NOTEBOOK; NEWMAN HAS CAST, MIDAS 
TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Imagine catching a pass wearing an oven mitt on one hand, and then you'll 
understand how Ram free safety Anthony Newman felt Sunday in the final minutes 
of the Rams' 17-10 victory over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, wearing a large cast on his right hand to protect a finger he 
dislocated in practice, intercepted a Dave Brown pass intended for Mike 
Sherrard at the 50 and returned it 24 yards with 1 minute 13 seconds remaining 
to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing but a nub, a club," Newman said. "I don't know how I got the 
interception with one hand. When things like that happen, you concentrate a 
little bit harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cast was big, it was heavy and it was always in my way. They (doctors) 
did a good job of putting the cast on. Maybe if I wear casts on both hands, I 
might get two interceptions next game." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman's interception Sunday was his first since a 38-17 victory over the 
Giants on Oct. 18, 1992. Linebacker Joe Kelly intercepted a Brown pass in the 
first half, Kelly's first since 1991, when he was with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have 10 interceptions in seven games this season, one shy of their 
season-total last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis was held to less than 100 yards for the second 
consecutive game -- gaining 88 yards in 30 carries -- but he caught three 
passes for 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes a lot of pressure off me," Miller said. "He opens up the passing 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the second half, sometimes we lean on him a little too much. We say, 
'Here you go Jerome, here's eight or nine dudes up there, let's see how many 
yards you can get.' Those are hard-earned yards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Fred Stokes and defensive tackle Jimmie Jones dedicated Sunday's 
victory to Corona's Barry Barrier, a cancer patient they, along with 
quarterback T.J. Rubley, visited Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw his situation, it really brings you back to reality," Stokes said. 
"I'm really glad we won because we had dedicated the game to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had learned that Barrier, a longtime fan, had refused his medication 
before last week's Green Bay game because it made him drowsy and he didn't want 
to miss the game on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a picture of him here in my locker and I looked at it before the game. 
I'll be praying for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Hester's streak of consecutive games with a catch was in danger until 
the Ram wide receiver caught a 12-yard pass from Chris Miller with about three 
minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester has caught at least one pass in 69 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked pretty bleak at the moment," Hester said of the streak. "We had to 
move the ball a little bit and get some passes and I thought, 'Maybe I have a 
little ray of hope here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reception came on third and eight from the Ram 39 and kept alive the Rams' 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 They ran off nearly two more minutes before punting the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that it (the streak) is still alive," Hester said, "and we got a 
victory as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowded house: Tight end Troy Drayton, on the crowd of 40,474, the 
second-largest to see a Ram game in Anaheim Stadium this season: "Those 40,000 
people are faithful fans. I would rather have 40,000 people who are faithful 
fans than 60,000 or 70,000 fair-weather fans. At least I know half of those 
guys out there (in the stands). The guys in the end zone, those guys will be 
there no matter what. They're the die-hards." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Farr: "They're the few, but they're the loud." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Farr on his lack of size (6 feet 1, 270 pounds) for a defensive 
tackle: "Six-foot-one doesn't mean anything. So I can't see over a bathroom 
stall, big deal."

<P>
 There were little hints Sunday that the good times were back for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you know things are going your way when a one-armed guy makes an 
interception," Ram defensive back Marquez Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Newman, right-hand wrapped like a mummy, snagged a pass intended for 
New York Giants wide receiver Mike Sherrard. Newman then wandered around 
Anaheim Stadium, broken finger and all, looking for the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his teammates were looking for the exit. They had a 17-10 victory 
locked up and wanted to get going while the going was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was celebrating and he's out there running around," defensive end Robert 
Young said. "I said, 'Anthony, get down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One can hardly blame him. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and the defense had seen too many strange things the past two weeks. 
They had done their share, twice, but had nothing to show for it. Two leads 
became two losses and it was getting to be too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams held the Atlanta Falcons scoreless through three-plus quarters, then 
gave up one measly touchdown and lost, 8-5. They took a 17-3 lead into halftime 
against Green Bay, but again lost, this time, 24-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense knew it was to blame even if no one else did. Its members looked 
in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to take responsibility," defensive tackle Jimmie Jones said. "Our job 
is to stop the other team. That's what we get paid to do. If we don't let the 
other team in, we win those two games." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a skewed view. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the offense pulled vanishing acts in both losses. Poor special 
teams play cost them in Green Bay. The defense had been a rock, but could only 
stand so much. It had crumbled in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to make the play when it counts," said Newman, who broke his finger 
during practice for the Giants. "You can make plays in the first quarter, the 
second quarter and the third quarter, but you have to make plays in the fourth 
quarter. We wanted to stay late and put in some overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense did a full day's work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Joe Kelly intercepted a Dave Brown pass and returned it 
31 yards to set up the Rams' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Young got in Brown's face on third and five at the 
seven. Brown ditched the pass and the Giants settled for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The big plays just kept getting bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants trailed, 17-10, in the third quarter, and had a fourth and one at 
the Ram 35. The ball was going to Rodney Hampton (25 carries, 109 yards), which 
was common knowledge. The Giants didn't even try to disguise it, bringing in 
three tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked over at Darryl Henley and said, 'Where are the wide receivers,' " 
cornerback Todd Lyght said. "We were supposed to be in a zone, but we turned it 
into a blitz. Marquez told me he was going in and to watch his back. I told 
Anthony to watch my back, I was blitzing too." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Shane Conlan got there first, as he swooped in untouched and hit 
Hampton in the back field. Pope, Lyght and company soon followed. Hampton lost 
a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made up a defense and it worked," Lyght said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not all the ad-libs turned out so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton blew through a big hole for a 27-yard touchdown run in the first 
quarter. But the Rams were improvising again, using only 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play before, we were short personnel too and called a timeout," Jones 
said. "Instead of losing another timeout, we just went ahead and tried to play 
it. We came to the sideline and said, 'That's our fault. That one's on the 
defense.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't about to give up another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants got a final chance. They had the ball on their 20 with 1 minute 6 
seconds left. Nerves were getting a bit frayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Young: "I was saying, 'Oh Lord, don't let this happen again. I can't take 
another loss.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No worries. Brown let one fly and Newman chased it down. End of story, if 
Newman would just get down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took some time off the clock," Newman said. "I tried to help my (return) 
average a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates were happy just to get the victory.

 Ten years of managing winter ball in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela 
finally paid off for former Dodger relief pitcher Phil (The Vulture) Regan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've waited a long time for this," he said Sunday, after the Baltimore 
Orioles named him manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan, 57, signed a two-year contract, with an option for a third year. He 
replaces Johnny Oates, who was fired on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan was pitching coach for two teams, most recently with the Cleveland 
Indians this year, and spent seven years as a scout for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan took a break from managing his team in Caracas to travel to Baltimore 
for a second interview Saturday. He will return to Venezuela until his team 
replaces him. Motor Sports

KINGS' MCSORLEY NEGOTIATING TO PLAY FOR LAS VEGAS OF THE IHL

 King defenseman Marty McSorley will likely join Las Vegas of the International 
Hockey League during the NHL's lockout, but Bob Strumm, Thunder general manager 
and coach, said that reports that McSorley would make his debut as early as 
Tuesday were premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a chance," Strumm said Sunday."If we're going to do it, we'd like to do 
it as quickly as possible. I wouldn't say anything is imminent. We have to talk 
to him first. I haven't talked to him this weekend. We're planning on talking 
to him in the next couple of days, now that the 15th has passed. We'd love to 
have him. We think think we've got an edge with his brother Chris here (as 
associate coach)." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley's agent, Michael Barnett, has described the discussions as "casual 
conversations." McSorley was unavailable for comment. If McSorley agrees to 
play for the Thunder, Strumm said he would need two or three days of skating 
and might be ready to play Friday in Las Vegas against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder spokesperson Kevin Gallant disputed a report that McSorley would 
receive as much as $10,000 per game. LISA DILLMAN

SOCCER / JULIE CART; LIEKOSKI FACES A DIFFICULT TASK GETTING U.S. INTO MEDAL 
ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently appointed U.S. Olympic Coach Timo Liekoski spent the weekend at a 
college tournament in South Carolina, scouting players for his Under-23 
national team. Late one night he spoke with a group of coaches about why 
American players -- with all their athletic talent -- tend to lack the 
creativity that is at the heart of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the years of youth soccer car pools and perfectly lined fields dotted 
with orange cones have produced a generation of solid but unimaginative 
players? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the kids going to a park and playing 2-on-2 soccer, like they do 
in basketball," Liekoski said. "In blacktop basketball you become creative to 
survive, because if you lose, you have to wait for 23 games to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski will spend the next year and a half attempting to cull the most 
creative players from the college ranks for his 1996 Olympic team in Atlanta. 
An assistant on the 1994 U.S. World Cup team, Liekoski will surely face the 
most difficult task ever for a U.S. Olympic soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the context: There presumably will be a heightened interest in the 
tournament as a result of the World Cup. With the Olympics in the United 
States, the nation's patriotic fervor will not accept a non-medal performance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the rather high aim Liekoski has set for his team -- a place in the 
medal round. It has long been unattainable for the U.S. team, in part because 
of restrictions imposed by the American collegiate athletic system. World Cup 
Coach Bora Milutinovic, who rarely rules out any job opportunity, made a face 
when asked if he would be interested in the Olympic job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's the Olympics," Milutinovic said. "But when would I get the players 
to train and play? This is the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 It's now Liekoski's problem. He has chosen to work within the system, rather 
than fight it. He'll make do with training camps arranged around the players' 
academic and vacation schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make the most of the time we get," Liekoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in January 1996 will the players assemble for their final preparation, 
preferably at one of the Olympic soccer venues or a place with similar climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski and his fellow Olympic coaches will have an interesting card to play 
in 1996 -- the use of three overage (older than 23) players. Among Americans 
who have shown an interest are World Cup players Thomas Dooley, Brad Friedel, 
Claudio Reyna and Alexi Lalas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our success in the World Cup has greatly increased the expectations," 
Liekoski said. "But if I do my job right, the pressure will take care of 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom you ask, World Cup '94 will/will not give a final financial 
accounting of the tournament to FIFA next week in New York. But whether the 
surplus is $20 million as the Organizing Committee projected for two years, or 
$40 million to $50 million as Alan Rothenberg claimed during his reelection 
campaign, the key thing to remember is that the money will be turned over to 
the U.S. Soccer Federation Foundation as the World Cup's most visible "legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about the soccer fields that were never built in the housing projects, 
this money will be the real fuel for soccer in the decades to come. Or should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 The first order of business for the Foundation will be to hire an executive 
director. Presumably, the director will carry out the wishes of the 
Foundation's board, but we've heard little of late regarding the Foundation's 
agenda or priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming a surplus of $40 million, what will that actually translate into for 
soccer? According to one board member, the Foundation will invest most of its 
funds and give out/loan only 5% a year. That's $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a lot," acknowledged a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The real amount of the seed money could be affected by the outcome of the 
IRS's continuing investigation of World Cup '94's $5-million "loan" to Major 
League Soccer. Despite officials' assurances that the transfer of money from 
the non-profit World Cup Organizing Committee to the for-profit MLS was legal, 
the IRS has not concluded as much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Italian soccer has been caught up in the national corruption investigation, 
this one targeting clubs for tax evasion and irregularities in the transfer 
market. It seemed inevitable that soccer -- Italy's fourth-largest industry -- 
would be included in the far-reaching investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Operation Offside" began with raids on some of the country's biggest clubs. 
Documents were seized from 34 first and second division clubs by the Guardia di 
Finanza . The suspicion is that most Italian clubs are heavily in debt and club 
officials juggle the books to keep the clubs afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Few clubs are immune from the investigation, including mighty AC Milan, owned 
by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the president of the Italian Football Federation is under investigation 
for abuse of office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not panic," federation President Antonio Matarrese told the Italian 
newspaper La Stampa. "We haven't fooled anyone, we have nothing to hide."

 As punishment for fan violence, AC Milan has had two points deducted and finds 
itself at the bottom of its group in the European Champions' League. 
</P>
<P>
 UEFA, the governing body for European soccer, took the step against the 
defending champion as a consequence of the actions of Milan's crowd during a 
Sept. 28 game. 
</P>
<P>
 In that match at Milan's San Siro Stadium, the goalkeeper for Casino Salzburg 
suffered a concussion from a half-filled plastic bottle thrown by a fan. Milan 
Coach Fabio Capello accused the goalkeeper of faking the injury in the game 
that Milan won, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Salzburg was fined $7,500 because its fans lit fireworks in the stadium 
and Milan was ordered to play its next two matches in the competition at least 
200 miles from San Siro.

CLIPPER UPDATE; DEHERE: HE'S GOT NO RHYTHM WHEN HE'S GOT NO MINUTES 
</P>

 Clipper guard Terry Dehere, who shot 37.7% as a rookie last season, thinks 
he'll shoot better this season because he'll get more playing time after the 
departure of free agent guard Ron Harper, who signed with the Chicago Bulls 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere said he never developed a shooting rhythm because he averaged only 11.9 
minutes a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooters have to be able to play," Dehere said. "If a shooter doesn't have 
the minutes, he can't shoot, I don't care what type of shooter you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere missed eight of 10 shots in a 105-82 exhibition loss to the Orlando 
Magic on Friday. On Saturday, in a 106-84 exhibition victory over the Atlanta 
Hawks, he made eight of 12 shots, including two three-pointers. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie swingman Eric Piatkowski, whose father, Walt, played for 
Clipper Coach Bill Fitch at Bowling Green and went on to play four seasons in 
the now defunct ABA, got some advice from his father about Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me how tough the practices can be with Coach Fitch and how he can be 
sometimes during the season," Piatkowski said. "I don't exactly want you guys 
to print what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who coached former Boston Celtic star Larry Bird for four years, 
compared Piatkowski to Bird after scouting Piatkowski at a pre-draft camp in 
Phoenix last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a great compliment that he gave me," Piatkowski said. "That came 
toward the end of the Phoenix camp and he thought he was never going to see me 
again. Now, I'm sure he'll have a few other words that he'll say about me 
during the season. If he feels that way, that's just a great compliment. 
Hopefully, I can live up to some of his expectations." 
</P>

<P>
 Carl Horne, the Clippers' strength and conditioning coach for the last three 
years, resigned to become the personal trainer for former Clipper forward Danny 
Manning, who signed with the Phoenix Suns. . . . Former Clipper Coach Bob 
Weiss, who was fired in May with two years left on his contract, has been hired 
as the Dallas Mavericks' TV color commentator. . . . Guard Gary Grant, who 
underwent knee surgery two weeks ago, developed an infection requiring 
antibiotics. It is not expected to delay his return. CHRIS BAKER

YOUNGER GARRITSON ISN'T A STRANGER TO SUCCESS; CROSS-COUNTRY: HEATHER IS 
PICKING UP WHERE SISTER CARRIE LEFT OFF AT BUENA PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The comparison is a logical one to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who has seen freshman Heather Garritson run this season has been 
reminded of her older sister, Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Garritson left the high school scene as the first to earn four trips to 
the Foot Locker National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Three short months after Carrie graduated from Buena Park and left for 
Alabama, Heather stepped into the spotlight her sister had run so many miles 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 So just when opposing runners and their coaches thought they might have seen 
the last of the Garritson dominance, 13-year-old Heather moved to the 
forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters are similar in many ways, including how they win races. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Heather is undefeated after the Laguna Hills, Woodbridge and Sonora 
invitationals, as well as three Freeway League meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The race that brought her to everybody's attention was the first of the season 
and her first high school race -- the Laguna Hills Invitational -- in which she 
posted the day's only sub-18 minute mark for three miles. Racing against an 
all-freshman field, Garritson (17 minutes 41 seconds) topped the next best 
runner by 2:09. She was named a Times Orange County athlete of the week for her 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The next weekend, Garritson chewed up a tougher field, running 18:25 at 
Woodbridge despite getting lost -- just as her sister had done the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between the sisters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot more talkative than Carrie," Heather said. "That is something that 
people notice about me right off. Sometimes it gets me in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Mike Garritson, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt she is much more talkative," said Garritson, who has 
coached Heather since she began running at age 4. "She has a little more speed 
than Carrie, but not the work ethic in practice. But when it comes to the big 
race, Heather just seems to get the job done. Some kids are just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the job done is exactly what Heather did this past weekend at the 
Orange County Championships at Irvine Regional Park, where she finished third 
in the team sweepstakes race featuring the county's finest. 
</P>
<P>
 After running with Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire in the lead for much of the 
three-mile race, Garritson faded to finish third in 17:54, behind eventual 
winner Tracy Clark of Corona del Mar and Pugmire. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, having raced Carrie and Heather, noticed many similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they use the same strategy, but they both just get out there 
and go from the start. They look the same, too." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only place Heather hasn't proven herself is on the track, where she 
hasn't competed since age 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love cross-country for some reason," said Heather, who ran 3,000 meters in 
10:11 as a sixth-grader. "It's more competitive than track, going up the hills 
. . . it just gives you more of a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garritson figured Heather's break from track was a healthy one, allowing 
her maturing body to catch up to her racing success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped her racing two years ago because she was growing so much," he said. 
"She is considerably taller and much, much stronger than Carrie was at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 That strength is what Heather hopes will help her achieve some lofty goals in 
her first high school season. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather not only wants to eventually match Carrie's feat of making four 
national teams, but also become only the second freshman to win the individual 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't be the first freshman to win it all, then I at least want to be 
the second to win it all," she said, referring to last season's victory by 
freshman Erin Davis from Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Heather runs a good time at (the CIF) State (Championships in Fresno on 
Nov. 26), then we will look at going to Foot Locker," Mike Garritson said. 
"Otherwise we will go to the AAU's again. The same thing happened with Carrie." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Union championships are commonplace to Heather, who has 
won the last six cross-country titles in age-group races, as Carrie did before 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 If Heather is uncomfortable about being compared to her older sister, she 
doesn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the perfect role model," Heather said. "Perfect grades, the perfect 
runner . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like being asked if I am better than her, because I don't know 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Predicted her father: "There is no doubt that Heather has the ability to outdo 
Carrie. I've seen her and I know it's possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are going to be some big shoes to fit into, but I think she can do it."

AST LAYOFFS RENEW WORRIES OVER O.C. JOBS; EMPLOYMENT: ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMPUTER 
MAKER THAT IT WILL CLOSE FOUNTAIN VALLEY PLANT LEADS TO CALL FOR NEW EFFORT TO 
KEEP BUSINESSES IN COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 AST Research Inc.'s announcement that it will shut down its manufacturing 
operation here is bringing renewed calls by business and political leaders for 
a concerted effort to keep companies and jobs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered by heavy losses, the Irvine personal computer maker said Friday it 
will lay off nearly 700 workers, including 440 at the Fountain Valley plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "AST's announcement is part of a continuing loss of high-tech manufacturing 
jobs here," said Anil Puri, chairman of the economic department at California 
State University at Fullerton. "This again brings up the question of our local 
business climate and our ability to retain firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Just two months ago, Hughes Aircraft Co. said it will shut down most of its 
Fullerton operations, laying off 1,000 workers and taking 6,100 more jobs out 
of the county. Though that move had been rumored for months, AST's news Friday 
caught local officials by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know about it, and obviously this is not good," said Wayne Wedin, 
chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium, a business 
retention group. "Certainly we're not pleased to lose good jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 While that is not an indication that Orange County is failing in its effort to 
attract and keep good jobs, Wedin said, it is certainly a wake-up call. "We've 
got to work harder. We're going to have to redouble our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium has had a number of successes, Wedin said, citing Taco Bell 
Corp.'s decision in late June to keep its corporate headquarters -- and 1,000 
jobs -- in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhaustive two-year review by the fast-food company of opportunities in 
other states, including Texas and Georgia, prompted government and business 
leaders to assemble into an emergency "red team" to keep Taco Bell and its 
valued jobs here. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, however, Orange County has lost 148 companies that employed a 
total of 19,342 workers, according to data compiled by the Orange County 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "Any time we lose jobs like this, it is a 
blow to what has been a turnaround in Orange County," said Fred Mickelson, 
chairman of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri noted that, though the positions to be eliminated at AST will be only a 
small percentage of the estimated 65,000 high-tech employees in Orange County, 
the loss cannot be ignored. "In terms of percentages it's not a lot, but AST is 
an important company, a local, home-grown company, and when they make a 
decision like that, we need to pay attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said he had been in the dark about AST's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win them all, but that doesn't mean we can't do something about it 
and try to figure why this happened," he said. "This gives us another arrow in 
our quiver to say to local officials the importance of continuing to focus on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said the AST situation points out the need for a full-time, 
professionally run business retention effort in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Schneider, Orange County administrative officer, said there is support 
for a new business retention group that would combine efforts of the chamber, 
the consortium and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of putting together something right now," he said. "But 
I have a feeling there's not much we could've done here. It's hard to compete 
with Taiwan," where AST will consolidate manufacturing of its notebook 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's mayor said the layoffs could have a ripple effect on local 
businesses that depend on AST's employee base. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real concern is that there are 400 employees that will not be shopping in 
Fountain Valley, and the resulting loss in sales tax revenues," Mayor John 
Collins said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he and other local officials conceded that there was not much they could 
have done to keep the AST jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in the technology business," Collins said. "These people have 
fallen behind with their product and satisfying their customers. These people 
need to get on the technological power curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local businesses that deal with AST, however, had an early warning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 10, "AST told us they didn't need any more fasteners for the desktop 
model," said Mike Ratzlaff, 33, general manager of Irvine-based All-Spec 
Fasteners Inc. "We found out on Wednesday that they didn't want any more for 
the other model." 
</P>
<P>
 AST generates about 30% of All-Spec Fastener's revenue, so "the closing will 
put a dent into our business," Ratzlaff said. "But, surprisingly, we're 
starting to get a lot more business from the smaller companies out there, so we 
won't be knocked down entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratzlaff acknowledged, though, that the recent string of high-tech plant 
closings is troubling, and he raised concerns about the broader effect on the 
region's economy. "There are just so many big companies closing that it has to 
have an impact," he said, "even with the smaller companies growing."

MAKING IT IN O.C.; GIFT MANUFACTURER IN BUENA PARK HAS A PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy McHenry, 56, purchased Buena Park-based Artistic Gifts Inc. in 1984 
after a career in the brokerage industry. "I was looking for a change, and this 
looked like a tremendous little company," said McHenry, who had managed Merrill 
Lynch brokerage offices in Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic Gifts designs and manufactures stained-glass plaques for sale through 
drugstores, supermarkets and gift shops nationwide. Sales increased to $4 
million last year, McHenry said. Artistic Gifts' 50 employees manufacture the 
plaques from scratch, using plain glass and wood, McHenry said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have some wonderfully talented people working here," he said. "I think I 
could double the size of the business if I could get more equity." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also sells its product through a factory-outlet store at its plant 
on Aragon Circle.

HOW A PASADENA INVESTING FIRM SPUN A BOOM THAT FIZZLED; SECURITIES: CONVERSION 
INDUSTRIES' HISTORY SHOWS IT WAS INVOLVED IN DIZZYING FINANCIAL CROSS-DEALINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To skeptics, John P. McGrain's financial empire at Conversion Industries was a 
house of cards waiting for a stiff breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, it was more than a breeze that blew through Conversion's Pasadena 
offices: Within a period of four days, the American Stock Exchange decided to 
delist the company over disclosure issues, the stock lost nearly all of its 
value, McGrain resigned as CEO and some of Conversion's dozen-plus affiliated 
businesses began scrambling to distance themselves from the spreading morass. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, Conversion had named a largely unknown investment banker as its new 
CEO and pledged an all-out effort to "repair its relationship" with the Amex, 
which had not taken such strong action against any firm in almost a quarter 
century. Meanwhile, with trading officially halted, Conversion stockholders 
still had no way to trade their shares, which sold as high as $33.25 in 1993 
but were quoted at $1.38 last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion's future is far from certain now, but whatever its fate, the 
company's investors should have seen the red flags long ago. Since the onetime 
Canadian energy firm metamorphosed into a self-styled investment company in 
1991, it has engaged in more than a few financial practices that have raised 
Wall Street eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By using a controversial Colorado penny-stock brokerage to underwrite many of 
its spinoff companies, for example, Conversion virtually invited the scrutiny 
of "short sellers," professional traders who make a living betting against 
stocks they believe are grossly inflated in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion and its spinoffs were also involved in dizzying financial 
cross-dealings and interlocking directorships -- some of which, the firm has 
acknowledged, gave the appearance of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this was engineered by McGrain -- who declined to be interviewed for 
this story -- and a full-time staff of just 14 people in the company's Colorado 
Boulevard headquarters. Despite the "Industries" in its name -- and a stock 
market value of $170 million at its peak -- Conversion does not manufacture 
anything; it exists solely to deal in shares of other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion's stated mission is the "identification of, investment in and 
sponsorship of emerging growth companies." The basic idea is to find intriguing 
little companies, pump money into them, then take them public via stock 
offerings 12 to 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 If Conversion could invest in a hot business concept at a cheap price, 
individual investors conceivably could be enticed to pay a higher price for the 
business later. Conversion could make money either by selling its stake in the 
business to new investors, or by holding the shares as they appreciated -- and 
borrowing money against that stock to use for new investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why Conversion decided to enter the so-called merchant-banking 
business in the first place is not clear. From 1984 to 1991, the firm was 
involved in development of "alternative-energy" facilities, though little 
appears to have come of that. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrain, now 49, a former Southland stockbroker, headed Conversion all through 
the 1980s, when he also dabbled in oil and gas ventures. Officially Conversion 
remains incorporated in Canada; its stock first traded on the Vancouver Stock 
Exchange before migrating to the Amex in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion attracted little attention with its initial investments, in 1991 
and early 1992, in tiny entities such as an energy-management consultant and a 
Canadian oil exploration outfit named International Colin Energy. But things 
began to heat up in mid-1992, after Conversion raised $10.2 million in a new 
public offering of its shares and shares of International Colin. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell that stock, Conversion enlisted the services of Tamaron Investments, 
an Englewood, Colo.-based penny-stock brokerage that Conversion had previously 
used to underwrite small share offerings of companies in Conversion's 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 So close were the ties between Conversion and Tamaron, in fact, that 
Conversion CEO McGrain personally lent Tamaron $1 million to give the brokerage 
the capital it said it needed to launch Conversion's 1992 stock offering, 
according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with cash in mid-1992, Conversion shifted into high gear. In one major 
transaction, Conversion agreed that October to take a big stake in a private 
Canadian oil well servicing company called Beta Well Service. Beta's CEO, 
William J. Gordica, had known McGrain since the early 1980s and been a 
Conversion director since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of having Conversion inject cash into Beta, friends McGrain and 
Gordica did a trade: Conversion took 1.15 million shares of Beta from Gordica, 
and in return he got 307,874 shares of Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, using Tamaron, Conversion took Beta public in January, 1993, while also 
distributing more than half of Conversion's Beta shares to Conversion 
shareholders in the form of a stock dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Beta had been in difficult financial straits before the stock offering. But 
concurrent with the offering, the company heavily promoted its new business 
ties with Russian oil companies, touting sky-high profit margins on oil 
services contracts with the needy Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 The hype helped drive Beta's stock from $7 to nearly $20 on the American Stock 
Exchange in the first half of 1993, in the process enriching 35%-owner Gordica 
-- at least on paper -- as well as Conversion and its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrain and Conversion, meanwhile, were deep into many other new deals by 
mid-1993, advancing millions of dollars to small highly speculative businesses 
with the hope of quickly taking them public at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept -- a sort of fast-paced venture capitalism for the small investor 
-- appealed to Tom Dukes, a veteran Paine Webber broker in Pasadena. Dukes was 
among the investment professionals who put their own money -- and their 
clients' -- in Conversion and its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conversion was like a cow that produced milk," Dukes said last week -- the 
"milk" being a stream of spinoff companies such as Beta and the stock gains 
they generated. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, Conversion booked $18.6 million in 
investment revenue, a fourfold rise from 1992, thanks to its spinoff successes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Conversion's own shareholders -- as they were being rewarded 
with a blizzard of stock dividends, rights and warrants in the spinoff 
businesses -- likewise provided a ready and needed investor base for the new 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger the investor crowd within which excitement about a Conversion 
spinoff could be generated, the greater the chances that the stock would rocket 
-- boosting the value of the remaining shares held by Conversion, which were 
its only real assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But by the summer of 1993, Wall Street short sellers began to suspect that 
Conversion had built a house of cards. The shorts -- traders who borrow stock 
and sell it, betting that the price will plunge -- began to encircle Conversion 
as its stock hit $33.25 that June, a six-fold rise from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion's ties to Tamaron were one beacon for the shorts; several of 
Tamaron's principals had previous ties to other Denver penny-stock brokerages 
that had been associated with stock deals that crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 More intriguing for the shorts was Conversion's decision in June, 1993, to 
create and take public CVD Financial Corp. CVD's initial role was to be a 
lender to companies in which Conversion already had stakes. In effect, 
Conversion was creating a bank for itself, using fresh cash raised from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did McGrain & Co. need a bank? Because although Conversion had set out to 
be an equity investor in small companies, several of its "investee" firms 
needed so much cash to stay afloat that Conversion also began making short-term 
loans to them -- digging an ever-deeper hole for Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospectus for CVD's stock offering put it bluntly: "Conversion's lending 
activities were never part of its intended business and only arose as a result 
of the inability of the companies in which it had made equity investments to 
obtain debt financing from traditional sources." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risks involved in creating CVD from scratch, investors in August, 
1993, stepped up to buy $54 million worth of CVD bonds and stock in an 
underwriting co-managed by Tamaron. 
</P>
<P>
 CVD immediately assumed $4.4 million in loans made by Conversion to four of 
its investee firms, SEC documents say. In addition, CVD directors quickly 
approved contingent loan agreements worth $20 million, most of which was 
allocated for three Conversion companies: Bratcher Industries, a chemicals 
maker; trucker Joseph Land Group, and PDG Environmental, an asbestos-abatement 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, 1993, however, Wall Street doubts about the value of the 
companies in Conversion's portfolio were growing, and its stock was being 
hammered. The number of Conversion shares sold short rose from 185,000 in July 
to 605,000 that September -- 12% of the total outstanding -- putting further 
downward pressure on the per-share price. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that a new Conversion spinoff -- an Anaheim-based start-up firm 
named Statordyne Corp. -- had gone public that summer and quickly plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Conversion stock at $12 in October, 1993 -- off nearly two-thirds from 
its summer peak -- an incensed McGrain contended that he and the company were 
being victimized unfairly by the shorts. He asked the American Stock Exchange 
to investigate the shorts' trading. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then Conversion was in a vicious downward spiral. Many of its assorted 
publicly traded stock investments -- including Beta Well, Statordyne and CVD 
Financial -- were slumping in price, effectively slashing Conversion's 
shareholder equity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, losses on Conversion's investments in Bratcher, Joseph Land 
and a San Diego ship-repair business called Myriad Industries were mounting. By 
June of this year, Conversion's bad-debt losses for the previous 12 months had 
reached $5.4 million, nearly double that of the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief rally in some Conversion stocks early in 1994, sellers took 
control again by spring. Tamaron, which itself had planned to go public with 
Conversion's help, was forced to pull the plug on its offering. (Tamaron is now 
a shell of its former self, having sold its branch offices and accounts to 
Baraban Securities two weeks ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion began to take what appeared to be almost desperate steps to shore 
itself up. In April it sold one-half of a $500,000 promissory note interest to 
Canadian Polaris, a Canadian "clone" of Conversion set up in 1993. In June, 
Conversion cut a deal with Macdonald Capital, yet another of its affiliates, to 
inject $903,000 in capital into Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in a head-spinning series of transactions, Conversion in April cut 
its 52% stake in CVD Financial to 37% by selling 1 million CVD shares back to 
CVD for cash; then, in July, Conversion notified the SEC that it intended to 
raise its CVD stake back to at least 51% by buying CVD stock from current 
shareholders -- including McGrain, who would be permitted to unload his 212,000 
CVD shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Conversion's portfolio began to collapse, the complex cross-dealings of 
its companies and officers only accelerated the process. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrain told Bloomberg News Service earlier this year that his personal 
investments in Conversion and affiliates totaled $25 million as of March. But 
that portfolio was to some undisclosed extent leveraged. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, as Conversion's various stocks continued to sink in summer, 
McGrain faced margin calls from his lenders, forcing him to dump hundreds of 
thousands of shares of his assorted holdings -- including more than 200,000 
shares of Conversion at prices ranging from $5.38 to $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At some point along the way, the American Stock Exchange -- historically 
regarded as a fairly lax cop -- began to probe deeper into Conversion. Yet it 
appears that no one at Conversion was prepared for what the Amex announced last 
week -- that it would seek to delist both Conversion and Beta over unspecified 
"disclosure" issues, a dramatic disciplinary move that the Amex last took with 
one of its companies in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending Amex hearings on Oct. 24, the exchange will not say what its 
investigation found. But Conversion, scrambling to salvage its stock listing, 
suggested last week that allegations of conflict of interest might be part of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Conversion's board accepted McGrain's resignation and also 
announced that Beta Well CEO Gordica had resigned as a Conversion director and 
that D. Grant Macdonald, who had sat on both Beta's board and Conversion's, had 
quit Beta. Those resignations "should eliminate any perception of a conflict of 
interest between the two companies," Conversion said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dukes, the Paine Webber broker, insists that Conversion's basic business plan 
was sound, and he argues that there is significant value in some of 
Conversion's affiliates -- including Beta -- despite the stocks' collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 But he concedes now that the nature of Conversion's business allowed for "a 
great deal of self-dealing. That's the weakness of the concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, some Conversion affiliates took pains late last week to note 
that the Amex has not painted them with the same brush. David Norris, president 
of North American Recycling, said his paper-recycling company is working with 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities on a minimum $50-million bond issue 
that would in part extinguish debt to Conversion's CVD Financial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Conversion itself, of course, the paramount issue is whether the company 
has or can generate sufficient capital to survive, especially if its equity 
portfolio fails to rebound soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At June 30, Conversion's shareholder equity was $10.5 million, a steep plunge 
from the $34 million of a year earlier. Moreover, Conversion is on the hook for 
$8.1 million in loan guarantees to CVD Financial for loans to Conversion 
affiliates. And in what hapless shareholders will probably view as adding 
insult to injury, Conversion owes its executives $2.5 million in bonuses 
accrued in 1993 but not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrain alone -- who was paid $240,000 in salary in each of 1992, 1993 and 
1994 -- is also owed $902,999 in 1993 bonus money. 
</P>
<P>
 In its search for a successor to McGrain last week, the Conversion board of 
mostly McGrain cronies wound up picking Charles O. Thompson III, a 37-year-old 
former investment banker who came to Conversion in May from Sutro & Co., a 
mid-sized investment banking firm based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Thompson conceded that "capital is an issue" as 
Conversion attempts to right itself; he declined to speculate on the company's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he had joined Conversion as head of merchant banking operations 
in May because "I wanted to be a patient investor (in small companies) -- and I 
would still like to get back to that business." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Conversion's stock holdings, "some of our companies are more mature and 
some are less mature," he said. "But as they become more mature, they should 
prove their worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have value," he said, "but a lot of it just doesn't trade right now." How 
Fortunes Declined

PAINEWEBBER TO ACQUIRE KIDDER IN STOCK SWAP; SECURITIES: THE $675-MILLION DEAL 
WOULD CREATE THE NATION'S FOURTH-LARGEST BROKERAGE HOUSE. MASSIVE LAYOFFS ARE 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would create the nation's fourth-largest brokerage house, 
PaineWebber Group Inc. agreed in principle Sunday to buy the troubled Kidder 
Peabody brokerage from General Electric Co., a top Kidder executive close to 
the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, GE would receive a 21% stake in PaineWebber and a seat on the 
company's board of directors, according to news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of deal still were being negotiated late Sunday. A final agreement 
is expected to be reached today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder, which just last week slashed 10% of its 5,000-person work force, would 
have to cut more than half the remainder, one of the biggest single axings in 
brokerage history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kidder executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated 
Press the talks had almost stalled Friday after several weeks of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive said GE also agreed to pay an average two weeks' severance for 
each year worked to laid-off Kidder employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of GE and PaineWebber couldn't immediately be reached for comment on 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber wants Kidder's 1,250-member broker force as well as some of its 
investment bankers, research analysts and traders, PaineWebber representatives 
said. Kidder brokers generate $425,000 in average annual revenue for the firm, 
compared with about $300,000 a year for the average PaineWebber broker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the deal wasn't clear. But the New York Times, quoting 
unidentified sources who are close to the talks, reported in today's editions 
that the acquisition was a $675-million stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
 That is roughly equivalent to Kidder's value -- but far less than the $1.4 
billion GE has invested in Kidder since acquiring the brokerage in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 GE's decision to jettison Kidder caps a tumultuous year at the brokerage, once 
one of the most coveted brand names on Wall Street but increasingly troubled by 
financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage was rocked by allegations in April that its star government bond 
trader, Joseph Jett, had concocted $350 million in phony profits in a scheme to 
hide trading losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett has denied the allegations and said his bosses directed his trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In June, General Electric ousted Kidder's top management. The brokerage firm, 
which has lost enormous sums in the sharp downturn in the bond market that 
began in February, has sought to trim costs by $100 million and stem its 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder officials told employees earlier this month in an internal announcement 
that they had held sales talks with other securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder lost more than 30 of its top brokers this year and others said they 
would consider leaving if the branch network is sold to PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, General Electric shares rose $0.375 to $50.375. PaineWebber was 
unchanged at $14.875.

WHO WILL RULE THE RAILS?; PROMISE AND HURDLES AWAIT THE WINNER IN RACE TO TAKE 
OVER SANTA FE RAILWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Fe railroad helped build California a century ago. Now, as a 
takeover fight rages for Santa Fe, California stands as both a valuable prize 
and a big hurdle for the two companies seeking control. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Pacific Corp. agreed this summer to be acquired by Burlington 
Northern in a stock swap valued at $2.5 billion. But early this month, Union 
Pacific Corp. weighed in with a surprise $3.3-billion rival offer. 
</P>
<P>
 For Burlington, a Ft. Worth-based railroad that stretches from Texas across 
the Great Plains to the Pacific Northwest, Santa Fe would provide a strategic 
link to California, including its north-south route that snakes through the 
state's farm-rich midsection. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, meanwhile, already has a significant presence in Northern and 
Southern California. Those routes run very close to tracks operated by Santa Fe 
in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's that overlap that prompted Santa Fe to immediately reject Union 
Pacific's bid -- despite the much higher price -- on grounds it would reduce 
rail competition in California and thus never be approved by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts agreed. "There's no way on God's green Earth that they (Union 
Pacific) can expect to get this deal through" the ICC, said Scott Flower of 
Kidder Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's offer, he said, is aimed mostly at derailing Burlington's 
effort. "It's pretty clear this is a defensive maneuver to see if they could 
cause problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Chairman Gerald Grinstein has also blasted the Union 
Pacific bid, saying it is "nothing more than an attempt to stifle healthy 
competition in the western United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including some shipping and transportation executives in 
California, said that they're not concerned about a Union Pacific-Santa Fe 
marriage. Why? Because they would still have one other big carrier to turn to: 
Southern Pacific Rail Corp., the dominant railroad in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you have two, you still have the (competition) in place," said Al 
Fierstine, marketing director at the Port of Los Angeles. "I don't see any 
impact to the Southern California market other than instead of having three, 
you have two main carriers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific, based in San Francisco, has more than 50% of the California 
freight rail market, based on user fees that the railroads pay to the 
California Public Utilities Commission. The railroad also extends to the 
Pacific Northwest, Texas, Colorado and east to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Southern Pacific has said only that it's studying the battle for Santa 
Fe, and Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Southern Pacific, in fact, that tried to merge its rail line with Santa 
Fe's in 1986, but the deal was blocked by the ICC for being "anti-competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific has even hinted that its offer for Santa Fe would also give the 
ICC pause. In announcing its bid, the Bethlehem, Pa.-based concern said it 
would, in advance, grant unspecified conditions to Southern Pacific, Burlington 
and other railroads to ensure competition in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But Union Pacific says it's serious about buying Santa Fe, whose railroad is 
formally called the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in this thing to win," said Union Pacific spokesman Gary Schuster. 
Indeed, Union Pacific stepped up its attack last week by announcing plans for a 
proxy fight to take control of Santa Fe before Burlington can complete its 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for Santa Fe, based in suburban Chicago, is part of a larger wave of 
big rail mergers that began sweeping the industry this year. The railroads 
believe mergers can help them cut costs, boost their efficiency and reduce 
delays for shippers, all so the railroads can grab a bigger share of the 
$235-billion market for U.S. intercity freight transport. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroads currently are enjoying a solid period of growth amid the 
economy's expansion, and they still carry nearly 40% of the nation's intercity 
freight in terms of tonnage. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of revenue, the railroads have watched their share of the 
intercity freight market plunge over the past several decades, to about 13% 
currently, as the trucking industry became the dominant player. The highways 
now account for about 40% of market revenue, according to the Eno 
Transportation Foundation, a think tank in Lansdowne, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuing Santa Fe, Union Pacific and Burlington covet Santa Fe's Los 
Angeles-to-Chicago route, considered perhaps the industry's fastest connection 
between those cities. Santa Fe's "Texas to Los Angeles (route) is also 
attractive, for both chemicals and autos" shipped by rail, said Union Pacific's 
Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's another reason why California is key part of Santa Fe's attraction. 
Plans are moving ahead for the "Alameda Corridor," a proposed construction 
project that will let railroads travel between Downtown Los Angeles and the 
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach at much higher speeds than are currently 
allowed, thus enabling the trains to handle substantially more shipments 
arriving at the ports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the ports are a major source for "intermodal" cargo, meaning 
cargo that's placed in containers that can be shipped by train and truck. And 
intermodal shipments, particularly for cargo coming from the Pacific Rim, are 
expected to keep growing sharply in the years ahead and are "the No. 1 target" 
in California for the railroads vying for Santa Fe, said Robert L. Banks, chief 
executive of R.L. Banks & Associates, a consultant in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could well be a year or more before the ICC approves either 
Burlington's or Union Pacific's offers. In the meantime, the railroads, the 
shippers, companies that rely on the rails to move their goods, state 
regulators and others will all tell the ICC which merger they prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission, for instance, hasn't yet taken 
sides. But PUC lawyer James Quinn said the agency, which regulates much of the 
railroads' activities in the state, will want this question answered about 
either takeover: "What does it do to competition?" On the Merger Track 
</P>
<P>
 The contest between Union Pacific Corp. and Burlington Northern Inc. to buy 
Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is part of a growing wave of railroad mergers, which the 
carriers hope will help them gain back some of the intercity freight market 
they've lost to the trucking industry.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; KINKO'S GAMBLES ON HIGH-TECH SERVICES; COMPANY 
SEEKS TO SHED IMAGE AS A PHOTOCOPYING SERVICE FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kinko's Service Corp., known for years as the photocopy place, has big plans 
for motoring on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based Kinko's has since the late 1980s been adding higher technology 
services -- the use of personal computers, sophisticated color copiers and fax 
machines -- to its staples of basic photocopying and passport photos. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the company launched its most sophisticated technology service yet 
when it installed video conferencing rooms in 100 of its 725 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step Kinko's foresees is giving customers the ability to communicate 
with its stores electronically. For example, it wants to be able to let a 
customer in Los Angeles use his or her office computer to ask a Kinko's in New 
York to make copies of documents to be distributed there. 
</P>
<P>
 With such services, Kinko's hopes it can move away from the image that's stuck 
with it since it was founded 24 years ago: that of a photocopy store catering 
primarily to college students. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kinko's still serves the college market, more than anything it wants to 
be known as the "branch office" for entrepreneurs, telecommuters, traveling 
business people and local representatives of corporations based elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It also wants to lure more consumers who will use Kinko's for personal tasks, 
such as creating custom party invitations. With the new services, however, 
Kinko's is taking some risks. Its strategy requires investing heavily in 
expensive technology -- just one color copier, for example, costs about 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "All technology takes a burn-in period," said Kinko's President Dan 
Frederickson. Kinko's expects to invest $20 million in its video conferencing 
venture and, he said, "The gamble is whether the timing is right or not." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Frederickson knows well that Kinko's has another problem: 
Many potential customers just don't seem to know about all the new services. 
"As long as we hear customers say, 'I didn't know you could do that,' we've got 
a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson plans to install video conferencing centers in more -- though not 
necessarily all -- Kinko's outlets. The service is set up in a conference room 
equipped with a large-screen television monitor with a camera on top and a 
device that resembles an oversized TV remote control. A video conference 
doesn't come cheap -- $150 per site, per hour -- but Frederickson calls it a 
bargain compared with the cost of air fare, hotel rooms and other travel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to business people, he said he believes families may use the 
service for video "reunions" and other special occasion meetings. The company 
is offering a half-price video conferencing holiday promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture partner on the Kinko's video conferencing project is U.S. 
Sprint, which provides the phone lines and a toll-free number to set up a 
conference. Randy Doyle, Kinko's product manager, said he's now looking into 
adding PCs to the system so participants in a conference can share and 
manipulate data and graphics during the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, local Kinko's stores that have the equipment installed have found it 
slow going. The manager at the Kinko's store in Ventura reported averaging six 
or seven video conferences a week; managers at the Encino and North Hills shops 
say they see only one or two a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is, people just don't know about it," said Kinko's Encino 
manager Robert Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's is the first in its industry to offer video conferencing, and Bob 
Hall, executive editor of Quick Printing magazine in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
questions whether many customers will want the technology. "Somebody would have 
to show me where they're going to make money at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Lowe, president of a Kinko's rival, Sir Speedy, a chain of 880 
quick-printing and copy centers, based in Laguna Hills, said that investing in 
technology is "a requirement today." Sir Speedy already offers electronic links 
to many of its customers, a service that is increasingly in demand because it's 
convenient and saves customers time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, however, said he decided to pass on video teleconferencing. He felt the 
technology was not yet sophisticated enough, and "by the time it is perfect, 
AT&T will have those units in every office in the country and most hotels will 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe and others suggest that Kinko's might do better to expand into offset 
printing -- which rivals such as PIP Printing and Sir Speedy offer -- because 
of growing corporate demand for quick-turnaround print jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten thousand envelopes and letters can be significant bread-and-butter" 
business, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick-printing industry has been undergoing a shakeout, but generally 
large chains like Kinko's are better positioned to survive and invest in the 
new services that customers want, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's already enjoys some clear advantages because of its size, said Hall, 
including the ability to cut favorable deals with equipment suppliers like 
Xerox and Canon. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps that about 100 stores are owned solely by Kinko's reclusive 
47-year-old founder and chairman, Paul Orfalea, and the rest are co-owned in 
partnerships by Orfalea and other investors. Orfalea, who declined to be 
interviewed, also owns Kinko's Financial Services, an internal financing unit. 
This common ownership gives the company a strength of management, Hall 
believes, that franchised networks have difficulty achieving. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kinko's may be hampered by its low profile, which reflects the low-key 
style of Orfalea. "They're going to have to get the word out," Hall said. "It's 
great to have all these capabilities, but they don't do any good unless your 
customers want them." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orfalea avoids the spotlight, Frederickson said the chairman is still 
very much involved with store operations, new products and strategy.

 Bank's Economic Forecast Due: First Interstate Bank's annual economic forecast 
about the performance of the California and U.S. economies will be released 
Tuesday.A recent upbeat economic report from the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project found that California is staging a faster-than-expected recovery, 
albeit an uneven one. However, that study predicted that structural changes in 
the economy will continue to roil the state's job market for several years. In 
another report, the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy predicted that the state could add 310,000 jobs a year by 
2005, a rate of growth that would outpace the nation's.

 September Jobless Figures Expected: Economy watchers should know Friday 
whether Orange County's jobless rate rose as summer ended or if the recovery 
economists have been talking about for months is really here.In six of the past 
10 years, the September unemployment rate has jumped from the August rate, 
including last year. It stayed the same once and fell three times, most 
recently in 1992. This year, the August rate was 5.9%, one of the lowest among 
the state's large counties.

 Cervical Cancer Screening Test: Upjohn Co. will begin distributing a new 
visual cervical cancer screening test Wednesday that was developed by Trylon 
Corp., a Torrance-based medical products company. The procedure, being marketed 
as Pap Plus Speculoscopy, is designed to be used in conjunction with the Pap 
smear laboratory test, which is used for early detection of cervical 
cancer.According to Trylon, its new procedure will provide immediate results in 
the doctor's office. It uses a blue-white light capsule, or Speculite, attached 
to a speculum to illuminate the cervical area, the company said. When the 
cervix is viewed under 4-6X magnification, abnormal areas show up as white 
while normal tissue remains dark, Trylon said. The company said the procedure, 
developed in 1986, has been tested on 10,000 women in four countries. 
Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn acquired primary distribution rights from Trylon.

 Parretti Seeks Court Deal to Return to U.S.: Italian financier Giancarlo 
Parretti wants a Delaware court to grant him bail when the former MGM owner 
returns to stand trial on charges of tampering with evidence in a 1992 court 
case. Parretti must resolve the Delaware case to pursue his own fraud suit 
against Credit Lyonnais, the French bank that bought MGM for $500 million after 
Parretti fled to Europe to avoid a Delaware arrest warrant. Parretti still 
hopes to reclaim control of the history-rich film company.

STING OPERATION BREAKS UP CELLULAR-PHONE FRAUD RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM S. BAUMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Relying on an impromptu sting operation, Glendale police have broken up what 
allegedly was one of the largest and most active cellular-phone fraud rings in 
Southern California, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting the owner of a Los Angeles cellular phone store Friday 
afternoon, police took control of the business' operations -- nabbing customers 
as they came in either to purchase illegal phones or bring phones back to be 
reprogrammed, according to sources familiar with the operation.In addition to a 
number of arrests, more than 50 reprogrammed cellular phones were seized and 
thousands of dollars in specialized computer and cellular equipment 
confiscated, said Steve Crosby, director of external affairs for L.A. Cellular, 
one of the main providers of cellular telephone service in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ring allegedly "cloned" cellular phones, a process in which the 
phone is illegally altered so that calling charges end up on the bills of 
legitimate subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Lt. Ray Edey acknowledged the operation but declined to 
comment further in advance of a news conference scheduled for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Cellular officials say "clone shops" set themselves up as mini telephone 
companies, charging $60 to $100 a month for illegal cellular phone service. 
When the illegal calls are discovered, the phone is deactivated. Customers then 
must return to the store and have the phone reprogrammed to enable the illegal 
phone service to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say cellular-phone fraud has reached epidemic 
proportions in Southern California, the nation's largest mobile-phone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of cellular phone companies said some electronic countermeasures 
being put in service are only now beginning to stem the tide of phone cloning. 
Several such measures are not yet fully operational.

LAW FIRMS LEAVE WESTSIDE AS THEY CUT BACK; REAL ESTATE: OPERATIONS ARE BEING 
CONSOLIDATED IN DOWNTOWN HIGH-RISES, WHERE RENTS ARE A BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Unlike blue jeans, office space is not designed to shrink to fit -- a fact 
painfully clear to many Southern California law firms, which make up a 
significant chunk of the area's top-dollar tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of firms, having too much office space is only the beginning of 
the problem. The rest is that today, sub-lease rates for their excess space in 
Downtown Los Angeles office buildings are at rock-bottom, compared to 
peak-market prices they are paying on leases dating back to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 And the costs of excess real estate becomes magnified as firms, despite some 
upturn recently in business, strive to operate in a new environment of 
much-lower margins and fee-savvy clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the way things are going, law firms just can't operate as loosely as 
they once did," said one law firm consultant. "They've got to be more careful, 
and if they can save money here and there, they've got to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which dropped in size from about 700 to 620 attorneys 
over the course of the recession, said last week that it is considering closing 
down its Century City office next year. The 75 attorneys and their support 
staffs now in the Century Plaza Towers would be moved Downtown, where the 
state's biggest law firm occupies 10 floors in the Wells Fargo Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another firm, Sidley & Austin, recently closed its Century City office, 
consolidating its staffs Downtown; Cleveland-based Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue 
also closed its Westside offices this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms that were experiencing unlimited growth during the boom years of the 
mid- to late-1980s -- and expected it to continue indefinitely -- locked 
themselves into leases with what today are very high rates. The deals also 
called for the firms to take on even more space over the terms of the leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many of these firms have slimmed down and -- like dieters stuck 
with big-waisted trousers -- faced difficult alterations. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gibson, Dunn's lease on its Century City office space does not expire 
for another eight years, the outlook for subletting that space is better than 
for its excess space Downtown. In Century City, where the best offices command 
a premium, vacancy rates are at 15%, according to the CB Commercial real estate 
firm. Downtown, vacancy rates are pegged at 24%, twice what experts consider as 
optimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably could sublease their space on the Westside at higher rates than 
Downtown," said Cathy Schloessman, senior vice president for CB Commercial's 
western division. "Another important consideration is that it's cheaper to have 
one office than two, because of efficiencies of scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for office space Downtown have dropped as low as $9 per square foot, 
with an average of $13 to $16, Schloessman said. Some of the law firms are 
paying as much as $30 to $35 for each of the tens of thousands of square feet 
they occupy Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 While other major firms that have offices both Downtown and on the Westside -- 
including Loeb & Loeb and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker -- in the past have 
discussed consolidating Downtown, none say they now are considering it. For 
firms that have significant entertainment law practices, a Westside office is 
pretty much a necessity, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "every firm is looking at its operating expenses with a magnifying glass," 
said Steven Bay, a senior vice president with the commercial real estate firm 
Julien J. Studley Inc. Office costs account for 7% to 10% of the average firm's 
budget, and those with too much space are working to fill it -- most often 
through subletting to other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many firms have renegotiated their leases -- or tried to -- in the past 
couple of years to get lower rates, said Schloessman. And while more firms 
would like to do so, landlords are reluctant to give up the high lease rates.

 Companies to Scale Back on Hiring New Graduates: Japanese companies will hire 
16% fewer new college graduates this year than last year, according to a survey 
published in the financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.In the hard-hit 
manufacturing sector, 23.1% fewer jobs will be available to new graduates, said 
the paper, Japan's leading financial daily. Japanese manufacturers are moving 
production overseas as the strong yen erodes profits. The yen has risen 13% in 
value against the dollar this year. Non-manufacturing jobs will decrease by 
8.5%, the survey found.

 Country Acknowledges Double-Digit Inflation: Vietnam said it will fail to keep 
inflation in single figures this year."To keep the inflation index just a 
little bit over 10%, it will be necessary to apply some drastic measures," said 
Nguyen Ngoc Tuan, vice chairman of the government's pricing commission. These 
will include, he said, strict management of production, imports and exports; 
concentrating on projects that can be finished quickly; checking state spending 
on capital construction; increasing tax revenue, and regulating rice exports. 
Inflation in Vietnam through September was 9.8%.

 Canadians Tap Into Chinese Beer Industry: Noble China Inc. plans to buy a 60% 
stake in a regional Chinese brewery, a move that would make the company one of 
the largest beer producers in China.The purchase is the third brewery acquired 
by Toronto-based Noble China, which hopes to join China's rapidly expanding 
beer market. China's beer sales have been gaining 20% a year, and the country 
already is the world's second-largest beer producer, outranked only by the 
United States. At the same time, China's consumption remains a fraction of that 
of other Asian countries.

 Vietnamese government and business leaders visiting Southern California last 
week had a delicate task: Without calling too much attention to themselves, 
they needed to get the word out that the communist nation -- now taking tiny 
steps toward applying free-market principles to its economy -- is eager to do 
business with Southern California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 With antipathy toward the Hanoi government still strong among Southern 
California Vietnamese immigrants, the seven members of delegation -- who were 
making their first trip to the United States -- feared being met with angry 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County city of Westminster, for example, has been the scene of 
several demonstrations against the United States' February decision to lift its 
long-standing economic embargo against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 After tiptoeing quietly through a crowded schedule of meetings with eager 
California business owners, the delegation departed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-day trip served its purpose of establishing relationships and 
developing leads on further business negotiations, delegation leader Ngo Thi 
Chi Thanh, manager of the foreign trade section of the Hanoi People's Committee 
(the city's ruling governmental body), said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, she declined interviews for herself and other delegation 
members. The delegation also had its first public appearance on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome all foreigners to invest in Vietnam to improve our economic 
situation," she said. "It is a good chance for Vietnam to encourage relations 
with both countries and to move both countries closer and closer toward opening 
a new chapter of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vietnam has received some $8.8 billion in foreign investment since 
economic reforms began in 1988, the country still needs investment in basic 
infrastructure, the Vietnamese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of even the largest cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are 
still drinking dirty water, they said. Vietnam needs American investment to 
help build water purification and drainage control systems, the development of 
telecommunications and transportation and to develop its natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam can meet its development goals faster with America's help, Ngo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam also welcomes many other types of business investment, the delegation 
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim of the trip is to research the market and to make acquaintances with 
the people," Ngo said. "Businessmen in America are eager to do business in 
Vietnam because for America, Vietnam is a huge new market." 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of 73 million, a number that rivals that of Mexico, Vietnam 
offers American companies tremendous potential for new markets in an economy 
that has been growing at a rate of 7% to 8% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese delegates highlighted the government's economic reforms, saying 
that Vietnam has an open-door policy for any business interested in setting up 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Vietnam experts have expressed skepticism about the degree that foreign 
investors can operate successfully in the still tightly controlled country, but 
many Americans eager to do business in Vietnam have been less concerned about 
the risks, said the owner of a Santa Ana-based trade, development and finance 
corporation that assists Americans interested in investing in developing 
countries. He met with the Vietnamese delegation but did not want to be 
identified for fear that his business would be subject to boycotts and 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam "now has diplomatic relations but not many people have taken advantage 
of that," the Santa Ana business owner said. "There are good opportunities for 
growth and business there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese delegates outlined a flexible process for American companies to 
begin looking at Vietnam for opportunities. Interested businesses should 
contact either the American Chambers of Commerce in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, 
the Vietnamese Department of Foreign and Economic Relations, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs or a Vietnamese company they might be interested in pairing up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The door is open," said Pham Ngoc Phi, the managing director of Union of 
Export and Import Company, which specializes in the distribution of textiles 
and agricultural products. "The companies now need to move in."

 Government Considers Strict Price Controls: In what would be a further retreat 
from market reforms, the government is considering strict price controls to 
curb runaway inflation rate, the official China Daily reported.Beijing may take 
the action to bring down food prices that rose as this summer's grain output 
fell 4.6 million tons, the paper said, citing Agriculture Ministry sources. 
Agriculture analysts said such controls would be instituted at the expense of 
"possibly aggravating grain production" next year, the paper reported. Food 
accounts for 52% of the consumer price index used to track China's inflation 
rate.

 Mitsubishi Bank to Acquire Nippon Trust Stake: Mitsubishi Bank will invest 
nearly $2 billion to acquire a controlling stake in financially troubled Nippon 
Trust Bank, the two banks announced.The takeover is the biggest banking 
industry rescue since the collapse of Japanese real estate and stock prices a 
few years ago, which left many banks holding huge sums in bad loans. The deal 
gives Nippon Trust a badly needed cash injection that will help it write off 
problem loans. Japanese regulations normally bar commercial banks like 
Mitsubishi from certain trust bank functions, such as pension fund management, 
so a benefit to Mitsubishi Bank from the acquisition is the opportunity to 
expand into these areas through Nippon Trust.
