SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 'ASIANS ARE AUTOMATICALLY LABELED 
GANG MEMBERS'; CRITICS SAY CULTURAL BIAS FIGURES INTO THE CASE AGAINST A 
VIETNAMESE STUDENT. PROPOSITIONS 187 AND 184 COULD EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL C. TSANG, Daniel C. Tsang, a social sciences lecturer at UC Irvine, 
co-founded the Alliance Working for Asian Rights and Empowerment in Orange 
County. He also hosts Subversity, a weekly interview show, on KUCI, 88.9 FM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bobbing shaved heads in a sea of orange, for one fleeting moment, brought 
me back to Southeast Asia, reminding me of Buddhist monks going about their 
routine in their saffron robes. But reality struck: I am in the waiting room at 
Orange County Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 I am here to see Tu Anh Tran, 22, who legally immigrated from Vietnam in 1988. 
He is charged him with murder, attempted murder and robbery. His public 
defender, Jeff Lund, says Tu is a victim of being in the "wrong place at the 
wrong time." Tu says tattoos and cigarette burns on his arm and hand, inflicted 
years ago as a memorial to his dead mother, have caused police to label him a 
gangbanger. Others, including Li Ren Fong, Tu's math instructor at Rancho 
Santiago College and his mentor, firmly believe police are mistaken. Lund 
believes that without the gang assumption, Tu, who was shot in the back during 
the incident, would not have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 2, Tu was a student at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. It was 
spring break. Tu and a friend ate at a Little Saigon restaurant in Westminster. 
As Tu was paying the bill, a fight broke out, he says. As Tu tried to break up 
the fight, he says, an off-duty security guard shot and killed his friend, and 
wounded Tu. The next thing Tu knew, he was taken from the hospital to jail.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has no prior convictions, Tu faces a possible life sentence if 
convicted. The man who did the shooting is free, claiming self-defense, that he 
was attacked by a group of people in the crowded cafe.  
</P>
<P>
 Tu believes his predicament is due to cultural misinterpretation of his 
tattoos and cigarette burns. Tu has a tattoo of an eagle on his arm and the 
words, in Vietnamese, "bird without its flock." He says it speaks to his 
loneliness after his mother's death when he was 17 and living in Iowa. 
According to Tu, the police told him the tattoo is proof he is in a Chinese 
gang, even though he is Vietnamese.  
</P>
<P>
 Tu says the faded burns on his hands were also to show his pain at his 
mother's passing. Dr. Hoang Van Duc, who teaches pathology at USC, says Tu's 
actions may have been an adaptation of old Vietnamese religious tradition -- 
when monks are initiated into Buddhism, their skulls are seared with burning 
incense to prove they can handle pain through meditation. But the 1993 
Southeast Asian Gangs manual from the California Commission on Peace Officer 
Standards and Training states that cigarette burn marks are "without a doubt" 
the "most common form of marking found on Asian gang members."  
</P>
<P>
 John Song, an associate professor of criminal justice at Buffalo State who 
wrote his dissertation on the conflict between law enforcement and Southern 
Californians of Vietnamese and Chinese descent, disputes that view. Police are 
incorrectly generalizing from a small sample of arrestees with body markings, 
says Song. He believes that such flawed gang profiles perpetuate stereotypes of 
Asians as criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the Orange County Asian American community fear that too many youths 
are automatically labeled gang members, based on little evidence. They note 
that even though the 1990 census put Westminster's population at less than 23% 
Asian Pacific, 72% of those stopped by police as part of the Tri-Agency 
Resource Gang Enforcement Team program crackdown on gangs have been Asian, 
according to the program's 1993 year-end report.  
</P>
<P>
 Tu's fate will be decided at his trial in Santa Ana Superior Court, scheduled 
to begin this week. But his case raises questions about the future of recent 
immigrants. Passage of Proposition 187 and "three-strikes" Proposition 184 will 
exacerbate an already bad situation in which immigrants are singled out for 
discriminatory treatment, further dividing our society. If so, we are 
condemning them -- especially our youth -- to bui doi, or "a life like dust."

SUPER-HERO IMPERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My passion is comic books. When I looked in your Dec. 5 edition I saw the 
Youth Opinion feature about comic books ("Comic Super-Heroes: 'Batman Has to 
Use His Brains More").I was thrilled. Not only was the feature about comic 
books, but it portrayed them in a positive light. I was ecstatic as I 
discovered that you took the word of a 13-year-old seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I went on, I read the quote. My instant reaction was, "Who in the world 
is Vealot? " I saw underneath there was a section about WildC.A.T.s, one of my 
favorite books. I knew then that you meant Zealot and that Vealot was a typo. 
</P>
<P>
 I read the article and discovered that you used Vealot three times! And 
WildC.A.T.s was spelled wrong! I was upset! 
</P>
<P>
 If you produced a book you dedicated your life to, you would hope that a major 
newspaper with your quality would at least get the title and the characters' 
names right! 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage you to have more articles about comic books, maybe in your Life & 
Style section. Who knows, maybe in four years I'll be working under you in your 
comic book section. (Just a thought and wishful thinking!)

 Evans is an elderly man who treasures his privacy and quiet. To his dismay, 
the house next door has just been purchased by the Vargas family, who he 
considers too big and too friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, Evans is beside himself over the commotion going on next door. A 
large group has gathered in the Vargas' back yard, laughing and singing. 
Suddenly, a small hard object comes hurling through the air, slamming against 
Evans' kitchen window. Livid, Evans confronts his neighbors. What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The Vargas family was observing Las Posadas as they had in Mexico. This 
ritual, celebrated for nine days before Christmas, musically and dramatically 
re-enacts the story of Mary and Joseph searching for lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vargas family was offering shelter to Mary and Joseph and food to all the 
pilgrims accompanying them. They served posole (pork and hominy stew), tamales 
and bunuelos (cinnamon-flavored cookies). High spirits reigned until a hard 
candy from a pinata flew out, connected with Evans' window and stirred his 
wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vargas family explained the Posadas tradition to Evans, but he only 
reluctantly accepted their apology. Sorrowfully they realized that not all 
traditions can simply be transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: When entertaining large groups, alert neighbors beforehand, explain the 
occasion and note any cultural significance. If possible, include them in the 
festivities.

WORDS AND RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I believe that Professor Kwaku Person-Lynn (Voices, Nov. 28, "Language Keeps 
Racism Alive") had something of value to say. However, his manipulation of word 
definitions was truly outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, word processor programs do not provide extensive word 
definitions with the many variable meanings that exist in the English language. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, when I turned to my dictionary (The Concise Oxford English 
Dictionary) to see how it defined ethnic I was given the following: 
</P>
<P>
 1. a. (of a social group) having a common national or cultural tradition, b. 
(of clothes, etc.) resembling those of a non-European exotic people 
</P>
<P>
 2. denoting origin by birth or descent rather than by nationality (ethnic 
Turks) 
</P>
<P>
 3. relating to race or culture (ethnic group; ethnic origins) 
</P>
<P>
 4 (archaic) pagan, heathen 
</P>
<P>
 In order to control our language we have to be aware of its origins. It is 
imperative that we know ethnic once meant a heathen person so we can ensure 
that it never happen again. Person-Lynn is just as guilty with his manipulation 
of word meanings to validate his argument as those who use language to demean 
and control others.

COUNTY WATCH; EYE THAT SEES ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The televising of meetings of elected officials has opened a special window 
for the public, one free of editing. Now, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, at the urging of member Zev Yaroslavsky, joins the club.That's 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 However, we warn that the camera can be cruel. For example, in 1991 a 
Huntington Beach mayor, receiving a delegation of Japanese visitors, muttered 
unbelievably xenophobic remarks that were picked up by a live microphone and 
sent out over the airwaves. The delegation was there to give the city a check 
for $93,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For the intrepid viewer, there's no shortage of outrage. The televising of 
Thousand Oaks City Council meetings, for example, led some political contenders 
to run on an "anti-bickering" platform. 
</P>
<P>
 And personal appearance counts. A Newbury Park viewer applauded a city 
official for shaving his mustache, saying his encounter with a razor made it 
easier to read his lips.  
</P>
<P>
 Camera angles are very important, as a freshman Maryland legislator learned. 
He was told, to his horror, that the viewing audience had just caught him 
picking his nose during a poignant speech by a constituent. He spent much of 
the rest of the evening holding his nose, as if it was his characteristic pose. 
</P>
<P>
 With the TV camera present, enunciation bloopers have a wide audience. In one 
meeting, an East Coast school board member repeatedly referred to some fellow 
named Louie. It was later determined that he had been mangling the phrase "in 
lieu of." 
</P>
<P>
 Now you understand our respect for the courage of the county supervisors.

A TALL WALL FOR THE DEFICIT CUTTERS; HOUSE REPUBLICANS BACK DUBIOUS TAX-VOTE 
RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Republican majority that will take control of the House of Representatives 
next month has big plans for changing the way some things are done, and for the 
most part its ideas can be warmly welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 After 42 straight years of Democratic control some House-cleaning clearly is 
in order. Like every other institution that has been largely immune from 
pressures for change, the House has come to suffer from bloat, rigidity and a 
large measure of arrogant self-protectiveness. The Republicans say they want a 
leaner, more open forum. A lot of Democrats seem ready to support that aim. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Republican plan three of the lesser committees and 25 subcommittees 
are to be abolished, certainly at no great harm to the nation's well-being. 
That will help cut the House staff payroll by a full one-third, down to about 
1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the special-interest caucuses are going to lose their funding 
and official recognition. That won't and shouldn't prevent members who share 
interests from colloguing, but it will make at least a small dent in the House 
budget.  
</P>
<P>
 A TRUER 'RECORD': In the openness-is-the-best-policy category, closed-door 
committee hearings are to be banned except where national security or sensitive 
personnel matters are involved. All voting will have to be done in person, 
instead of using proxies as is now permitted. And the Congressional Record, the 
daily account of House proceedings, is actually supposed to begin reporting 
what's said in debate as it was said. There's to be no more late-night 
rewriting to make a member appear more eloquent, witty or wise. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. Where the Republican reform agenda comes a cropper is in its 
proposal to require a three-fifths vote rather than a simple majority on any 
legislation that would increase personal or corporate income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60% requirement assures a minority veto over tax increases. Such increases 
are of course never popular. But neither are deficits, and it would be foolish 
in the extreme for the House to make it even more difficult to raise revenues 
in the future to deal with the deficit problem. 
</P>
<P>
 BALANCING ACT: A key part of the House Republicans' "Contract With America" 
is, after all, a constitutional amendment to require that the federal budget be 
balanced. How? Bringing revenues into line with expenditures can't be 
accomplished simply by slashing expenditures, especially since the Republicans 
have already ruled out any tinkering with Social Security. Further, the GOP 
favors various measures -- a reduced tax on capital gains, a $500-per-child tax 
credit -- that would shave revenues even more. If a three-fifths vote is needed 
to raise taxes, should a three-fifths vote be required to lower them as well? 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans had better rethink their three-fifths plan. The contradiction 
between virtually ruling out new taxes while still posturing about balancing 
the budget is glaring. The Republicans have some useful and welcome ideas for 
reforming House rules. But the 60% tax vote requirement isn't one of them.

WHITE MALE VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * How kind of Milton Viorst and Ellen Goodman (Commentary, Dec. 2) to help us 
understand why white males voted Republican in greater numbers this past 
November. Before reading their pontifications, I had not realized that I was 
anxious nearly to the point of breakdown because my wife's salary is equal to 
mine (Goodman), or that I was feeling vulnerable, insecure, alone and 
frightened (Viorst). I had been laboring under the misapprehension that I 
merely resented being a member of the only group that is openly condescended to 
as inferior today, and all because of my anatomy and the color of my skin. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know I was wrong to protest when someone tells me that my voting 
pattern indicates I'm a "madman," or that I'm frustrated with my political 
"plight" because now I have to do the dishes. Honest, I thought Martin Luther 
King Jr. was right when he said the condition of a person's soul is more 
important than the color of one's skin, so I was a little irked when people 
denigrated my motives because of things like the color of my skin. Are Goodman 
and Viorst sure it's anxiety I'm acting on? Because it certainly feels more 
like disgust. With them and their type. 
</P>

 * Neither Viorst nor Goodman appears to have any understanding of the 60% of 
the white male voters who cast their ballots for Republicans. Simply put, the 
white male is historically a dreamer. He has never felt comfortable accepting 
the status quo because that would indicate that things are the way they should 
be and are as good as they are going to get. This is what has made him among 
all the peoples of the world the most gifted inventor and innovator, the most 
daring explorer and discoverer, and not to be overlooked in his anti-status quo 
makeup is his willingness to go to war to force change. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, like it or not, the person that built, shaped and led America through 
its first two centuries and into the start of its third.

<P>
 * As a white male voter I would like to turn my depraved mind over to the 
revered political observer and sometime-psychologist Viorst. It seems as though 
I am "alone and frightened" and I am desperately searching for a "sense of 
self," which has been destroyed by the "women's movement -- and perhaps the 
black and gay movements." This can be unequivocally observed by the bizarre 
voting patterns which resulted in a Republican landslide. Liberal voters 
indicate hope, optimism and a strong sense of self. Republican votes, on the 
other hand, reveal possible pathologies among the body politic (i.e., anger, 
fear, diminished sense of self-worth). While out in the field of research, 
Viorst managed to capture a "white male taxi driver" who expressed his 
animal-like anger toward Hillary Clinton. Luckily, Viorst managed to escape 
unharmed.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Viorst, I voted Republican. My fragile male ego just couldn't take the 
abuse anymore. I am no longer allowed to enslave people of color, go out for 
some Saturday night gay-bashing or enjoy the occasional date-rape. Under such 
threatening circumstances I voted for Republicans, who promise to bring back 
the good old days of white male hegemony. The egregious failure of 40 years of 
liberal policies did not manage to enter my small, fear-ridden brain.

SINGAPORE FREE SPEECH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "I Wrote the Truth; Now I'm a Fugitive From Injustice," Commentary, Nov. 
30: 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Lingle has been served with a summons from the attorney general to 
appear before the High Court in Singapore to answer charges for contempt of 
court. This is not because he has criticized the Singapore government. Nor is 
the issue about press freedom or freedom of speech and expression. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article in the International Herald Tribune of Oct. 7, Lingle claimed 
the "intolerant regimes in the region" had relied upon a "compliant judiciary" 
to bankrupt opposition politicians. As in many other countries, Singapore law 
on contempt of court covers situations where one alleges that the courts do not 
decide other than on the merits of the cases. Lingle makes a great deal of the 
fact that he did not name any country. Whether this is a good defense depends 
on the law. The prosecution is precisely to determine whether Lingle's 
assertion about a "compliant judiciary" constitutes contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the duty of the attorney general to uphold the integrity of the 
judiciary, which is a key institution in Singapore. If he believes an offense 
may have been committed, he is duty-bound to order investigations and, if the 
evidence warrants it, to institute prosecution. How does such action constitute 
"using the full force of its government institutions to intimidate those who 
would speak freely"? Lingle's case is simply a matter of the law taking its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore has not "belittle(d) the liberalizations of the continuing evolution 
of the democratic system" of any country. Neither do we have any interest in 
"poising" ourselves "to serve as the region's model for development." However, 
how Singapore should manage its own government, society and economy is surely a 
matter for only Singaporeans themselves to decide.

BOSNIA CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * When Yugoslavia was created after World War I, it was created of three 
ethnic groups: Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Now that the West has decided to 
destroy Yugoslavia, it doesn't seem enough to dissolve it among the groups that 
created it, for Serbs would be too "big" for the West, so not only is Croatia 
granted the Serb lands of Dalmatia and Slavonia, but ethnic groups that have 
never before existed are recognized by the West (Bosnians, Muslims and 
Macedonians). 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Dole's plan to lift the embargo and bomb the Serbs (Dec. 5) begs only 
one question: What if the Russians say no to his plan? President Clinton's 
support of the Muslims and the current borders of Bosnia is encouraging the 
Muslims in further warfare.

 * The Clinton Administration cave-in to Serbia to please our "allies" is an 
abomination. While communism was collapsing all over Europe, President Bush 
encouraged communist Yugoslavia's Milosevic to hold Yugoslavia together, 
resulting in Serbia's war of aggression in Slovenia, Croatia and finally 
Bosnia. These republics chose democracy in free elections and wished to 
separate from Serbia and its domination. Bush asked the U.N. to impose the arms 
embargo on the victims of Serb aggression, knowing that Serbia was in 
possession of all the arms of former Yugoslavia. Now our government and its 
allies have the audacity to say that the Serbs have won the war -- because they 
are stronger.

KIDS AND COMPUTERS: POWER UP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent conference on children and computers raised issues that should 
concern every responsible official, educator and parent. For if one thing is 
clear about the information superhighway -- and little else is clear -- it is 
that the computer revolution isn't going to go away. Neither, of course, is 
society's solemn obligation to educate its children as best it possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Children and the Information Superhighway," the conference was 
co-sponsored by the advocate organization Children Now and the UCLA Center for 
Communication Policy. Foremost among the conferees' concerns was the question 
of equity: Will the children of parents who cannot afford the new technology be 
denied an on-ramp to the information highway? And how about schools that do not 
have the wherewithal to link up to the Internet (the so-called information 
highway), much less purchase the technology? Would it not be better, as the 
Children's Partnership puts it, "if children in a low-income neighborhood with 
precious few library books could use a modem-equipped computer and access all 
the resources of the Library of Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
 The good ideas -- and the worries -- don't stop there. One estimate of the 
cost to wire up all of America's public schools and libraries by the year 2000 
is $28 billion. Actually, that's doable -- indeed, aggressive public policy 
could achieve a lot of the public-domain internetting by requiring concessions 
from the private sector in return for regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The much harder question is this: Even if every single classroom and library 
were plugged into the information highway, would students be better off? The 
amazing computer revolution has not fully answered the content question. 
</P>
<P>
 The profitable lines of entertainment software typically still are far more 
sophisticated and engaging than educational software. In the market-driven 
world of software development, companies usually are involved only to the 
degree they can profit -- not an ignoble goal but not the only possible goal 
for America. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the situation, it must be asked: What, realistically, is the future of 
educational software? What if almost everyone had a computer but much of what 
kids could run on it was little more than sophisticated junk?

HOMELESS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Homeless Camp Weighed in Industrial Area," Oct. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 Both the public and other Times' reporters have been misinformed about a 
planned downtown drop-in center that is part of a $20-million homeless 
initiative grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The 
article noted that "the Riordan Administration has launched a plan to shuttle 
homeless people to an urban campground on a fenced lot in the city's core 
industrial area . . . where up to 800 people could take showers and sleep on a 
lawn."We would like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed drop-in center did not originate in the mayor's office. It 
originated in a joint committee of the City of Los Angeles Homeless Steering 
Committee and the County of Los Angeles Coordinating Council for the Homeless. 
It is designed to be voluntarily accessed. It will include approximately 50 
beds for those who want an alternative to sleeping on the streets and will be 
able to provide an average of 200 persons per day with showers, toilets, 
laundry facilities, storage areas, an opportunity to rest or sleep, and access 
to information and services without the usual program requirements. Providers 
and advocates should remain vigilant to ensure that the drop-in center's 
services are voluntary and that it does not become another "urban campground."

LANGUAGE AND RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * " 'Language Keeps Racism Alive' " (Voices, Nov. 28) is enough to make one 
weep. How can a college professor be so completely bereft of common sense? A 
dictionary is a reflection of language usage, not a guide to morality. It's 
people that use, misuse and change the meanings of words. 
</P>
<P>
 To Prof. Kwaku Person-Lynn's "amazement," black can be defined as " 
'forbidding, menacing, threatening, evil, wicked' and more. This could explain 
why many people may have negative attitudes toward black people." Oh, please. 
Is the Aryan Nation going to appeal on the grounds that "the dictionary made us 
do it"? 
</P>
<P>
 To blame the dictionary is to blame the messenger. But the professor doesn't 
stop there. "Our scrutiny must be constant," he says. Are we going to censor 
dictionaries? Was my back turned when Sen. Jesse Helms changed his name to 
Kwaku Person-Lynn? 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES G. BRAGG JR. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Palisades 
</P>
<P>
 * One could, if he chose to do so, leaf through dictionaries and compile a far 
longer list than Person-Lynn's of words for which archaic and demeaning 
synonyms are given. Of the synonyms offered for "ethnic," for instance, the 
professor has been careful to omit any that convey its generally accepted 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 This old, white man has never learned, was never taught, "from his cradle to 
his (near) grave" to use or to read the word "ethnic" to mean "heathen," 
"uncivilized" or "irreligious," its Greek root notwithstanding. Nor was he 
offended to learn that a Chinese synonym for "foreigner" is "barbarian." This 
old man is himself part of an "ethnic" group, however ill-defined that group 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Dictionaries, like the Christian Bible, are often put to uses obtuse and 
unworthy. Each of us has sorrow and grievance enough without manufacturing 
more. Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty said that words meant what he said they 
meant. No dictionary can correct that way of thinking.

ELDERS IS SUBSCRIBER TO NEWT AGE VALUES; POLITICS: THE FIRED SURGEON GENERAL 
HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH INCOMING HOUSE SPEAKER GINGRICH THAN ANYONE REALIZES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT S. MCELVAINE, Robert S. McElvaine is a history professor at Millsaps 
College in Jackson, Miss. His latest book will be published next year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The basic reason why so many people called for the political head of Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders -- and why President Clinton gave it to them on Friday 
-- is that she has repeatedly held positions diametrically opposed to what her 
critics believe to be traditional values. What raised alarms was not so much 
her outspoken championing of sex education, but her view that there is nothing 
inherently wrong with promiscuity, even among those in their early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem Elders sees with indiscriminate intercourse is that it can 
result in unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. Hence her 
advocacy of condom distribution, even in grade schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders is also on record saying that serious consideration should be given to 
the legalization of hard drugs. Her latest statement about masturbation being 
natural and safe, and that "perhaps" these facts should be taught in schools, 
was actually less objectionable than many of her earlier comments. Given 
Clinton's current political situation, however, it was too much for him to 
take, and he finally fired her. 
</P>
<P>
 It is probably the opinion of many Americans that Joycelyn Elders has no 
values -- and certainly no traditional values. But in fact, many of her values 
are similar in an important way to those of conservative Republicans. As part 
of a book project, I have in recent years solicited the views on traditional 
values of a large number of people from a wide variety of backgrounds. What 
Elders had to say on the subject in 1989, when she was still the relatively 
obscure director of the Arkansas Department of Health, is of great interest at 
this point, since she has been sacked and there is a party coming to power in 
Congress that claims to be the defenders of traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what she believes to be the most important of traditional American 
values, Elders responded: "I think the right of self-determination ranks high 
among our values. I think the right to self-determination includes the concepts 
of determining one's own solutions and protection of individual freedoms." What 
in this statement would not be applauded by the new Republican leadership? 
</P>
<P>
 Elders went on to tell me that "the value placed on self-determination has 
benefited us as a society through promoting upward mobility." She expressed 
concern that "policies supporting upward mobility and self-determination have 
been eroding in recent times." Nothing there that would raise eyebrows in the 
Republican caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Joycelyn Elders and Newt Gingrich have more in common than either realizes. 
One trait that they obviously share is an inability to avoid saying outrageous 
and embarrassing things. But the similarities between the outgoing surgeon 
general and the incoming speaker of the House go beyond their loose lips. Both 
border on a libertarian philosophy, although they apply it inconsistently and 
to different realms. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders favors limitless freedom in personal behavior; Gingrich favors 
limitless freedom in economic behavior. (Gingrich seems to want freedom for 
everyone except Republicans in the House. He wants them to unquestioningly 
follow him on all matters.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich wants to "unleash free enterprise" but restrict personal freedom. 
Elders would do the opposite. Both fail to understand that extreme freedom is 
seamless. Encouraging economic self-indulgence (greed) is bound to encourage 
behavioral self-indulgence (such as promiscuity). Gingrich is an advocate of a 
"counting culture" that expresses its values in numbers preceded by a dollar 
sign and is not far removed from the "counterculture" that he denounces because 
it centers wholly on the self. 
</P>
<P>
 In more ways than either would admit, Elders and Gingrich are dipping from the 
same well -- that of unlimited individual freedom. It is not much of a stretch 
to say that Elders is an unconscious subscriber to Newt Age values. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has often attacked Elders for what he has termed her "outspoken 
views." His comment on her dismissal was: "It's good for the country and good 
for the President that she's departed." The arrival of Newt Gingrich in a 
position from which he can do far more damage than Joycelyn Elders ever could 
from the one she is simultaneously leaving is not likely to be good for the 
country, although it may prove to be good for the President.

OUT WITH THE OLD IN MEXICO AND BRAZIL; REFORM: LATIN AMERICA'S LARGEST NATIONS 
SEEM SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING TIES WITH THE PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABRAHAM F. LOWENTHAL, Abraham F. Lowenthal, director of the Center for 
International Studies at USC, was the founding director of the Inter-American 
Dialogue and serves on its board. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most important news in the Americas this month is not from the Miami 
summit but in Latin America itself. Historic changes are occurring, especially 
in Brazil and Mexico, the region's largest nations. 
</P>
<P>
 From both countries there is evidence that steps will finally be taken to 
address key problems that have worsened in recent years: social and equity 
issues and problems of governance, justice and accountability. For while Latin 
American economies have moved from authoritarian rule toward democratic 
politics, they have also been plagued by rampant corruption, violence, 
manipulation and disenchantment with democratic institutions. And although 
Latin America's major economies have stabilized and begun to grow, most have 
also become even more unjust, with poverty deepening while the wealthy get 
richer on the basis of free-market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most exciting breakthrough is occurring in Brazil, a country with 
a population and an economy as large as Russia's. After 10 years of disastrous 
political false starts and hyper-inflation, Brazil has in the past six months 
reduced inflation to less than 3% a month and held exemplary national elections 
in which some 98 million Brazilians participated. The successful architect of 
the anti-inflation plan, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, won a decisive mandate by 
capturing 54% of the vote in an eight-candidate race. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, a sociologist whose writings are known by every student of Latin 
American affairs, was exiled by Brazil's military regime in the 1960s and 
entered political life in the first legislative elections allowed by the 
military in 1978. Since then, he has served with distinction in both houses of 
the legislature and as foreign and finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 With demonstrated talent at coalition building, Cardoso promises to focus 
first on consolidating the victory over inflation by assuring fiscal balance, 
reforming the social security system, and privatizing public enterprises; to 
promote political reforms to make government more accountable and effective; 
and to increase strategic investments in education, infrastructure and social 
services. For the first time since the military coup of 1964, Brazil seems 
poised to realize its enormous potential. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar sense of historic opportunity can be felt in Mexico, where President 
Ernesto Zedillo stunned the country with the content and tone of his strong 
inaugural address. Abandoning the usual technocratic recitation of economic 
indicators, Zedillo spoke forcefully on the issues that thoughtful Mexicans are 
most concerned about: achieving the rule of law and equal justice, fighting 
corruption and curbing political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 While signaling continuity of the Salinas regime's economic policies by naming 
members of the outgoing government to new posts, Zedillo broke with the 
governing party's political approach by naming an opposition party leader to 
the sensitive post of attorney general. Zedillo promised sweeping electoral 
reforms to separate the ruling party from government authority and also made 
tough statements on corruption, abuse of authority and accountability. Whether 
he can deliver on his bold promises remains to be seen, but he has staked his 
administration's reputation on political reform.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE FDA; WHEN POLITICS DRIVES SCIENCE; UNDER CLINTON, INTEREST 
GROUPS WIN OUT OVER ADVANCEMENTS IN RESEARCH ON FOOD AND DRUG PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY I. MILLER, Henry I. Miller, former director of the FDA Office of 
Biotechnology, is the Wesson fellow at the Hoover Institution and a consulting 
professor at Stanford University's Institute for International Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When David Kessler became the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration 
in 1991, he found the agency to be ponderous and slow. Kessler promised 
dramatic changes, that he "would teach the elephant to dance." And he has -- to 
a tune called by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 During my 15 years' involvement with and observation of the FDA, which has 
spanned the administrations of four presidents, the agency has encountered 
different management styles and regulatory philosophies. But never was raw 
political influence permitted to dictate decisions on policy and products as in 
the Clinton Administration. The regulatory process is no longer impartial and 
dependent on law and science, but operates as if the issue were which interest 
group deserves a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, when a new female condom was under review, the agency 
was reluctant to approve the product in view of its controversial 26% failure 
rate in normal use. Other contraceptives were much more effective: Male condoms 
had a failure rate less than half and hormonal methods less than one-tenth that 
of the new product. But the word came down from the politicos in the Health and 
Human Services Department that they wanted the product approved. Damn science 
and medicine, it had the support of feminists. Approval soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotechnology policymaking and product review provide perhaps the most 
illuminating example of the rise of political influence at the agency. The FDA 
had a consistent and generally positive 15-year track record of regulating 
biotech. Since 1979, there had been a conscious decision that scientific 
considerations would dictate regulation. Furthermore, the fairness, 
predictability and impartiality of the regulatory review process stimulated 
researchers, companies and investors to favor this industrial sector. As a 
result, more than 1,000 new biotech products have been approved for marketing, 
including some genuine medical milestones for diseases ranging from cancer to 
cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis. Millions of patients have been treated 
with these safe and effective products, and hundreds more new products are in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 18 months, however, the FDA has shown an unmistakable change 
on biotech policy. New instructions from the Clinton Administration have 
undermined the scientific paradigm that has been the basis for policymaking 
over the past 15 years: that new biotech techniques are extensions or 
refinements of earlier techniques and that the degree of regulatory scrutiny 
will be determined by risk. Signaling the reversal, the FDA has announced that 
it will soon require food manufacturers to notify the FDA before marketing 
foods manufactured with new biotech techniques -- high-precision recombinant 
DNA or gene-splicing techniques -- while exempting those crafted with other, 
cruder techniques such as hybridization or mutagenesis.  
</P>
<P>
 With these moves, the agency appears to be seeking new regulatory dominions in 
spite of its cries of inadequate resources. Most certainly, the new policies 
will discourage the use of the newer, more precise techniques, denying 
consumers the choice of more nutritious, tasty and convenient products. These 
changes are reflections of a very different attitude about the relative roles 
of science and politics in policymaking. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recently completed review of the milk-stimulating drug, bovine 
somatotropin, Kessler directed a vigorous search for reasons not to approve it. 
Now that BST has been approved (reluctantly), the FDA is permitting stores that 
sell dairy products to flout the agency's policy on labeling -- which has the 
effect of "damaging" BST's acceptability. Many food markets have signs over the 
dairy case proclaiming "NO BST." However, cows' milk normally contains BST, a 
naturally occurring protein; thus the label is inaccurate. The milk-containing 
products in the case could, therefore, be considered misbranded, a violation of 
federal law. Neither FDA nor any state agency has taken action. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes also reflect the new order. Since the 1992 elections, Kessler 
has eliminated the two policy offices having extensive involvement with the 
biotechnology industry, with veteran scientists (including me) swept aside. 
Direction on science policy (and sometimes even on civil-service personnel 
matters) is now provided by a political commissar, Jerold Mande, a former 
Senate staffer of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 At the FDA, which overseas food and health-care products accounting for 25 
cents of every consumer dollar -- more than a trillion dollars worth annually 
-- consumer protection and competition in the marketplace are increasingly at 
the mercy of politics and politicians. Is this any way to run a regulatory 
agency whose job is to ensure that products are safe and that quacks cannot 
prey on the public?

RAIDERS PROVE BETTER BY FOUR FEET; PRO FOOTBALL: BRONCOS FIND THE FINAL YARD 
MOST DIFFICULT, JAEGER KICKS FIVE FIELD GOALS TO LEAD L.A. TO A 23-13 VICTORY

 One yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the difference between the Raiders and the Denver Broncos on Sunday. 
And it might well prove to be the difference between going into the postseason 
and going home. 
</P>
<P>
 One yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all that stood between the Broncos and a chance to get into the end 
zone and back into Sunday's game at the Coliseum on two separate occasions. 
That and Chester McGlockton and Jerry Ball and Patrick Bates and Winston Moss 
and Albert Lewis and Aundray Bruce and the rest of a defensive unit that played 
with as much emotion as it has demonstrated all season in two memorable goal 
line stands. 
</P>
<P>
 One yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how close Denver came to perhaps winning a game it was forced to play 
without quarterback John Elway, who spent the afternoon on the sidelines 
because of a strained left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, on a day when the Raider offense was less than efficient, the team 
rode the hot foot of Jeff Jaeger, who kicked a club-record five field goals, 
and its immovable defense to a 23-13 victory before a crowd of 60,016. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Raiders improve to 8-6, moving them one game behind the AFC 
West-leading San Diego Chargers and onto firmer footing in their bid for a 
wild-card playoff berth. The Broncos fall a game behind at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders lined up in their own end zone to hold off the Broncos, who 
were being led by backup quarterback Hugh Millen, there wasn't any dramatic 
speech in the huddle about slamming the door on the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't something that needed to be said," Raider linebacker Greg Biekert 
said. "Everybody on the defense had the attitude that they (the Broncos) were 
not going to make it. We knew and they knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people might have figured there was no way the Broncos were going to 
win when it was announced that Elway would serve as the third quarterback 
Sunday, and probably wouldn't be used even in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider coaches, perhaps fearing a natural letdown, didn't even inform 
their players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches didn't even mention it," Bates said. "I thought he was going to 
play all week. But it didn't really matter. It wasn't a big deal to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Raiders had bigger concerns. Like the malfunctioning of their 
offense. Like the never-ending parade of flags that seem to wave in their 
direction whenever they take the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders began play with 128 penalties this season, putting them within 
striking distance of the league record of 149, held by the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 They also were coming off a performance in which they had been called for 17 
penalties against the Chargers to tie the Raider record. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't able to reach those heights Sunday. But they were called for a 
dozen penalties for 81 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was shaping up as another frustrating afternoon for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 All they had to show for the first half against a team sputtering badly 
without Elway, its main spark plug, was two Jaeger field goals, from 44 and 29 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the Broncos with a chance to take the lead at intermission with 
their final drive of the half despite the fact that they hadn't yet made it 
into Raider territory and Millen had completed only two passes for 12 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 But on that final drive, the Broncos got down to the Raider six-yard line on a 
35-yard pass from Millen to Shannon Sharpe, who finished as the game's leading 
receiver with nine catches for 89 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On first and goal, Denver running back Reggie Rivers, in for Leonard Russell 
who was knocked out of the game in the second quarter because of a neck injury, 
was thrown for a four-yard loss by McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly determined to not do anything the easy way, the Raiders then 
committed back-to-back penalties -- by Bates and Moss -- to move the Broncos to 
the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Then: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On first down, Millen threw incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On second down, Rivers lost a yard, tackled by Ball and linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On third down, Millen threw incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Elam then salvaged what could be salvaged by kicking a 20-yard field 
goal in the closing seconds of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders had made a statement. In the second half, they would put an 
exclamation point on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger extended the Raider lead to 9-3 with a 47-yard field goal on the 
Raiders' first drive of the third quarter after a Bronco fumble by Derrick 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Denver took its best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on their own 25-yard line, the Broncos drove back down to familiar 
territory, the Raider one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, from the one: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On first down, Rivers tried the middle, but was stopped by Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On second down, Rivers tried the left side, but was stopped by Bates, 
Biekert and Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On third down, Rivers tried the left side again, but was met by a wall of 
opposition led by Bruce, Fredrickson, Ball, Moss and Harrison, Rivers thrown 
all the way back to the four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, there was still plenty of time to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally, however, the Raiders had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Elam kicked a 21-yard field goal to keep Denver close at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Jaeger added his fourth field goal, a 30-yarder, Hostetler finally 
got his offensive unit into the end zone by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass 
to Harvey Williams, and Jaeger broke the team field-goal mark, held by Mike 
Mercer and George Blanda (three times,) with a 28-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it came on a win," said Jaeger of his record-breaking effort. "It 
was kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't much fun for the Broncos, who lost for the eighth time in a row at 
the Coliseum and the 11th time in their last 12 meetings with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos played without their star quarterback, they played without safety 
Steve Atwater, who sat out because of a hamstring injury, and they played more 
than half the game without Russell, who leads Denver with nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with all their problems, the Broncos might have made a game of it if they 
could have gotten only one more yard. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders held the Broncos to 63 yards rushing. . . . Coach Art Shell 
replaced right tackle Greg Skrepenak, who was ineffective, with Robert Jenkins 
in the second quarter.

RAMS LOSE COOL, TAMPA BAY TAKES ADVANTAGE, 24-14; PRO FOOTBALL: BUCCANEERS 
CAPITALIZE ON THREE UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT PENALTIES TO HAND L.A. ITS FIFTH 
LOSS IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chuck Knox said he was looking for a spark, but instead of getting an 
electrifying performance from quarterback Chris Chandler, the Rams' stoic head 
coach watched in disbelief as his taunting, late-hitting linebacking corps 
ignited the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 On three of the four plays following offsetting penalties and a warning from 
game officials to stop misbehaving, Ram linebackers were penalized for 
unsportsmanlike conduct. The penalty binge allowed the Buccaneers to move into 
position to score and take a 10-point halftime lead on their way to a 24-14 
victory Sunday in Tampa Stadium before 34,150. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where their heads were at," Tampa Bay linebacker Hardy Nickerson 
said. "But they came in here jawing at us, calling us names. That only made us 
play harder and shove their noses in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers, who led, 17-14, after blocking Tony Zendejas' 48-yard 
field-goal attempt with 1:51 to play, opted to go deep for a 44-yard touchdown 
pass from Craig Erickson to Charles Wilson 17 seconds later rather than run the 
clock out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay (5-9) ran its winning streak to three, the first time since 1982 
that the Buccaneers have won three games in a row and the first time since 1980 
that they have defeated a team from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the lowest point in a lot of our careers, especially mine," said Ram 
linebacker Shane Conlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-10), losers of five in a row, once again failed to run effectively 
and allowed Wilson, who had been buried three-deep on the Buccaneers' depth 
chart, to catch four passes for 176 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at Tampa Bay and it's like looking at the Los Angeles Clippers in 
basketball," said Ram defensive end Fred Stokes. "I heard some guys saying, 'If 
they are that bad, what does that make us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although inept for much of the first half, the Rams remained within a field 
goal but then lost their cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Joe Kelly tackled running back Errict Rhett after a two-yard 
gain, then let him know it. An agitated Rhett took exception and, while tempers 
flared, the two-minute warning sent both teams toward their own benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Todd Lyght, however, strolled over to the Buccaneers' sideline 
and attempted to eavesdrop on the Tampa Bay huddle. Rookie quarterback Trent 
Dilfer was the first to spot Lyght and, after bringing it to Coach Sam Wyche's 
attention, Nickerson attempted to remove Lyght from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hanging out," Lyght said. "That field is for everybody. I can do 
whatever I want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I ignite all this? No, I think Sam Wyche ignited it when he tried to put 
his hands on me. I was too quick for him, though, so he didn't touch me, but 
Nickerson was there. I think he was frustrated from just getting beat for a 
touchdown by Troy Drayton." 
</P>
<P>
 While folks at home were treated to commercials, the Rams and Buccaneer began 
to spar. The officials called offsetting penalties, and after announcing to the 
crowd that both teams had been warned about such future extracurricular 
activity, play resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play -- on second and eight from his 37-yard line -- Erickson 
badly overthrew wide receiver Lawrence Dawsey down the left sideline. On the 
right side of the field, meanwhile, Conlan had laid out Buccaneer tight end 
Tyji Armstrong with a head-high wallop, drawing a 15-yard penalty for 
unnecessary roughness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came and cut my knee in the first quarter and I said, 'I'll get you,' " 
Conlan said. "So I hit him -- right in the head, right in the face. I've been 
doing this for eight years and I never had anybody do that to me. I'm not a 
dirty player, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He was talking about what a man he is, but he's a (terrible) player. He's 
nothing, but we got to be smarter than that. I shouldn't have done it because 
it cost our team. It was stupid, but it still felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play Rhett ran for 14 yards, and 15 more yards were tacked on 
after an official caught Ram linebacker Roman Phifer taunting running back 
Anthony McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taunting penalties kept their drive alive and allowed them to score," 
Knox said. "I told the players, 'Listen, enough is enough.' That's not our kind 
of football." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, continued to get in trouble. Phifer threw Rhett for a 
three-yard loss, then tackled running back Vince Workman, who had caught a 
seven-yard pass from Erickson. After sliding to the ground, however, Workman 
appeared to juggle the ball while trying to regain his feet. Phifer leaned on 
Workman in an effort to keep him from advancing, and was penalized half the 
distance to the goal line -- seven yards -- for unnecessary roughness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was a bad call," Phifer said. "The guy was trying to get up, 
and this is football and it's a physical game." 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Rhett ran free for eight yards and a touchdown, and with 50 
seconds remaining in the half, the Buccaneers led, 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all in my face talking," said Rhett, who ran 31 times for 119 yards 
on his 24th birthday. "If I even tried to breathe they were all over me." 
</P>
<P>
 While Rhett had his way with the Ram defense, running back Jerome Bettis 
continued to go nowhere. Bettis ran 13 times for 23 yards against the 
27th-ranked defense against the run, and has averaged 2.4 yards a carry in his 
last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram passing game, which was supposed to receive a boost after the benching 
of Chris Miller, was also ineffective. Chandler, who had been 0-6 as a starter 
with Tampa Bay previously, missed a number of wide-open receivers before 
finding Drayton for 22 yards and a touchdown in the second quarter. A 12-yard 
touchdown pass to Jessie Hester in the fourth quarter brought the Rams within a 
field goal, but another break in discipline damaged their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving within Zendejas' field-goal range at the Tampa Bay 25, Chandler's 
first-down pass to Todd Kinchen at the 19 was wiped out by a holding call on 
guard Leo Goeas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A weak call," Goeas said. "No. 71 (Santana Dotson) had cried to the ref about 
something and on the very next play they called the penalty. It will show on 
film that it was a very weak call." 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty pushed the Rams to the Tampa Bay 35, but instead of going 
downfield for substantial yardage on third and 16, Chandler, as he has done 
several times this season, went short for five yards to Kinchen. That left 48 
yards for Zendejas to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was at the breaking point for Zendejas with the wet field and the breeze 
that was there," said Wayne Sevier, special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Charles McRae blocked Zendejas' kick -- the first kick blocked by a 
Buccaneer since Dec. 6, 1992, when McRae blocked another Zendejas attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers went on to score another touchdown, and with two games to play, 
they still can avoid losing a 10th game for the 12th consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers," said Ram cornerback Darryl Henley. 
"This is terrible. Just terrible."

USC GOES COLD, LOSES TO LAMAR; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TROJANS FALL TO 3-4 AFTER 
SHOOTING DROPS FROM 52% IN FIRST HALF TO 41% IN SECOND HALF.

 Ron Coleman made three free throws in the final 19 seconds Sunday to give 
Lamar an 80-78 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore guard led Lamar (3-1) with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans built a 43-40 halftime lead by connecting on 17 of 33 shots from 
the floor, 52% compared to Lamar's 43% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lamar's shooting improved slightly after intermission as the Cardinals 
made 46% of their shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the Cardinals became more selective in their shots. After 
making two of 11 three-point shots before the half, the Cardinals made four of 
seven in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (3-4) made 41% of its second-half shots. The Trojans made four of nine 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Johnson gave the Cardinals the lead for good at 75-72 with a three-point 
shot from the corner with 1:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Cameron Murray, a freshman guard, had a chance to send the game into 
overtime but missed from the top of the key at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray led USC with 24 points and Lorenzo Orr had 20.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders, who are playing some of their best football in December, should 
become the only local major league franchise to reach the playoffs this year. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Defense is the name of their game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The highlights of their 23-13 victory over Denver Sunday were goal-line stands 
in the second and third quarters that forced the Broncos to settle for field 
goals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Both times the Broncos had first downs on the one-yard line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Both times they wished they had John Elway at quarterback instead of Hugh 
Millen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And both times they wished young linebackers Rob Fredrickson and Greg Biekert 
and veteran tackle Jerry Ball hadn't made big plays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is nice to see fullback Tom Rathman becoming an integral part of the Raider 
offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The more I see of rookie running back Calvin Jones, the more I like him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For a change, Raider special teams were special. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing wrong with the crowd of 60,016 at the Coliseum was that it was 
big enough for the wave to be executed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Catch of the day: Rocket Ismail's remarkable reception for a 42-yard gain in 
the fourth quarter with cornerback Ben Smith draped over him and guilty of pass 
interference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad that Ismail and Jeff Hostetler had the chat not long ago that 
resulted in more business coming Rocket's way. . . . 
</P>

 What will the NFC playoffs possibly be like without the Rams and the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You must have stayed glued to your TV set during that epic battle from 
Florida. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't understand why the Dallas Cowboys, with no timeouts left, didn't throw 
into the end zone in the closing seconds against the Cleveland Browns on 
Saturday.You simply can't leave room for error, such as receiver Jay Novacek 
slipping inches short of the goal line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stat of the day, courtesy of Fox TV's Howie Long: Steve Young has thrown more 
touchdown passes to Jerry Rice than Joe Montana has. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Something is wrong with the system when three NFL games are televised into the 
nation's second-largest market, Los Angeles, on the 15th Sunday of the season 
and none of the teams has a winning record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best football game on the tube over the weekend here was Santa Ana Mater Dei 
High's 28-21 victory over La Puente Bishop Amat at Anaheim Stadium for the 
Southern Section Division I title. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon, who was brilliant in defeat, is my choice for the 1997 
Heisman Trophy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Rollinson, who did a terrific job coaching Mater Dei to an unbeaten 
season, lettered as a defensive back at USC in 1971. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only upset in the Heisman Trophy balloting was that Kerry Collins, the 
Maxwell Award winner, finished as low as fourth behind winner Rashaan Salaam. .

 Phase I of Oscar De La Hoya's professional boxing career is over. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, the Golden Boy from East L.A. will face only opponents who are 
reigning champions or ranked highly by the three major alphabet groups. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 His ninth-round victory over game but outclassed Johnny Avila on Saturday at 
the Grand Olympic was exactly what De La Hoya needed before embarking on Phase 
II against International Boxing Federation junior-lightweight champion John 
John Molina on Feb. 18 in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how Avila stood up to all the punishment dealt by De La Hoya, who 
didn't lose a round on my card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After Felix Trinidad's eighth-round knockout of Oba Carr in Monterrey, Mexico, 
Don King got in the ring and challenged Pernell Whitaker on behalf of Trinidad. 
A heavy hitter with a long reach, Trinidad might have the style to bother 
Whitaker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 World Boxing Council president Jose Sulaiman made a "greatest promoter in the 
history of boxing" presentation to -- you'll never guess it -- King. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman will defend his heavyweight title against an opponent yet to be 
signed in April at the Superdome in New Orleans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 James Toney and manager Jackie Kallem have made amends and Toney will fight on 
the De La Hoya-Molina card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fenway Park should do wonders for Jose Canseco's career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I turned on the car radio Friday night and heard Chick Hearn say the score of 
the Laker-Clipper game was 72-49. It didn't surprise me. . . .

CHICAGO, 40-3, FOR NINTH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY AT LAMBEAU FIELD. 
</P>

<P>
 A return to frigid Lambeau Field, a white-hot offense and an ice-cold Steve 
Walsh were exactly what the Green Bay Packers needed to salvage their playoff 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers routed the Bears, 40-3, Sunday as Brett Favre threw three 
touchdown passes, two of them to Sterling Sharpe, and Green Bay's defense 
returned to form after a five-game skid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could say I gave them a magic pill, but I can't," Green Bay Coach 
Mike Holmgren said. "You never expect a lopsided score in this division." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jacke kicked four field goals as the Packers (7-7) stayed alive for the 
playoffs by winning their ninth consecutive game at Lambeau, where they 
completed their first undefeated season since 1962 when Vince Lombardi won his 
second of five NFL titles. They are 5-0 at Lambeau this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers passed for 259 yards and ran for a season-high 257. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our balance was like a dream," Favre said. "We were going to try to run the 
ball more because of the conditions and the way our defense had been 
struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (8-6) fell from first place in the NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was sunny Sunday with no snow, it was the coldest game between the 
Bears and Packers in 18 seasons as the temperature was 15 degrees at kickoff 
with a windchill of 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears were even colder, managing only a 25-yard field goal by Kevin Butler 
for an early 3-0 lead before the Packers overwhelmed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Edgar Bennett carried 22 times for 106 yards. Favre completed 19 of 
31 passes for 250 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett has three career 100-yard rushing games, all against the Bears. Reggie 
Cobb added 78 yards on 11 carries and rookie LeShon Johnson had six carries for 
42 yards as the Packers outgained Chicago 516 yards to 176 yards, including 
257-27 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In ending a three-game losing streak, the Packers scored on seven of their 
first nine possessions and took a 24-3 halftime lead behind Favre's touchdown 
passes of 12 yards to Robert Brooks and 13 yards to Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks finished with career bests of six catches for 105 yards, and Sharpe 
caught seven passes for 86 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown on the opening 
drive of the second half that made it 31-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacke's 25-yard field goal made it 34-3 going into the fourth quarter. He also 
had a 39-yarder in the second quarter and added field goals of 20 and 29 yards 
in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, who replaced Erik Kramer in the second half of the Halloween debacle 
and has started ever since, was spelled by Kramer in the fourth quarter.

PATRIOTS DEFEAT COLTS FOR FIFTH VICTORY IN A ROW; AFC: NEW ENGLAND MOVES CLOSER 
TO FIRST PLAYOFF APPEARANCE IN EIGHT SEASONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New England Patriots, a franchise starved for success, continued an 
amazing turnaround Sunday and moved closer to a rare playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 New England's 28-13 victory over the Indianapolis Colts was its fifth in a row 
after a 3-6 start and it greatly improved the team's chances of making the 
playoffs for the first time in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots overcame Drew Bledsoe's four interceptions and a 10-0 
second-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never count ourselves out," said Willie McGinest, the Patriots' rookie 
linebacker from USC. "People had done that earlier in the season and we turned 
everything around." 
</P>
<P>
 They've done it so well that they no longer need a spectacular game from 
Bledsoe to win. He was smiling despite a mediocre performance in which he threw 
two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling to know that our team is now playing at a level that it 
can overcome the quarterback," Bledsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots defeated the Colts (6-8) with a defense that allowed fewer than 
300 yards for the fourth consecutive week after doing it only once in the first 
10 games. New England gave up a season-low 212 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, who have not had a winning season since 1988, overcame Ray 
Buchanan's 90-yard interception-return touchdown. It was Buchanan's third 
interception return for a score in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts didn't score after their other three interceptions, including 
another by Buchanan, who has six interceptions in five games since moving from 
safety to cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in three weeks, the Patriots controlled Marshall Faulk, 
the AFC's No. 3 rusher. He gained 50 yards in 17 carries. In a 12-10 loss Nov. 
27, he managed only 48 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt less than 100%," said Faulk, who was hospitalized Thursday with a 
respiratory ailment. "There are times when you have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, though, couldn't control Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 After Buchanan's touchdown gave the Colts a 10-0 lead, Bledsoe led the 
Patriots to touchdowns on three of their next five possessions for a 21-10 lead 
with 16 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe finished 25 of 45 for 277 yards. He said the strong wind was only a 
minor problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots used a no-huddle offense in the third quarter, hoping to score as 
much as possible with the wind at their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The no-huddle was unexpected," Buchanan said. "The Patriots have taken an 
average team and made themselves into winners." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, combined with Minnesota's win over Buffalo (7-7), left the 
Patriots alone in second place in the AFC East.

MOON GETS HIS FIRST VICTORY IN BUFFALO; INTERCONFERENCE: WITH HELP FROM CARTER 
AND DEL RIO, VIKING QUARTERBACK ENDS HEX AGAINST BILLS; KELLY SPRAINS KNEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warren Moon never won in Buffalo in 10 years with the Houston Oilers. Maybe he 
should have had Cris Carter and Jack Del Rio on his team then. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter caught nine passes for 111 yards on Sunday to lead Minnesota to a 21-17 
victory over Buffalo and give the Vikings' new quarterback his first victory at 
Rich Stadium in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter needs one more catch to tie Sterling Sharpe's record of 112. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio had an interception to kill one Buffalo drive and sacked Jim Kelly to 
stop another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew exactly what's happened here in the past," Moon said. "But I also knew 
that if I play my type of game and if I don't make any major mistakes, we can 
win up here. . . . At some point, the law of averages had to kick in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (9-5), who scored the last 12 points, lost three in a row in 
November, but they have now won two in a row to solidify their hold on first 
place in the NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps us in the playoff hunt. And also the monkey's off my back as far 
as me never having won up here," said Moon, who was 21 of 34 for 261 yards to 
top the 4,000-yard milestone for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I accomplished two different things up here." 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:29 left and Minnesota needing only a first down to run out the clock, 
Phil Hansen stripped the ball from Terry Allen to give the Bills another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly was injured and carted off after the second play and Thurman Thomas 
was hurt on the fourth play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly suffered sprained ligaments in his left knee and will have further tests 
today. Thomas hyperextended his knee, but was said to be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Frank Reich, who led the Bills' back from a 32-point 
deficit to knock Moon and the Oilers out of the playoffs in 1992, couldn't pull 
it out this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been another storybook ending, wouldn't it?" Buffalo center 
Kent Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo (7-7), which has not won consecutive games since September, again lost 
after an emotional victory. One week after defeating the AFC East-leading 
Dolphins to stay in the division race, the Bills dropped to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still in the wild-card race, a Miami victory over Kansas City on 
Monday night would destroy Buffalo's chances of a sixth AFC East title in seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure we can recover. You all know we can recover," cornerback Thomas 
Smith told reporters. "I guess nobody's seen the Bills' backs against the wall 
this far, but we still have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first year with the Vikings, Moon already has begun to rewrite their 
record books. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has 4,078 yards for the year to top Tommy Kramer's team record of 
3,912. He also has 356 completions, surpassing Fran Tarkenton's team record of 
345. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills took advantage of seven Minnesota penalties in the first half -- 
including one that negated an interception and three that saved Buffalo from 
punting -- to open a 10-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it 17-9 on the opening drive of the third quarter, but a short 
kickoff led to one of Fuad Reveiz's five field goals, this one from 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills drove to the Viking 26 on their next possession, but Del Rio, a 
10-year pro from USC, made a one-handed interception that led to the Vikings' 
only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big play," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "But they still had 75 yards 
to go to score after the interception, and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon was five of six on the drive, including a 22-yard pass to Qadry Ismail on 
third and seven to give Minnesota a first down at the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who had 90 yards rushing, ran it in two plays later. After a missed 
two-point conversion, Minnesota led, 18-17, with 9:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio sacked Kelly for a loss of seven on Buffalo's next possession, when 
the Bills went three and out, holding the ball for 43 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings added a 22-yard field goal with 2:38 left.

CARDINALS KEEP HOPE ALIVE, 17-15; NFC: FIELD GOAL BY GREG DAVIS ON FINAL PLAY 
GIVES ARIZONA THE VICTORY OVER WASHINGTON AND EVENS RECORD UNDER RYAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals have remained in playoff contention by winning close 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals have won twice with field goals in overtime and another time by 
a single point.On Sunday, they defeated the Washington Redskins, 17-15, on Greg 
Davis' 27-yard, final-play field goal, and Coach Buddy Ryan said it looked like 
"a playoff-caliber" victory to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is to win," he said, "and sometimes you have to win when 
you're not as fired up." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Redskins took a 15-14 lead with 2:54 left on Chip Lohmiller's 
21-yard field goal, Jay Schroeder, who threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Ricky 
Proehl in the first quarter, led the Cardinals (7-7) on a 70-yard scoring 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 His 29-yard flare pass to Garrison Hearst on fourth and one took the ball to 
the Washington six with 51 seconds left. The Cardinals ran down the clock with 
two more snaps before Davis kicked the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he was ready to kick from the 35 but couldn't talk Ryan out of 
going for the first down with the pass to Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to kick," Davis said. "But after I watched the play, I thought, 'God 
bless Garrison Hearst.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had a touchdown and a field goal in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got the ball after Lohmiller kicked his third field goal to give 
the Redskins (2-12) their only lead. The loss was the Redskins' 15th in a row 
in the NFC East, a league record that surpassed a 14-game skid by the Houston 
Oilers in the AFC Central from 1972-74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good feeling about our football team," Coach Norv Turner said. "We 
played physical in the game today, and we made some good plays."

SHULA LASHES OUT AFTER 27-20 LOSS; INTERCONFERENCE: BENGAL COACH CRITICIZES 
OFFICIALS FOR PASS- INTERFERENCE CALL LATE IN GIANTS' VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a day when the New York Giants kept their faint playoff hopes alive by 
defeating Cincinnati for the first time, Bengal Coach David Shula simply lost 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Shula criticized the officials minutes after a questionable 
pass-interference call set up Rodney Hampton's game-winning three-yard 
touchdown run with 40 seconds to play Sunday, giving the Giants a 27-20 victory 
and their fourth consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (2-12) made the Giants work a lot harder than expected to post 
their first victory in five games against them. Cincinnati rallied from a 20-10 
fourth-quarter deficit to tie the game on Jeff Blake's second touchdown pass 
play to Carl Pickens and a 23-yard field goal by Doug Pelfrey with 1:47 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dave Brown completed three consecutive passes to move the Giants from 
their 34-yard line to the Bengal 25, and then came the play that probably will 
get Shula a telephone call from the NFL executive offices. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mike Sherrard running a go pattern on the left sidelines against Corey 
Sawyer, Brown went deep. Both players went for the ball and it fell to the 
ground. So did a flag from side judge Dave Wyant for interference. 
</P>
<P>
 The play gave New York a first and goal and Hampton scored his second 
touchdown on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 A livid Shula said Wyant's call was horrible, although the word he used was a 
little worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got . . . ," Shula said. "Corey Sawyer is doing everything you teach a guy 
to do. He's in front of the receiver, playing the ball and the receiver runs up 
from behind and we got called for pass interference. You explain it to me. I 
don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer said he told Wyant that he had given the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was a Giant I wouldn't take that win," said Sawyer, who set up two 
Bengal touchdowns with a punt return and an interception. "It's under the win 
column but I don't consider it a win. It's a Christmas present." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (7-7) probably have to win their final two games to have any chance 
of making the playoffs. They play at Philadelphia next Sunday and close on 
Christmas Eve at home against Dallas.

EVERETT LEAVES FALCONS FEELING JITTERY; NFC: SAINT QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 273 
YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN 29-20 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Everett isn't as concerned about the present state of the New Orleans 
Saints as he is the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to downplay the potential for making the playoffs, but I think 
we've got something going into 1995 here," Everett said Sunday night after the 
Saints used his two touchdown passes and Morten Anderson's five field goals to 
defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 29-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to put something together," Everett said. "We're not 
forgetting '94." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Saints and Falcons are on the verge of being eliminated from 
contention for a wild-card playoff berth, each holding 6-8 records that rank 
10th in the NFC's six-team scramble for a postseason date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest satisfaction was coming in here and playing pretty good against a 
good team," Everett said. "We take more pride in the win than trying to play a 
spoiler role." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who completed 18 of 31 passes for 273 yards, connected with Michael 
Haynes on a 78-yard scoring play when two defenders collided in the second 
quarter. His other touchdown pass play, a five-yarder to Quinn Early, gave the 
Saints a 26-17 lead with less than four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen's field goals came from 45, 33, 31, 34 and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints continued their mastery in this series of NFC West rivals by 
defeating the Falcons for the 13th time in their last 17 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame we waited till December to come together," Haynes said. "They 
didn't change their defense from the last game, so we came out and did stuff 
that we were looking at the films of our last meeting. And, it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons rode Jeff George's passing to a 14-13 lead at halftime, but had to 
settle for Norm Johnson's field goals of 42 and 21 yards the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 George completed eight passes in a row in Atlanta's two second-quarter 
touchdown drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Heyward ended a nine-play, 74-yard drive on a nine-yard run through the 
middle five minutes into the second quarter, erasing a 3-0 deficit. George 
connected with Andre Rison on a 17-yard pass to key the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's Terance Mathis became the eighth player in NFL history to catch 100 
passes in a season.

WARREN LEADS SEAHAWKS, 16-14; AFC: SEATTLE BACK RUSHES FOR A CAREER-HIGH 185 
YARDS AS LATE RALLY BY HOUSTON FIZZLES OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Warren almost outgained the Houston Oilers and helped the Seattle 
Seahawks ease two weeks of misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, involved in an auto accident that paralyzed teammate Mike Frier on 
Dec. 2, rushed for a career-high 185 yards in 30 carries and scored on a 
33-yard run. That kept alive Seattle's slim playoff hopes with a 16-14 victory 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Frier gets the game ball," Warren said. "I'm sure it will make him feel 
better. All my prayers and sympathy have been with him. He'll be getting 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren ignored the fractured ribs he received in the accident and played until 
the Seahawks were in control in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to have the focus on me, like it was today," Warren said. "I like to 
be the one that makes things happen. When something starts to work, why abandon 
it? We were running the ball real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren sat out most of the fourth quarter, despite Houston's late comeback on 
Billy Joe Tolliver's 36-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter and Ernest 
Givins' 78-yard punt return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I took a deep breath I had pain," Warren said. "We had the lead 
and were pretty much in control until the very end. This game was special, 
because of some key players we have that are injured." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle (6-8) rushed 50 times for 266 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-13), trying to regroup under new Coach Jeff Fisher, lost their 
10th consecutive game and looked bad doing it -- until they scored twice in the 
final 4:23. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolliver completed a two-point conversion pass to Haywood Jeffires following 
Slaughter's touchdown catch. Givins took Seattle's next punt back 78 yards and 
did a flip into the end zone with 2:53 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two-point try failed when Todd McNair caught a pass and was tackled at 
the one by Robert Blackmon, preventing a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' Bubba McDowell grabbed the ensuing onsides kick, but Oilers hopes 
ended moments later when cornerback Orlando Watters intercepted Tolliver's pass 
at the Seattle 34 and the Seahawks ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers couldn't make their offense work most of the game against a Seahawk 
defense that came in yielding 343.7 yards per game, 24th in the NFL. The Oilers 
finished with 208 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers never found a solution for Warren. He had a 32-yard run in the 
third quarter that set up Mack Strong's 13-yard touchdown run.

PRO FOOTBALL / TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 24, RAMS 14; RAM REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Quarter: Suzanne Sommers stopped by the table Saturday night. True, 
true, true, no telling how this season might have gone had Wayne Gandy had the 
thigh master from the very start. . . . Joe Kelly is celebrating and ref has 
called teammate Jimmie Jones offsides; Wonder what Kelly will do if Jones makes 
a tackle. . . . Two guys keep blocking Sean Gilbert; seems like a waste of 
manpower. . . . Rams probably figured Whacky Wyche doesn't watch film, run 
Jerome Bettis on first play for 12th time in 14 games. Who has to watch film 
when you know Chuck Knox: Bettis loses three yards. . . . Sparky Chandler has 
Rams punting after three plays. . . . Bettis doesn't lose ground this time, 
just the ball. . . . Sparky gets sacked; Knox might be next. Bucs 0, Rams 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Quarter: Chris Brantley, Troy Drayton and now Jessie Hester have 
dropped passes. As wild as Chris Miller was, no one had any idea how bad Ram 
receivers were until Sparky started hitting them in the hands. . . . Charles 
Wilson catch covers 53 yards, third-longest in his career, but game is young. . 
. . Wilson catches 71-yard pass, the longest completion in Craig Erickson's 
career, but it isn't even halftime. . . . Troy Drayton catches sixth TD pass; 
how many TDs would he score if he was included in the game plan? Both teams 
warned for taunting: "We will move before you move, so there." Shane Conlan 
repays cheap shot, demolishes Bucs' tight end and probably damages team's 
playoff hopes. . . . Roman Phifer penalized for trash talk. If you know Phifer, 
this is like accusing Mother Theresa of cussing. Bucs 17, Rams 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Quarter: David Lang returns kickoff 57 yards, which is indeed 
noteworthy: hard to believe he could run that far without fumbling. . . . 
Sparky overthrows Anderson. Get it? Sparky falls down trying to handoff to 
Bettis, Bucs recover and aren't Miller's excuses better than Sparky's mistakes? 
Check this out: Buc fans are chanting: "We will rock you." They are playing the 
Rams and may be right. . . . On his best day, Joe DiMaggio never hit as many 
line drives as Sean Landeta Sunday. . . . Todd Kinchen returns punt 40 yards, 
which is indeed noteworthy: he caught the ball. . . . On third and one Bettis 
stopped by Gandy for loss of one. Bucs 17, Rams 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Quarter: Bettis loses two yards. He no longer has goal of 2,000 or 
1,000 yards, but finishing in black. . . . Jessie Hester catches TD pass. You 
can't call this "Miracle on 34th Street," because Tampa Stadium is located on 
Dale Mabry Highway. . . . Jimmy Stewart had an angel, friends with money; 
Bettis has Gandy, loses two yards and ain't life a . . . Holding call on Leo 
Goeas wipes out first down, pushes Tony Zendejas back, kick blocked, Bucs win 
three in a row. Rams long for days when NFL schedule ended after 14 games. Bucs 
24, Rams 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Summary: You've seen the Sean Gilbert TV commercial: "Kid, you got my 
lucky jersey." Well, gosh darn it, kid, give it back.

PALMER-NICKLAUS TEAM CAN'T HOLD OFF COMEBACK; GOLF: MATCH PLAY WON BY 
FLOYD-EICHELBERGER, MCGOVERN-MAGGERT AND GREEN-ROBBINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It had to happen. The only way a 65-year-old golfer and his 54-year-old 
partner could win the $2.1-million Diners Club Matches is if there was a 
grandfather clause. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, there wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus sure didn't act their age Sunday at PGA West. 
They led by one hole with one to play, but wound up losing to guys old enough 
to be their, well, cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus and Palmer came from four shots down to take a lead only to see 
Raymond Floyd, 53, and Dave Eichelberger, 51, win 1-up on the 19th hole in the 
Senior PGA Tour division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we both thought we had it won," Palmer said. "I know I did." 
</P>
<P>
 He had good reason to think so. Floyd and Eichelberger, 4-up through 11 holes, 
could do nothing while Palmer and Nicklaus found an entire nest of birdies, 
caught up then went ahead on the 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, it looked like it was going to be a rout," Floyd said. "But on the 
18th tee, I didn't have much empathy for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichelberger tied the match with an 18-foot birdie putt on 18 and won it with 
a 15-foot birdie putt on 19. 
</P>
<P>
 As comebacks or collapses go, the most dramatic Sunday was the one in which 
Jim McGovern and Jeff Maggert defeated Rocco Mediate and Lee Janzen on the 19th 
hole, 1-up, to win the PGA Tour division. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert rolled in a short birdie putt in sudden death for an unlikely victory, 
made possible by the generosity of Mediate and Janzen, who blew a four-hole 
lead with five to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't looking good there," Maggert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The view improved. Three times Mediate and Janzen had putts to win the match 
and three times they failed, the last time on No. 18 when Mediate missed a 
five-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one other comeback, in the LPGA Tour final, where Tammie Green and 
Kelly Robbins came from two holes down on the back nine to defeat Dottie 
Mochrie and Julie Inkster, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Green and Robbins birdied three consecutive holes to get it done, which didn't 
surprise Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you can make a run like that, things are going to happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer felt the same way. With Floyd and Eichelberger 4-up through 11 holes, 
Palmer turned to Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him let's birdie the next four holes," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 They came close with birdies on four of the next five holes and felt like 
winners for a short while, right up to the moment Eichelberger made his 
18-footer on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned to Arnie and was just about to ask him when was the last time he won 
a tournament," Nicklaus said. "I decided not to say anything at the last 
minute."

FIRST DAVIS CUP THEN GRAND SLAM CUP FOR LARSSON; TENNIS: SWEDE DEFEATS NO. 1 
SAMPRAS TO WIN SPORT'S RICHEST TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week after helping Sweden win the Davis Cup, Magnus Larsson upset 
top-ranked Pete Sampras to win the richest prize in tennis -- $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson won, 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, in the final of the Grand Slam 
Cup on Sunday, at $6 million the most lucrative tennis tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best Christmas present I could get," Larsson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson nearly equaled his career prize money of $1,690,317, and more than 
doubled his 1994 earnings, which had stood at $639,105 before the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic news wasn't bad for Sampras, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The American, who won the inaugural Grand Slam Cup in 1990, earned $750,000, 
plus a bonus of $500,000 for the two Grand Slam titles he won in 1994 -- the 
Australian Open and Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 By adding $1.25 million to his 1994 earnings, Sampras reached the record sum 
of $4,857,812 for a year. Sunday's prize money also boosted the career earnings 
for the two-time Wimbledon champion to more than $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament invites 16 players with the best records in the four Grand Slam 
events, which also include the French and U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson, who had never beaten Sampras in five previous matches, made the 
tournament by virtue of reaching the semifinals at the French Open, his best 
finish at a Grand Slam event. He is ranked 19th in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras won 10 titles this year, the last at the ATP Tour World Championship 
in Frankfurt in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could not match the raw power of Larsson, who hit 31 aces. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of two titles this year, Larsson broke Sampras twice in the final set 
to take a 5-1 lead. He wasted a match point and was broken in the eighth game, 
allowing Sampras to cut the lead to 5-4.  
</P>
<P>
 But Larsson went up, 40-0, on his serve, and a service winner gave him the 
match after 2 hours 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the start of the fourth set I had a few good games, but at the end I felt 
a bit tired -- the pressure was on me," Larsson said. "But I saw that Pete was 
also tired and I thought that the longer the match lasts, the better my 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win the Davis Cup is something very big, I felt I could go here and play 
with no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 In reaching the final, Larsson upset three higher-ranked players -- Davis Cup 
teammate Stefan Edberg, world No. 2 Andre Agassi, and Todd Martin in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras had to battle through five tough sets Saturday against Goran 
Ivanisevic. He didn't look as fresh Sunday as Larsson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a bit tired, but you've got to give Magnus credit," Sampras said. "He 
played too good, he served too big, and he's coming off the Davis Cup victory."

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE DARK SIDE OF A CELEBRATED 
AUTHOR; REMEMBER LAUGHTER: A LIFE OF JAMES THURBER BY NEIL A. GRAUER ; 
UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA PRESS $20, 255 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of James Thurber's birth, 
"Remember Laughter," a succinct biography, is a gift package of mixed messages. 
Drawing heavily on the memories of friends, New Yorker colleagues and 
particularly Thurber's daughter Rosemary, the book balances an admiring 
assessment of the delightful wit, the unforgettable drawings and the enduring 
classics against disturbing recollections of Thurber's mercurial personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is an ambivalent biography that verges upon the revisionist when 
discussing the man himself while remaining respectful about most of his work. 
Still, by the time you have finished Neil A. Grauer's book, you may find 
yourself not only deconstructing the stories but also regarding the cartoons 
from a new perspective. There was a dark side to Thurber, and what once 
appeared altogether whimsical and beguiling becomes ominous and far more 
complex than it seemed at first glance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurber thought of his work as tragicomedy, believing that "humor and pathos, 
tears and laughter are, in the highest expression of the human character and 
achievement, inseparable." Like many other humorists, he longed to be taken 
seriously and often deplored the fact that humorous writing tends to be 
ephemeral while pomposity and pretension endure. 
</P>
<P>
 As Grauer points out, Thurber's fantasy "was not always a sanctuary for the 
soul; sometimes it served as an exterminator. In "The Whip-poor will," "A 
Friend to Alexander" and other stories, fantasy kills. And Walter Mitty's final 
daydream is of his own execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thurber had been celebrated in England, where his quirky humor found 
instant acceptance, "The Years With Ross" was not received with pleasure by the 
British critics. Dame Rebecca West was particularly affronted, remarking that 
"buffoonery was in the eye of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
 When "The Years With Ross" appeared in the late 1950s, Thurber's personality 
had already begun to show disturbing signs of change. After he was awarded 
several honorary degrees and a number of literary accolades, Thurber became so 
convinced of his own importance that he told literary critic Edmund Wilson he 
thought he deserved the Nobel Prize. By then, he was drinking excessively, 
talking compulsively and boring even his most ardent admirers with endlessly 
repeated anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a tortured man, no doubt about it," his New Yorker editor, Roger 
Angell, says. By 1960, Thurber's always poor vision had deteriorated badly, his 
quixotic wit had soured into wide-ranging anger, and his general health was 
poor. Increasingly frequent drinking bouts only exacerbated his depression, and 
many of his friends believed that the mental and physical decline was 
irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, they were wrong, if only temporarily. Haila Stoddard, a well-known 
actress and loyal fan, had the delightful idea of adapting her favorite Thurber 
pieces for the stage. The result was "The Thurber Carnival," a succes d'estime 
though not a box-office smash to match Thurber's earlier play, "The Male 
Animal." 
</P>
<P>
 The respite from anguish was pathetically short-lived. Within a few months of 
the show's closing, Thurber suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, the first of many. 
The mood swings became more exaggerated, and his behavior grew increasingly 
abusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he continued to write, the magic light touch was gone, replaced by 
tedious word games, curmudgeonly attacks on virtually everything, and ponderous 
attempts at satire. The New Yorker rejected these late efforts, and Thurber 
became convinced that he was the victim of a conspiracy. Elliott Nugent, his 
collaborator on "The Male Animal," remembers Thurber telling him that "people 
are not funny; they are vicious and horrible -- and so is life." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the three decades before blindness and ill-health embittered him, 
Thurber enchanted millions. Their children and grandchildren still delight in 
his fables and stories -- "The 13 Clocks," "The Wonderful O," "The Last Flower" 
and "Many Moons." Walter Mitty dreams on, as much a part of our heritage as 
Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, and even the captions for the cartoons have 
entered the vernacular, guaranteeing Thurber the lasting fame he thought had 
eluded him.

ROCK'S EMERGING GENDERATION; FROM SUCH POLAR OPPOSITES AS LIZ PHAIR TO COURTNEY 
LOVE, WOMEN STRIKE A KROQ CHORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know you're in good hands at a holiday rock concert when the records 
played between acts range from Christmas tunes by Frank Sinatra and Elvis 
Presley to the latest music from Pearl Jam and Nine Inch Nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Saturday's first night of KROQ's annual "Almost Acoustic Christmas" 
benefit weekend at the Universal Amphitheatre was a winner: a frequently 
glorious, 5 1/2-hour survey of contemporary rock that was more revealing, on 
balance, than the average Lollapalooza lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the 11-act affair was a parade of emerging female rock stars, 
highlighted by polar opposites Courtney Love and Liz Phair. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Phair combines a disciplined demeanor and superbly intelligent 
songwriting, Love surrounds her art with explosive bursts of passion. But they 
are both at the center of the most liberating array of female artists ever to 
arrive on the scene at one time -- a '90s crop that was well represented 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Luscious Jackson, four female musicians backed on stage by a male 
deejay, opened the night's series of 15- to 20-minute sets with winning tales 
of urban life, blending hip-hop and alternative rock with refreshing 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a far more energized and impressive outing than its recent Hollywood 
Palladium date, Chicago's Veruca Salt -- a co-ed quartet led by singers Nina 
Gordon and Louise Post -- operated from a widely appealing musical base that 
combines the bounce of the Go-Go's and the moodiness of the Velvet Underground. 
The group's lyrics reflect a strong sense of feminist independence and 
self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzy Star, the California band guided by singer Hope Sandoval and guitarist 
David Roback, trades in a sort of post-Cowboy Junkies, post-Velvet Underground 
midnight blue melancholia. On Saturday, their music ranged from haunting to a 
bit remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving her band in her Chicago hometown, Phair introduced new material and 
revisited songs from her acclaimed 1993 debut album, "Exile in Guyville." For 
all the attention Phair has received for her flashy use of X-rated words in her 
explorations of love and lust, she is far from a shock-minded novelty. There is 
in her best work a seductive blend of intelligence and innocence, as reflected 
in such disarming lines as "Whatever happened to a boyfriend, the kind of guy 
who makes love because he's in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the soft intimacy of Phair's set, Love and her band Hole came on stage 
ablaze about four hours later. Unlike Hole's recent Palladium show, where the 
fan intensity matched the fervor on stage, the young KROQ crowd seemed seemed 
more questioning than committed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if the fans were trying to figure out just what to make of the brash 
widow of the late Kurt Cobain. Despite Hole's having an acclaimed album before 
Love ever married Cobain, some apparently still see her as an opportunist who 
owes her career to the Nirvana connection. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Palladium show dramatized Love's ability to electrify an audience, 
Saturday's performance showed just how much of a challenge she still faces in 
reaching a mainstream audience -- despite a set that combined five of the best 
songs from one of the albums of the '90s, the current "Live Through This." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the male contingent on the KROQ package (the second night was scheduled for 
Sunday at Universal), the most significant acts were the Jesus and Mary Chain 
-- arguably the most absorbing band to come out of Britain in a decade -- and 
the Meat Puppets, the veteran Arizona trio whose career got a big boost when 
Nirvana did some of their songs on its "MTV Unplugged" show. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the lineup went from the thunderstorm intensity of Sunny Day Real 
Estate to the highly animated and highly uneven Live to the frantic and likable 
Bad Religion and, finally, the Stone Temple Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Pilots have sold more albums than the other 10 acts combined and 
were clearly the crowd favorites, the quartet was equally unbearable whether 
Scott Weiland was crooning his way through a piano-bar version of a Christmas 
song or dancing his way through STP's own middlebrow tunes. Far better would 
have been more Elvis or Pearl Jam records.

 Hanks Takes Two Bites: Tom Hanks was the apple of the Hollywood Women's Press 
Club's eye on Sunday at the groups's 54th Annual Golden Apple Awards at the 
Beverly Hilton. The actor won an unprecedented two Golden Apples -- the Louella 
O. Parsons Award for the person who "best represents Hollywood and the 
entertainment industry to the world," and the honor for most newsworthy male 
star of the year. Hanks was given his Parsons award by last year's winner, 
Charlton Heston; Kate Capshaw gave him his second honor. Annette Bening won the 
most newsworthy female star award and was given her honor by Rob Reiner. Hugh 
Grant won the male discovery of the year award, and Ellen DeGeneres won the 
female discovery honor. Howard Stern was given the Sour Apple award for "the 
person who most believes his/her own publicity" by last year's winner, Zsa Zsa 
Gabor. Director Gary Marshall hosted the event. The late columnist Parsons 
founded the press club, one of the oldest organizations in Hollywood, in 1928.

<P>
 Parentage Questioned: The movie "Junior" has given birth to a controversy. 
German author Bernd Spaeth told the German newsmagazine Focus his lawyer has 
determined that some scenes from the movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger could 
have come from his 1981 novel, "Seitenstechen" ("Pains in the Side"). In 1985, 
the book was turned into a German film. Spaeth said he will seek to have 
"Junior" banned in Germany unless its distributor, Universal, acknowledges his 
intellectual property rights, German media reported Saturday. Spaeth said he 
has already hired an attorney in the United States to seek compensation.

 Jackson Watch: French clothing manufacturer Nelson, S.A. on Friday filed a 
multimillion dollar lawsuit in Los Angeles against the Jacksons, accusing the 
family of breaching a 1991 licensing agreement to give the company worldwide 
rights to manufacture and distribute clothing and accessories bearing the 
Jackson family name. The company alleges that the Jacksons received an initial 
licensing fee of $100,000 plus 10% of royalties from the line, but that in 
March of this year family patriarch Joseph Jackson attempted to terminate the 
agreement "without any legal justification." The lawsuit alleges the company 
has lost more than $17 million through damage to its business relationships.

MUSIC; REKINDLING MOZART AND BRUCKNER -- MEHTA-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just like old times, Friday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
Well, almost like old times. 
</P>
<P>
 Zubin Mehta, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962 to 1978, 
was back for the first of two weeks as guest on his erstwhile podium. His 
program began with eine kleine Mozart-musik , which served as an innocent 
prelude to the big business at hand: Bruckner's lush, lavish, anguished, 
sprawling, convoluted, recalcitrant, incomplete, ever-indulgent, semi-mystical, 
quasi-religious, ultra-Romantic, deceptively climactic, never-ending 
valedictory, the Symphony No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The mighty Bruckner challenge has long been a mighty Mehta specialty. The 
maestro first ventured it here during his inaugural season, and he repeated it 
on numerous occasions thereafter. Germanic heroism has always brought out the 
best in him, after a fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta's approach to Bruckner in general, and to the Ninth in particular, does 
not seem to have changed drastically over the decades. It is a 
bigger-than-life, no-holds-barred, flex-all-the muscles approach that makes its 
zonking case primarily in visceral, not spiritual, terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach is certainly legitimate. Bruckner could roar and thunder in the 
best gargantuan tradition. He tried desperately to out-Wagner Wagner, and he 
savored the impact of a long, momentous, circuitous journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta always took the composer's instructions at face value. He made the large 
gesture very large indeed, and the long line very long. He moved slowly (for 71 
generous minutes), savoring each expressive nuance and every melodic 
indulgence. He put useful quotation marks around the borrowed passages, and 
luxuriated in the dramatic impact of extended Luftpausen.  
</P>
<P>
 He made no effort to disguise the episodic nature of Bruckner's start-and-stop 
inventions. He did little to clarify timbres that tend toward mush. He often 
sacrificed poetry for drama. Still, he made good aesthetic sense on his own 
unabashedly gusty and gutsy terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other conductors have done more to balance Bruckner's bombast with 
introspection. Others have found more subtlety beneath the bravado, more 
pianissimos beside the fortissimos. Others have chosen to understate the 
obvious, keeping the textures transparent and the tempos swift. Others have 
managed to sustain greater tension against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Bruckner interpretation becomes a matter of taste. One man's 
grandeur is another's vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, one had to admire the unbridled force, the abiding warmth, the 
daring breadth and the obvious conviction of Mehta's performance. One also had 
to notice that the Philharmonic, possibly under-rehearsed, responded to his 
flamboyant urgings with more bravado than finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent New Yorker article, incidentally, Paul Griffiths wrote that Mehta, 
who led the New York Philharmonic after leaving Los Angeles, "is remembered 
with far more fondness in Los Angeles than in New York." One wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's G-major Concerto, K. 216, served as a gentle prelude to the 
not-so-gentle Bruckner. It also served as a memorable introduction to David 
Garrett, a German violinist making his U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett happens to be only 14, if one gauges such statistics chronologically 
rather than artistically. Mozart was a grand old man of 19 when he wrote this, 
his third violin concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 In this collaboration of precocious teen-agers, Garrett played Mozart with 
telling mastery of both score and style. If the young man was nervous, his 
poise belied it. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought eager grace to the agitation of the opening allegro, uncommonly 
sweet tone to the arching cantilena of the adagio, perky charm to the rondo 
finale. He even made Eugene Ysaye's Romantic cadenzas sound organic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta and the Philharmonic provided attentive, obviously affectionate, 
slightly untidy accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a deserved push-button ovation, the soloist beamed and 
announced an enigmatic encore: "Johann Sebastian Bach." The choice turned out 
to be the sarabande from the B-minor partita, elegantly dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 David Garrett. Remember the name.

JAZZ REVIEW; OKOSHI HAS THE BRILLIANCE, NEEDS SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Listening to jazz at La Ve Lee in Studio City is a bit like sitting in a 
Parisian Left Bank cellar boite . On Saturday, Japanese trumpeter Tiger Okoshi 
played the pleasantly intimate, low-ceilinged room before an entranced audience 
placed at tables close enough to squeeze the edges of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Okoshi, an amiable 44-year-old performer making his first area appearance in a 
decade, seemed to enjoy the contact, joking with the crowd and leavening his 
tunes with personal asides such as, "For 22 years in Japan, I was Toru; then 
for next 22 years in the U.S., I am Tiger. I think I stay Tiger; then I'm only 
22 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Okoshi has worked with everyone from Sonny Rollins and Tony Bennett 
to Michael Franks and Pat Metheny, his visibility was relatively low until the 
release last year of his recorded tribute to Louis Armstrong. Which is ironic, 
since Okoshi is a cutting-edge contemporary artist whose most obvious influence 
traces to the post-'60s work of Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoting a substantial part of his set to material from a current JVC album, 
"Two Sides to Every Story," Okoshi played with free-flying abandon. Very much 
the master of his horn, he poured out brilliant flurries of notes, often 
building solos via abstract assemblages of bits and pieces of musical 
fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Good as he was, however, and good as he may eventually be, Okoshi was in short 
supply on two important elements: a strong sense of swing and a clearly defined 
musical personality. A first-rate rhythm section -- bassist Jimmy Earl, 
guitarist Jeff Richman and drummer Joel Taylor -- provided sufficient momentum 
to equip Okoshi's solos with the swing they sometimes lacked. But Okoshi needs 
to take his playing up another level by reaching down to open the inner gates 
of his own jazz voice. DON HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MOULD'S SUGAR IS STRONG BUT LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Mould must have chuckled when he named his current group Sugar -- there 
has never been anything remotely sweet about the introspective Angst and 
cathartic roar of the singer-guitarist's music. While Sugar's strong set at the 
half-filled Hollywood Palladium on Friday showed that the trio has cut the 
frenetic rush of his old band Husker Du with enough fresh touches to carve its 
own niche, it also made you wonder whether the group can expand its audience 
beyond the converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist David Barbe's thin, reedy lead vocals provided a contrast to Mould's 
throaty rasp on a half-dozen songs, and Sugar also got the maximum mileage from 
occasional tempo changes and shifts in dynamics. It needed to, because the band 
works in a limited range -- Mould's songs boast plenty of pop touches, but 
they're usually submerged in his patented, full-bore guitar roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Sugar's virtually nonstop performance reach out to engage the 
audience. When a denim shirt thrown from the crowd landed on the mike during 
the encore, Mould looked momentarily startled before slowly toppling backward 
with the mike stand and finishing the song flat on his back. It was a nice, 
unplanned move . . . and a welcome break from the no-frills, all-business 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 An impressive opening set by Magnapop, a Georgia quartet whose recent album 
was produced by Mould, showed off smart arrangements and an ace in the hole in 
guitarist Ruthie Morris' born-to-it rocker's intensity. DON SNOWDEN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SUICIDAL TENDENCIES HITS HARD-CORE NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been years since Suicidal Tendencies has played its home town of 
Venice, so crowds of avid fans in the customary Suicidal garb -- head scarfs, 
tube socks and tattoos -- infiltrated the neighboring Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium on Friday in a show of undying support.  
</P>
<P>
 The legendary hard-core band, one of the few survivors from the '80s to break 
big on the mainstream level, crossed over into the larger metal arena a few 
years back, but kept its menacing street attitude and, therefore, its respected 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's show didn't reveal any new twists in the band's sound, but confirmed 
that Suicidal is more of a bad-ass institution than a trailblazing rock act. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Mike Muir, who seems to get more muscular with each passing year, 
screamed, rapped and rambled old and new material through an annoyingly 
distorted and echo-heavy sound system -- moving in a stealthy, evil skip across 
the stage. He whipped the audience into uniform shouts of "S-T, S-T" between 
songs, then had the band back his anthem shouts during more charged numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The outfit's mix of fist-pumping metal riffs and speedy hard-core satisfied 
both metal head bangers and punk moshers, but dress codes aside, it was 
Suicidal's low-down attitude that hit a true dysfunctional chord and drove the 
show home.LORRAINE ALI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BACHARACH PROVIDES RARE BRIGHT SPOT AT SONGWRITER BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Academy of Songwriters' ninth annual "Salute to the American 
Songwriter" delivered considerably less than it promised at the Wilshire Ebell 
Theatre on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the songwriting team Gamble & Huff canceled its appearance 
due to Kenny Gamble's illness, and Rickie Lee Jones simply never arrived on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the generally excellent quality of past salutes, the absences shouldn't 
have made a difference. But aside from one or two major highlights, this was 
not an evening that had very much going for it -- with or without Gamble & Huff 
and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Williams made a gallant effort to add some pacing and humor to the 
proceedings, but even Williams' whimsy seemed wasted on a generally 
unresponsive crowd and a show possessing few memorable moments. 
</P>
<P>
 After a parade of musically unremarkable tunes and tunesmiths, the concert 
came to life, briefly but brilliantly, with a performance by Burt Bacharach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasting no time with the kind of preliminary remarks that had been dragging 
the show to a slow grind, Bacharach produced a breathtaking rendering of his 
and Hal David's standard "Alfie." In three understated minutes, he defined what 
was missing in so many of the songs heard on the program -- a skillful blending 
of multileveled, emotionally rich lyrics with expressive, illuminating music. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening climaxed with lifetime achievement awards to David Crosby, Stephen 
Stills and Graham Nash. With Crosby still recovering from a liver transplant, 
Stills and Nash graciously accepted the awards before concluding what was 
beginning to feel like an interminable event with a sing-along version of 
"Teach Your Children."DON HECKMAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; PAULIST BOYS SING A COMPLETE 'MESSIAH' IN WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA * The Paulist Boys Choristers of California sing at the L.A. 
County Holiday Celebration, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., Dec. 
24, 7-10 p.m. Admission and parking free.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dedicated to the memory of Henry Mancini -- a composer-conductor who 
encouraged emerging musical talents assiduously -- the Paulist Boys Choristers 
of California's first complete performance of Handel's "Messiah," Friday night, 
proved the choir of 14 boys and nine men up to the demands of this exposing 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Such accomplishment promises more, of course, as the group, led by music 
director Dana T. Marsh, polishes its balances and text definition, learns to 
pace its energies and focuses more pointedly on the work's dramatic 
continuity.In this initial outing, however, heard in the spacious sanctuary of 
St. Paul the Apostle parish in Westwood, many virtues were already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh's conducting kept the work in motion. The gifted 18-player orchestra 
performed splendidly, as a cohesive body and with strong soloism. Three vocal 
soloists, including countertenor Marsh and baritone Edward Levy, proved 
efficient, if not always clear in word or note. And the choristers came 
prepared, for the most part, to sing stylishly and with genuine confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a performance that did not often stress the meaning of the text, some 
successful moments stood out: tenor Jeffrey Thomas' touching singing of the 
four recitatives and airs beginning, "Thy rebuke hath broken His heart"; the 
Choristers' purity of sound and emotional projection at both "All we like 
sheep"; and in the concluding, "Worthy is the Lamb." Throughout, the orchestra 
gave object lessons in Baroque playing. DANIEL CARIAGA * The Paulist Boys 
Choristers of California sing at the L.A. County Holiday Celebration, Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., Dec. 24, 7-10 p.m. Admission and parking

MUSIC REVIEWS; L.A. BAROQUE FULFILLING PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its profoundly satisfying holiday concert, presented on Saturday in the 
pleasingly resonant atrium lobby of the post-modern Water Garden complex in 
Santa Monica, L.A. Baroque approached the decade mark of its history sounding 
very much like the superior period band violinist-director Gregory Maldonado 
has, with deeds rather than puffery, been promising us. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program both well executed and imaginatively constructed, an interested 
observer could feel more than ever that L.A. Baroque is on the right track, 
possibly even the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that speed -- an excess of which has been a besetting sin of historically 
informed performance -- played a prominent part. Order was maintained, but 
never at the expense of the visceral charge, in the group's offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 These included a solemn "Sonata a quattro" by Corelli, Telemann's potent 
Concerto in E minor for alto recorder (the superbly accomplished Kim Pineda) 
and transverse flute (the agile Janet Beazley) and the Concerto in B-flat, Opus 
4, No. 2, of Handel, familiar on the organ but argued here with lively 
conviction and decorative imagination for his instrument by one of L.A. 
Baroque's resident treasures, harpsichordist Edward Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 A nativity cantata by Alessandro Scarlatti proved too blandly benign to make 
an impression on its own, but its protagonist, Kris Gould, with her pure, 
faultlessly tuned soprano, scored a personal triumph and proceeded to reinforce 
it in the evening's centerpiece, the beguilingly disingenuous "Pastorale on the 
Birth of Jesus Christ" by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, L.A. Baroque's holiday 
signature piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado, putting aside his violin, conducted with a fitting blend of 
reverence and fervor while his forces, a spot of bother in the finale aside -- 
a sudden acceleration threatened to derail the ensemble -- delivered not only 
with their customary enthusiasm but with a crowning polish that must have 
cheered veteran L.A. Baroque watchers.HERBERT GLASS

DANCE REVIEWS; LACB 'NUTCRACKER' GETS THE RECIPE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JENNIFER FISHER * Los Angeles Classical Ballet "Nutcracker," in Terrace 
Theater at the Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, 
Dec. 9-17, 8 p.m.; Dec. 18, 7 p.m. And in Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 300 E.

<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Nutcrackers" were fast food -- and at this time of year it sometimes seems 
they are -- Los Angeles Classical Ballet could claim that the popularity of its 
version rests on the choreographers' secret recipe. Launching the company's 
"Nutcracker" season Friday night at the Long Beach Convention Center, LACB 
knows what traditional ingredients to mix in -- all of them.This means sugar 
and spice and great special effects -- without losing emphasis on classical 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographers David Wilcox and Terri Lewis keep the first act party scene 
lively with difficult doll dances (well done by Kristin Douglas, Edward Cueto 
and Kristopher Jones) and a focus on Clara that highlighted young Melissa 
Watson's beautiful placement and ease on pointe. Personalities can also make 
"Nutcracker" cook: In the Snow pas de deux, Mayumi Hanabusa and Aidar Akhmetov 
blended graceful athleticism with glittering enthusiasm. In the second act, Yan 
Lin stood out in a strongly simmering Arabian Dance, and Lisa Cueto was a 
willowy chief Mirliton. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of Roger Hickman, the LACB Orchestra was wonderfully 
crisp, light and dramatic by turns, but had some balance problems during the 
grand pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced by Lilia Mousavarova and Anton Labuschagne, this was the most 
disappointing moment choreographically as well, depending on an excess of 
sweeping poses instead of steps that link the couple to the majesty of the 
music. JENNIFER FISHER * Los Angeles Classical Ballet "Nutcracker," in Terrace 
Theater at the Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach,

DANCE REVIEWS; 'NUTCRACKER' SUCCESS FOR PASADENA TROUPE 
</P>

 In "Nutcracker" narratives, the age of Clara, nutcracker doll recipient, is 
crucial. If she's a young girl, we can be taken into her dream of glitter and 
candy-cane fantasies.If she's older, as in the Pasadena Dance Theatre's 
version, the ballet can lose some of its ability to let us rediscover youthful 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the oldest version of "Nutcracker" in North America (created by 
Willem Christensen, in 1944), PDT has a Clara who towers over her friends, 
peevishly plays with dolls, then becomes a prima ballerina overnight and dreams 
a royal court with static pages and ladies in waiting. That's one kind of 
fantasy, but when Clara is so composed and doesn't even stick around to see the 
array of dances in her honor, one loses the thread. 
</P>
<P>
 This way, however, Clara does get to dance, and on Saturday night Jacqueline 
Kowskie made the most of that with partner Frank Martinez in both the Snow pas 
de deux and in the Waltz of the Flowers. Dancing a muted but technically 
exciting grand pas de deux were guest artists Elizabeth Loscavio and Mikko 
Nissinen, from San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by artistic director Charles Maple as "in transition from regional 
to professional," PDT features several levels of technical skill, from loose 
around the edges to very respectable. 
</P>

 Generally brisk recordings of the score were well-projected throughout, making 
for a cheerful party scene and well-paced second act, although most of the 
divertissements could use renovation (more dancing, less prancing). JENNIFER

VALLEY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 AT LAST: Construction of the Platt library is nearly complete, 27 years after 
city officials announced plans to add a second community library in Woodland 
Hills. The city bought land at Victory Boulevard and Platt Avenue in 1967, but 
failed bond measures and bickering among neighborhood groups stalled the 
project.The new branch is scheduled to open by February. 
</P>
<P>
 EAGER READERS: Anyone who questions the need for new facilities should know 
that West Valley residents rank among the city's most voracious readers. Before 
the earthquake slowed business, the West Valley Regional Branch in Reseda 
circulated 100,000 books a year, second only to downtown's massive Central 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR THE AGES: Of the Valley's 17 city libraries, only one remains closed since 
the earthquake. The North Hollywood Regional Branch, above, suffered extensive 
damage and officials have proceeded cautiously with repairs. "We wanted the 
building's historic integrity preserved," said Fontayne Holmes, a city 
official. Engineers worked especially hard to save the building's arches, which 
date back to 1929. The library is scheduled to reopen early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 GRANDFATHER: North Hollywood Regional seems young when compared to the San 
Fernando City Library, which is celebrating its 80th anniversary. Founded in 
1914, the library has seen generations of changes. "We used to serve an older, 
Anglo nucleus," said manager Judith Babka. "Now we have a lot of homeless who 
need a place to sit and be warm and read the paper. We also have an 
overwhelming Latino population, so we have Spanish-language books, magazines, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 STRANGE TOMES: Other Valley libraries feature diverse collections. Surrounded 
by movie and television studios, the North Hollywood branch will offer a 
variety of entertainment, educational and instructional videotapes when it 
reopens. The West Valley Regional Branch, on the other hand, specializes in 
auto-repair manuals. David Wharton

KEITH JOSEPH; ARCHITECT OF THATCHER MARKET REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Joseph, the publicity-shy political scientist behind Margaret Thatcher's 
free-market reforms, died Saturday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Joseph died in a London hospital of undisclosed causes.He suffered a 
stroke last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Courteous, reflective and calm, he was probably closer to the former prime 
minister than anyone else in Parliament. It was only after he assured her that 
he would not run for the Tory leadership in 1975 that she sought it herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I have lost one of my dearest friends, England one of her greatest 
men," Lady Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph held many governmental posts after being elected to Parliament in 1956. 
But he avoided the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times in his 30-year political career he found his speeches widely 
misunderstood. His refined and often arcane arguments on high Toryism and the 
class structure led to blazing headlines and intense controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notorious incident occurred in October, 1974, when the Conservatives 
were in opposition in a Labor-led government. He made a speech in Birmingham 
interpreted as a call for more birth control among women in the lowest social 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph, the Oxford-educated son of a baronet, said his words were grossly 
misrepresented.

EDWARD MADIGAN; FORMER AGRICULTURE SECRETARY, CONGRESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Madigan, 58, 10-term congressman and secretary of agriculture under 
President George Bush. A moderate Republican from central Illinois, Madigan 
served six years in the state Legislature before moving to Congress in 1972.In 
1989, he lost a bid for Republican whip to Georgia's Newt Gingrich, incoming 
House Speaker. Madigan was the ranking minority member on the Agriculture 
Committee when Bush picked him to succeed Clayton Yeutter as agriculture 
secretary in 1991. Some of Madigan's most significant handiwork as a legislator 
appeared in the 1985 farm bill. The House Agriculture Committee approved 
production limits and sent the bill to the House floor. But Madigan, who 
favored the free market approach, passed an amendment to kill the production 
limits. As secretary, he sought to make programs more farmer-friendly, improve 
nutritional education and increase research on new uses for farm products. 
Madigan endured some controversy when he admitted writing 49 overdraft checks 
totaling $30,000 on the House bank while he was in Congress. A native of 
Lincoln, Ill., Madigan was educated at Lincoln College. On Thursday in 
Springfield, Ill., of lung cancer.

GEORGE RAMOS: THE LONG ROAD TO LITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concepcion Castillo says it wasn't so long ago that she felt humiliated and 
ashamed. She couldn't read or write. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine how embarrassing it is to have someone write your checks for 
you?" the 74-year-old grandmother from El Salvador asked the other day. "I 
should have learned how long ago, but I never had the time. I was working since 
I was very young, and then I raised a family." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of three-days-a-week lessons, Castillo has learned the basics of 
writing simple sentences and understanding the signs she sees in her 
neighborhood. But in L.A., she knows she's only halfway home in her battle with 
illiteracy because the language she's barely learned to read and write is 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning early next year, the grandmother begins the classes all over again, 
this time in English. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To staffers with El Centro Latino de Educacion Popular, a nonprofit group that 
has established adult literacy programs in the largely immigrant neighborhoods 
near Downtown L.A., Castillo's story is all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the blitz to get recent arrivals conversant in English, it's easy to forget 
that many of them can't even read or write in their own language. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Marcos Cajina, Centro Latino's executive director, more than 
300,000 adults in the county have less than a fifth-grade education. "In our 
experience," Cajina said, "many of these adults never even made it to first 
grade because their families could not afford to send them on the bus or they 
needed them to do housework or work in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many are ill-equipped to learn to read their native tongue, much 
less English. 
</P>
<P>
 In Castillo's case, although she has been in this country since 1970, she has 
failed to learn English despite several classroom tries at it. "I just couldn't 
do it," she remembered. "I kept trying, but I was getting nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Centro Latino was formed in 1991 to offer classes in Spanish to help prepare 
adults like Castillo to make that jump to English. It gives reading, writing 
and math classes in Spanish. And, instead of using traditional subjects, the 
instruction involves the immigrants' own experiences back home or in L.A. So in 
stressing themes like gangs, racism and poverty, Centro Latino's literacy 
campaign fuses a little political activism with the basics of grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an approach that doesn't find much favor in this Proposition 187 era, 
especially among educators who think the best way to learn English is total 
immersion. "Learning another language first, even if it's that person's first 
language, is a waste of time," one language specialist at USC told me. 
</P>
<P>
 Cajina, however, makes no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This approach works," he said. "It does cause some problems with some 
potential funders, but it's been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The program's results so far might seem marginal to some, but Cajina is 
enthusiastic about them. More than 100 students have completed the Spanish 
language classes and more are coming through the door each day, largely because 
of neighborhood canvassing. Arco has donated some computers to complement 
Centro Latino's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Centro Latino relies on volunteers for the bulk of its program because its 
annual budget is a meager $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, it got some free advertising, courtesy of the Pioneer supermarket in 
Echo Park. More than 40,000 grocery bags were printed with the stories of some 
of Centro Latino's students. Among them was Castillo's, told in her own words: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made a big effort to improve myself and now I feel very confident and 
happy because I can read and write. People who do not know how to read cannot 
have any privacy and have to ask others for favors to write their letters. That 
is very humiliating. I have come out of that ignorance. . . . I now feel happy 
to be a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had one of those grocery bags on my desk here at The Times when one of the 
after-hours workers eyed it. He asked if he could have it. Sure, I said, 
figuring he needed it for trash. It turns out he did, but he looked puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what's all this writing on it?" he asked in Spanish. "Is it for free 
food?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's for free classes to learn and write in Spanish," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
 He stared at the bag and then at me. After a few awkward moments, he admitted 
he can't read English or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had the time, too busy working," he said finally. "I got somebody 
here to fill out my application for me."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: YOUTH OPINION; 'A CONFLICT BETWEEN FREEDOM, ORDER 
IN SCHOOLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRAVIS LUND MOON, Travis Lund Moon, 18, is a student at UC Santa Barbara and 
a graduate of Royal High School in Simi Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are prices one must pay for the security of living in a civil society. 
Indeed, throughout history, American government has prided itself on its 
ability to maintain certain degrees of order to keep its citizens safe. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, each day, millions of drivers stop at red lights and strive to 
keep their speed under 55 m.p.h. to obey laws enacted to achieve civil safety. 
They dutifully obey such laws without ever taking into account the fact that 
they have, in a real sense, traded in their freedoms -- to drive when, where 
and how they choose -- in the name of order. Few would argue that such laws are 
repressive or unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, then, do we draw the lines when standards of order overwhelm our basic 
freedoms? I am not speaking of liberal-defined freedoms but the inalienable 
rights -- life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- enumerated by our 
Founding Fathers more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A conflict between these two most basic American values, freedom and order, 
has crept into public schools. A new wave of radical conservatism aims to 
standardize public schools -- and thereby students -- with strict dress codes 
and full uniform policies on the grounds that a student's right to 
self-expression and individuality must be limited to ensure order and safety on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 This argument may have some merit, depending on where the school is located, 
crime statistics or if the campus has experienced any problems. But there is no 
statistical evidence that such dress codes decrease violence or promote safety. 
The point is that these policies disregard students' right to self-expression.  
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley illustrates what I call this fallacy of order over freedom. The 
school board approved a dress-code policy. Two schools in the district, Garden 
Grove Elementary and Valley View Junior High, adopted strict dress codes, 
banning clothing including oversize pants, hats and shirts with any writing or 
pictures other than those with the school logo. (The latter school's policy is 
being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union in court on the grounds 
it violates students' constitutional right to express themselves.) This follows 
moves to implement religious-based abstinence-only sex education and to ban 
some secular literature, all of which is being done, parents and students are 
assured, in the name of "safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Safety? Is that really an issue in this city, which is the safest for its size 
in the nation and home to a high percentage of police officers from throughout 
Southern California? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 I fear the grim reality behind this "order versus freedom" agenda is not to 
ensure a more civil society, but rather one that will be safe from young people 
who choose to exercise their right to think for -- and express -- themselves.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: GIVING BACK; NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH; 'KEEP THE CRIMINAL 
ELEMENT OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH E. PRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent news stories and internal Los Angeles Police Department reports have 
criticized the effectiveness of community policing and suggested that 
Neighborhood Watch volunteers are at risk in the toughest neighborhoods. But 
there are some towns where both concepts work.  
</P>
<P>
 Police volunteer Ralph E. Pray coordinates Neighborhood Watch in Monrovia, a 
San Gabriel Valley city of 36,000 residents. Pray, 67, is a metallurgical 
engineer who runs his own laboratory business. He spoke with BERKLEY HUDSON 
about how community policing and Neighborhood Watch are cutting crime in his 
city.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was drawn into community service because there was a distressing need in 
Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 I have an office building, a one-story, brick building with my business and an 
apartment in it where I live with my wife. On a daily basis I would see illegal 
activity outside on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 There was prostitution, narcotics dealing and some gang activity. I saw this 
for 10 years without doing anything, except occasionally calling the police. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol car would come. But by that time, the people performing the illegal 
acts would stop. Some had police scanners and would hear the dispatch to the 
police car. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, I saw a notice that volunteers were needed by the police 
department. I thought somebody better do something about my neighborhood, that 
this was an opportunity to do something for my community. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of volunteering, I was asked to serve as coordinator for 
Neighborhood Watch. I worked with the crime prevention officer of Monrovia 
police to resurrect Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I volunteered, the new police chief, Joe Santoro, had arrived in town. 
He said: "I'm a Neighborhood Watch man." He went to 40 neighborhood meetings 
that first year. 
</P>
<P>
 As coordinator, I help set up meetings. Sometimes gang experts bring in people 
to show Neighborhood Watch groups the clothing gangs wear. They show people 
what crack looks like. The canine patrol people bring their dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Each police division has made a contribution. It was a new thing for hundreds 
and hundreds of Monrovia residents to have uniformed police in their homes 
telling them what police did and how much police liked the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect was a steamroller. People responded in a positive way. We also had 
earthquake preparedness sessions. The fire chief came. Representatives from the 
electric company, the gas and water companies came. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three nights a week of meetings the first years. We were physically 
trying to bring down the crime rate. We were doing it through education, 
organizing and through the involvement of police with the public. The result 
has been good rapport between the public and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens have to engage in self-policing. This isn't being a vigilante. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation in my neighborhood was difficult. All the dumb criminals were in 
jail. All the smart ones were on my sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 It became evident that the way to clean up my neighborhood required the 
offices of code enforcement, building inspection, the fire department, the 
sanitation department, the health department. 
</P>
<P>
 They could bring so much pressure to bear on landlords, residents and groups 
of people that were not law-abiding. So things did improve. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't seen any repercussions or revenge from other people being involved 
in Neighborhood Watch. But it did happen to me once. I went into the worst 
neighborhood, alone, with a Neighborhood Watch badge on my jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked up to a group of young people. One had a bottle of vodka and was 
drinking. When they saw my (police) I.D., they hustled the drinker away. I told 
them we were going to have a Neighborhood Watch meeting and I needed help. They 
didn't respond. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked up to older people, people watering their lawns and working on cars. 
I had a wonderful response. But when I came back to my car, it was broken into, 
with all four tires flat and my wallet gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The police department can't stop crime. Police can only respond to it. 
Citizens have to stop crime by getting together and keeping the criminal 
element out. 
</P>
<P>
 You control your neighborhood by collectively calling city agencies that bring 
to bear existing regulations that will solve the problems. This has been proven 
in Monrovia. There's been a 21% reduction in crime in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to hear about communities where they say Neighborhood Watch 
doesn't work. There's a big difference in some communities, especially big 
cities, that don't have full cooperation between police and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 We're a small city but we have 2,000 Neighborhood Watch members on 160 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers go into neighborhoods and knock on door after door and say: "Please 
join Neighborhood Watch." When I go, I usually have an officer or two standing 
beside me. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it works. The man or woman in the door of their homes can only 
say: "Somebody cares." If that happens enough times on a block, Neighborhood 
Watch works.

 The word -- orphanage -- rings of something distant in the past. But the 
concept, boarding institutions for children, is a matter of furious debate in 
current welfare reform proposals.The discussion is continued below in today's 
Platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's first orphanage was established in Los Angeles in 1850, 
when the city had only about 2,000 residents. At right are some historical 
snapshots of institutional care in the region.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; LOS ANGELES FREE-NET: A WEALTH 
OF INFORMATION, A LOCAL CALL AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a universe of free, valuable information resources on the Internet. 
What can be costly is the computer and telephone modem, plus the on-line time 
(often long-distance) needed to retrieve it. A fledgling local service, the Los 
Angeles Free-Net, will make 'Net resources a local call away for anyone in L.A. 
County with access to a computer and a modem, whether at home, school or at 
community locations such as libraries or hospitals. Health, education, job and 
government information is available to free-net members seven days a week, 24 
hours a day. There are scores of public access Free-Nets in the works 
nationwide, 33 of which serve other cities. The Los Angeles Free-Net officially 
came on-line seven months ago and is operated by the Encino-Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center and the H.O.P.E. (Hope Opportunities Participation Education) 
Unit Foundation, a cancer support and counseling center. The free-net grew from 
their interest in using modern technologies to offer the same medical 
information and support by computer that they provide on a personal basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, organizers received a $95,000 grant from the U.S. Department of 
Commerce to provide local calling access to the Los Angeles Free-Net from 
anywhere in the county. The free-net expects to offer local call service from 
the 213, 310 and 818 area codes by mid-1995. Current Services on the Internet

</P>
<P>
 1. Local users dial the Los Angeles Free-Net from home, schools, libraries, 
senior centers, hospitals, clinics and other community locations. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Local calls are relayed to switching sites that transfer the calls to the 
free-net's main computer in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The main computer delivers users' requests and messages out onto the 
Internet. The system currently runs on a computer with 16 telephone lines. To 
maximize access members must log-off after each hour of use. Free-Net operators 
hope to expand telephone capacity to 800 lines over the next three years. Los

 "Getting computer information resources can be extremely expensive. Free-Nets 
make available much of the same or similar material for much less. Today, 
information is almost like currency when it comes to managing your life. And in 
a democracy we need to make it available reasonably and in many cases (such as 
free-nets and public libraries) free. The Los Angeles Free-Net is another 
package for information, and it's available to people who can't afford home 
computers and long distance bills to dial in on their own to computer 
resources. It's is a real work of love and a great public service."

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; SURF ROCK'S KING PLAYS A BIT LIGHTER WITH HEIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One way to tame a savage guitar gladiator might be to turn him into a doting 
daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Dale underwent that transformation Saturday night at the Coach House. 
After playing with customary sturm and sizzle through most of the first half of 
his 90-minute set, the surf-rock patriarch was joined on stage by his 
not-quite-3-year-old son Jimmy, behind a kid's-size drum kit, and spent the 
latter part of the show paddling through generally calmer waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, it was a nicely varied, entertaining performance that got across 
Dale's extraordinarily forceful and spontaneous musical personality. But he and 
his band mates, veteran bassist Ron Eglit and newcomer Dave Haynes, didn't get 
into the extended rides that Dale has been known to embark upon. Moving from 
crest to crest, they peaked often, but never quite went over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale's second career wave has been gathering force over the past two years 
with the release of two well-received albums, "Tribal Thunder" and "Unknown 
Territory," which have made him -- at 57 -- by far the oldest rocker to get the 
approval of a young hard-rock following. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his fans are those arbiters of headbanger taste Beavis and Butt-head, 
who gave their seal of approval to his video for the song "Nitro." Now, his 
classic 1962-vintage recording of "Misirlou" is reaching millions as the 
opening-credits music in the hit film "Pulp Fiction" and the lead-off track on 
its hot-selling soundtrack album. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coach House, he played to a nearly full house made up mainly of older 
fans. A fair number of them may have seen him back in the early '60s when he 
was inventing the dramatic, and still-influential, surf-guitar sound at 
teen-dances in Orange County. Now that he has grown accustomed to playing for 
riled-up kids, perhaps he doesn't get as charged up by the older, sit-down 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he may find it hard to activate the savage beast that powers his playing 
when one of his sidekicks is a very cute toddler. Son Jimmy, who stayed for the 
second half of the show, displayed an impressive musical sense for a youngster, 
following Haynes or watching his dad for cues. He isn't the second coming of 
Buddy Rich just yet, but heredity has done its work. (Dale the elder -- who 
assured the audience that Jimmy was equipped with earplugs -- is a natural 
musician who can play just about any instrument, and used to during shows when 
he led big bands with horns and keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 (He gave up the large ensembles after discovering his extraordinary power in a 
trio format during a 1989 Christmas benefit at the Coach House). 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 40 minutes of Saturday's show, Dale garbed himself in the 
mystique and drama of a rocker with a rare gift for harnessing elemental forces 
in his playing. He came on in a leather jacket and a black headband, his 
stringy ponytail falling to the small of his back, and hammered out dramatic 
riffs from "Tribal Thunder" and "Unknown Territory" with body English to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently he squared off with Eglit to play harmonized lines or to carry on a 
conversational give-and-take in the language of heavy guitar-rock. He and Eglit 
also enacted some playful, showman-like rituals: During a version of Link 
Wray's "Rumble," they presented, then rotated their matching gold-flake Fender 
guitars, as if they were palace guards performing some mysterious drill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale played compact versions of "Misirlou," "Nitro" and other hot numbers, but 
his exploratory side wasn't entirely absent. "Let's Go Trippin,' " a bouncy 
number from 1961, metamorphosed into something darker and grander, in the 
Spanish and Middle Eastern mode that he often favors. It was one of several 
pieces in the set that he said he intends to put on his next album, "Calling Up 
Spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the show, as he went for more controlled playing and a more relaxed 
stage presence, some fans clearly craved more explosive displays: There were 
cries of "shred, Dick, shred" and "go, Dick, go." He seemed about to oblige as 
he set off on a closing rendition of the Chantays' surf-instrumental standard 
"Pipeline" (he dedicated it to Stevie Ray Vaughan, who teamed with him for a 
scintillating version of the song in the 1987 film "Back to the Beach"). 
</P>
<P>
 But after tossing in some grinding, revving passages from Henry Mancini's 
"Peter Gunn" theme, he guided "Pipeline" into calmer waters -- actually, he 
abandoned the surf entirely and ended the number, and the night, with a light, 
sentimental Mexican air that evoked dusty border towns. 
</P>
<P>
 In his quieter moments, Dale showed that he doesn't have to shred to be 
interesting. One of his new tunes is an unusual piece with a temperate dynamic 
and an off-kilter, chromatic chord progression. Played in the first half of the 
show, it found Dale and Eglit executing some tricky tandem passages that called 
for delicate detail work rather than explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the second half came when Dale announced "a song I'm fiddling 
with and having a good time (playing)." It turned out to be Jimi Hendrix's 
instrumental "Third Stone From the Sun," and Dale got into its mood of 
exploration and wonder by trying out the memorable theme in various registers, 
dynamics and tones, including a bit of country twang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun to see him in a forum where he could play against his titanic type. 
But it would be an even greater treat to see what he might do given an opening 
slot on tour with one of today's hot young punk or hard rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dale were to go on stage in front of a crowd of Metallica, Pearl Jam, 
Offspring or Green Day fans, they might go by appearances and wonder why anyone 
would invite a big, craggy, old dude to the party. But after 30 or 40 minutes 
of "shred, Dick, shred," they would have a pretty good idea what he was doing 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 (Old Dale fans, new ones, and curious bystanders should note that he is 
playing a free show at 11 p.m. on New Year's Eve at the Hard Rock Cafe in 
Newport Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Cisco Poison could use reinforcements. Bolstering the hard-rock 
trio's sound with a better guitar mix would have been helpful, but what's 
really needed is another player. Led by Joe Wood, the former T.S.O.L. 
front-man, the band recently debuted with "It's A Long Way to Heaven," a strong 
album of stormy, brooding songs powered by full, layered arrangements. On 
stage, something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood played guitar capably if not distinctively, and the bass-and-drums team 
of Mark Rasmussen and Johnny Minguez provided a good, heavy foundation. But in 
virtually every number except a medley of blues standards, "Born Under A Bad 
Sign" and "Back Door Man," there were gaps that a sharp lead guitarist could 
have filled. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of somebody who knows how to embroider a chorus and 
complement and prod a singer, the raspy-voiced Wood would be able to 
concentrate on dramatizing the songs and serving as a visual focal point. 
Double duty as guitarist and singer/showman left him stretched too thin.

THEATER REVIEW; 'RED SKY': A JOURNEY OF LIFE, HUMOR AND MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By M.E. WARREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A short English-language program note was tucked away in the otherwise 
completely Chinese playbill for Performance Workshop's touring "Red Sky" at the 
Irvine Barclay Friday and Saturday. It characterized the eminent Taiwanese 
troupe's gentle portrait of aging as having been "constructed more on the 
principles of poetry or music" than those of "conventional" theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Red Sky" does play rather like a concerto for a small ensemble. And 
though some of the poetry may have been lost on the non-Chinese-speaking 
members of the audience (even with the English supertitles), the eight actors 
endeared us to the irascible, foolish, passionate, funny and very human old 
folks they portrayed, who are living out their final hours in a Taiwanese 
retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 Living, as opposed to dying, is most certainly what these old people are 
about. But director Stan Lai never let the audience forget that, for all of us, 
time is finite. Two large digital clocks, the kind seen in American sports 
arenas, flanked the stage. They were set for 123:00 minutes; the countdown 
began as the lights came up. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no intermission. More than two hours with no break is a challenge to 
the audience; the clocks became reference points for how well we were holding 
up. I found myself checking them regularly, sometimes surprised at how swiftly 
the time had gone, sometimes dismayed to see that I would be sitting a good 
while longer, sometimes noting poignantly that for the characters onstage, the 
clocks hitting 00:00 meant a good deal more than a chance to stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The visual production was deliberately spare. Settings were suggested with a 
few set pieces and the changing flood of color that illuminated the painted 
backdrop. Aside from the God-like clocks, the images were like delicate 
miniatures etched into a soft stone: The backgrounds had faded and left the old 
people floating alone in the front, a telling metaphor for the isolation of old 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 The very first image of the play is of a bed, shrouded in a dark blanket, 
isolated in a spotlight. When the shroud is lifted, the bed is revealed as a 
pile of suitcases and boxes ready to accompany the old people on their final 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 The leitmotifs that echo throughout "Red Sky" are of journeying. The 
production is bracketed by the suggestion of a train ride and the scenes are 
like stops along the way, each with its particular scenery and sense of 
farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey itself is full of life, music, humor, and reminders to look around 
and enjoy the view while there is still time. Singling out an individual 
performance is impossible, partly because the program did not list the actors' 
names in English, but mostly because each and every performer was wonderful in 
his or her own right. Their skills were obvious, their ensemble work exemplary, 
and one only wished that one could speak Chinese so as to have appreciated 
their artistry more fully.

DANCE REVIEW; 'NUTCRACKER' BY LACB HAS RIGHT RECIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Nutcrackers" were fast food -- and at this time of year it sometimes seems 
they are -- Los Angeles Classical Ballet could claim that the popularity of its 
version rests on the choreographers' secret recipe. Launching the company's 
"Nutcracker" season Friday night at the Long Beach Convention Center, LACB 
knows what traditional ingredients to mix in -- all of them. This means sugar 
and spice and great special effects -- without losing emphasis on classical 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographers David Wilcox and Terri Lewis keep the first act party scene 
lively with difficult doll dances (well done by Kristin Douglas, Edward Cueto 
and Kristopher Jones) and a focus on Clara that highlighted young Melissa 
Watson's beautiful placement and ease on pointe. They also know when to make 
room for scenery when it dances: The tree growing and snow scene transition 
made full use of Tchaikovsky's majestic crescendos. 
</P>
<P>
 Personalities can also make "Nutcracker" cook: In the Snow pas de deux Mayumi 
Hanabusa and Aidar Akhmetov blended graceful athleticism with glittering 
enthusiasm. In the second act, Yan Lin stood out in a strongly simmering 
Arabian Dance, and Lisa Cueto was a willowy chief Mirliton. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortest dancers of the evening were appealing as they emerged from Mother 
Ginger's skirt, but for show stealing, no one could beat the wild and crazy 
Russian Dance, choreographed by Alexander Kalinin. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of Roger Hickman, the LACB Orchestra was wonderfully 
crisp, light and dramatic by turns, but had some balance problems during the 
grand pas de deux. Danced by Lilia Mousavarova and Anton Labuschagne, this was 
the most disappointing moment choreographically as well, depending on an excess 
of sweeping poses instead of steps that link the couple to the majesty of the 
music.

STREET SMART: THE METHOD TO THE MADNESS OF THE MYSTERY STOP SIGNS 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few years, the Rancho Santa Margarita Town Center shopping area 
will be built up and eventually completed. Currently, between Santa Margarita 
Parkway and Antonio Parkway, a narrow two-lane road has been opened through 
what will one day be the center of Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This road -- El Paseo -- has two stop signs on it, yet there are no cross 
streets, no construction traffic, nothing. Not even the curb structure for 
future road crossings has been built. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any point in making traffic stop at these signs for the two years it 
takes before enough commercial buildings are completed to warrant constructing 
these cross streets? Many motorists are (rightly, I believe) simply running the 
stop signs because there is no reason to stop. Can these signs perhaps be 
covered until they have a purpose to serve? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 There is a method to the madness of having those stop signs on El Paseo now, 
said Ignacio Ochoa, county traffic engineer. The county hopes to get drivers 
into the habit now of slowing and stopping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Paseo is not intended to act as a shortcut to connect Antonio and Santa 
Margarita parkways. Rather it is a private road that eventually will be heavily 
trafficked by pedestrians and Town Center shoppers, he said. Eventually, the 
road will have diagonal parking and pedestrian amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Faster traffic should consider using Alma Aldea as an alternate route or 
continue on the major arteries of Antonio and Santa Margarita, Ochoa said.

 Dear Street Smart:  
</P>
<P>
 I have noted that more and more automobiles lack front license plates. Section 
5200 of the California Vehicle Code states that when two plates are issued for 
a vehicle they must be placed on the front and rear of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 I am an instructor in the 55-Alive safe driving program and my students 
sometimes ask about this. In response to other reader questions on minor 
offenses, you have responded that police officers don't have time to enforce 
the law in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, we can accept that rationale, but if that is the answer to this 
problem, my question would be why does the state continue to issue front plates 
if they really are not that important? 
</P>
<P>
 The state of California has been faced with severe budget problems for the 
last few years. Couldn't we save both the money and the metal, as many other 
states do, by simply issuing rear license plates? Why does the state continue 
with this licensure program if they are not going to enforce it? Why do they 
feel the front plate is important when other states seemingly have a different 
view? 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol staunchly maintains the need for two plates, 
said Bill Madison, a spokesman for the Department of Motor Vehicles. And the 
CHP does enforce this two-plate law, said CHP spokesman Steve Kohler. Officers 
will ticket a vehicle if they see it's missing a front or back plate, he said. 
In the past two years, the CHP statewide has issued more than 89,000 citations 
for this offense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no proposals to change the law, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, a law was passed requiring gas stations to have devices on 
pumps so self-service customers could insert the nozzle, turn on the gas pump, 
walk away and let the gasoline flow automatically until the tank is filled. 
That way customers would not have to breathe any escaping gasoline fumes. Now, 
there are some self-service stations where these devices are broken and they 
are not being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 They are heedless to complaints. To whom can we report these stations? 
</P>
<P>
 David Green 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which issues operating 
permits to gas stations in Orange County, also is responsible for citing gas 
stations with malfunctioning vapor recovery equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 To report a faulty nozzle, including the gadget that allows hands-free 
pumping, call the district at 1-800-242-4020. Between 7 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday, you can talk to a person, but after business hours you 
can leave a voice mail message. Provide specific information, including the 
name and location of the gas station and the pump number.

SCHOOLS IN FILLMORE NOT YET SERVING BREAKFAST; NUTRITION: STATE GRANTS ARE 
AVAILABLE FOR THE PROGRAM. MORE THAN HALF OF THE DISTRICT'S STUDENTS QUALIFY 
FOR FREE OR LOW-COST MORNING MEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seventeen months after California started offering special grants to feed 
school breakfasts to needy students, the Fillmore Unified School District still 
serves no morning meal. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is not for lack of need: 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 54% of Fillmore schoolchildren are eligible for free or 
reduced-price meals because their parents' wages leave them at or near the 
federal poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no breakfast program, said Barbara Spieler, business director, 
because of logistical problems in making it work: bus schedules to be juggled, 
multipurpose rooms to be cleared and the late arrival of state paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant application forms arrived in Fillmore only last month, just two or three 
weeks before they were due back at the state Department of Education, Spieler 
said, and there was insufficient time to study the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that next year . . . we'd try to take a look at the schedules and 
get all the logistics straightened out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Fillmore teachers must put up with students who are fidgety or sleepy 
by midmorning because they have eaten no breakfast. It may hit hardest in 
children with medical problems such as diabetes or migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher said she even shares her own sandwiches with the hungriest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know I have children that don't eat breakfast. They tell me that they're 
hungry," said Jan Lee, who teaches first and second grade at Fillmore's San 
Cayetano School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to do your work when you haven't had breakfast," Lee said. 
"Sometimes I end up giving them part of my lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore district nurse Martha Romero was even more pointed: "They have their 
hard subjects in the morning, and they come to the nurse's office complaining 
of headaches or stomachaches. A lot of times, kids come in with the symptoms of 
being hypoglycemic. If they had their last meal at 6 or 7 o'clock the night 
before, how can they focus?" 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said she sometimes lectures parents about the importance of feeding 
their children breakfast. And, she said, some Fillmore teachers try to inject 
the breakfast gospel into their regular lessons on health or nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lower grades, especially the kindergarten classrooms, teachers ask 
students to bring a snack, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the kids will bring a bag of oranges or a bag of apples or bananas 
and share with the other kids," she said. "I think it makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the benefits of a good breakfast can be seen at Cesar E. Chavez 
School, the first in the Oxnard Unified School District to offer free 
breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Students no longer nod off or act up in class quite as much, teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Grades and scholastic test scores have been rising, according to the 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 And the district nurse says 8- to 10-year-old girls have stopped coming to her 
office with fresh burns on their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls would have to heat up the beans or fry the eggs for their little 
brothers or sisters" after their parents left for work at dawn, nurse Linda 
Butcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were trying to fix breakfasts for their families," Butcher said. "The 
tortilla would spit hot grease on their arms while they were cooking. I'd see 
as much as a case a week." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they are planning to extend the year-old program 
throughout the Oxnard district's other schools that serve needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard's Christa McAuliffe School, for instance, hungry students cause 
trouble, do poorly in class and even fall asleep at their desks, Principal 
Dennis Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have students who are tired, irritable and cranky," he said last week. 
"These inevitably are the students who could be agitated on the playground, 
students who are mad at someone in the corridor for bumping into them 
accidentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he is "hoping to see a turnaround" when his elementary school 
starts serving breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 That will happen after district officials obtain grants from the state 
Department of Education to buy cafeteria equipment so they can serve free or 
reduced-price breakfasts at five schools: McAuliffe, Curren, Emily Ritchen and 
Lemonwood elementary schools and Nueva Vista alternative school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students miss breakfast for several reasons, officials said: Parents may lack 
time or money to prepare breakfast, and children themselves may sleep late or 
leave early without eating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is an important program for children," said Pera Jambazian, 
district director of child nutrition services. "If they eat correctly, 
especially in the morning, they pay more attention in school."

COUNTY LAGS IN EFFORTS TO BUILD A STATE UNIVERSITY; EDUCATION: LATEST PROPOSED 
SITE IS EMBROILED IN LITIGATION. FOUR OTHER REGIONS HAVE MOVED AHEAD ON STATE'S 
PRIORITY LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The top official for the Cal State University system in Ventura County says 
she is devastated by continuing delays in planning a state university locally 
and doubts that it will be built before she retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been heartbroken over the length of time it's taken in Ventura County," 
said Joyce Kennedy, 60, director of the Cal State Northridge-Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still think it's going to happen in my time, but I've given up on 
that," she said. "There are times when I'm angry, and there are times when I'm 
terribly, terribly dejected. How long must we wait?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two decades, proposals for campus sites have come and gone. The 
latest, an area of land that includes a lemon grove west of Camarillo, is 
embroiled in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Kennedy has watched in distress as four other sites have crept ahead 
of Ventura County on the state's priority list. They have been moved ahead of 
the planned campus she has championed for 20 years in the largest county still 
lacking a California state college. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, enrollment at the Ventura satellite campus has increased and 
state funding has dwindled, prompting boosters to launch all-out fund-raising 
drives to pay for such basic services as new computers and classes threatened 
with cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had higher enrollment," Kennedy said, noting that the campus had 
the equivalent of 650 full-time students in the spring, up 9% over the previous 
year. But "even though our enrollment is the highest ever, the budget is not 
what it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she said, such communities as Monterey, San Marcos, Concord and 
Palm Desert seem to have leapfrogged ahead of Ventura County in efforts to 
establish four-year colleges in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials said the efforts in those four areas are unrelated 
to their commitment to bring a public university to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they said, it is the county's failure to secure a location for the 
proposed Cal State Ventura that has thwarted its establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, three potential sites have been scrapped. A Taylor Ranch location 
near the junction of the Ventura Freeway and California 33 was rejected by the 
Ventura City Council in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's still very painful for me to talk about," Kennedy said. "It set us 
back I don't know how many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle voted against the Taylor Ranch site. But he 
said the state improperly blamed the city for its own shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a good site," Tuttle said. "They realized they made a mistake when 
they looked at all the costs, then they needed a scapegoat to get out of it 
without admitting they'd made their own mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said he has no regrets about his vote, despite claims by Kennedy and 
others that it delayed a local university by years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It set back the university about 11 months, or 12 months," he said. "That's 
how long it took them to find a better site." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials have since settled on a 260-acre site off Beardsley Road, 
a two-parcel site sprinkled with lemon groves in the greenbelt between 
Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the two landowners has refused to sell, forcing state officials to 
file suit to condemn the property. That's where the project is now stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to get the property without going through the legal 
issues," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, of the state chancellor's office in Long 
Beach. "We certainly thought it was going to be a lot easier to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ventura County has struggled with finding acreage to house a public 
university, a new college has sprung up in north San Diego County, and another 
one is scheduled to open at the abandoned Fort Ord near Monterey next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earmarked for off-campus centers are sites in Contra Costa County and Palm 
Desert, where city officials recently donated 40 acres to the state with a 
promise to save another 160 acres should a full campus ever be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this makes any sense to Patrick Callan, executive director of the 
California Higher Education Policy Center in San Jose, an independent nonprofit 
group that tracks state university trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's "concerns are very well-taken," Callan said, "because the site 
selection processes for new campuses are in very serious danger of turning into 
political footballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be that the communities with the most political clout rather than 
those with the most need are the ones who will get new universities." 
</P>
<P>
 As example No. 1, Callan cites Cal State Monterey Bay, where he said there is 
no justification for spending $140 million or more to transform Fort Ord into a 
four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply because it was offered as a gift and the land was free, we are now 
committed to an incredibly expensive undertaking," Callan said. "We're building 
a campus where there is no demand, and we're asking students to move there as 
opposed to building a campus where we need one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bentley-Adler responded that "you just don't turn down" offers of free 
land such as the opportunity at Fort Ord. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the $140 million is coming from the federal government, and that 
only about $10 million in state university funds has been designated for 
Monterey Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten million dollars out of a $2-billion budget really isn't that much money," 
Bentley-Adler said. "It would be foolish of us not to build a campus there." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a new university has opened seemingly from scratch in San Marcos, a 
small north San Diego County city with big growth and even bigger aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went by Ventura like a freight train," said Peter MacDougall, president 
of Santa Barbara City College who chairs the CSUN-Ventura community advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They established the land, they acquired the land, and now it's up and 
running," MacDougall said. "The difficulty is in the land acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley-Adler said no state university project has been bumped ahead of 
Ventura County. But a series of factors conspired to delay construction of the 
long-planned Cal State Ventura, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circumstances at the other campuses have just been more favorable," she said. 
"Sometimes that happens. It hasn't been that Ventura's been pushed back. It's 
just that the other campuses have come to fruition sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the quick progress of Monterey Bay, San Marcos and the other 
communities has discouraged those who have worked locally for years to land a 
public university in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody that's been involved is frustrated at this point," said Stan 
Whisenhunt, a local publicist who sits on the CSUN-Ventura community advisory 
committee with MacDougall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been sitting here kind of marking time while these other areas are 
moving ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisenhunt is not the only committee member full of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bothered me all along, when San Marcos and all the others beat us," said 
Dorothy Jue Lee, a member of the state Board of Education who also sits on the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's nothing we can do about it until we get behind a site in 
Ventura," said Lee, a former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) agrees. He said he has been working 
with state university officials for years to build a university in Ventura 
County. But without a place to put it, the project stands idle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the CSU has been in extensive negotiations with the potential sellers 
with a desirable site," said O'Connell, a former Oxnard High School social 
studies teacher. "CSU wants to avoid litigation and, without a doubt, it's been 
very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the land is acquired, through purchase or condemnation, O'Connell 
concedes that financing construction and operation of the college would require 
a commitment of funds from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is dependent on the electorate and whether the voters are willing 
to pass bond measures," he said. "With any new campus, we're going to have to 
supplement revenue sources so it does not become a drain on the existing 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Palm Desert, which last month donated 40 acres to the CSU for an 
off-campus center of Cal State San Bernardino, said his community has 
experienced none of the opposition to a public university that Ventura County 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford Crites, who works as a speech instructor at College of the Desert, said 
his fast-growing city has seemingly moved ahead of Ventura County because of 
its commitment to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the state of California chooses to have the resources to not make this 
that the Coachella Valley wins and Ventura County loses," the mayor said. "No 
one in this valley has any intention to move something away from other areas in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Crites conceded, "we're doing our best to tend to our needs well ahead of 
our time." 
</P>
<P>
 The state chancellor's office said a campus is warranted in the Palm Desert 
area because more and more people are moving there. But that off-campus center 
attracts fewer than half the 1,400 students at CSUN-Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got some real explosive growth out there in the desert," 
Bentley-Adler said. "It may not be a new campus right now, but certainly down 
the line there's going to be the need for a new campus." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal approved last month also sets aside another 160 acres should the 
state choose to build a permanent campus in Palm Desert, which spent nearly $11 
million to acquire the 40 acres and donate it to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good common sense," Crites said. "The end result of this 
multimillion-dollar investment will be an influx of the kinds of citizens we 
want, young people we want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any taxpayer should say, 'Well done,' not 'Government giveaway,' " he said. 
People in Ventura County, he added, "need to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Kennedy declined to chastise Ventura County officials for not 
displaying the same commitment to higher education that desert community 
officials have shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she works daily to keep the progress toward a public university in 
Ventura County humming. A telethon is scheduled in the spring, as is a series 
of other fund-raisers in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it takes," she said, "short of selling my soul."

'CONTROLLED CHAOS'; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB KEEPS CHILDREN BUSY AFTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 4 p.m. in the main game room of the Camarillo Boys & Girls Club, and the 
place is awash in the sights and sounds of happy children. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Temple Avenue building, kids are playing pool, Foosball and 
board games. Laughter -- oscillating between high-pitched shrieks and a low 
roar -- fills the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gymnasium, the staccato of basketballs hitting the hardwood floor 
reverberates to the ceiling and back. Kids contort as they shoot hoops under 
the watchful eyes of a recreation supervisor. An hour later, these future 
Michael Jordans will be replaced with dozens of white-robed miniature Bruce 
Lees as a karate class begins. 
</P>
<P>
 In an adjoining room, an imaginary tea party has begun. Next door, future golf 
stars are practicing their putting and, nearby, another group is staging a mock 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best description we can think of is that it's a state of controlled 
chaos," said Jay Grigsby, the club's executive director for the past 5 1/2 
years. "We think it's healthy for kids to have some fun after school. We have 
to remember that they need to blow off steam every once in awhile, just like we 
(adults) do." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that the scores of kids who daily descend upon the club keep 
disputes about the position of a cue ball or the possession of a favorite doll 
good-natured, a small cadre of adult supervisors stand by to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep a sharp eye on our kids," Grigsby said. "We don't permit violence or 
rough-housing. We expect and want kids to have a good time, but we also expect 
them to demonstrate good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 Camarillo-area children enrolled and about 200 to 300 
kids visiting the facility each day, club officials launched a fund-raising 
drive to pay for an expansion and remodeling program for the 21-year-old 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The building goal -- $1.3 million -- was reached earlier this month, and 
construction is slated to begin early in the spring, Grigsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the facility to be expanded by several thousand square feet, 
with the new rooms housing computer labs, learning centers and a meeting place 
for teen-agers. Grigsby said an additional $1 million will be raised to help 
endow the club and its programs. The club operates on an annual budget of about 
$500,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First established in a little house on Barry Street in 1967, the club, one of 
the largest and oldest in Ventura County, offers more than sports and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides traditional athletics, the club offers boys and girls programs in 
drama, cooking, self-defense and computing, as well as help in completing 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Yates, the club's operations director, said the facility has worked 
hard to become a place where parents know that their children will be safe and 
have their minds engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Boys & Girls Clubs) have been known as the clubs that beat the streets," 
Yates said. "Here in Camarillo, the problems we face don't involve just beating 
the streets: It's finding new ways to challenge and stimulate the kids 
intellectually and culturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Lisagor, a pediatric dentist who has served on the club's board of 
directors for 14 years, says the role of the club in providing a quality 
after-school program has become increasingly important to many area families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often kids are left with a part-time sitter, Nintendo and the 
television," Lisagor said. "We want a place were the kids are in a safe 
environment that is structured but not too structured. We want to give them a 
place were they can have fun and learn new things." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some services, such as bus transportation, cost extra, the club's 
basic enrollment fee is $12 a year for children 6 to 18, club officials said. 
The facility is open from 2 to 8 p.m. during the school year and longer during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much for them to do," said Chris McGivney, 35, whose sons, 
9-year-old Andrew and Matthew and 10-year-old Christopher, visit the club 
several times a week. "I can't believe what a great program this is. The boys 
like it and I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Villa, a 35-year-old aerospace designer, said he is more comfortable at 
work in Moorpark knowing that his son, Michael, 7, is in a safe and supervised 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been involved with the club for about a year now and I have had no 
complaints," Villa said. "For those days when no one is going to be home until 
later in the day, you can't beat this." 
</P>
<P>
 Stretched out on a green expanse of carpeting, 8-year-old Jayce Couplin cannot 
be bothered by the inquiries of a visitor -- after all, he's commanding a 
plastic army in what appears to be an epic battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have the mortars," Jayce said. "They're good, but the army with 
the tanks are better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, 8-year-old Stephanie Mince is playing the role of a sleeping family 
cat while her friends act out the parts of parents getting the evening supper 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fixing mushroom soup and I'm going to get some," the black-masked 
Stephanie said. "I like playing the kitty because everyone pays attention to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in a quieter area away from the games room, Ventura College student 
Arlene Sadowsky is helping a handful of children get through their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadowsky, a 20-year-old Camarillo resident, says she attended the club when 
she was a child. She now volunteers time each week between classes, where she 
is studying to become a pediatric nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid, I spent a lot of time here. I just wanted to give something back," 
Sadowsky said. "I've had some very happy days here and I wanted to help."

STREET SMART: SHRUBS AT INTERSECTION POSE BUSHY PROBLEM FOR DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a really dangerous problem at an intersection in downtown Camarillo 
that could be remedied with a gardener's clippers in less than three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists who wish to turn right onto Arneill Road from westbound Daily Drive 
must first contend with a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars on Arneill, which serves as an overpass for the Ventura Freeway, are 
driving at speeds up to 35 m.p.h. The problem is that those cars are largely 
hidden from view because of overgrown shrubs on the east side of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way to be certain that there are no fast-moving cars coming at you 
from the left until they are within about 15 feet of your stopped car. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you zip out onto Arneill with your fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a cautious senior citizen driver, and I use this intersection almost 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if I possessed Clark Kent's super vision, I would still be taking my life 
into my own hands at this spot. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that this is a site with a history of fender-benders, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mort Steirer, Camarillo

<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are not the first to complain about the unruly bushes near the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received a complaint several months ago about the bushes, which were 
planted as part of a landscaping project in 1991, Traffic Engineer Tom Fox 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is studying whether the bushes should be removed, Fox says. In the 
meantime, they will be pruned within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the complaints, there have been no accidents caused by poor visibility 
at this intersection in the recent past, Fox says. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing about the traffic signal on Pleasant Valley Road just south of 
the Ventura Freeway in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a problem for anyone driving south on Pleasant Valley who wants to 
make a left turn onto the access road for the park-and-ride lot near the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait for a green arrow is very long, even though the opposing traffic is 
very light. 
</P>
<P>
 If this left-turn arrow were changed to a regular green light, cars would be 
allowed to turn much more easily, instead of having to wait for the arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 I have written to Caltrans, but have received no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of my car pool have also written to Caltrans without reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Please help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Schechter, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your wait is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation has conducted a traffic count at the 
traffic signal on Pleasant Valley Road and discovered that you are right, 
Traffic Engineer Luu Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Oncoming traffic is light, and there is no need for a left-turn arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans plans to replace the arrow with a regular traffic light within a 
week, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 You really disappointed us in your Nov. 21 response to Bruce Pritchard of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote to complain about the vehicles that speed on his street and how they 
imperil the many children who play in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 While we agree that the speeders are a hazard, the obvious question you failed 
to deal with is why these adults are allowing their children to play in the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard says none of the children has been injured yet, but wants the speeds 
lowered before that happens. 
</P>
<P>
 We know of numerous vehicle-versus-pedestrian collisions, and we can assure 
him that a child being struck by a car doing 25 m.p.h. is as likely to be 
injured as one struck by a car doing 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to the children's safety is TO GET THEM OUT OF THE STREET! 
</P>
<P>
 The city provides parks and playgrounds for recreation. The streets are for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Please do all of us a big favor and remind your readers to teach their 
children how to safely use the roadways and to keep their games, toys and 
unapproved vehicles off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mauch, Hugh Wahler and Robert Evans, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is inevitable that children will be in the roadway when crossing 
the street or riding bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in January, when a state law goes into effect requiring children on 
bicycles to wear helmets, parents will get some help in teaching road safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their enforcement plan, schools and police departments throughout 
Ventura County are planning to step up safety education efforts.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NEWSPAPER GROUP NAMES NEW EDITOR

<P>
 Albuquerque Tribune Editor Timothy J. Gallagher has been named editor of the 
Ventura County Star group of newspapers, company officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, 38, will replace John R. Irby, who abruptly resigned late last week 
citing "philosophical differences" with the company's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor of the Tribune since 1987, Gallagher will take control of the 
newspapers Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher's hiring and Irby's resignation are the latest in a series of 
management changes in the Ventura County newspaper group, which is owned by 
Ohio-based Scripps Howard newspapers. Gallagher has been a Scripps journalist 
for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's daily newspapers have undergone several changes since publisher 
John P. Wilcox arrived last year. Coverage of local news has been shifted to 
pages deeper inside the main section, the price of home delivery has been 
increased and, late last month, the Star-Free Press and its editions changed 
their names to the Star. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks papers have also added Star to their 
mastheads. J. E. MITCHELL

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks man was listed in good condition Sunday at Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center after being shot in the right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Moran, 38, was shot late Saturday after arriving at the Thousand Oaks 
home of his estranged wife to retrieve property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A verbal and physical fight ensued, and another man confronted Moran, 
investigators said. The victim fled the residence in the 2100 block of Calle 
Camelia and sought treatment at Los Robles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are searching for the gunman but no description of the suspect 
was provided in police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being investigated by the major crimes unit of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MALATHION SPRAYING SLATED FOR TUESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo's 16-square-mile Medfly eradication zone will undergo its fifth 
aerial application of malathion Tuesday night, agricultural officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather and winds permitting, the trio of helicopters will lift off at 10 p.m. 
from Camarillo Airport, said Doug Hendrix, spokesman for the state and federal 
Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service meteorologists said onshore winds ranging from 10 to 
15 m.p.h. may hit the Camarillo area Tuesday night, but no rain is expected. 
Hendrix said state regulations forbid the spraying of pesticides in areas where 
winds are higher than 10 m.p.h. or when there is a 50% or greater chance of 
rain immediately following an application. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrix said residents living in the eradication zone should cover cars and 
fishponds, and keep children and pets indoors during the four-hour spraying 
operation. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; JURY REJECTS CLAIM OF POLICE BRUTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man's claims of police brutality during a 1989 arrest have been 
rejected by a Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated about three hours before voting 11 to 1 Friday that force 
used in the Jan. 27, 1989, arrest of Alejandro Guzman-Flores was reasonable, 
said attorney Alan Wisotsky, who represented the city of Oxnard and a police 
officer named in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In civil cases, only nine votes are required to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman-Flores claimed during the 10-day trial before Judge Fred Jones that 
Officers Jana Young and Fred Sedillos beat him on the head and damaged one of 
his eyes when they arrested him while investigating a report of an armed man. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman-Flores' lawsuit, filed in November, 1989, said he was working in a 
motorcycle repair shop when his supervisor asked him to investigate a noise in 
the alley. It was there that Guzman-Flores, 21 at the time, encountered Young 
and Sedillos. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisotsky said the officers initially believed that Guzman-Flores might have 
been the man with the gun and treated him as such. During the arrest, 
Guzman-Flores put up a fight, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The force was necessary and justified under the circumstances," Wisotsky 
said. "He was actively resisting, (although) he was never an aggressor." 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, Guzman-Flores sought $500,000 in damages, Wisotsky said. He 
claimed to have lost $50,000 in wages since the incident and said the total 
medical bill is expected to reach $25,000. BARBARA MURPHY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; PARENTS TAKE ENGLISH CLASSES TO HELP KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a child on one arm and another clinging to her pants, Lidia Araoz of 
Oxnard tried to repeat the words as the teacher instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, every week, every month," Araoz intoned. But then she was 
interrupted by her 2-year-old son, who wanted to show her something outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Araoz, 41, is one of 60 adults taking English language classes at Oxnard's 
Driffill School so that they can help their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a mother of English-speaking children, I need to know the language, too," 
Araoz said. "If I don't, I lose part of my authority as a parent and I won't be 
able to feel comfortable with my own children." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other mothers in the group, Araoz came to the United States years ago and 
has kept Spanish as the primary language spoken at home. But when her oldest 
son began school in Oxnard, Araoz realized that the family also needed to speak 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to help my children with their homework and help them to function at 
school," she said. "If I don't speak the language, I'm limited at what I can do 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The program began in September after several parents expressed a willingness 
to learn English but were unable to attend the evening classes offered by some 
schools, said Martha Flournoy, who helped develop the program. 
</P>
<P>
 So three times a week, while their older children attend school, the group of 
mostly mothers also hits the classroom, taking their younger children with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-hour class, they learn to write, read and speak English as 
their toddlers play with each other and the toys nearby. Older students who are 
off school sometimes baby-sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go to classes in the evenings because that's when my children and my 
husband are home," said Isabel Chavez, mother of two. "This is a great 
opportunity for me to learn, and it's also a convenient time. 
</P>
<P>
 But mothers are not the only ones taking advantage of the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiree Gregorio Figueroa, 66, is one of the few men attending the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had the time to learn English. I was always either working or taking 
care of my family," Figueroa said. "Now that my children are on their own, I'm 
taking time to do the things I always wanted to do." CHRISTINA LIMA

MIKE DOWNEY: JUG OF GATORADE MIGHT BE IN ORDER FOR RAIDERS, SHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Jaegers kicked the horseshoes off the Broncos, 23-13, Sunday 
at the Coliseum on a day when their kicker outscored Denver all by himself. 
After watching his old college classmate from Washington deliver a 
Raider-record fifth field goal, 310-pound lineman Kevin Gogan couldn't squeeze 
past the 190-pounder in a crowded hallway without uttering the ultimate in 
praise for any kicker, "That Jeff Jaeger is a player!" 
</P>
<P>
 Two victories in six days. Just that fast, the Raiders have transformed from 
unhappy players into happy players. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver is dead and San Diego is dying. Kansas City hasn't beaten anybody since 
before Thanksgiving. No team in their division except the Raiders has won two 
games in a row. OK, I'll say it if they won't: The Raiders are going to run the 
table, win the division and open the playoffs at home. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the news, good night and see you in January. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, so I might not be right. I say I am. Denver, dead. San Diego, 
dying. Call in Coach Kevorkian. And better keep an eye on Kansas City tonight. 
Those Chiefs have been looking kind of sickly themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders might be pouring a cold pail of Gatorade over Art Shell's head 
before this thing is over. Something has visibly changed. Something is 
definitely different. "From what I can see," rookie linebacker Rob Fredrickson 
said, "it's a totally different team from the first half of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't winning by three touchdowns, but so what? They aren't losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, what do you want us to do?" receiver Tim Brown asked. "Sit here and be 
upset because we didn't score 40 points?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams, who scored their only touchdown, freely admits that the 
offense isn't exactly moving the ball at will. He probably knows that the 
Raiders have reached 30 points only twice all season. 
</P>
<P>
 But so? 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three or four games have been pretty ugly," Williams said. "But when 
we do put together a perfect game, it'll be something to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're saving it for Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City will be the last game of the season, come Christmas Eve. By then, 
the Raiders will know what's what. They go to the Seattle Kingdome next week to 
try to keep the ceiling from crashing on them, then return home to try to wrap 
up Joe Montana with a big ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense. That's why the Raiders are still in this race. No opponent has 
scored more than 21 points against the Raiders since Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me repeat that. Since September.  
</P>
<P>
 Try as they might, the Denver Broncos couldn't bang the ball into the end zone 
until it was too late. Life without John Elway is not a pretty sight in the 
state of Colorado. Hugh Millen couldn't push a football over a goal line with a 
first down at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, Hugh: 
</P>
<P>
 Four quarterback sneaks, pal. You're 6 feet 5, for Pete's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have the Raiders dug in harder. Aundray Bruce, Albert Lewis, Nolan 
Harrison, Jerry Ball, everybody but Gunther Cunningham, John Fox, Jim Haslett 
and Ray Hamilton was out there waiting for that bucking Bronco on that goal 
line, and they couldn't be out there because they're coaches. The ballcarrier 
went down and the Raider spirits went up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cause and effect," Ball put it perfectly. "Make a play like that, brings them 
down, lifts you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway plays, he probably calls a quarterback draw and jogs across the goal 
line, untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Even linebacker Greg Biekert of the Raiders had to concede, "We did pretty 
well against Elway last time, but let's be honest: With him not playing, it's a 
different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything looks different now to the (playoff-bound?) Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 First came several weeks of hell. Week after week, the Raiders struggled. They 
got slaughtered by San Francisco, 44-14, by Seattle, 38-9, by Pittsburgh, 21-3. 
They were only three points better than the Rams, 20-17, only three better than 
Houston, 17-14. Dissension. Recrimination. A team on the verge of a breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And then this -- six days, two victories. That's how fast it can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, to quote Patrick Bates of the Raider secondary, "We've still got a 
shot at thetitle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders? Yeah, the Raiders.

MIKE PENNER: 49ERS SHOW THE CHARGERS HOW CHAMPIONS PERFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember when the Chargers were 6-0 and Natrone Means was on the cover of 
Sports Illustrated? 
</P>
<P>
 (If you can't, consult a librarian or an older relative; it actually 
happened.) 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when San Francisco-San Diego on Dec. 11 was going to be a "Super Bowl 
preview?" Oh, how we pined and we waxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young vs. Stan Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Norton Jr. vs. Junior Seau. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice vs. Tony Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the timeless matchups were countless. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the 49ers and the Chargers finally got around to bashing facemasks 
at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, however, said Super Bowl preview was found to 
be sorely lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 One Super Bowl-caliber team, to be precise. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are still on track. Barring an Achilles' tendon tear by Young or the 
sudden transformation of Barry Switzer from official Texas state loon to 
Lombardi II, the 49ers should sweep their NFC playoff games and spend the last 
week of January in Miami granting interviews to glazed sportswriters over 
doughnuts and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, meanwhile, are looking more and more like first-round fodder, 
looking very Ram-like these days, if the truth be told. Sunday, Means rushed 
for 50 yards, Humphries threw two interceptions and the Chargers scored 15 
points. Since opening the season 6-0, San Diego has gone 3-5, including 
back-to-back losses at home to the Raiders and the 49ers within the span of six 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Super Bowl atmosphere and tendencies, there was only this: 
</P>
<P>
 The NFC team beat the AFC team by 23 points, 38-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking on the bright side, the Buffalo Bills weren't anywhere near the place. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco so thoroughly humiliated San Diego that you'd have thought the 
cities were comparing bookstores, not football teams. The 49ers passed better, 
ran better, caught better, blocked better, kicked better, tackled better, 
coached better, led cheers better -- even dressed better. Once again, the 49ers 
donned their nifty 1957 3-D jerseys while the Chargers, owners of the finest 
throwback uniforms in the NFL, stuck to their present-day, duller-than-dull 
navy-and-whites that make them look like the Ram frosh-soph team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so one-sided that former Charger Gary Plummer, who'd devoted the past 
week to popping off 'round the clock about his old employers, was moved to pity 
as he faced the press with a 49er baseball cap jammed on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough for them to compete against a team like this one when they don't 
match up," Plummer said. "They don't have Jerry Rice on offense. They don't 
have Brent Jones at tight end." 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer said that he wished Seau "the best of luck in his last two games. He 
deserves to go to the playoffs. He played his (backside) off." 
</P>
<P>
 But, frankly, Plummer wished Seau had a sounder supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're banged up," he said. "They need to get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best indication of how the 49ers felt about the afternoon was 
Young's postgame closed-doors harangue for the benefit of his teammates. The 
49ers had just beaten a 9-5 team, in their home stadium, by 23 points -- and 
Young senses a roster-wide reprimand is just what the squad needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Young addresses the team about as often as San Francisco misses the 
playoffs. He has always been a leader by deeds -- leave the words to Deion 
Sanders -- but Sunday, he stood up and told the NFL's only 12-2 team, "I don't 
want us to get complacent. Things are going well, but we got a little sloppy 
out there at the end today. Be careful. We have to keep that mean, nasty 
feeling each and every week." 
</P>
<P>
 A little sloppy? 
</P>
<P>
 What, the end zone touchdown celebrations were a step out of sync? 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going three, four, five plays and off the field in the fourth 
quarter. That's ridiculous," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the things we didn't do. We had four downs inside the five and we didn't 
score (a touchdown) . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a certain standard, a way we do things. If we don't reach that 
standard, we need to talk about it. Yeah, we played a great game and things 
went well, but let's not get complacent about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young and too many current 49ers remember what happened in 1990, when San 
Francisco went 14-2 and lost the NFC title game to the Giants. Big fumble by 
Roger Craig in that one. That's why bad habits need to be corrected in 
December, before it's late January and over and out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be a little hyper-intense about it," Young said, "but I'd rather it 
be that way than the other. Or hyper-vigilant. I guess that's the word I'm 
looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Nit-picking, that would be another word for it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to offensive tackle Harris Barton, Young "told us we've got to do 
better in clock management, we've got to do better with third-and-one 
play-calling. When we're trying to run out the clock, we can't let the ball go 
out of bounds or fumble the snap." 
</P>
<P>
 Barton had to admit that, "If those are the only problems we have, we're all 
right." But the essence of Young's message -- do what it takes to get to the 
Super Bowl and then win it -- was nothing Barton could argue with. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get any rings or trophies for having the home-field advantage," 
Barton noted. Without naming names, he cited a nearby example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning six in a row at the beginning of the year doesn't mean nothing, 
because you've still got to play the seventh game. They don't cancel games if 
you win six in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 They do if you go 3-5 after winning six games in a row. Then, they start 
canceling conference championship games and Super Bowl games on you. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and his hyper-vigilantes can assure the Chargers of that.

ORANGE COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME; BITTERSWEET MEMORIES; DOWNING SET RECORDS AS 
ANGEL, BUT HE'S SOUR ABOUT BEING CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a man who did not acknowledge many happy days in a 20-year major league 
career spanning 2,344 games and 2,099 hits, Sunday should be one of Brian 
Downing's better days. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Downing, who spent 13 years with the Angels and became the team 
leader in 10 of 12 offensive categories, enters the Orange County Hall of Fame, 
alongside teammate and friend Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be no joy for Downing. At 44, two years removed from a career 
that began with the Chicago White Sox in 1973 and ended with the Texas Rangers 
in 1992, Downing remains angry with the Angels' decision to release him in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 So angry, that getting him to talk about it is like working through a 
labyrinth and finding Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really hurt by what the Angels did to me and I'll never forgive them 
for it," Downing said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put all my heart into that team. A lot of people don't think that. I had a 
lot of teammates that didn't like me because I took every at-bat personally. 
Some people have inner struggles going on. I had trouble off the field and 
playing on the field was my release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish now I had never played here." 
</P>
<P>
 To try to understand the depth of Downing's feelings, one needs a few history 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the White Sox traded him to the Angels in 1978 (along with pitchers Dave 
Frost and Chris Knapp for outfielders Bobby Bonds, Thad Bosley and pitcher Rich 
Dotson), Downing was an undersized converted catcher with thick glasses and a 
.243 lifetime batting average. "I probably would have been out of baseball in 
another year if I had stayed in Chicago," said Downing, who also played at 
Magnolia High and Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 His first year he batted .255, but in 1979 -- when the Angels won their first 
American League West title -- Downing hit a career-best .326. It was the top 
average by a right-handed batter and third-highest in the league. But with it 
came only 12 homers (and 75 runs batted in). And after a disastrous 1980 season 
in which he was sidelined from April 20 to Sept. 1 because of a fractured 
ankle, Downing figured if he was going to stay in the majors, he had to get 
bigger and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next couple of years, Downing remade himself with an exhaustive 
weightlifting regimen. The difference was dramatic: From 1982-88 Downing 
averaged about 23 home runs with a career-best 29 in 1987. He averaged 78 RBIs 
per year during the same span, with a high of 95 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tired of being a little guy," said Gene Mauch, Downing's manager with 
the Angels from 1981-87. "When he started out, he was a hustling but 
not-so-confident guy. But as his strength increased, his confidence increased. 
He became one hell of an offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the greatest 'scuffle' stroke I ever saw. With two strokes he'd cut 
down on his swing and just foul off pitches until he got something he could 
handle. I think that's what I remember so fondly. Another was his total lack of 
fear of the ball hitting him." 
</P>
<P>
 If Downing did not create a weightlifting revolution in baseball -- an 
activity long discouraged by old-timers who thought it bunched and knotted 
muscles, making them counter-productive to skills needed for the game -- he 
certainly spurred its wide use. You cannot walk into a major league clubhouse 
today and not find an extensive weight workout room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it helped me hit the ball farther but it did help me generate 
more bat speed," Downing said. "Would I have lasted as long at the same weight? 
I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being the lone player on all three Angel division winners, 
Downing was also the team's leadoff hitter, when penciled in by Mauch. 
Certainly not a prototype -- Downing had little speed, reaching double figures 
in stolen bases only once -- he nonetheless maintained an above-average on-base 
percentage (lifetime .373) and led the majors in walks (106) in 1987. He also 
scored 100 or more runs twice in that peak period of 1982-88. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he brought to the park every day was 100% baseball player," Mauch said. 
"Not 100% of what was left after the off-the-field stuff was taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Mauch's moves was to put Downing in left field, a move he initially 
resisted because he wasn't sure he could play it capably. And above all else, 
Downing hates to embarrass himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauch remembered his first play in Anaheim Stadium. "There were men on base 
and a ball came to him and rolled through his legs. He didn't want to see left 
field again. But he realized it couldn't get any worse, and from there went 
straight to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 By spending countless hours learning hitters' tendencies and where to position 
himself, Downing became more than adequate. In 1982 he set a league record for 
handling 330 consecutive chances without an error, breaking the 1971 mark of 
314 set by the Yankees' Roy White. By the middle of 1983, he set another record 
-- 244 errorless games, surpassing Detroit's Al Kaline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't a Gold Glove outfielder," said Downing, who had played the last two 
years despite severe pain in his right side. "I played strategic baseball, and 
coming from behind the plate really helped me a lot. It helped me think the way 
hitters think." 
</P>
<P>
 But Downing's heavenly run with the Angels took a hellish turn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final weekend of the 1990 season, then-Manager Doug Rader announced the 
team "would only play the guys who care about the team." Downing was lumped 
into the does-not-care group. He was stunned and he sat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Rader was great for the team," Downing said. "But he and 
(then-General Manager Mike Port) promised me things to my face. I said, 'Just 
let me play on Fan Appreciation Day and I'll retire. If you want to get rid of 
me because you have (other) guys you want to make the designated hitter, I can 
handle that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Downing, who by then was the team's all-time leader in games played, hits, 
home runs and several other categories, said he asked that if he was going to 
be released, that it not be in December. The Angels said they would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you do to Downing, don't tell him one thing and do another. A 
self-made but insecure player, he always wants to know where he stands. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Angels unceremoniously let him go, they created a wound that will 
not heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not upset with everyone because they got rid of me," Downing said. "They 
had made promises to my face. I had gone through the things I had done for them 
and felt I had done, and they agreed with everything I said. They said, 'We 
won't cut you in December.' Then they go ahead and do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to retire with a little dignity. To turn around and be released in 
the off-season . . . that just bugs me. They didn't owe me anything. But they 
were like my family. Baseball was my life. To have them turn their backs on me 
like that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Although he finally signed with Texas and played two more years -- "I did like 
it there" -- much of the fun of baseball was drained from Downing. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he and wife, Cheryl, watch sons Brad and Brandon play baseball. (Brad is 
trying out for Cypress College; Brandon plays for El Dorado.) And Downing also 
loves riding motorcycles; he has taken trips through Wyoming and South Dakota, 
and hopes to travel with a group cross-country in March, starting from Daytona 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing has not decided on a second career, but doubts he will seek a major or 
minor league coaching job. He still loves the game, but remains anguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may need more time away from the game," Downing said. "I'm not a teacher. I 
wasn't a great player, just an everyday scuffler.

CHARGERS CAN'T STAND THE HEAT; PRO FOOTBALL: IN WHAT WAS BILLED AS A SUPER BOWL 
PREVIEW, SAN DIEGO IS DOMINATED BY SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS, 38-15. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Deion Sanders strutted over the final third of his 90-yard interception 
return Sunday, the San Diego Chargers gawked as if watching a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, that was them. Unbeaten after six games, dancing through the 
NFL amid dreams of Super Bowls and shoe commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 But their gait has changed. That became evident Sunday after they suffered 
their worst beating in nearly two years, a 38-15 loss to a San Francisco 49er 
team that was supposed to be their equal. 
</P>
<P>
 Where once they were skipping, now they are stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody keeps saying we just need one win to get into the playoffs . . . 
one win, one win, one win," said Stanley Richard in the quiet Charger locker 
room. "You start to wonder, when are we going to get that win? Are we going to 
get that win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Potential playoff matchup? This wouldn't even have qualified as a good 
exhibition matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 With one minute left in the first half, the 49ers were leading by three 
touchdowns. They had outgained the Chargers, 223-75. 
</P>
<P>
 That the 49er defense snoozed through the rest of the game did little to 
refute the notion that these were teams from different planets. 
</P>
<P>
 With a victory against the Denver Broncos next week, San Francisco will clinch 
home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are playing so well that shortly after tying Joe Montana's club 
record with his 31st touchdown pass of the season, quarterback Steve Young 
scolded the team for not beating the Chargers worse. This even though they had 
just won their ninth consecutive game while outscoring opponents, 322-146. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be mean and nasty," said Young, who threw for 304 yards and two 
touchdowns and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers have lost five of their last eight games, and have only two 
remaining chances to clinch the AFC West Division title without help from the 
Raiders or Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 That would not make the playoffs seems unfathomable. But if they cannot defeat 
the Jets in New York next week, or the Pittsburgh Steelers at home in the 
season finale on Christmas Eve, the Chargers might need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we should go back and look at some film of some of our earlier games," 
Richard said. "Man, that seems like a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this game, the first quarter seemed like a long time ago. That 
was when the Chargers made the mistake that has typified not only this game, 
but the second half of their season. 
</P>
<P>
 After holding the 49ers on their first possession, the Chargers used Natrone 
Means' barrel legs and Stan Humphries' slant passes to drive 48 yards to the 
49er 31-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, with the Jack Murphy Stadium sellout crowd of 62,105 roaring, they 
went for a first down on fourth and eight. But they never had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Whitley, a backup guard working on the injury-battered offensive line, 
pulled to the right when he should have pulled to the left. Tim Harris, the 
49ers' designated pass rusher, ran through the open hole and pulled down 
Humphries before he had a chance to set up. 
</P>
<P>
 The sack was worth nine yards and possession of the ball. About six minutes 
later, the 49ers turned it into a touchdown after Young found Brent Jones open 
for a 10-yard scoring pass. The game was never again close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the corner of my eye, I see a guy coming through my hole and it was a 
horrible feeling," Whitley said. "It was like, 'Oh no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Charger linebacker Junior Seau will never admit it, he apparently had 
that feeling several times too. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing Seau was playing with a pinched nerve in his neck, and then later a 
sprained left knee after a bruising tackle in the second period, the 49ers 
pointed their offense directly at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, catches were made in front of him, or ballcarriers would run 
past him as he vainly hobbled after them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a down time for us," Seau said. "But I've got no excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Plummer, 49er linebacker and former Charger, had some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Junior afterward that he really needs to sit out for a game," Plummer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't say whether he had talked to Means, who also sprained his knee, 
ironically on his first powerful run in weeks, a 12-yard touchdown rumble in 
which he flattened cornerback Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through this before with the Chargers, in 1987 when we collapsed 
and didn't even make the playoffs," Plummer said. "I wouldn't say the wheels 
are coming off." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. "But they do have a heckuva lot of pressure on them."

CHANGING GEARS; HIS LEGACY SECURE, GREG LEMOND NOW MUST FIND A NEW CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg LeMond won the 1989 Tour de France in a little drama so compelling that 
even American sports fans took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 After 2,015 miles, 22 days and 20 stages of cycling's greatest spectacle, 
LeMond trailed Laurent Fignon of France by a virtually insurmountable 50 
seconds before starting the final stage that Sunday five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15.2-mile individual time trial from the Palace at Versailles to the 
Place de la Concorde in the heart of Paris, LeMond started in second place two 
minutes before his rival. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Fignon crossed the finish line, collapsing on the Champs Elysee a 
few minutes after LeMond, it was over for the French rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years removed from a near-fatal hunting accident, LeMond, then 28, rode as 
no one before him. He rode all out at a Tour record pace of 34 miles per hour, 
declining to have his splits called to him from the pace car. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of cycling's most unforgettable moments, LeMond had stolen the title in 
the closest finish in 81 Tours with an eight-second victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a memorable scene, an American winning in Paris during the height of 
France's bicentennial celebration. And perhaps more than any other ride -- 
LeMond won the Tour de France three times and the world road race championship 
twice -- it served as a metaphor of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 That ride introduced cycling to the New World as legions of Americans became 
enthralled with LeMond and the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the American cycling scene, it was a dark day when LeMond, 33, retired 
last week because his physicians believe he is suffering from a rare muscle 
disorder known as mitochondrial myopathy. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease saps the energy production from muscle cells. In LeMond's case, it 
leaves him listless and unable to compete as an elite rider, but will not 
otherwise greatly affect his life. 
</P>
<P>
 That he was fatigued has been evident since 1991 when he was seventh in the 
Tour de France, the first time he failed to finish in the top three. Then he 
dropped out in 1992 in the Alps because of extreme fatigue, did not start last 
year after suffering from severe allergies during the Tour of Italy and quit 
after seven stages this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to have him home more," said LeMond's wife Kathy, who also has been 
a powerful presence in the American cycling community. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think I'd rather have him home when was really ready to quit. I feel 
like it got cut short a little, but then we never dreamed he would have a 
career like he did. He had his time." 
</P>
<P>
 A remarkable time. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond's influence on cycling will not soon be forgotten. He is one of four 
riders to win the Tour de France at least three times. And if not for the 
accidental shooting during a wild turkey hunt near Sacramento in the spring of 
1987, he might have notched one or two more. That shooting left about 40 
shotgun pellets lodged inside him, including three in his heart lining. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond said before the accident he rarely felt bad during the cycling season, 
but the six years afterward were laborious. 
</P>
<P>
 His contributions go beyond the resume of victories: 1977 world junior road 
race champion; 1983 world road race champion; third in his first Tour in 1984; 
second in 1985, and first in 1986 to become the only non-European to win it. 
After winning in 1989, he earned his second world championship that summer, 
then, in another comeback, won his final Tour in 1990 by overcoming Italy's 
Claudio Chiappucci. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had an enormous impact on the sport," said Sam Abt of the Paris-based 
International Herald Tribune and author of "LeMond, the Incredible Comeback of 
an American Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 "He changed everything, salary structures, the mechanics of the sport, the 
triathlete bars, sunglasses, helmets, cyclometers, jerseys, everything. The guy 
was just like an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Cycling was a quaint sport by American standards when LeMond, a downhill skier 
from Reno, left the States for Europe in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 When he flew over his first year as a pro, someone on the plane asked him what 
he did for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was in sports marketing because I never wanted to explain that I was 
a professional cyclist," LeMond said, adding that when he did people assumed he 
raced motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived on the continent with the pioneer spirit, hoping to win a Tour one 
day. But it wasn't easy riding for a French team and not speaking the language. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually won over Europeans by mastering French and their beloved Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did it his way, a uniquely American way. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond eschewed the French cycling traditions. He ate ice cream if he felt 
like it. He played golf on his off days and took his family with him to races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg . . . was like a Martian or Venusian," Abt said. "He came from a place 
where nobody took it seriously. Europeans laughed at the idea of an American 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 And this American continually pushed cycling out of its comfort zone. He was 
the first Tour rider to use special aerodynamic handlebars when he tried them 
during the final stage of the '89 Tour. Now, many competitors use them during 
time trials, all-out sprints against the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond and his father, Bob, were tough negotiators, setting the standard for 
cycling salaries. In 1989, LeMond signed a three-year, $5.7-million contract to 
become the first rider to earn more than a $1 million a year. He also earned 
unprecedented amounts of endorsement money. 
</P>
<P>
 "He revolutionized it," Abt said. "The guys would be riding for slave wages 
still." 
</P>
<P>
 He also humanized the sport. Kathy and their children, Jeffrey, 10, Scott, 7, 
and near the end, Simone, 5, often accompanied LeMond during his three-week 
storm of France. The Europeans could not imagine it, but now others bring their 
families along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond is gone, and perhaps only Lance Armstrong of Texas is left to carry the 
American banner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armstrong, the 1993 world champion, is known as a classics rider, strong 
for one-day races. Whether he can hang on for the long haul of the Tour is 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond, who went through an excruciating muscle biopsy last August to help 
determine his condition, cannot worry about that. He did what he could to prop 
up the sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his time to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ski six weeks this winter (even) if I have to fly all over the 
country to find snow," he said. "I could be termed a professional 
recreationalist." 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Wayzata, Minn., LeMond realizes he will need something to challenge 
him in the coming years. But the competitive edge will burn, even if he is 
mountain biking for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate," he said. "My mind's the same. It's just the body has given 
up."

GOVERNORS WILL CAUCUS WITH NO TIME TO WASTE; LABOR: BOARD UNLIKELY TO SET 
DEADLINE, BUT OWNERS SAY PLAYERS REALIZE AN AGREEMENT MUST BE REACHED BEFORE 
YEAR'S END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not every member of the NHL's Board of Governors believes the league must set 
a deadline at its meeting today to caution players that time is running out to 
salvage the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you have to put up a traffic signal. We all know if this 
thing isn't done by the 27th or 28th of December, church is out," said Peter 
Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's tough to chisel something into concrete until you get down to the 
short strokes and say, 'Look guys, we've had it, go away. We have to start 
renting our buildings.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The board meeting represents the beginning of the end of the tedious, 
two-month negotiating process. The governors will review the players' last 
proposal -- which already has been labeled inadequate by Commissioner Gary 
Bettman -- but it's unlikely they will vote to cancel the season while at least 
two weeks remain to make a deal and play 40 to 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't support it (the players' proposal) now because we didn't get 
anything, we didn't get any significant gifts," one governor said. "I'd guess 
(Bettman) will poll each team, see what people are thinking and see if any new 
or different ideas can be incorporated into a new proposal. Then he'll go back 
to the union and say, 'This is our last and best deal. Take it, or see you in 
August.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The league's proposed payroll tax continues to divide players from owners -- 
and has caused a split among owners. They hired Bettman expressly to institute 
salary controls, but there is some disagreement over whether he has been too 
inflexible in achieving those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 26 clubs, eight can be classified as insisting on a collective 
bargaining agreement that contains a tax and tough cost containment. Eleven are 
moderates who want to reform the economic structure but aren't convinced the 
payroll tax is the way to do it, especially if it's the only obstacle to an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining seven, principally clubs that are plagued by financial problems 
and need gate revenues, would begin the season tomorrow if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Those leanings will be crucial when the governors vote. Only a majority is 
necessary to accept a deal that has been recommended by the negotiating 
committee. A 75% tally (20 votes) is required to reject a deal recommended by 
the committee, or to take a deal that is not recommended by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the negotiating committee rejects the union's last offer, as it is sure to 
do, the "doves" could not cobble together a 20-vote bloc to overturn that 
decision and get the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be difficult to categorize clubs, because some have changed their 
stance during the talks and others that are financially stable have 
conservative leanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Detroit Red Wings are assumed to be doves, Jimmy Devellano, their 
senior vice president, insists they're firm on getting salary controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we need some type of cap more than a tax," he said. "You look at the 
two leagues that are successful -- the NFL and the NBA -- and the reason is 
they have some control over their player costs. Owners and players do very well 
in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think because we're a high-revenue club we'd want to do just 
anything to play, and that's not so. We're also a big payroll club (about $20 
million this season) and if things go on as they have for another year, we're 
going to lose money. A building of our size (nearly 20,000) and we can't make 
it? Then who can?" 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Sabres' Governor Robert Swados, who once warned a player during 
contract negotiations, "You're driving the Cadillac over the cliff," was a 
hold-the-line hawk. However, he has softened because he knows it would be 
easier to sell luxury boxes and tickets in the Sabres' new arena if prospective 
buyers could attend games and sample the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Personalities might also come into play. Several clubs are angry that Bettman 
has excluded them from negotiating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., said last week 
players had made enough concessions in entry-level salaries, free agency and 
salary arbitration to warrant eliminating the tax. Bettman, however, downplayed 
the extent of the givebacks. Pocklington claimed 13 voters "are tired of 
compromising" and won't drop the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what's on the table at the moment it's got no shot," said Tony Tavares, 
president of the Mighty Ducks. "The chasm is so wide, what you've done is only 
thrown a rope across it to bridge it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moderates and doves say that if players so strenuously object to the payroll 
levy, the bridge can take a different form. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to be a tax, just something that helps us stay competitive," 
said Don Maloney, general manager of the New York Islanders. "The last offer 
(which included a 25% payroll tax), I guarantee there could be some negotiation 
off that level that will still present some slowing down of salaries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done it to ourselves. We've awarded such exorbitant (salary) figures, 
but now we need help. What we need is almost more than what players are willing 
to accept right now. But we have no other options. We can't price tickets 
higher. We're driving fans out of the building already. I don't know how much 
is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares said there's room for compromise on free agency, perhaps with the NHL 
lowering the age for unrestricted free agency to 29 if players accept a modest 
tax. Said a governor: "I don't think anybody is enamored of the tax but they're 
saying if they don't get a win in other areas, they need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maloney, who was a union representative during his playing career, said he 
doesn't begrudge players their lucrative salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be the first to say they should get every penny they can," he said. 
"There were some discrepancies in the past and maybe some players were 
underpaid in the past, but that's not true now. They are well paid and they 
will continue to be well paid, but just not at the rate they've been in the 
past. "What bothers me is the idea that $300,000 or $400,000 is not a lot of 
money, that it's the bottom range." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he remains optimistic. "I still think enough people at the end of the 
day will say, 'Let's play,' " he said. "Is it the league that will be stepping 
back or the players? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares is less sure the puck will be dropped, "but I'm a pessimist," he said. 
"Nothing would make me happier than being wrong. Logic tells you there's going 
to be a season, but the whole process has been so bizarre that logic means 
nothing."

PRO FOOTBALL SPOTLIGHT; COMMITMENT TO YESTERDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders have a competent quarterback, a decent halfback, an Olympic relay 
team of receivers, a terrific defensive line and all-world cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do they once again need a late-season rally to snag a wild-card spot? 
</P>
<P>
 According to former Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Ron Jaworski, who 
specializes in film study for ESPN, the answer lies in their design. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders' vertical stretch offense just doesn't give the quarterback 
enough options," Jaworski said last week. "There are few NFL offenses as poorly 
designed as the Raiders' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I'd have migraines, too, playing in this offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back to their first game against the Chargers and timed every one of 
Jeff Hostetler's drops from the snap to how long it takes him to throw the 
football. The majority of the time it took him 3 1/2-4 seconds to throw the 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say, what does that mean? Well, in the NFL in a conventional-style 
offense, on a three-step drop you throw the ball in 1.5 seconds. In a five-step 
drop, you throw the ball in 2.1 seconds. In a seven-step drop, you throw the 
ball in 2.7 seconds. He's holding on to the ball for almost four seconds! You 
can't last in the NFL playing quarterback if you're holding the ball for four 
seconds!" 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, he should say that. Hostetler was sacked five times Sunday, giving the 
Raiders 42, second-worst in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand design for the Raider offense, of course, was laid down in the '60s 
by managing partner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging his own concerns, Davis hoped Mike Shanahan could bring "a 
freshness" to the Raider scheme when he hired him in 1988. However, Davis fired 
Shanahan in 1989 and promoted Art Shell, who announced a return to Raider Ball: 
"You may know where we are but we know where you are too." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan is now the offensive coordinator in San Francisco, where he has 
helped freshen the 49ers. The Raiders are back in the wild-card hunt. PLAYOFF 
PICTURE MADE EASY 
</P>
<P>
 In the NFC, the 49ers (12-2) and Cowboys (11-3) have clinched their division 
titles. The 49ers have also clinched a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Vikings (9-5) defeat Detroit next Sunday, they clinch the division 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (8-6) and Bears (8-6) can clinch a playoff berth with two victories, 
amid other combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Packers (7-7) win their remaining games, they clinch the playoffs. The 
Giants, Cardinals and Eagles, all 7-7, are still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the AFC, the Steelers (11-3) and Browns (10-4) have clinched playoff 
berths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (9-5), assured of a better record against AFC West competition 
than the Raiders, need one victory to clinch the division title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (8-5) can clinch a playoff berth with a victory tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (8-6) and Patriots (8-6) can get in with two victories and one 
loss by the Chiefs, among other combinations. If the Raiders and Patriots are 
tied for the final playoff spot, the Raiders would advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (7-6) can make the playoffs by winning their remaining games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills (7-7) and Broncos (7-7) are still alive. BIG D AS IN D-PRESSED 
</P>
<P>
 For Jimmy Johnson and anyone else who enjoyed seeing Jerry Jones' look of 
horror as he jumped up and down on the sideline only to discover that Jay 
Novacek hadn't gotten into the end zone at the end of the Dallas Cowboys' 19-14 
loss to the Cleveland Browns on Saturday, it was a good week, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers need one victory in two games to make sure any rematch will be in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, getting a first-round bye is the most important 
thing," Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman said. "We've been hearing about playing 
San Francisco in the championship game since the playoffs. We've played out 
there before and won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we won't even have to play San Francisco. Who knows?" BE CAREFUL WHAT 
YOU WISH FOR. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Cunningham, spared the ax by Coach Rich Kotite, got to start against 
the Pittsburgh Steelers, after all. Lucky him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham completed nine of 27 passes for a career-low 59 yards and threw 
another costly fourth-quarter interception as the Eagles lost for the fifth 
time in a row after a 7-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Kotite, reportedly only weeks away from getting the ax himself, 
suggested he'd start backup Bubby Brister, saying he was "keeping my options 
open," noting Cunningham hadn't seen an open receiver on the interception the 
Cowboys' Darren Woodson returned 94 yards for a touchdown the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The droll Brister regaled the press with an account of how he handled life as 
a reserve ("I drink lots of beer") but didn't think it was so funny when Kotite 
then announced, in a written release, that Randall would be back in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the basis of Monday's press conference, when there were mixed 
interpretations as to my remarks concerning our quarterback situation," wrote 
Kotite, "I am making a statement that should be understood by everyone: Randall 
Cunningham is the starting quarterback this Sunday in Pittsburgh." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday the Eagles trailed, 7-3, in the fourth quarter when Cunningham 
overthrew Calvin Williams and hit safety Darren Perry, who returned it to the 
Philadelphia 17, setting up the second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham will need divine intervention to hold his job this week. Try this 
for a scenario: 
</P>
<P>
 Randall gets benched, gets upset and gets traded in the off-season to Arizona 
where Buddy Ryan, his old Eagle coach, is planning to purge his Cardinal 
quarterbacks as soon as he can find replacements. STILL IN THE CHASE, IF THEY 
CAN USE THEIR CANES 
</P>
<P>
 The four-time defending AFC champion Buffalo Bills, needing a victory at home 
to keep pace with the Raiders and New England Patriots, lost to the Vikings, 
21-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills (7-7) haven't won two games in a row since September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we can recover," said cornerback Thomas Smith. "You all know we can 
recover. I guess nobody's seen the Bills' backs against the wall this far, but 
we still have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 They're going to have to do a lot of recovering, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Kelly was carted off the field with 1:29 left because of a 
knee injury and left the locker room in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfback Thurman Thomas, held to 50 yards in 16 carries, left because of a 
hamstring pull in the first quarter, returned in the second half but went down 
with another leg injury before the end of the game. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly suffered strained ligaments in his left knee. The knee was X-rayed and 
then immobilized in a soft cast. Results of the X-rays were not available. . . 
. Steeler halfback Bam Morris left in the second half because of leg injury. 
X-rays were negative. . . . Eagle defensive end Burt Grossman left because of 
bruised ribs and a sprained right ankle. QUOTEWORTHY

Sterling Sharpe's season record of 112.

 Viking wide receiver Cris Carter will tie Sterling Sharpe's single-season 
reception record with one catch. He caught nine passes Sunday, giving him 111 
receptions for the season. Sharpe established the single-season record last 
year. . . . We refuse to use "From Sharpe minds" here. This will be be a 
sterling noteworthy: Sterling Sharpe extended his club record to 101 
consecutive games with at least one reception. He also started for the 110th 
game in a row. He hasn't missed a start since joining the Packers as a 
first-round selection out of South Carolina in 1988. Sharpe's seven catches 
moved him past Mark Clayton into 16th place on the all-time list with 583 
catches. . . . What about MeShon Johnson? Packer cornerback KeShon Johnson made 
the first interception of his career Sunday. Packer rookie running back LeShon 
Johnson, who had 57 yards rushing coming into the game, broke a career-best 
43-yarder in the fourth quarter. Johnson led the nation in rushing last season 
at Northern Illinois. . . . Jim Kelly's 35-yard touchdown pass to Pete 
Metzelaars in the first quarter for Buffalo was the 200th of his career. He is 
the 18th quarterback in NFL history to reach 200. . . . Andre Reed caught two 
passes, giving him 81 for the season. He needs eight to break his club record 
of 88, set in 1989. . . . Plus, he keeps the Patriots nice and warm: Ben Coates 
set the Patriot single-season record with 88 receptions. His six catches Sunday 
put him ahead of Stanley Morgan's 84 in 1986. His 68 yards gave him 1,089 for 
the season, moving him from third to second on the Patriot single-season list. 
Morgan set the record of 1,491 in 1986. . . . The Patriots moved closer to 
becoming the first NFL team with at least five players catching at least 50 
passes in the same season. Kevin Turner became the fourth with two receptions 
for a total of 50. Coates has 88, Michael Timpson 67 and Leroy Thompson 59. 
Vincent Brisby's four catches gave him 48 with two games left. . . . Wait a 
second, Fritz Coleman said there would be no more eclipses till the turn of the 
century: Drew Bledsoe needs 50 completions in his last two games to break 
Warren Moon's single-season record of 404 set in 1991. . . . Rodney Hampton's 
76 yards moved him into second place on the Giant rushing list with 4,655 
yards, surpassing Alex Webster, who had 4,638. Joe Morris is first with 5,296. 
. . . No running back has 100 yards against Pittsburgh since Seattle's Chris 
Warren in the fourth game of the season. . . . Pittsburgh's 11-3 start is its 
best since the 1979 Steelers -- the last of their four Super Bowl champions -- 
had the same record. . . . It was Jerry Rice's 48th game of 100 yards or more. 
That puts him two behind Don Maynard's record of 50. . . . Steve Young threw 
two touchdown passes to tie the 49ers' record of 31 set by Joe Montana in 1987. 
. . . Coming soon -- Jim Varney in Ernest Plays Football: Ernest Givins' 
78-yard punt return for a touchdown was the first by an Oiler since Billy 
(White Shoes) Johnson's 72-yard return against Cleveland on Dec. 11, 1977. 
Tonight's Game 
</P>
<P>
 Miami at Kansas City 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 There is a chance that quarterback Joe Montana will be able 
to play for the Chiefs, but he won't be evaluated until shortly before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (7-6) lost to the Broncos in overtime last week, but backup 
quarterback Steve Bono completed 18 of 37 passes for 323 yards and a touchdown 
in Montana's place. Marcus Allen accepted part of the blame for Kansas City's 
loss last week because of his costly fumble. Still, the Chiefs probably will 
rely on Allen to offset any pressure that the quarterback gets. But the 
strength of the Dolphin defense has been stopping the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs, who have lost three of four games, also need to get more points 
inside their opponent's 20-yard line. The Chiefs have been inside the 20 of 
their opponent 17 times in the last seven games. Those turned into only six 
touchdowns and 11 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, opponents have been inside the Chiefs' 20-yard line 19 
times in those games and scored 12 touchdowns and five field goals.  
</P>
<P>
 The ball didn't bounce right for the Dolphins (8-5) much last week. The 
Dolphins have lost four of five games and Don Shula might even miss the game 
because of an injury to his Achilles' tendon that is similar to Dan Marino's.  
</P>
<P>
 They had a 17-7 halftime lead and ended up losing, 42-31, to the Bills. The 
Dolphin offense has not had a reliable running game for three weeks -- that 
will have to change to keep the pressure off Marino.

 Ram President John Shaw met with officials from FANS Inc., the group trying to 
bring the team to St. Louis, Sunday in the team's box at Tampa Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Bornstein, an attorney for Stan Kroenke, who's trying to buy a minority 
interest in the Rams, joined Shaw and senior vice president Jay Zygmunt for the 
Rams' 24-14 loss to the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke, a businessman from Columbia, Mo., reportedly was in Tampa Sunday, but 
was not seen in the Rams' box. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he "remained optimistic" about striking a deal with the St. Louis 
group, but added there's a "zero chance" that such an agreement would be 
announced before Sunday's game at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis also is among five cities that have completed the first round of 
negotiations to buy the Buccaneers, who went up for sale after owner Hugh 
Culverhouse died in August. MIKE REILLEY

BUCCANEER FANS HOPE ONLY RAMS MOVE; NFC: TAMPA BAY SUPPORTERS ARE COUNTING ON 
RAMS RELOCATING TO ST. LOUIS OR BALTIMORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Russ Barner, a Tampa Bay season-ticket holder since the city landed the 
expansion franchise in 1976, cheered for two things Sunday when the Rams and 
Tampa Bay met in the Relocation Bowl -- a Buccaneer victory and a Ram move to 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Barner got half his wish -- the Buccaneers beat the Rams, 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's still no word on whether the Rams have struck a deal with FANS 
Inc., the group trying to lure them to St. Louis, meaning the Buccaneers still 
have an outside shot at moving there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the Buccaneers moving to St. Louis," Barner said. "If the 
Buccaneers leave, it will cripple this town. We'll go right back to the Stone 
Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you feel about your team out in Los Angeles. But we would 
rather (the Rams) go to St. Louis than us." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Buccaneer fans figure it, if the Rams move to St. Louis, it takes one 
more potential buyer out of the picture. But can Tampa save the Buccaneers? 
</P>
<P>
 Barner remains hopeful the team will stay. He wondered just who the winner in 
all this mess will be -- St. Louis, the Rams, the Buccaneers or the moving 
company that lands the contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep showing tape of the moving trucks pulling into Baltimore to move 
the Colts on TV (news) here," he said. "I don't know how you could let your 
team go out there in L.A. Here, it would be like cutting an arm or a leg off. 
You'll never get another NFL team."  
</P>
<P>
 That's why fans hung a sign in the north end zone Sunday wishing "The St. 
Louis Rams luck in 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Orange County's bankruptcy -- a blow to Save the Rams' hopes of 
building a new stadium to keep the team -- made the front page of the Tampa 
Tribune sports section this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's also why the Tribune devoted a sports cover story Sunday to St. 
Louis' pursuit of the Rams, complete with color photos of the city's new domed 
stadium and blue-and-gold bumper stickers that read: "We're on a Rampage . . . 
. St. Louis Rams . . . . NFL in '95!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, whatever happened to Save the Rams?" said Angel Sandoval, a Ram fan from 
Rowland Heights who moved to Orlando, Fla., two months ago. "We keep hearing 
that they (the Rams) are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's going to happen here in Tampa. I think the Buccaneers 
will stay put. From what I've seen this year, and I've been to games in both 
cities, there's a lot more support here than there is for the Rams back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at Sunday's game was 34,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the St. Louis group joined Ram officials in their suite to 
watch the 4-9 teams play an ugly game marred by five unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalties. The Rams are in their fifth consecutive losing season, and the 
Buccaneers haven't finished better than .500 since 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides wooing the Rams, St. Louis is one of five cities that have completed 
the first round of negotiations to buy the Buccaneers, who went on the market 
after owner Hugh Culverhouse died in August. Groups from Tampa, Toronto, 
Orlando and Baltimore also have contacted the board charged with selling the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Tye, from Ellicott City, Md., outside Baltimore, was pulling for the 
Rams to move there. He said he would settle for the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like they want the Bucs back in Baltimore, but I would much rather 
have the Rams," he said. "But we'll take the Bucs if nobody else comes through. 
I guess it's either feast or famine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we haven't had football back there in more than 10 years. Right now, 
we'll take anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about making a sign that read: 'Go Baltimore Rams' on one side and 
'Go Baltimore Bucs' on the other and then bring it to the game. But I didn't 
think that would go over very well here."

PRO FOOTBALL / TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 24, RAMS 14; RAM NOTEBOOK; BLOCKED KICK 
RAISES QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Special teams coach Wayne Sevier emerged from the locker room Sunday and asked 
what play reporters wanted to discuss after the Rams' 24-14 loss to the Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it David Lang's 57-yard kickoff return, the longest by a Ram this season? 
Rookie Toby Wright's blocked field goal, the first by a Ram since Alvin Wright 
in 1988? Or Todd Kinchen's 40-yard punt return? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above. What happened on Tony Zendejas' 48-yard field-goal attempt 
that was blocked by Charles McRae? 
</P>
<P>
 With two minutes remaining and the Rams trailing, 17-14, McRae batted down 
Zendejas' low kick, which Tampa Bay's John Lynch recovered and returned 27 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asking him (Zendejas) to do something on the verge of being very 
tough with the wet conditions on the field and a slight breeze," Sevier said. 
"In those conditions, I thought it would take a great kick to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt like he hit it pretty good and drove it, McRae just got his hand up 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sevier didn't fault the Rams' blocking on the play. McRae said he got a "good 
jump" and knocked it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kick was pretty low and I got my arm on it," McRae said. 
</P>
<P>
 McRae's block was the first by a Buccaneer since Dec. 6, 1992, when he knocked 
down an attempt by Zendejas in a 31-27 Ram victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was a high-percentage kick," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "From my 
angle, it just appeared that Tony kicked it low." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen's 40-yard punt return was the longest against the Buccaneers' 
top-ranked coverage team this season. Before Sunday, the Buccaneers had allowed 
only 42 yards in punt returns all season, and nine yards was the longest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' trash-talking antics Sunday upset Buccaneer middle linebacker Hardy 
Nickerson, who lashed out in the locker room after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where their (Rams') heads are at . . . maybe in the ground," 
Nickerson said. "They came in here jawing at us, calling us names. That only 
made us play harder and rub their noses in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickerson was particularly upset with Ram cornerback Todd Lyght, who tried to 
listen in on a Buccaneer sideline huddle during the two-minute warning before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Trent Dilfer and Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche yelled at Lyght 
before Nickerson grabbed him by the jersey and shoved him away. The teams were 
assessed offsetting penalties for taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anyone do that in all my time in football," Nickerson said of 
Lyght's antics. "I guess he was just listening in or trying to get a cup of 
water or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing something like that is a lack of respect. Teams have been doing that 
all year, Washington taunted us in warm-ups last week. If they would read the 
papers, they would see we're on a three-game winning streak." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Super sub: When Tampa Bay receiver Courtney Hawkins injured his knee in the 
first quarter, the Buccaneers' passing game didn't go down with him thanks to 
third-stringer Charles Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson replaced Hawkins, the Buccaneers' leading receiver, and burned the Rams 
with four catches for a career-high 176 yards, including touchdown receptions 
of 71 and 44 yards. It was the first 100-yard-plus receiving game by a 
Buccaneer this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a four-year pro from Memphis State, started briefly early in the year 
but was pushed out when Lawrence Dawsey returned in Week 7 from a knee injury. 
Wilson entered the game with only 20 catches for 368 yards and three touchdowns 
on the season and came in when Hawkins strained ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson surprised the Ram secondary when he stretched a catch to 53 yards after 
Ram defensive backs Darryl Henley and Anthony Newman collided trying to make 
the tackle. Ten more yards were tacked on when Ram safety Marquez Pope grabbed 
Wilson's facemask making the tackle, setting up Michael Husted's 20-yard field 
goal that gave the Buccaneers a 3-0 second-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add injuries: Ram linebacker Chris Martin left the game because of a strained 
calf. Guard Leo Goeas (ankle), linebacker Joe Kelly (sore abdomen) and 
linebacker Thomas Homco (foot) returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running on empty: It was another tough game for tailback Jerome Bettis, who 
gained only 23 yards in 13 carries against a Buccaneer defense ranked 27th in 
the league against the rush. His Sunday totals give him 970 yards in 296 
carries for the season, with games against Chicago and Washington remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After four consecutive 100-yard-plus games early in the season, Bettis hasn't 
rushed for more than that since Oct. 2 against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a pretty good job up front," Bettis said. "We knew they would be a 
feisty group up front." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add rushing: Tampa Bay rookie tailback Errict Rhett celebrated his 24th 
birthday Sunday by rushing 31 times for 119 yards and a touchdown, only the 
second 100-yard-plus game against the Ram defense this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' Rodney Hampton rushed for 112 yards Oct. 16 against the Rams. New 
Orleans rookie Mario Bates had 96 yards and three touchdowns against the Rams 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rhett's a good, strong player," Ram middle linebacker Shane Conlan said. "I 
felt worthless in the first half. He made a lot of good cut-back decisions and 
played a lot better than I thought he would." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhett has 893 yards for the season, including 589 in the past five weeks. He 
ran for 192 yards in 40 carries last week against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jessie Hester extended his streak of games with at least one 
catch to 76 with six catches for 82 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown pass 
from Chris Chandler in the fourth quarter. . . . The Buccaneers' victory Sunday 
broke the Rams' six-game winning streak against Tampa Bay.

STRIKE CERTIFICATION WOULD LIMIT BASEBALL REPLACEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players 
Assn., said Sunday that the Department of Labor has now certified the strike 
that began on Aug. 12, meaning that all foreign players will be prevented from 
receiving visas and entering the United States next spring to serve as 
replacement players if the owners attempt to open the camps amid the ongoing 
bargaining dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 That dispute seemed no closer to resolution Sunday, when the owners made a 
counter proposal they claimed was within the framework of the proposal made by 
the union on Saturday. They gave the players until tonight to respond, which 
prompted union leader Donald Fehr to say that if the "owners want to rush off 
to their meeting, they will. We can't stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 The reference was to Thursday's scheduled meeting in Chicago, where the owners 
plan to declare an impasse and implement a salary cap if there is no 
settlement. Fehr said the proposal that the owners delivered Sunday contains 
"all of the elements of a cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington, the owners chief 
negotiator, said he was confident an agreement could be reached on the 
non-economic aspects of the union proposal and that "we tried to adopt their 
framework in satisfying our cost control concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources indicated the owners are willing to accept the union's 5% payroll tax 
-- specifically 4.64% in the owners' proposal -- but with a trigger that would 
create an escalating tax similar to their high rate proposal of Nov. 17 if 
payrolls reached a certain threshhold. A union lawyer said the concept would 
particularly reward high-revenue clubs if they stayed below the threshhold, 
creating a deterrent to spend and a cap in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fail-safe mechanism if revenues fail to grow at the level at which 
we would hope," Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspicion lingers among union officials that the owners are attempting to 
force the union to deliver the last rejection so that they can move on to 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The visa denial for foreign players is now automatic under Immigration and 
Naturalization Service policy and affects major and minor leaguers, Orza said. 
He added, however, that the union will seek an exemption for players who were 
on major league rosters and on strike from Aug. 12 to Oct. 3 so they are not 
treated differently from their striking U.S. colleagues. The owners have all 
but said they plan to open the camps with replacement players next spring. Some 
management people have speculated privately that they would expect many Latino 
players to cross picket lines, a contention strongly denied by many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the visa restriction on foreign players -- those with green cards are 
automatically exempted but Orza said he didn't know how many were in that 
category -- diminishes the pool of potential replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it can be assumed that the owners will be or would be 
successful filling replacement rosters, but the suggestion that Latin players 
would cross the line represents the height of insensitivity and is an insult to 
the Hispanic culture," Orza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most agents believe the owners will focus on double A and single A players; 
older minor leaguers; striking young players vulnerable to financial pressure, 
and college players whose eligibility is up. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also noteworthy under baseball rules that the use of replacement players 
would have to be bargained to impasse -- separate from the impasse that the 
owners seem certain to declare Thursday -- before the owners could unilaterally 
use them.

NHL CLUBS SPLIT THREE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 26 league teams have different attitudes toward ending the labor dispute. 
HARD-LINE HAWKS 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Bruins: Owner Jeremy Jacobs is an ally and adviser of Commissioner Gary 
Bettman and will back him to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Blackhawks: A money-making machine, and they want to maintain that 
large profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton Oilers: Squeezed financially by the limits of playing in a small 
market, they need economic supports of a new agreement to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Panthers: They lost $3 million last season after playing to 94% 
capacity in the 14,500-seat Miami Arena. Plans for a bigger rink fell through, 
so owner Wayne (Blockbuster) Huizenga will have to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford Whalers: Also limited by small market size and hurt by on-ice 
failures, they need financial bolstering. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Devils: Adamant about slowing salary growth. Their real problem, 
though, is they are in an over-saturated market and don't draw enough fans or 
advertisers who might put them in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Flyers: Ed Snider, their majority owner, has threatened to sell 
if he can't stem his losses. Don't believe it. He's planning a new arena and 
wants to be on surer financial footing before the project gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Capitals: Won't vote to start season unless a tax is part of the 
deal. Blame rising salaries for financial losses in recent years; better teams 
-- and a better arena -- might have averted much of that. MODERATES 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks: One of the NHL's most profitable clubs last season (about $9 
million), they're itching to play. But they're cost-conscious and want one more 
medium-sized concession by players before they'll approve a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Sabres: Robert Swados, their governor, is militant by nature. That's 
being tempered by his need to sell seats and luxury boxes in the club's new 
arena. They must play to sell those seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary Flames: Say they can't be competitive without salary controls. They'd 
jettison the tax for an alternative system. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Red Wings: They want to play, because they figure they have a good 
shot at the Stanley Cup in what figures to be Scotty Bowman's coaching finale, 
but owner Mike Ilitch, who is also losing money on baseball's Tigers, is 
determined to create cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Canadiens: They were hard-liners initially but have softened since 
players made various concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders: They'd drop the tax if players gave up salary arbitration 
or made a minor concession that would slow payroll growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec Nordiques: Unhappy at being left out of negotiations, they might oppose 
Bettman out of spite. But as a small-market club, they desperately need 
financial help. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Sharks: Another big money-maker, they want to play. But they know 
their on-ice success will lead to a huge payroll, and they want to lessen the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay Lightning: They lean toward being hawks because they'd lose $2 
million less by not playing than by playing. But being on the ice could 
solidify fans' affections. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver Canucks: Made only a small profit last season despite going to the 
Stanley Cup finals, so they want salary restraints. But they're also building a 
new arena and it's easier to sell luxury boxes if they're playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg Jets: A small-market club that would benefit from pooled tax fees. A 
local group working to finance a new arena has sold 40 luxury boxes. With that 
pot of gold lying ahead, they want to play. DROP-THE-PUCK-TOMORROW DOVES 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Stars: Cash-flow problems make them eager to play. Frustrated at 
inability to build on success of last season's Big D debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Kings: Cash flow is a major problem because they're paying huge bonuses to 
Wayne Gretzky and Marty McSorley. Playing would also deflect attention from 
last season's playoff miss and minority owner Bruce McNall's legal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers: They won the Stanley Cup and can't raise the banner. Never 
crazy about the tax -- they'd be hit hard -- they'd drop it happily. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa Senators: Money problems and difficulties in financing their new arena 
make them want revenues they'd get from playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Penguins: Publicly, co-owner Howard Baldwin says he's a hard-liner. 
Privately, he's scrambling to keep his club's finances in order. There are 
rumblings that he will sell his stake. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis Blues: After hiring Mike Keenan away from the Rangers and acquiring 
defenseman Al MacInnis, they're primed for a run at the Cup and have tried 
several times to get Bettman to lift the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto Maple Leafs: Another money-maker and Cup contender, they're managed 
well at every level and can only gain if the season is played. HELENE ELLIOTT

HOLLYWOOD PARK; WINNING PHONE CALL FOR KOWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal that former hockey player Joe Kowal made on his car phone less than 24 
hours before the race turned into immediate dividends when 35-1 shot Frenchpark 
stormed home a three-length winner Sunday in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Kowal, who played two seasons for the Buffalo Sabres in the 1970s, not scoring 
a goal but once getting prominent billing in a video of "The NHL's Greatest 
Fights," bought Frenchpark for $200,000 from bloodstock agent Hubert Guy at 7 
p.m. Saturday, while driving home to Newport Beach. Guy had bought the 
4-year-old British-bred colt in France in early October, planning to sell him 
to former pitcher John D'Acquisto, but when that deal and a few others fell 
through, he spent several weeks trying to find another buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hectic time," Guy said. "I am in the business of buying and selling 
horses, not racing them, and I was going out of my mind with what to do with 
this horse." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a pre-race agreement, Kowal and Guy will split the $275,000 
winner's share of the purse, which was more than three times what Frenchpark 
earned while winning two of 12 previous races. Frenchpark raced in Europe, 
where he was passed around to three trainers, before Terry Knight saddled him 
for his U.S. debut, a fourth-place finish in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ownership exchange sounds convoluted, consider how Corey Black got the 
chance to ride Frenchpark. Black, who rides frequently for Knight, would have 
been Frenchpark's jockey for Burke, but he was committed to Sir Mark Sykes, who 
ran third in the race. Eddie Delahoussaye rode Frenchpark, but he switched to 
Jackdidi for the Turf Cup and settled for a ninth-place finish. Black might 
have been in Hong Kong this weekend, but he became available for Frenchpark 
because he had been taken off his regular mount, Megan's Interco, who finished 
far back in an $800,000 race there Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Savinio and Square Cut, who also ran in the Turf Cup, finished 1-2 in the 
Burke, but that was at 1 1/4 miles, a quarter of a mile shorter than Sunday's 
race, and Frenchpark bled badly at Santa Anita and was able to run with a 
bleeder's medication for his second U.S. start. He defeated Dare and Go, the 
9-5 favorite, who was 1 1/4 lengths ahead of Regency. Savinio was a neck back, 
in fourth place, and River Flyer, the Hollywood Derby winner, finished sixth 
after leading with an eighth of a mile to go. River Flyer and Square Cut, who 
was seventh, paid the penalty for battling one another for the lead until the 
top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenchpark, who was timed in 2:25 3/5, missing Itsallgreektome's 1990 stakes 
record by four-fifths of a second, paid $72.60, the biggest price since the 
race was first run in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In the jockeys' room before the race, there was indecision about which colors 
Black would wear for Frenchpark. Black posed in the winner's circle in the 
borrowed red-and-black silks of R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park's board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Black missed the chance to work Frenchpark. The mount had fallen 
into his lap through a domino effect and he was on his way to Las Vegas for the 
Jockeys' Guild convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "About all I knew about this horse was that Terry (Knight) thought he had 
improved leaps and bounds in the last month," Black said. "I was told to ride 
him conservatively, and maybe we'd get a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frenchpark was ninth in the 11-horse field after three-quarters of a mile, but 
only about six lengths from the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him hidden until the quarter pole," Black said. "Then I got outside at 
the three-sixteenths pole and went around Savinio. Then I said to myself, 'Oh, 
I got a little chance here.' He found the next gear and went on with it. At the 
eighth pole, when we went by Dare and Go, I knew we were going to be very 
tough. This is a nice way to end a very lackluster summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, riding Dare and Go, the Hollywood Derby runner-up, would have 
preferred a faster pace. "It took me a long time to get him to settle," Stevens 
said. "But he just couldn't keep pace with the winner down the stretch." Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Kowal's horses, Lisa Mac, won the race after the Turf Cup. . . . 
Frenchpark gave Terry Knight his first major victory and the biggest since he 
saddled Magdeleine to win the Matchmaker at Atlantic City in 1988. A trainer 
for 20 years, Knight was winless at the meet but scored with seven of 14 
starters at Hollywood's summer meet. . . . David Flores had a four-victory day. 
. . . At Bay Meadows Sunday, Russell Baze won the third race with T.V. 
Producer, becoming the second jockey to win 400 or more races three consecutive 
years. Kent Desormeaux had three 400-plus years in a row from 1987-89.

CHARLES TOWN JOCKEY THORNTON DIES FROM INJURIES SUSTAINED IN RACING FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey James Thornton died Sunday, two days after injuring his head in a fall 
from his horse at Charles Town Races. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton of Edgewood, Md., died at Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Va., 
track spokesman Paul Espinosa said. He had surgery Friday night to relieve 
pressure on his brain, but his family ruled out further surgery "due to a poor 
prognosis," Espinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton fell early during the first race Friday while riding Shifty Four in 
tight quarters. Another jockey, Glenn Reeder, was unable to avoid the fallen 
rider and also fell from his mount, Sales Book, which trampled Thornton. The 
horses were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa said Thornton is best remembered for a December 1983 race in which he 
fell from his mount, grabbed the neck of another horse that also fell, then 
pulled himself into the saddle when that horse got up and rode it to the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is survived by his former wife, Roslyn, to whom he was to be 
remarried, and five adult daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the third jockey to die at Charles Town. Charles Hinojosa died in 1985 
and Joe Snyder in the 1950s. The track ended 61 years of live racing Sunday, 
citing declining attendance and wagering and the failure of voters to approve 
video lottery.

 In a battle of Olympic downhill gold medalists, 1992 winner Patrick Ortlieb of 
Austria defeated this year's champion, American Tommy Moe, in a World Cup super 
giant slalom on Sunday at Tignes, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortlieb was timed in 1 minute 22.25 seconds. Moe was second in 1:22.58 to 
continue the U.S. success on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fog and high winds after a heavy snowstorm forced postponement of the race 
Saturday. It was run Sunday in place of a giant slalom that was rescheduled for 
Val d'Isere on Dec. 18.

SMITH HINTS AT AGREEMENT WITH ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Free-agent closer Lee Smith said Sunday night he likely will accept the 
Angels' two-year contract offer worth about $4 million this week, and might 
sign as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the decision is quite simple, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any other offers," he said. "I wanted to give everybody an 
opportunity, but I don't want to let anything slip though my fingers and then 
end up getting nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really appreciate what the Angels are doing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, baseball's all-time saves leader, said five teams were interested: 
Baltimore Orioles, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and St. 
Louis Cardinals. Yet, only the Angels made an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Brian David told the Angels, who set no deadline for Smith, to expect a 
decision today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only wait so long," Smith said. "I don't think the Angels are going 
to wait until spring training to get a closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 37, who produced a major league-leading 33 saves last season with the 
Orioles, had been awaiting an offer from them. He underwent a magnetic 
resonance imaging test on his knees and ankles last week at the Orioles' 
insistence, and received a clean bill of health last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Orioles still were undecided Sunday night whether they wanted 
Smith, a high-ranking Oriole official said. Even if the Orioles made an offer, 
the source said, it would be for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind staying in Baltimore," Smith said. "But you can't always get 
you want. I've given them ample time to make an offer. I'm not going to wait 
forever."

EL DORADO'S RENKEN GROWS INTO GAME; HIGH SCHOOL: OFF-SEASON WORK ETHIC HELPS 
SENIOR FORWARD RAISE GAME TO HIGHER LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Shanna Renken remembers it well. She was sitting on the bench, and every time 
El Dorado Coach Gary Raya would walk past her in the 1992 Southern Section 
semifinal against Inglewood Morningside, Renken would look the other way, 
hoping he somehow wouldn't notice her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my freshman year," she recalled. "We were in CIF and I didn't even 
know what CIF was, and Morningside was supposed to be real good. And I was 
thinking, 'I hope he doesn't put me out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Raya stopped and spoke. "You go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Renken can still feel that knot in her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was toward the end of the first quarter," she said. "We were playing real 
bad. I noticed no one else was scoring, so I thought, 'How can I possibly 
score?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She scored right away, on a move to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'Whoa, maybe I can do this,' " Renken said. "After that, I would 
spend all my time off the court playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Renken now lives on the basketball court, honing her skills for an El Dorado 
team that is one of the county's best, a team that hopes to reach a Southern 
Section final after reaching the semifinals twice -- including last year -- and 
quarterfinals once in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Renken and her teammates will get a workout this week, beginning at 6 p.m. 
today with the first game of the El Dorado Co-ed Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, Renken had played hardly any basketball at all. Her sport was 
soccer, and she went out for the basketball team to try to escape some of the 
pressures of being a club soccer goalkeeper. But two weeks into the season, she 
made the junior varsity team because of her natural talent. Four games later, 
after the varsity team was hit by injuries, Renken was on the varsity, a 
freshman out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has been quite a catch since. 
</P>
<P>
 Renken, a senior forward who is 5 feet 11, averaged nine points and 12 
rebounds as a sophomore and 14 points and 14 rebounds in an injury-riddled 
junior year -- she missed 14 games because of a knee injury. This season, she 
knocked Raya over with her off-season work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the first player to start with me and go through the program and 
achieve this kind of success," Raya said. "Her commitment to the game and 
conditioning to prepare for her senior year has been a great example for her 
teammates to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an overachiever -- not playing (any appreciable) ball until high school 
and then getting in a semifinal game as a freshman -- she works hard. Her size 
and athletic ability is good, and her quickness sets her apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Renken has, in some ways, been an early- and late-bloomer. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the court, her skills came quicker than we expected," Raya said. "Off the 
court, she got there a little slower. When she realized what she does off the 
court affects what takes place on the court, she set her sights on the right 
things and made a commitment to the right things. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has grown into her body and grown into an adult -- that's the most 
important thing. She realized how important academics are, and her commitment 
to academics and basketball followed." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Canyon (Ariz.) University has been impressed. It has shown the most 
interest in Renken, and she likes the idea of going to a small school instead 
of a high-profile program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I would just feel more comfortable," Renken said. "It would be like 
it was here, where the basketball program wasn't really anything and we just 
built it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Other colleges that have shown interest include St. John's, Arizona State, 
Portland, Northern Illinois and Stetson. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches are just dumbfounded that it's only her fourth year of 
basketball and that she's as strong as she is without ever lifting weights on a 
consistent basis," Raya said. "They're thinking that once they get her into the 
weight room, she can be a pretty good player." 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to say she's not a pretty good high school player now. Her 
improvement over last year has been considerable, Raya said, and some of 
Renken's newfound insight has come from an unusual source -- coaching. The act 
of coaching, not from someone else's coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 She and former El Dorado teammate Jody Caruso coached a group of seventh- and 
eighth-graders earlier this year, and she found it to be as enlightening as 
getting into the Morningside game 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it to be fun," Renken said. "I learned a lot from it. You see the game 
a whole different way."

ANN CONWAY: CHARITIES NOT LIKELY TO FEEL O.C. CRISIS 
</P>

 Don't look for Orange County's bankruptcy to have a major impact on the 
charity scene, say local social leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy losses by Orange County's investment pool resulted last week in the 
county filing for bankruptcy protection in the biggest municipal finance 
debacle in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all in shock, of course, but we'll get over it," says real estate 
developer George Argyros, a big supporter of the arts, Chapman University in 
Orange and the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty and confusion about how the bankruptcy will affect individuals may 
cause donors to tighten their money belts, "but not for long," Argyros says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know Orange County has always been a place where we have leadership and 
vision and the guts to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that positive things will come out of this -- hopefully in the way 
we govern ourselves. We need to have more qualified people, more expertise," he 
says. "In Orange County, the government system was designed when we were an 
agrarian society. Now we're a suburban society, and we haven't changed our form 
of government to keep pace with our demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Billur Wallerich, community relations director of South Coast Plaza (owned by 
the Segerstrom family) -- a major player on Orange County's charity landscape 
-- says news of the bankruptcy has not made any negative waves at the Costa 
Mesa retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are shopping away," she says. And the shopping mecca's commitment to 
participate in charity events will proceed as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has had its ups and downs -- fires, earthquakes, mudslides -- 
and always come through. It's who we are ." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Catherine Thyen, who chaired Sunday's Candlelight Concert on 
behalf of the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, news of the 
bankruptcy has caused an "enormous concern for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think it will have a major impact on arts funding," says Thyen, 
who also raises funds on behalf of South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arts is not dependent on government funding, though a ripple effect might 
be felt. We don't know the full extent of the impact and probably won't for a 
long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if any community could survive something like this, we could. The spirit 
of the county seems to survive all sorts of devastation. We put it behind us 
and rebound. It's our history." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Tomlinson, executive director of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
says he is confident that donors will continue to support the center and its 
fund-raising social events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a well-managed, fiscally prudent organization -- a safe place to 
invest philanthropically," he says. "The center is not a government 
institution, nor does it accept any funding from the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Louis Spisto, executive director of the Pacific Symphony: "We are 
confident our supporters will continue to stand by us. The only concern I have 
about the bankruptcy is that there would be further cutbacks in school music 
programs and arts programs. That would impact us." 
</P>

 Meanwhile, close friends of Robert L. Citron, Orange County's resigned 
treasurer-tax collector, are standing by the man hailed in social circles as 
one of USC's most ardent fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good friend; I like him very much," says Paul Salata, a retired 
investor who lives on Linda Isle in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's beyond reproach -- has always been a good, hard-working guy who I think 
is terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 When Citron was on the social scene, he got teased a lot, Salata says. "People 
were always asking things like, 'Can we get a break on our tax bill?'  
</P>
<P>
 "And he would say, 'It should be increased !' People were always confusing him 
with the assessor, who decides how much. We'd make certain that the jokes were 
about collecting to say something funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Salata has always enjoyed his visits to Citron's Santa Ana home. Citron is 
such an avid booster of USC that even his bathroom is decorated in cardinal and 
gold, he says. "The towels, the toilet seat, the mirrors -- there's no 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also has a penchant for colorful clothes when he attends USC sporting 
events. "He's the guy in the red pants and the gold shirt," Salata says. "He is 
totally Trojan." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Kobrin of Newport Beach also counts Citron among his best pals. "I've 
known him for nearly 20 years," says Kobrin, who writes a people column for the 
Daily Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just about as open, frank and engaging as any man I've ever met -- great 
fun to be with."

A TRICKY, STICKY SITUATION; WHAT IS AN AMERICAN ICON? ELVIS? A MUSHROOM CLOUD? 
THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN HOGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time again for the ultimate test of what's in and what's out. Early next 
month, behind closed doors, the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee will meet 
here to discuss who and what should appear on that singular place of national 
honor -- a U.S. postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues are sticky. What about popular but tainted? Think Elvis stamp, with 
its $36 million in revenue last year -- although other drug-using singers (Jimi 
Hendrix and Janis Joplin) were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 What about historic but tainted? Think mushroom cloud, an image on a stamp 
scheduled for 1995 that the Postal Service agreed to withdraw on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 These are difficult days in the increasingly difficult business of minting 
American icons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a burden, no doubt about it," says John Foxworth Jr., the auto industry 
executive who chaired the World War II subcommittee that in the late 1980s 
chose a picture of an atomic blast for a stamp commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized the atomic bomb would be controversial, that some people would 
object. But we just didn't feel we could represent the end of World War II 
without depicting the event that ended the war," says Foxworth, who retired 
from the group in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of people, from Japanese officials to the U.S. State Department, 
disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who last month pressured the Postal Service into 
reinstating a Madonna and Child Christmas stamp after a national squawk about 
its discontinuance, also prevailed in the matter of the bomb stamp. The White 
House did not object to commemorating the bombings, but the artwork depicting 
the nuclear mushroom cloud was a poor choice, said Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service will substitute a stamp with a picture of Harry S. Truman 
announcing the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 These controversies have raised provocative questions for the Stamp Advisory 
Committee and the country: Just who or what is an American icon? 
</P>
<P>
 There are some rules. A subject can't be commercial. It must have broad 
national appeal. It can't be a living person. The subject must be American, or 
at least American-related. It shouldn't be religious (with the exception, it 
appears, of Madonnas). Major anniversaries and events, such as wars and 
statehood, can be commemorated only every 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at recent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon? In. All Presidents get a stamp the year after their deaths, 
even the ones who quit. (Other people have to be dead for at least 10 years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Monroe? In. The stamp, due out next year, is expected to be a big 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lennon? Out. (He was British.) 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Oakley? In, finally, after 10 years of tireless lobbying by one of her 
descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah? Out -- again -- to the dismay of a Marietta, Ga., plastics engineer 
who has been writing to the committee for years championing a stamp for the 
Jewish Festival of Lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Free Enterprise? Out. A swell idea, but how do you draw it? 
</P>
<P>
 No decision is final. The 15 members of the Stamp Advisory Committee -- 
artists, scholars, business executives, marketers, all with an interest in 
philately -- can always decide to approve Lennon, Hanukkah or Free Enterprise 
at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, chosen by the postmaster general, does its national duty for 
expenses and a small stipend. The current group includes actor Karl Malden, 
sports figure Richard (Digger) Phelps and Los Angeles designer Michael Brock. 
Among former members are author James Michener and actor Ernest Borgnine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times a year, the group meets for two days in a conference room at U.S. 
Postal Service headquarters. Working several years ahead of when a stamp is 
actually issued, members pore over an agenda that postal officials cull from 
thousands of submissions from groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Postal Service moves toward hip, contemporary and socially inclusive, 
the chance of an average American's hero, passion or ancestor appearing on a 
U.S. postage stamp has skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're right up there with George Washington," says committee chair Virginia 
Noelke, a professor of history at Angelo State University in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new George Washingtons include Bessie Coleman, the first African 
American woman aviator and Phoebe Yates Levy Pember, a Confederate nurse who 
fed soldiers her famous chicken soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members say there isn't a subject that doesn't surface in the requests 
-- Shaker chairs, fishbowls, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, somebody's 
grandmother. Can your grandmother make it? Possibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did your grandmother do?" asks 10-year stamp panel member Phelps, the 
former Notre Dame basketball coach. "If your grandmother did something great in 
her own neighborhood, she probably won't make it. But that submission could 
spark an idea. There might be a groundswell of people whose grandmothers did 
great things in their neighborhoods, and then we might look at the idea of 
grandmothers in general. We try to reflect what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is not without its critics. "With their need to be politically 
correct, they're ending up with all these obscure people that John Q. Public 
has never heard of," says Michael Laurence, editor of Linn's Stamp News, the 
country's largest stamp publication. "George Washington hasn't been on a stamp 
in 10 years. Some of the old subjects my constituency longs for have been 
jettisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence and some other stamp experts say the committee is really a political 
buffer between stamp hopefuls and the Postal Service. "You can bet that of 
those thousands of submissions the committee gets each year, a lot of them are 
already in the works by the Postal Service marketing department," Laurence 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee says it isn't so. "We look at everything," says panel member 
Mary Ann Owens, an international stamp show judge from Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 While the stamp group sorts through thousands of submissions for about 50 to 
100 annual spots, final approval belongs to the postmaster general. 
</P>
<P>
 The President pushes a stamp agenda by pressuring the postmaster general. 
"Once, President (Ronald) Reagan wanted a Hispanic veterans stamp. He wanted 
the Hispanic vote," Phelps says. "Our view was, if you do one group of vets, 
you have to do every other group -- Irish, Italian, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we said no." But the decision came down on the President's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the White House victory on the atomic bomb stamp, "I'm not surprised. There 
certainly are two sides to the issue," says committee chairwoman Noelke. 
"Ultimately it's the postmaster general's call. He cares what the President 
thinks as have all postmasters general." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, what is retained in the national memory may have very little to do 
with what is commemorated by the Postal Service. As with Mozart and Salieri, 
time -- not a committee -- will tell.

100 miles northeast of here. It took Stoner, seven schemers and 145 pounds of 
explosives to reshape this rapid from an experts' deadly menace to a cascade 
for lesser river runners. 
</P>
<P>
 But when accused of the bombing, he wouldn't say why. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner, a 34-year-old river guide, was tarred as the amoral commander of the 
Quartzite Eight, destroyers of a natural and signature resource. News stories 
from Pasadena to Paris described his wrecking crew as eco-terrorists, heretics 
and environmental rapists. A letter to Paddler magazine suggests Stoner's next 
river ride be face-down without a rubber boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner still spoke no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a federal grand jury indicted William Stoner -- "Taz" since high 
school for approaching football, sky-diving, rodeo, life and food with the 
fierce appetite of a Tasmanian devil -- on charges of conspiracy and 
destruction of federal property. Along with Richard Scott, Stephen Cortright, 
William Kelley, James Lewus, and the brothers Christopher, Mark and Michael 
Meehl. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Quartzite Eight stayed silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came two months of hot pretrial rumors. The most popular accuses Stoner 
of blowing Quartzite Falls to reduce a rafting bottleneck and make his 
part-time job easier. Some are whispering that one or maybe all three companies 
licensed to run this 58-mile stretch of river, from U.S. 60 to Highway 288, 
paid him to tame the falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did the U.S. Forest Service, guardian of the river, turn a blind eye to 
Stoner's blasting because the deadly rapids represented a perennial federal 
liability? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, preparing to plead guilty, Stoner finally spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it to save lives . . . to make it safer for the public to pass through 
there," he said. He said he toyed with doing something for years. Then, two 
Californians drowned at Quartzite. "It made me want to take the killer out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The death trap -- familiar to river runners and federal publications covering 
the Salt River Wilderness of Tonto National Forest -- was created by a rose 
quartz ridge, 21 feet across, that partially barricaded the falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-season, at low water, with the river running at 400 cubic feet of water 
per second, the rock was visible and harmless. On season, when the snow-fed 
Salt River may thunder at 50,000 CFS until its canyon walls quiver, the ridge 
was submerged and built silent, invisible, hydraulic downforces. 
</P>
<P>
 This underwater disturbance elevated Quartzite Falls to a Class 6 ride -- 
somewhere between vicious and inescapable. The type of hazard river-runners 
call a "keeper," it sucked logs, cows, even 16-foot boats to the bottom, 
holding anything down for maybe 30 seconds before spitting it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the stupid or exceptionally skilled ran Quartzite at full boil in a 
rubber boat. The majority carried their craft around the falls. Or "lined" 
them, tethering rafts to long ropes and leading them through the 100-foot long 
rapids like a hippo on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, Richard Panich, 44, of Manhattan Beach, and Jerry Buckhold, 43, 
of Chico, dared to run the falls. The keeper grabbed their boat. The veteran 
rafters drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read about the drownings and wasn't surprised," Stoner recalls. He is a 
bachelor who speaks softly from a gentle face with the look of a loner. 
"Quartzite Falls is a hazard, has been for a number of years, I knew of its 
dangers. . . . Still, if I'd ever thought about (demolition) before, I wasn't 
serious. After the drownings, I was serious."  
</P>
<P>
 Stoner, a construction engineer on weekdays, a skier, diver, hiker, hunter and 
climber on weekends, says he faxed a copy of a news story about the drownings 
to a man he had taken down the river: Rich Scott, 39, an explosives and 
hazardous materials expert with a masters degree in engineering from Arizona 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott recruited a crew from good buddies who also had run the river with 
Stoner. They are companions in campfire parties, hiking, fishing, families and 
picnics. They have small businesses and no criminal records. Most are married, 
some baby-sit each other's kids, almost all say they share Stoner's concern for 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Except Cortright, 39, owner of a furniture-foam company and the wheel man who 
drove explosives and bombers to the site: "My motivation was that it was a 
weekend rouser with the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Scott used an $800 cashier's check to buy commercial binary 
explosives -- inert ammonium nitrate in four-pound pouches that comes alive 
when mixed with nitro methane. Exploded by detonator and primer cord, the mix 
is 30% more powerful than gelatin dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
 Between August and October of last year -- sometimes as a group of five, 
sometimes just Scott and Stoner -- the Quartzite Eight took four cruel hikes 
and one raft ride to the falls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two explosions . . . 28 pounds the first time, 30 pounds the next . 
. . there wasn't a whole lot of damage," Stoner says. "The third was 68 pounds, 
explosives the size of a beach ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That broke the back of the ridge. Final, smaller blasts performed surgery, 
trimming and cleaning. The ridge now juts only six feet across the river. Its 
fatal hydraulics are believed to be finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process, Stoner has violated a natural setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad about that because I do have respect for rivers," he says. "A lot 
of people, including some friends of mine, are disgusted that we did it. And 
I'm ashamed to have hurt their feelings in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I made something safer. Lives will be saved. That outweighs the 
destruction of a natural resource in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spring was a poor, dry season on the Upper Salt. Only a scattering of boats 
ran the river. So the wounds of Quartzite Falls went undetected until March. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when one rafter reported that the ride seemed different, not quite as 
intimidating. Then a length of fuse was found alongside the sharp edges of 
freshly blown rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Explosives records led federal agents to Scott. Interviews with Tonto Forest 
officials and river outfitters pointed at Stoner. 
</P>
<P>
 For there had been complaints that Stoner, a guide for Desert Voyager Rafting 
Tours of Mesa, had been involved in arguments with other rafters portaging or 
lining boats around and through Quartzite. At a spot where jammed boats could 
produce five-hour delays in negotiating the falls, Stoner had been known to 
jump the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation, some published, was direct. Stoner was said to have blown the 
falls to ease delays and move more people. Conceivably, that could add to his 
income and increase the number of two-day trips organized by Desert Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
 That, Stoner counters, is nonsense. He already works every weekend of the 
three-month season, so additional trips wouldn't benefit him. He earns $50,000 
a year as a full-time engineer and only $3,000 as a part-time river guide. And 
he guides for pleasure, not profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he blasted only one rock the size of a Volkswagen. That, he says, 
improved the safety of the falls without reducing their size, pace, level of 
difficulty or challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very possible we're still going to get three-hour waits with eight boats 
in line," he says. "The falls are still a big tourist attraction and people 
will want to stop there. This will remain one of the most exciting rapids on 
the river, and only the most experienced will choose to run it. Now they won't 
die doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Blumm owns Desert Voyager. He insists that he had nothing to gain by 
Stoner's assault on Quartzite Falls. His permit allows him to raft 286 people 
each season, and each season he carries close to the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know these guys were not hired mercenaries," he says. "We (river 
outfitters) have got too much to lose, nothing to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators probed deep to find a financial link between outfitters and the 
Quartzite Eight. Stoner and Scott denied any connection and agreed to polygraph 
tests. A source within the investigation said both men passed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is generally accepted that the Forest Service would never disturb natural 
formations of a federal wilderness. There is no evidence suggesting any 
official of the agency gave Stoner a wink, a nod and tacit approval for the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the early '70s, after another drowning at Quartzite Falls, there were 
calls for correction. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came to us and said the obvious solution to this is to destroy it," 
recalls Pete Weinel, recreation director of the Tonto National Forest and 
co-author of its guide to the Upper Salt River. "So we looked at it and we 
said: 'No, that's really not the solution. The solution is to be careful and to 
be warned.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service, he adds, does not consider Quartzite Falls a liability. A 
hazard, yes. But posted and well publicized and a calculated risk. And no 
victim's family has ever filed a lawsuit over fatal accidents at the falls. 
</P>
<P>
 George Marsic, owner of World Wide Explorations, believes risk is part of the 
river's allure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when danger turns deadly and places such as Quartzite Falls become fatal 
attractions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, yes," he says. "Each river has its own personality, its own reality, 
and (Quartzite) was part of the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Class 3 rapid can kill somebody. You can drown in a bathtub. That (risk) is 
part of the wilderness experience. John Wesley Powell would have never gone 
down the Colorado if he'd been worried about dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, say Marsic and other outfitters, the Forest Service could have created a 
climate that encouraged Stoner's act. Budget and manpower restrictions have 
always minimized river management. Only this year, Marsic says, did officials 
agree to a permit system and limit the number of private boats to increase 
safety on the Salt River. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the service has constantly wanted to defer that," he says. "Now, two 
deaths and a major destruction of a natural resource happens. Oh, yes, I point 
the finger -- in the sense that the situation became so aggravated that 
somebody (Stoner) did something stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner anticipated protest and criticism for his act. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't expect a global demand for his hide. 
</P>
<P>
 W.L. Minckley, a professor of zoology at Arizona State University, says he is 
studying the damage to measure depletion, if any, of the native fish 
population. But he is more concerned "that certain people have absolutely no 
respect for public lands and they go in and destroy a remarkable natural 
feature. And apparently with no thought of this being ethically wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Peters is Arizona director of American Rivers. She despises the thought 
of individuals deliberately damaging God's wilderness. And what's next? 
</P>
<P>
 "What if somebody says: 'Gosh, I don't like this rapid in the Grand Canyon and 
it's really too hard to run'?" she asks. "Does that mean somebody can sneak 
down there some winter month and blow it up and rearrange it? Or what if 
somebody doesn't like Mt. Rushmore? Can they go blow it up?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner was hoping for understanding from Bob Finkbine. They have known each 
other for six years as fellow river guides. But Finkbine, 63, a poet and 
retired teacher, cannot be sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his future is duller. Because Quartzite carried the evil fascination 
of the jaws of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd come down the river knowing how dangerous it was and the adrenaline 
would start to pump," he remembers. "Is there any chance of running it? Could 
we get by on the right? Do we line it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nature established it as a barrier, a challenge. At times you'd moan and 
groan about it. But this was an exhilaration of the river in its natural state. 
It was free.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now. Boom! It's gone. In my poet's eye, the womb is still bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner is guilty of another oversight. He didn't research laws concerning 
conspiracies and explosives and destruction of federal property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda knew we were doing something wrong," he admits. "But I had no idea it 
was a felony. I had no idea you could go to jail for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But that is indeed the letter of the law. Conspiracy has a maximum penalty of 
five years, and destruction of federal property could bring a 20-year sentence. 
Both felonies carry $250,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten by the passionate backlash, broken by $10,000 in legal fees, Stoner 
pleaded guilty last week in exchange for a sentence of up to 18 months in a 
federal facility. Scott has signed the same agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The others have also plea-bargained. Depending on the extent of participation, 
there will be short sentences, probation or community service. Sentencing will 
be in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoner is bitter. He think his crime has been overblown by environmental 
extremists. And that their movement has lost its human priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We removed a rock, we didn't obliterate a pretty, beautiful waterfall," he 
says. "Sure, this may have taken something away from a very few people who were 
qualified to run it in its previous condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we had a purpose that will benefit all people for years to come, and 
ultimately save lives. And if we're guilty of anything, we're probably guilty 
of weighing out human life as being worth more than that rock." 
</P>
<P>
 There remain enormous ironies to this Great Caper of the Quartzite Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 For public perception is of a defanged Quartzite Falls with the Upper Salt 
reduced to a milk run. That could attract new hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 They clearly will be no match for Island Rapid, where one man died in 1973, 
and Reforma Rapid, where another drowned in 1986. And Overboard, Corkscrew and 
Cliff Hanger rapids were not named for their peaceful natures. 
</P>
<P>
 Owing to unseasonably low water, nobody has been tested by the Quartzite Falls 
in the 14 months since the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there was no change and at full bore the falls are as deadly as ever. Or 
maybe the flow has been changed -- and will create new dangers downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved some rock and to look at it you know it's going to be different," 
Stoner agrees. "But I don't know, it's still awfully deep on that downward 
side." 
</P>

JACK SMITH: ETERNAL BLISS MAY HAVE ITS DRAWBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been much talk lately about heaven. The Life & Style section 
recently devoted its front page to it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much testimony that it does not exist. For heaven's sake what would 
we do without it? The language would be sadly weakened were there no mild 
expletives such as those derived from the word itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Little boys and girls are taught not to say, "The hell with it," though I 
can't see why. Many times when I was a small boy I felt like saying it and 
sometimes did. But they can say "for heaven's sake" or "thank heaven" or any 
other variation of that celestial nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to think the word was especially favored by older women. Whenever she 
was taken by mild surprise, my grandmother used to say, "Heavens to Betsy," 
though she never gave us a clue as to who Betsy might be. Of course to suggest 
that such locutions are the province of older women is sexist and ageist. I 
don't want to do that. Heavens to Betsy! 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven is not only thought of in our culture as a nice place to live but also 
as a source of power or benign favor, like God himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The language is replete with such supplications as "Heaven help us!" and 
"Heaven will help the working girl." The latter evidently derives from the 
early 20th Century when young women first entered the work force and were 
oppressed and harassed by their male associates. Heaven help them, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently there is a flood of recent books about heaven, some of them by 
people who have been there. I do not believe a dead person, or a person who has 
been dead, can write a book (though I have read some that read like it). 
</P>
<P>
 Heaven is thought to be a place of eternal bliss. For whom? One can hardly 
imagine a place that would be bliss for everyone. Eternal bliss is eternal 
boredom. Imagine lying on a bed of pansies on a nice spring day under a peach 
tree while naked maidens dance all about. Soon one would want to turn on the TV 
or read the comic page. 
</P>
<P>
 What if heaven were an eternal replay of the USC-UCLA football game? Is there 
anything that one would want to see over and over again, no matter who won? 
</P>
<P>
 No. It seems to me impossible for anyone to write a script for a perfect day 
in heaven. For one thing, what is life without conflict? Even life without 
defeat? What if USC always won? Worse yet, what if they always tied -- as they 
did last month? Heaven would theoretically have to be an eternal tie. What a 
bore. 
</P>
<P>
 In heaven (one supposes), everything would be suffused in soft lights and soft 
music. OK. But what about those who wanted to read the newspaper? What about 
those who wanted to hear hard rock? (I assume in all fairness a few of them 
would get in.) 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there would be no politics in heaven. Would a citizen like to wake up 
and read (if there was enough light) that the government had been overturned in 
a military coup? Who even in hell wants that? 
</P>
<P>
 I have never been dead, but I think I have been close enough to know what it's 
like. I was in a coma once a few years ago. My heart had stopped. All signs of 
life had vanished. The doctor told my wife not to expect me to live. I had been 
on the other shore. Believe me, there was nothing there. No light. No music. No 
perfume. No football game. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no law (this is a democracy, remember) against a person saying that 
he or she has been to heaven. But they'd better bring home some pictures or I'm 
not going to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
 I see no reason to believe that in case of my death I would not be admitted to 
heaven. Oh, I've committed a few sins, but nothing felonious. I don't know what 
the rules of admission are, but if half of us get there the place is going to 
be as overcrowded as hell. It will be as cosmopolitan as Los Angeles and twice 
as hectic. Half of us will be USC fans and half UCLA. We will have the same 
amount of conflict as we do here and the same amounts of joy and misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows where heaven is. Jesus is said to have ascended to heaven, which 
suggests that it's up. But space is all around us. He could just as well have 
descended. 
</P>
<P>
 No planet is big enough to hold the dead of all time. So heaven must just hang 
free, out there in space. But then there wouldn't be any gravity. You couldn't 
even play Ping-Pong. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to anyone is that if they come for you, don't go.

 In the news: Comic Argus Hamilton, on President Clinton at the Summit of the 
Americas conference in Miami: "Leaders discussed hemisphere-wide trade without 
import duties. It worked so well with cocaine, they decided to try it with 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on Darryl Strawberry and his agent being indicted 
for not paying income taxes on money Strawberry earned for signing autographs: 
"When Darryl was delivered the indictment, he refused to sign it until a 
federal marshal forked over $100." If convicted, Hamilton says, "Darryl could 
get five years in prison. His agent, of course, would get 10% of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on the heirs of Three Stooges' Mo Howard being 
ordered to pay heirs of Larry and Curly $2 million in unpaid movie profits: 
"The judge said, 'The jury's verdict is approved -- nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.' He then 
adjourned by giving noogies to his court reporter and banging his bailiff on 
the head with a rubber mallet." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on Ollie North working on a deal to be a talk show 
host: "He just needs 900 more guns, which he'll then trade for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, on Jerry Lewis joining the Broadway cast of "Damn Yankees": "Leave it 
to Jerry to pick a show that will make the French revere him even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyser, on the Wilmington, Del., law that limits panhandling to five days a 
year without a city permit: "A similar ordinance also limits the amount of 
begging by public TV stations." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the link between smoking and impotence: "Doctors 
thought they had a remedy, but the patch was impossible to keep on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, on nude pictures of Paula Jones in Penthouse magazine: "She doesn't want 
to keep the photos. She just wants to frame the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Marc A. Holmes, on word that Roseanne is pregnant: "She's 
already cranky and eats lots of weird food, so the only way doctors could tell 
was with a blood test." 
</P>
<P>

 Reader file: Jerry Gilbert of Venice says there's good news for Orange County: 
"What with the depressed mood over the financial mess and the boycott of 
Disneyland led by Latino groups, the waiting time is down to 45 minutes at 
Pirates of the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
 R. Alex Kaseberg of La Jolla says government services are to be cut so 
severely in Orange County "that officials will change the name of John Wayne 
Airport to John Wayne Bobbitt Airstrip." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kevany of L.A., on the furor over the now-rejected mushroom cloud stamp: 
"Despite bowing to White House pressure, postal officials still feel the whole 
thing was blown out of proportion."

COMMITMENTS; INVASION OF THE DEMOCRAT SNATCHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, the Republicans are smiling and unpacking their boxes in government 
buildings all over the country, and my women friends and I are wearing black 
and weeping and putting our social concerns away with the baby clothes -- fond 
memories but with no use right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry White Men have risen up to reclaim their own, we are told, and the hands 
that pulled the Republican levers during the midterm elections will now use 
those guns that they feel they have an inalienable right to own to draw a bead 
on this country's social conscience. All in the name of lower taxes and a more 
cost-effective approach to things such as children and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The national press seems just to have discovered these guys, but my friends 
and I have known about them for years. They live in our neighborhoods. They 
share our table. They father our children. Those Angry White Men are married to 
my Horrified White Women friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who went to bed 20 years ago with a guy who was at least a Democrat -- 
if not a philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger -- find themselves waking up 
beside a Bob Dole obstructionist with Rush Limbaugh on the clock radio. 
</P>
<P>
 (This does not apply to my friend Betsy, who says she knew how conservative 
her husband was when they were dating, but she married him anyway. He still has 
his Goldwater bumper stickers: "In your heart, you know he's right.") 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us don't recognize our husbands anymore. And it isn't the hairline or 
the waistline, but the political lines they have drawn between us. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we moved back to the United States after living in Canada," says my 
friend Diana, "he told every new person we met, 'Health care is a right, not a 
privilege.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They can't even discuss health-care reform now without veins throbbing in his 
neck. And don't even mention Hillary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened to him," she says. "But I think while I was home 
with the kids, he was out in the business world becoming more and more 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 This gap between the personal agendas of men and women, one that I am 
convinced has been there forever, was clearly demonstrated this past election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, 54% of male voters cast their ballots for Republican House 
candidates, while 54% of women voters cast their vote for Democrats. It is the 
largest gender gap since pollsters started keeping track in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 This election season, men were talking in dispassionate terms about running 
government like a sound business, while women talked passionately about the 
welfare of children and education. Everybody worried about crime. But men want 
to reinstate the death penalty, and women want to fund more Head Start 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always had a soft heart for anyone," Diana says. "But I find that the 
only other ones who share my views are teachers and mothers -- women who are 
down in the trenches with the kids and see that they all deserve a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The instinct to accumulate and then protect is distinctly male and very 
primal. Men are out in the world earning theirs, and they don't want shirkers 
or big government to take it away. They go home after a hard day at the mill 
and find the wife making a long list of the deserving poor. No wonder they are 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 When my children asked the difference between Republicans and Democrats, I 
explained -- quite succinctly, I thought -- that Democrats care about poor 
people and children and all Republicans care about is their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me clarify that," my husband said. "Republicans don't want people like 
your mother giving all their money away." 
</P>
<P>
 The strains that politics puts on marriages make James Carville and Mary 
Matalin look like Ozzie and Harriet. My husband greets me most mornings by 
saying: "Well, your boy Clinton is at it again." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that if Angry White Men and Empathetic White Women can share 
the same address, there is hope for the two-party system.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; DON'T LOOK BACK -- LIFE IS GAINING ON YOU

 I haven't been a big fan of birthdays for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as the year finally surrenders to December and the brittle age of 30 
lurks less than 365 days away, I'm not sure I'll ever look forward to one 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 I swear I did my best to look relaxed -- even happy -- as my mom and 
girlfriend waltzed the traditional marble fudge cake out of the kitchen, their 
smiling faces beaming over the glowing candles. But all I could see was the 
best years of my life going up in the smoke from those tiny wax pyres. 
</P>
<P>
 Birthdays were nice when life was simple. Back in the days when the 
celebration meant a living room full of toys, lots of cards stuffed with money 
from relatives I'd never met, and neighborhood friends over for a hot-dog roast 
and slumber party. That era came to an end with the dawn of puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, I've had only two birthdays that I really looked forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen hit when I was still in high school, and with it came the jubilant 
feeling (if false hope) that somehow I was emancipated. I was a "legal" adult. 
Reveling in this newfound freedom, I registered to vote, signed my draft 
eligibility card and rented a porno flick. Somehow that vow I'd made at 16 to 
move out as soon as I was 18 didn't seem important anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The next, and last, cool B-day came along three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The sacred 21. I scanned my driver's license for a long time on that hallowed 
occasion, blissful that my days of standing in front of liquor stores with 
friends looking for sympathetic adults willing to do us "a favor" were over. 
What a gift that was, no more having to look insulted or befuddled when a clerk 
carded me. No more asking if they'd accept a library card. 
</P>
<P>
 With beer legally in hand, I waded into the long haul of my 20s. It was a 
wondrous, carefree era. Yet at 22 I never imagined I'd be waxing about the 
glory days a mere eight years down the road. I never imagined I'd be full of 
fear, anticipation and dread as I wrapped up my third decade of life. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of my friends fell into marriage and a 9-to-5 grind well before they 
were 25, but figuring I might be on to a good thing, I stayed single and in 
school until my mid 20s. I remember an uncle of mine laughing the time I told 
him I was under pressure from the folks to graduate and get on with my life. 
"Milk it for as long as you can," he advised. Little did I know what words of 
wisdom those truly were. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of "milking it" have pretty much faded away, but the finality of 
life's changes didn't really hit until I was staring down the cold barrel of 
another birthday cake.  
</P>
<P>
 My mom decorated the cake with Peanuts characters such as Linus, Charlie Brown 
and Snoopy holding signs that were supposed to cheer me up. But they may as 
well have read "Happy Birthday Blockhead! Another year has rolled by and your 
hair's a little thinner, your gut a little bigger and you're indentured to 
Citibank!" 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that all this angst surrounding this birthday has taught me is that 
age really isn't a stigma to many women, at least when they are hitting their 
30s and 40s. I cautiously asked several female friends and colleagues of mine 
how they handled the end of their 20s, figuring I might find some consolation 
there. Bad move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fine," one replied. "You know that old saying about women are like 
wine? It's true. Thirty was great and 40 was even better." Another told me: "I 
felt like I was finally hitting my stride when I turned 30. I was just entering 
my prime. Evolving from a girl into a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Wine. Prime. Ahhhhh! They felt like a fine glass of Gallo. I felt like a grape 
shriveling on the vine. 
</P>
<P>
 Down at the neighborhood bar, my buddies were a little more sympathetic. By 
the time their 20s were ending, many of them were getting divorced, remarried, 
paying child support, looking for another job. They told me not to worry about 
it. They said I'd get over it. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part, they assured me, was women really do get better in their 30s 
and 40s. Financially independent, clear-minded and sexually confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they all want a man with the same qualities," one friend promised. "They 
don't want some kid in college whose parents are paying his auto insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 I felt a little better after that, but my girlfriend is 23, which means I'm in 
for a long wait before she hits her prime. And by that time, 40 will be 
tightening its noose around my neck. But as my friends said, it's unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 I can hear the captain's voice crackling over the cabin intercom. That's 30 
down below. It's time to take my seat and buckle up. The flight was pretty 
smooth but it looks like it's going to be a rough landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's my attendant? I think I need a drink.

COMMITMENTS; THE (OTHER) PARENT TRAP; MEETING YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER'S PARENTS 
CAN BE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE -- WHEN OTHERWISE NORMAL PEOPLE SUDDENLY TURN 
INQUISITOR. BUT DON'T FRET, THERE ARE WAYS TO CHARM MOMS AND DADS ALIKE.

 What's scarier than a college entrance exam, riskier than an IRS audit, more 
painful than root canal work? 
</P>
<P>
 Interview with a potential in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 At any age, meeting your significant other's parents is a stressful, sometimes 
traumatic, experience for everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors can recount verbatim each little insult uttered by a spouse's parent 
decades earlier. Otherwise normal parents turn inquisitor, grilling suitors and 
sweethearts alike. 
</P>
<P>
 For during these first encounters, while our conscious self is busy lapping up 
eggnog and fruitcake, our subconscious is reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you meet parents for the first time, the initial concern is that they 
approve of you," said UCLA psychiatrist Dr. Walter E. Brackelmanns. "Then it's 
common to transfer the problems that you had with your own parents as a child 
to the fiance's parents. It's not two people who get married; it's six." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents go through their own psychological wringer when meeting prospective 
sons- and daughters-in-law. The experience often brings to a head the issue of 
separation -- one that can be particularly pronounced between genders. 
</P>
<P>
 "In relationships in which everyone is stuck together in a tight emotional 
bond, there are going to be some negative feelings because of the potential 
loss," Brackelmanns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides letting go, parents must clear other self-inflicted hurdles. Parents 
often have high, even unrealistic dreams for their children that lead them to 
believe that their children's fiances aren't good enough. Others don't believe 
their children are capable of making such important decisions and start having 
doubts before the girlfriend or boyfriend even walks through the door. Other 
times, the child's glowing description of a suitor doesn't fit the person who 
shows up at the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning flags can also fly when a fiance steps out of bounds in terms of 
education or religion. One Thanksgiving, Judith Hayward's college sweetheart 
invited her home to meet his parents. The fact that she was Christian and her 
fiance was Jewish already had the tension barometer rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Then while browsing through her future father-in-law's bookshelves, Hayward 
spotted the title, "How to Prevent Interfaith Marriages." 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband's father was very embarrassed," she recalled. "He quickly assured 
me that a friend had given it to him and he would never buy anything like that 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Daughters-in-law hold a uniquely powerful position. Sensing this, Ron Burns, a 
writer from Pacific Palisades, has adopted a pragmatic approach to his 
22-year-old son's dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell myself to be very nice to this girl immediately because she may be the 
mother of my grandchildren. If I want to ever see them, she's the gatekeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' middle son, Adam, a high school senior, brings home girls for "study 
dates," for which Burns and his wife wind up cooking dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first girl who offers to help do the dishes gets my vote," Burns said. 
"But that hasn't happened yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are no fail-safe strategies for making a good first impression, but 
there are some ways to get off on the right foot. If you want to be 
interesting, be interested, experts say. Rather than meeting at the parents' 
home, couples should consider selecting a neutral territory -- like a 
restaurant -- where everyone is on the same footing and all parties can exit 
gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers and fathers should be approached differently, advises John Gray, 
author of the newly released "What Your Mother Couldn't Tell You and Your 
Father Didn't Know" (HarperCollins). Since men tend to bond through action, 
Gray suggests that boyfriends find an activity to do with the father -- like 
watching a football game or fixing a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Either gender can make points with a mate's parents by listening and showing 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dads want to feel appreciated and moms want to feel heard," Gray said. "The 
more you can get mothers to talk and share, the more they will become 
emotionally attached." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if there are relationship problems, couples should present a united front 
during the first get-together. Complete openness can come later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women need to sparkle and delight in their fiances and men need to be 
affectionate and attentive," Gray added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rushing to fit into their boyfriends' families, would-be 
daughters-in-law should use the initial rendezvous to observe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect that the family dynamic has been in place a long time and it's better 
to just step back and watch," said Annette Annechild, author of "Your Man and 
His Mother" (Berkley Publishing Group, 1994). "What you see is what you get . . 
. and you can learn a lot about a man by observing him in the setting where he 
has spent most of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 As with any important job interview, appropriate attire and behavior are musts 
when meeting future in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't dress in a tank top with tattoos hanging out," Brackelmanns said. "Just 
be friendly and natural. Both sides have to be very empathetic and very 
forgiving. Everyone should be nice to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes relationships do work out despite horrible beginnings. On their 
second date, Michael Zarro walked into the home of his girlfriend, Tina Deford, 
asking who owned the van parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do," replied Tina's father, Donald Deford. "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hit it," Zarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, on a deserted stretch of highway, Zarro was driving the 
same van when the engine caught fire and the Chevy burned to the ground. All 
that was left was the metal frame and some fishing tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You weren't happy just to scratch it, you had to burn it down," Deford kidded 
Zarro when he saw the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad karma continued. Zarro had just taken the wheel of Deford's brand-new 
silver Cadillac when his Labrador retrievers started fighting in the back seat. 
Turning to separate them, Zarro smashed the luxury sedan into a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 For many courtships, the crash of the Coupe de Ville would have been the coup 
de gra ce. Luckily, Donald Deford had a big heart -- and a comprehensive auto 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he makes you happy, baby, it makes me happy," the Lawndale building supply 
owner told his daughter, who will celebrate her 17th wedding anniversary this 
month.

 While Orange County tries to hold off creditors with its record-high municipal 
bankruptcy filing, county taxpayers get no respite from today's 5 p.m. deadline 
for paying the first installment of their property taxes. Despite having to pay 
up at the treasurer-tax collector's office, the center of nationwide attention 
due to the county's massive losses in the securities market, taxpayers are 
taking some comfort in knowing that their checks are being placed in a 
separate, low-risk fund. A28

 A frustrated British gambler went from a losing streak to a wrecking spree and 
caused more than $156,000 worth of damage Sunday when he rammed luxury cars in 
a casino parking lot with his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was not identified, went "berserk" at the Castle Casino in this 
northwest resort, and of about 20 rammed cars about half were declared 
write-offs, a police spokesman said.

MAN JAILED IN FATAL STABBING AFTER WEDDING; CRIME: THE SLAYING OCCURRED DURING 
A MELEE OUTSIDE A RECEPTION AT THE MOOSE LODGE. POLICE, WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT 
MOTIVATED THE ATTACK, SAY THE SUSPECT IS A GANG MEMBER.

<P>
 A wedding night celebration turned deadly when a Santa Ana man was fatally 
stabbed in a fight outside a reception hall, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Adam Perez Jr., 19, was rushed to a hospital but died after emergency 
surgery, police said. A Huntington Beach man was arrested in connection with 
the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 9:15 p.m. Saturday when five or six young men got 
into a melee outside the Moose Lodge at 1140 S. Pomona Ave., according to 
Fullerton Police Lt. Mike Stedman. During the fight, Perez, a wedding guest, 
was stabbed once in the chest and later died at the UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour after the stabbing, police arrested Miguel Bustamante, 21, whom 
Stedman described as a Huntington Beach gang member nicknamed Cookie. No weapon 
has been recovered, and police do not know exactly what was used to stab Perez 
or what might have motivated the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Chaidez, administrator for the Moose Lodge, said 80 people attended the 
wedding of the daughter of a lodge member from Huntington Beach. The stabbing 
happened outside in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time something like this has happened since I've been here, 
and I've been here 14 years," Chaidez said Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they usually only have to deal with petty thefts and occasional 
auto burglaries at the Fullerton Town Center, in which the lodge is located. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, teen-agers in Bustamante's Huntington Beach neighborhood described 
the suspect as a popular figure with many friends who like to go to parties. 
The Huntington Beach gang to which he belongs has about 50 members, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who live near Beach Boulevard and Slater Avenue said they know 
Bustamante for the customized low-rider bicycles he rides around the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But some teen-agers also said Bustamante, who has a shaved head, has a 
penchant for getting into fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He snaps fast at the littlest things," said an anonymous 17-year-old Ocean 
View High School student who has known Bustamante for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustamante was arrested in November, 1993, after he was involved in a 
gang-related gunfight in Fountain Valley, according to police and newspaper 
accounts.  
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, a blue Honda Accord and a white pickup truck -- which 
contained Bustamante -- began racing on Warner Avenue, and gunshots were 
exchanged between the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 With police in pursuit, the pickup truck finally stopped near Warner and 
Magnolia avenues, but the car sped on and later crashed into a palm tree in the 
center median at Beach Boulevard and Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Garden Grove man and a 16-year-old Santa Ana youth, who were 
both in the car, died in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustamante is being held without bail at the Fullerton Jail.

A CHRISTMAS TREE-DITION; HARRY NOONAN HAS BEEN AT SAME STAND FOR HALF A CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Noonan has been selling Christmas trees on the same street for 50 years. 
He's seen them all. Knows the best from the worst. Can tell a Douglas from a 
Noble at a glance. Can practically make the annual trip to Oregon blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 He's even been known to wax philosophical about them, until they become more 
than just trees waiting to be bought on an otherwise empty lot at Victoria 
Street and Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "After spending hours of decorating it, you might step back and look at it and 
admire it," said Noonan, 72, in the trailer that is his sales office. "But 
after a while, you don't just see the tree. After a while you start to see 
more. You start to see the past, the future, your children, the history of the 
family and, sometimes, even the Holy One." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan didn't always feel this way. At one time, a Christmas tree was just a 
Christmas tree, as when Noonan came home from World War II in 1944, with 
shrapnel wounds in a knee and hip from fighting on Omaha Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Having nothing to do and no income, Noonan was asked by an old friend, Barney 
Bernstein, if he would like to help around Bernstein's department store in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 "And before I knew it I was selling Christmas trees for him," Noonan said. 
"Then, one day, Barney said, 'Those are your Christmas trees, Harry, you can 
have them. I have no use for them.' I guess he figured I needed some help." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan had found his seasonal calling. 
</P>
<P>
 During the off season, he worked as a painter and remodeler. But once 
Christmas rolled around and the decorations started going up, Noonan found 
himself driving to Oregon and handpicking the trees that would wind up in 
hundreds of living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife, she'd always stay home to take care of the kids while I took care of 
the Christmas trees," Noonan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But times have changed. The longtime Orange County resident now lives most of 
the year in Henderson, Nev., but is in Orange County for the Christmas season 
and to visit relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tree season, his two sons, a daughter-in-law and three grandsons 
take care of the Christmas trees while Noonan sits back and runs the show. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,500 Christmas trees should be sold by the time Noonan closes shop 
on Christmas Eve. His son, Doug, 42, made the trip to Oregon this year, looking 
for the best trees he could find. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Noonan, Doug Noonan said, suffered a small stroke six months ago and 
skipped the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad's the kind of guy who, if you tell him he can't go or if you tell him to 
stop working, he'll get mad," the younger Noonan said. "But this year he 
listened. This year he knew he'd have had a difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Noonan said one of the best things about selling Christmas trees, 
besides the smell of pine, is visiting with old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the greatest, them stopping by to say hello and talk to you, which 
doesn't happen very often today," he said. "Everybody always seems to be in 
such a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan said he plans to enjoy these reunions and stay in the tree-selling 
business for quite a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "God willing, of course," he said, with a smile.

CONCERT WARMS THE HOLIDAYS FOR 75 YOUNGSTERS; GIVING: THE PERFORMING ARTS 
CENTER THROWS A PARTY FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

 Blindfolded and with his hands firmly curled around a wooden stick, Oscar 
Hernandez swung the baton with all his might at the star-shaped, papier-mache 
ornament. When candy came cascading out of the hanging pinata, a mob of 
children flocked to the mound of treats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was one of about 75 Orange County children with a VIP invitation to 
Sunday's sold-out musical performance, Fiesta Navidad, and a private backstage 
party at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Marking a tradition of hope and heritage, the Philharmonic Society and the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center had their first Christmas celebration for 
children with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at the center's first tier, children 10 to 12 watched Mexican folk 
dancers and mariachi bands onstage. Some were recent Latino immigrants whose 
parents lack money for such entertainment; others were the children of AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened with Las Posadas, the traditional Mexican procession 
portraying Joseph and Mary's pilgrimage to Bethlehem. Performances by mariachi 
bands and UCLA's Ballet Folklorico followed. The cultural extravaganza ended 
with the audience joining in mariachi renditions of "Jingle Bells" and "Silent 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities began when the music ended. The children, most from three 
Anaheim elementary schools, filed backstage where they feasted on an assortment 
of Mexican foods. While some served themselves from the buffet, others eagerly 
lined up to meet Santa Claus and receive bags filled with board games, toys and 
candy donated by local companies and toy drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's Christmas party is part of the Philharmonic Society's youth 
music education program. Organizers said they hope to make this an annual 
event, in an effort to introduce fine arts to the young, especially those who 
otherwise might not get the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives these children an opportunity to experience something from their 
own heritage," says Dean Corey, Philharmonic Society executive director. "They 
probably would not have the opportunity to visit the center otherwise. Our hope 
is to make them feel comfortable there, to welcome them to our community." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dalinda Pineda, 12, this was her first concert. Though mariachi bands are 
common in her Mexican homeland, she said attending a show and party at the 
center was exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 A polite and confident Andrew Villafana, 10, said the "cool sonic-siren 
football and backgammon gifts make me happy. This is a special night." 
</P>
<P>
 But for another 10-year-old, this will be her first Christmas without her 
father, who died of AIDS complications two months ago. She was invited to the 
party through her connection with the AIDS Services Foundation in Irvine. 
Wearing a velvet green dress, she bashfully peered into her bag of gifts as a 
hint of a smile tugged at her lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Dena Montiel, an organizer with the Philharmonic Society, said touching the 
lives of these children is the goal of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what Christmas is about, the joy of giving and sharing and to bring 
happiness."

ROADBLOCK AHEAD; LEISURE: TERMINAL ISLAND TRACK IS AN EXPERIMENT IN ETHNIC 
HARMONY WHERE ALL IT TAKES TO RACE IS $10 AND YOUR OWN VEHICLE. BUT IT MAY 
CLOSE IN APRIL TO MAKE WAY FOR AN EXPORTING FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brotherhood Raceway on Terminal Island is a place where the uninitiated can 
get lost in the conversation around the car hoods. Terms such as dominator 
carburetors, planetary transmissions and superchargers flow back and forth 
among teen-agers, off-duty policemen, grandmothers and traditional drag-racing 
grease nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a track where you do not have to know that kind of jargon, a place 
where the motto is: "Run Whatcha Brung."  
</P>
<P>
 On any given weekend, nitrous-equipped cars, junior dragsters, motorcycles and 
even kids on bicycles roll up to the starting line at different times to clock 
their speed on the quarter-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
 In a culture in which illegal street racing has traditionally attracted 
accidents and violence, the year-old Brotherhood Raceway is a testament to 
peaceful coexistence. A common denominator -- the sheer fascination of pushing 
a vehicle to run just a little bit faster -- has allowed all kinds of racers to 
mingle without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The track is the creation of Willie Andrew (Big Willie) Robinson III, a 
longtime figure in Los Angeles street racing. After the 1992 riots, Robinson 
persuaded the Los Angeles Harbor Commission to allow him to use the Terminal 
Island property for $1 a month. With Robinson donating his time, the track 
breaks even without any government support. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unusual harmony of Robinson's experiment appears only temporary. In 
April the commission is expected to close the track to make way for a coke 
exporting facility and a container terminal. Commission officials say they have 
no other suitable site for the racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police credit the track with decreasing illegal street racing because racers 
have somewhere to go -- a place where a computerized starter and clock prevent 
the usual arguments about who left the line early. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a 6-foot-6, 300-pound onetime medical student, preaches peace. He 
shuns sponsorship from alcohol and cigarette manufacturers and has banned 
alcohol and drugs from the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race itself is the rush," said Robinson, 52. "I don't want any gang 
member coming here, getting drunk and doing something stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Although admission is $10 for spectators and racers alike, Robinson waives the 
fee for military veterans, police officers, firefighters and anybody who cannot 
afford it. His creed: "When it comes to wheels, there's no generation gap, 
there's no gender gap and no color barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 The track draws people such as Barbara Ybarra, a 52-year-old grandmother, and 
her son Tony, who drive their twin El Caminos at the track on weekends after 
they close the family radiator shop in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra recalls a time when her son was chased by police helicopters for 
illegal racing on the street. She even admits to drag racing herself as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband insisted that she give up drag racing when she got married, but 
once she and Tony, 30, visited the track last year, they were hooked. These 
days she puts the pedal to the metal in only one place, even when people pull 
up beside her at a stoplight and want to drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Come on down to Terminal Island and I'll race you,' " she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another track regular is Billy Chaffin, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy 
who races a nationally competitive Buick Regal. Chaffin says he has seen people 
at the track that he has stopped on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some guys that are gang-affiliated. I can see the tattoos and tell 
what neighborhood they are from." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he ran his car at the Brotherhood Raceway, it flew down the 
track at 129.5 m.p.h. Most of the time he beats the street racers who challenge 
him, but sometimes they get a good start off the line and take him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffin began racing in high school, when he bought a '63 Corvette 
convertible.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was the fastest car around, and I was out street racing to prove it," he 
said. When he got caught, the judge assigned him to a program at the Irwindale 
raceway, where he learned to race safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think cars probably saved me, because I was a rabble-rouser," Chaffin said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a year he has been competing in a car painted black and white like 
a patrol cruiser -- complete with a light bar on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 He says racing with the youngsters on the track changes the way they think 
about law enforcement officers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will give them a one- or two-second head start," Chaffin said. "Then they 
go down the track and if they see red lights in their mirror, it's the one time 
they don't have to worry."  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Natividad, 17, is typical of the youngsters Chaffin wants to reach. 
Natividad has been caught five times racing his black Honda Civic in the 
street. Now he brings his high-performance engine and exhaust system down to 
the Terminal Island track. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people are getting to know each other here," said Robinson, who ran a 
track on Terminal Island from 1974 to 1984 and in the past has volunteered to 
help police contain street racing to certain areas and hours. "You aren't going 
to do a drive-by on somebody you know. They're getting along, that's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Harbor Commission's plan to close the track in spring is so 
depressing for the racers. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Douglas A. McKee is one of the people trying to change 
the commissioners' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee describes himself as a conservative, maximum-sentence type who generally 
metes out tough punishment. But he is just another racer at the track, driving 
his '85 Corvette, which he says he floored for the first time there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every ethnic group I can think of is out there -- just dragging," McKee said. 
"What gets me is that down there I never have seen anybody even argue with 
anybody else. And these are guys who look like people I could have sent to 
state prison at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the track will only send the racers onto the streets, McKee said.  
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have obviously spent a lot of money on their cars. If they weren't 
doing it here, common sense tells you they would be doing it somewhere else."

STREET SMART: TALKING TRASH ON THE FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Truckers haul stuff all over the world. But sometimes what they haul ends up 
all over the road instead. And for most of the past 15 years, Vincent Moreno 
has been there to help clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Caltrans maintenance supervisor, Moreno has scooped up tons of spilled 
ice cream on the Foothill Freeway, helped corral cattle stampeding on the 
Golden State and even picked up thousands of dollars in loose change on the 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get some pretty bizarre situations," Moreno said with understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the thousands of spills that occur each year on state highways, most pass 
without much notice except, of course, by those harried commuters stuck behind. 
Yet with so many trucks, odd stuff is bound to spill from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit, the ice cream truck hauling frozen five-gallon drums a few years back. 
When the trailer jackknifed and spilled its load, a few drivers helped clean up 
the mess: They stashed the ice cream in their trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started jumping out of their cars to retrieve the ice cream," Moreno 
said. "I guess their attitude was, 'We're stuck here so what else is there to 
do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It happens more often than not, Moreno said. Motorists will hop out and grab 
anything that seems of even minor value. He has watched people harvesting heads 
of lettuce off the pavement and rummaging through stacks of shoes in the fast 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were everywhere, running around looking for their sizes," he said. 
"They were picking up boxes, looking at the size and throwing them down. We try 
to discourage that." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no use crying over spilled milk -- unless it's on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the milk gets into an estuary or stream, it can suffocate the fish," said 
Richard Crawford, one of two Caltrans maintenance superintendents who supervise 
the cleanup of hazardous spills -- everything from milk to hydrochloric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Crawford and his team responded to 762 hazardous spills around 
Southern California. Not all were toxic chemicals, though. Anytime a cleanup 
crew stumbles upon a substance it can not identify, the hazardous materials 
crew is called in. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most common spill -- accounting for 60% of all calls -- is of 
petroleum products such as oil or gasoline. "Most people don't relate to fuel 
spills as hazardous materials," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the stuff flows into a gutter or storm drain, it can find its way into 
streams, the ocean or the drinking water supply. The same goes for almost 
anything people find in their laundry rooms -- from a bottle of bleach to a jug 
of window cleaner to a box of detergent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hazardous materials are used every day and they are transported all over the 
place," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it can take days or weeks to clean up a spill. Crews are still 
cleaning soil contaminated by a July fuel spill along the Antelope Valley 
Freeway. Other times, even quick cleanups can seem as if they take forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had loads of fertilizer, and I mean steer manure," he said. "Or Andy 
Gump toilets. We've had trucks carrying those spill. It's some pretty bad 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the junk that thousands of drivers dump every day -- the 
uncountable bits of lives that blow out windows or tumble off pickup truck beds 
or are somehow simply swallowed by the windy roar of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1992 and 1993, Caltrans crews across the state picked up 125,000 cubic 
yards of litter, enough to bury a football field -- end zones and all -- in 58 
feet of junk. Not to mention the 120,000-odd pieces of debris the crews hauled 
away -- everything from old sofas to neatly packed suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, thousands of volunteers cruise the freeway shoulders in a daylong 
search for roadside rubbish. What they find scattered among the eucalyptus and 
the oleanders is tallied into a sort of catalogue, an archeology of modern man. 
Just consider the categories of detritus found one day this fall: 
</P>
<P>
 * Diversions: four new horseshoes, a 10-speed bike, a full bottle of wine, a 
finger-painting set and a collection of Elvis tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passion: 17 packages of condoms, after-shave, empty Budweiser cans, porno 
magazines, a bridal veil, men's underwear, a pair of black lace panties, a 
girdle, Polaroids of nude men, a love letter written on a lunch bag and a home 
pregnancy test kit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fauna: dead opossum, dead bobcat, dead sea gull, dead poodle, dead deer, 
dead rattlesnakes, dead raccoons, dead bat, bag of fish heads, dead pheasant in 
a sack, a live kitten and a green frog in a bag (also alive). 
</P>
<P>
 * Threads, etc.: new socks, shoes, wristwatch, gloves and a prison uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 * Money: a $1 bill, a $5 bill, a $20 bill, credit cards, 10,000 won (Korean 
currency), 15,000 pesos, uncashed check for $1,000, a $50 savings bond and a 
$200 alimony check. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lost: school history report on Teddy Roosevelt, department store credit card 
payment and library books on the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yuck: dirty diapers, used toilet paper, bottle of urine and political 
flyers.

'YOU NEVER FORGET'; EL SERENO: RELATIVES DECORATE A TREE WITH THE NAMES OF 32 
LOST TO VIOLENCE BY GANGS AND OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARY ANNE PEREZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Ever since her son was shot and killed 11 years ago this month, Marina R. 
Martinez has not put up a Christmas tree or colorful lights in her El Sereno 
home because she cannot reconcile the cheery season with her son Ismael's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Martinez, 73, helps El Sereno remember those who have been murdered, 
many of them by gangs, by decorating a 25-foot-tall pine in the median of 
Huntington Drive with red velvet bows that bear the names of 32 people slain in 
the area over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Martinez was 32 and the father of two young sons when he was caught in 
gang cross-fire as he went out to get a pizza for the kids. He was one of many 
remembered Saturday night with a mass, a posada and a candlelight vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never forget," said Martinez, whose red lipstick matched the festive red 
pantsuit she wore with a small Christmas wreath pin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's in a better place, but my house is dark during Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Other bows on the tree bear the names of more recent shooting victims, among 
them Michael Zepeda, 18, shot and killed Wednesday as he walked down Huntington 
Drive South; and high school student Yolanda Navarro, 18, and her 
college-student boyfriend, Roberto Rodriguez, 19. The couple were followed home 
from a Halloween party in Highland Park in October and shot execution-style 
near their homes. Police suspect gang members in both attacks but have made no 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very difficult evening for many, but also it's a very beautiful 
evening to light the tree, a symbol of hope and the beginning of Christmas," 
said Councilman Richard Alatorre at the vigil before he turned on the lights. 
"Maybe we can begin to make a difference in this senseless violence in our 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pain of her loss will never go away, Martinez has become a 
crusader for making the area safer for children and for turning gang members 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked with other parents to institute a dress code at El Sereno Junior 
High School, and she chairs the nonprofit El Sereno Youth Development Corp., 
which for years has worked to find and fund a gang-neutral site for recreation 
and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the group opened a temporary site, offering karate classes, soccer, 
basketball and baseball teams and computers. "If we can keep them busy doing 
something we can keep them out of trouble," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the junior high school, navy-blue pants and white shirts for boys and 
skirts and white blouses for girls have taken the place of baggy pants and 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cholitos that we had before are wearing the uniforms and they look 
different, and the teachers say they can start educating them," said Regina 
Vega, mother of a student there. "The environment in the school is so 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all her efforts, Martinez said, the most difficult is as head of Victims of 
Crime in El Sereno, whose members know the grief of losing a child to violence. 
They visit families, hold carwashes and sell Mexican dinners to raise money, 
sometimes coming up with just enough to buy a bouquet of flowers for the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The public spares little sympathy for victims involved in gangs or drugs, but 
that does not matter to Martinez. "Sometimes when I'm walking up (to their 
homes) I feel funny. I don't know what to say to them. It happened to me, I 
understand how they feel, but it's very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 One mother whose son was killed in 1991 finds services for gangs distasteful 
and unjust. In a way, Virginia Escobedo says, gangs are benefiting from their 
misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to do with the gangs," she said. "I just wish they didn't 
exist. The only way they survive is by destroying lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, parents of victims would attend the Mass and bring photos of 
their loved ones, but that became too difficult, so the annual event has taken 
on a cheerier note.

DEPUTY FIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE; VIOLENCE: SEVEN-YEAR VETERAN STEVEN BELANGER IS IN 
CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER BEING SHOT IN HEAD. THE GUNMAN LATER COMMITTED 
SUICIDE, POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles deputy sheriff was in critical but stable condition Sunday after 
being shot by a skateboard-riding gunman who later turned his pistol on himself 
and committed suicide in front of a Catholic church in Paramount, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Belanger, 29, a seven-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, was wounded in the head and foot Saturday evening as he questioned 
an assault suspect in Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends flocked to Belanger's bedside Sunday at Queen of the Valley 
Hospital in West Covina. Also at his side were about two dozen sheriff's 
deputies, who described Belanger -- a married father of a 15-month-old daughter 
-- as outgoing, athletic and especially fond of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all pulling for him," said Deputy Dan Duran, who was Belanger's 
training supervisor when he was rookie. "He's just an outstanding kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Belanger was unconscious and under heavy sedation as doctors waited for 
swelling to subside before attempting to remove the bullet from his head, Duran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the suspected gunman as Matthew Hagemann, 20, of 
Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place about 5:30 p.m. Saturday after Belanger recognized 
Gregory Dewayne Powell, 18, as a man wanted for a previous assault and stopped 
him and a 15-year-old girl as they drove by in a car, Deputy Brian Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the deputy searched the girl, Hagemann -- a friend of Powell's -- cruised 
up from behind on a skateboard and fired two shots before fleeing with Powell 
and the 15-year-old, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, Jones said, an anonymous caller contacted the Sheriff's 
Department and said that Hagemann "admitted to shooting the deputy and was 
going to kill himself." 
</P>
<P>
 About 8:35 p.m., deputies responded to calls of shots being fired at Our Lady 
of the Rosary Church in Paramount, about 16 miles from where the other shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying in a pool of blood on a sidewalk in front of the church was Hagemann, 
with a single wound to his head. At his side was the handgun believed to be the 
weapon used to shoot Belanger, Jones said. Hagemann was pronounced dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and the 15-year-old girl turned themselves in to West Covina police 
about 12:15 a.m. Sunday. The girl was released to her parents, Jones said, and 
Powell was booked into Central Jail on the previous assault with a deadly 
weapon charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives were still investigating what role, if any, Powell and the girl 
played in Belanger's shooting, Jones said.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I moved here from the Midwest, outside of Chicago, and was wondering why there 
are very few left-turn signals aA.-area intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that installing left-turn signals would help cut down on accidents 
where cars turning left must wait for a yellow or red light before turning and 
are hit by opposing traffic. I find it very nerve-racking to be hung out in the 
middle of the intersection, making a left turn, when the light is red and 
opposing traffic is revving its engines like the start of the Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Jacobs, Burbank

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 To explain why L. A. seems to lack left-turn signals, we might start with a 
paraphrase from "The Wizard of Oz": Toto, we're not in Chicago anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 Here in the City of Angels, city traffic engineer Brian Gallagher says, we 
must deal with myriad traffic and street conditions, especially congestion, 
that aren't necessarily the case elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot more traffic than they have in the Midwest, so we have to pay 
more attention to the efficiency of the whole intersection. Every little second 
matters. We can't afford to give up 10 seconds for a couple drivers to turn 
left, because that 10 seconds we could use for three lanes of through traffic" 
from the other direction, Gallagher says. 
</P>
<P>
 The synchronization of signals makes such considerations all the more 
important to keep traffic flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say there are no left-turn signals at all in Los Angeles. 
Selected intersections have them, but had to undergo engineering studies before 
they were installed. Engineers examine whether there is a high accident rate at 
a particular intersection, what the average speed of traffic is in the area and 
the number of left turns made, among other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have guidelines here to figure out where left-turn signals are actually 
needed instead of arbitrarily putting them in," says Gallagher.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening to Valley freeways? It seems everywhere either the center 
dividers or the shoulders are being worked on -- specifically, on the 405, 118 
and 170 freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 Are we going to be getting some badly needed extra lanes? 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Frandson, Valencia 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Those of you who have followed this column will already know that lanes are 
indeed being added on those freeways, but because Street Smart still receives a 
number of inquiries on this issue, let this be the definitive announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Where you see roadwork going on in the median, Caltrans is constructing extra 
lanes, but only for the ecologically minded. The new lanes are for car pools of 
two or more people (no inflatable dummies allowed). 
</P>
<P>
 On the 170 Freeway, car-pool lanes -- called "high-occupancy vehicle lanes" in 
Caltrans-speak -- will run between Interstate 5 and the 101-134 Freeway split. 
The lanes should be available by April of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 405 Freeway, the car-pool lanes will stretch from I-5 on the north to 
the 101 Freeway on the south. Work is expected to be finished by June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the 118 Freeway, recently renamed in honor of former President Ronald 
Reagan, car-poolers will be able to zoom in their own designated lane from the 
I-5 out to the Ventura-Los Angeles County line, starting sometime in 1996. 
</P>

 Dear Readers: 
</P>
<P>
 For your "In Case You Were Wondering" files, there is a reason why Los Angeles 
insists on being different when it comes to the color of its street signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The national color for street markers is green. But in L. A., and in some 
other cities that may or may not be trying to emulate us, street signs are a 
royal blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, for once, actually boils down to one of practicality rather than 
an attempt to stand out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the city began fabricating signs out of porcelain. As it 
turned out, blue was one of the few colors manufacturers could make with 
porcelain, says David Royer of the city Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, that didn't conflict with the national standard, which, though 
establishing green as the preferred color, allowed cities to use blue or brown 
if they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo our blue signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, for many years, the city's sign makers stopped using porcelain 
in favor of metal. But the old markers proved more graffiti-resistant and so 
durable (many in East Los Angeles date back to the 1940s) that 10 years ago the 
city reverted to using porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
 So now they do make 'em like they used to. And the original reason for 
adopting blue as our official street-sign color is back.

ROD CAREW BECOMES CHAMPION FOR THE ABUSED; COMMUNITY: BASEBALL GREAT RECALLS 
CHILDHOOD TRAUMAS AS HE FIGHTS FOR A SHELTER IN AN AFFLUENT ANAHEIM HILLS 
NEIGHBORHOOD. ELI HOME EXPECTS TO START CARING FOR TROUBLED WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
WITHIN SIX MONTHS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An obedient son, 10-year-old Rod Carew would wait for his father to return 
home at night holding a cord, a rope and a leather strap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would choose one and beat me with it," recalled Carew, who also endured 
watching his father hit his mother. "I ran away from home a lot, but I always 
had to come back because there was no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 So when residents opposed building a shelter for abused women and children in 
Carew's affluent Anaheim Hills neighborhood earlier this year, the fight 
reopened an old wound for the baseball Hall of Famer and former California 
Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shelter eventually won city approval, Carew said his community's 
"Not in My Back Yard" attitude has motivated him to broaden his role with the 
Eli Home, which expects to open an emergency shelter for abuse victims within 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be outspoken," said Carew, 49, famous for his smooth swing and 
wide smile. "If they had to put it in my back yard, I'd tell them to put it in 
my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' star hitter learned of the Eli Home shelter group, which has twice 
been honored by U.S. Presidents for its community service, through newly 
elected Anaheim City Councilman Bob Zemel. Aware of Carew's troubled youth, 
Zemel recently told his friend of 10 years about the home's programs, which 
annually provide emergency housing and counseling to about 1,000 abuse victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew immediately wanted to help, Zemel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having Rod involved will mean kids will want to grow up stealing 
second base instead of a car," said Zemel, a longtime Eli Home advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Home officials are grateful for the well-known athlete's support, which 
will include attending a Christmas party for 200 children on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very valuable," said Lori Galloway, executive director of the Eli Home. 
"People really respect Carew, and if he shows his support for our programs, 
then they pay a lot more attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the shelter won a permit after a battle with residents in 
September, Eli Home officials are still nervous about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession to opponents, the City Council will review the shelter in one 
year and could revoke the permit if the facility proves to be an unwelcome 
neighbor. Critics, who say the shelter violates city zoning codes and could 
attract violent spouses, have vowed to keep a close watch on the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carew said he is prepared to go to "the end" to protect the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't ruin the neighborhood," said Carew, who lives about three miles from 
where the shelter will be located. "When you've never been through a battered 
situation or a child abuse situation, you never know how badly these places are 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a haven, Carew said, might have spared him and his mother, Olga, from 
years of physical abuse at the hands of his father, who was a laborer on the 
Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a real sickly kid, and my dad just couldn't understand that -- a weak 
kid," said Carew, who was the only one of his four siblings beaten. "And later 
I got rheumatic fever. It just got worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Carew said his father's rage -- ritualized, but often unpredictable -- eroded 
his self-esteem and mystified him. By age 10, Carew could divine from his 
father's walk as he came home from work whether he would be hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sit and you wonder, why?" said Carew, who underwent counseling for the 
childhood trauma. "I used to question myself and ask myself what did I do 
wrong. I don't know how much better of a son I could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 The young Carew, however, discovered a life-changing refuge away from his 
tormented home life -- baseball. On the ball fields in his native Gatum, 
Panama, he excelled. By age 11, he even played in a men's fast-pitch softball 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball allowed me to be myself," said Carew, who hit over .300 in 15 
consecutive seasons in the major leagues. "I was the best at this and nobody 
could do anything, including my father, to hurt me." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport also became an arena to defy his father, who pitched for an opposing 
team. Though succeeding at the plate against his father meant a beating later, 
the young Carew relished the chance to hit against his abuser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys on the team were concerned because they knew I'd get a whipping, and 
they'd ask me not to play against my dad," Carew said. "But I said no, I'll 
take it. I liked hitting against him, just for him to say one day, 'You're 
good.' But he never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Carew wouldn't give his father the chance. The two haven't spoken since 
1983, when Carew took his children to New York to see their grandfather for the 
first and only time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with him," said Carew, who has three daughters. "My dad 
always said I wasn't going to amount to anything. He never encouraged me. . . . 
I think I wasn't supposed to have been born." 
</P>
<P>
 Carew, who quietly lived with the abuse for decades, finally revealed the 
searing experiences of his youth in a 1978 autobiography, titled "Carew." The 
openness proved to be a catharsis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book ended the torment of having it inside me," Carew said. "I was able 
to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
 His father could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 While distancing himself from his painful past, Carew engages himself with 
volunteer work and finds it as healing for himself as for the youngsters. 
Besides operating baseball camps, Carew said he regularly contributes his time 
to organizations dedicated to aiding troubled youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew said his experiences enable him to bond quickly with youngsters who have 
suffered abuse, and he hopes his openness about his past helps kids quiet their 
own personal demons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always deal with (the abuse). But the only way to improve is to get it 
out," Carew said. "I just hope someday when these kids grow up they say, 'God, 
I'm glad the Eli Home was there.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; GROUP URGES TRUSTEES TO RECOUP INVESTMENT 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Alamitos Unified School District should withdraw its investments from 
the Orange County pool and use part of the money to open Oak Middle School, 
residents here have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Save Weaver, Open Oak committee urged school board trustees 
last week to avoid further losses for the district by pulling out its 
$11-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that amount, about $5.5 million is from the school district's reserves, 
according to Ron Murrey, the school district's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrey told the group that the district's funds cannot be withdrawn because 
the county has filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens' group wants to use the reserve funds as an alternative to the 
school board's plan to sell the vacant Weaver site to pay for the September 
reopening of Oak. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the school board approved the sale of the 9.1-acre Weaver for $8 
million, of which $3.1 million would be used to reopen Oak, which was closed 10 
years ago. Annual interest from the remaining $4.9 million would support the 
school's operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A buyer has not been found yet, although school district officials said 
several developers have shown interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the citizens' group said Weaver may be needed in the future 
because of the school district's growing enrollment. In addition, they said 
that school district officials have not looked hard enough to find financing 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 They proposed that the school district sell other properties or convert Weaver 
to a child development center to generate income. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; FAMILY AND AUTHORITIES SEEK TIPS IN 
HIT-AND-RUN DEATH

<P>
 A residents' group is spreading flyers to collect information about a 
hit-and-run driver who killed a local teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Pugh, 18, was killed instantly at about 5:30 p.m. last Tuesday 
when his motorcycle was struck by a red pickup truck at Alondra Boulevard and 
Stage Road in nearby La Mirada, said Lt. Daryl Lance of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 friends and residents are trying to find eyewitnesses to the 
accident, family friend Jennifer Patalsky said. They plan to have 3,000 to 
4,000 flyers distributed by early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends are also seeking donations for a trust fund to help the family pay for 
the funeral and to offer a reward to witnesses, Patalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're begging the public for information," she said. "We have nothing to go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 David Pugh, the father of the victim, said the family has drawn tremendous 
emotional support from the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having people call and ask to help is helping me, not bothering me," he said 
from his Huntington Beach home. "I want the person who did this to my son to be 
caught. My baby was only 18 years old, and he was left there to die. It's just 
not human." Christopher was buried Saturday in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 People with information should call the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department in Norwalk at (714) 994-2970. Donations can be made to the Chris 
Pugh Trust Fund at any Wells Fargo Bank. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON/LA HABRA; ELECTION SEASON WAS ACADEMIC FOR 
THESE 6 TRUSTEES

<P>
 While almost all school districts in the county congratulated trustees who won 
elected office, six board members of the Fullerton Joint Union High and La 
Habra City school districts didn't need accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees -- three in the Fullerton district and three in the La Habra 
district -- didn't campaign, spend money or solicit votes to win their 
elections.They didn't even have to run in last month's election because no one 
challenged them. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoo-in candidates slipped back into office for four more years of the 
same routine -- making policy, handing out proclamations and handling 
disciplinary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, Marilyn Buchi, Robert N. Hathaway and Robert A. Singer were 
sworn in Tuesday. Antonio Valle Jr. and Nancy Zinberg were sworn in Thursday in 
La Habra. Linda Navarro Edwards of La Habra will be sworn in at the next school 
board meeting in January. She was absent for the formality last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees, most of whom are school board veterans, said they were glad they 
didn't have to campaign for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that it says that the people in our communities are happy with the way 
the districts are being governed," said Buchi, who has been on the board for 11 
years. She also was chosen to serve as president next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle, a 13-year school board member, was chosen to serve as president in La 
Habra. MIMI KO

<P>
 Budget uncertainties in the wake of the county bankruptcy, and a 
master-planned residential community proposed for the foothills within Brea's 
sphere of influence are among the issues facing Bev Perry as she begins her 
one-year term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a huge responsibility," said Perry, who was named mayor this week 
by a unanimous vote of her council colleagues. Perry had served as mayor pro 
tem for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perry does have to worry about the $9-million Brea has tied up in the 
county investment pool, it could be worse. The city had $17 million in the pool 
in September, but began withdrawing funds in response to a hike in interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest planning issues during Perry's term will be the 284-acre 
Olinda Heights project planned for the foothills northeast the city. A revised 
environmental impact report is due out in January for this proposed community 
of up to 867 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving as mayor pro tem for the next year will be Burnie Dunlap, who is 
beginning his second four-year council term. In choosing Dunlap for the job, 
the council majority snubbed Kathryn E. Wiser. She is halfway through her first 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser said she would have been "pleasantly surprised" to receive the mayor pro 
tem appointment, but she was not expecting council members to support her. 
Wiser is often the lone voice of opposition in council decisions. She 
consistently opposes the use of eminent domain in getting property for 
redevelopment purposes, and has accused the council of favoritism in awarding 
some city contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Perry, Dunlap and Wiser on the council are Glenn G. Parker and Lynn 
Daucher. Parker, the previous mayor, was elected to his second council term. 
Daucher, the only council newcomer, was the top vote-getter in last month's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring from the council was Carrey J. Nelson, who first joined the 
legislative body in 1978. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW MAYOR TO TACKLE BUDGET, HOUSING 
PLAN

<P>
 As Councilman Victor Leipzig stepped into the ceremonial role of mayor this 
week, he predicted that an arduous task as the city's chief spokesman lay ahead 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't expect was the fiscal crisis that enveloped Orange County his 
first week as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst municipal crisis that has occurred -- and we are tied to it," 
said Leipzig, who has spent most of his time staying on top of the fiscal 
fiasco and its effects on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leipzig sees a number of other challenges the city will face next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig said that dealing with a deficit budget is among his top priorities. 
The council recently passed a $96-million general-fund budget for 1994-95, with 
a $912,000 shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to have to have a combination of cutbacks and revenue 
increases," Leipzig said. "The primary ingredient in the final solution is 
spending reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig also said that because of budget restraints, "holding the line and 
maintaining (the current) level of public safety is a challenge -- and that's 
not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the controversial housing development proposed for the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands area, Leipzig said he wants the city more involved in the process. "We 
cannot ignore or pretend that development is not going to happen out there. We 
have to prepare for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that any development of the area would increase traffic and impact 
police, fire and water services. "We need to minimize the impacts and the 
number of homes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leipzig said he will continue to encourage public involvement in local 
government and strive to maintain an open-door policy. He plans to be in his 
City Hall office each Friday to be available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope people come in and use the office hours," he said. "I really want 
people to know that the mayor of Huntington Beach wants to deal with their 
issues." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL BOARD ELECTS OFFICERS AMID RANCOR

<P>
 The Orange Unified School District's Board of Education ended a tumultuous 
year with a bang this week as it elected next year's new board officers amid 
rancor and accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Maureen Aschoff was elected Thursday during the board's final 
session to a second term as board president, becoming the first board member in 
more than 30 years to keep that post for two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But a demand by Trustee James Fearns for a roll call vote forced Aschoff to 
break a 3-3 tie and cast the deciding vote in her own favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearns earlier in the week blasted Aschoff and accused the faction that wanted 
to keep her as board president -- Trustees Martin Jacobson, Max Reissmueller 
and Bill Lewis -- of fixing the election.  
</P>
<P>
 Aschoff said that she had been lobbied by the trustees for two months prior to 
the vote to accept the president's seat again. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected was the rancor following roll-call votes for vice president and 
clerk of the board. Fearns nominated Trustee Rick Ledesma, who is in the 
minority faction, for vice president. Aschoff then nominated Jacobson, who won 
on a 4-3 vote.

 Outgoing vice president Robert Viviano has refused to discuss the issue, but

 "Tonight, we are going through the motions for appearances' sake, much like 
the Romans did in ancient times when the elite threw dice with the peasants to 
determine who would marry the most desirable damsels in the empire," he said of 
the election. "Of course, the dice were always loaded in favor of the elite, 
but the game was played . . . to give the impression of fairness and full 
participation of all." LESLEY WRIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will hear an appeal of a recent Planning Commission 
decision that rejected an application for an expanded day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-to-1 vote last month, the commission voted against the center and said 
the neighborhood site had too few curbside parking places. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman Altamirano, who lives and works at 28885 Woodcreek, had been allowed to 
watch over six children. 
</P>
<P>
 When she wanted to expand her business to care for as many as 12 children, 
several neighbors complained about the potential danger extra traffic might 
create for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners argued that Altamirano's home is on a cul-de-sac where there is 
little curbside parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials had recommended approving the application, saying the 
expansion would create little extra traffic. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; TRUSTEES TO STUDY STATE TEST 
RESPONSE

<P>
 Capistrano Unified School District trustees are scheduled to consider a 
resolution today blasting test scores from the 1994 California Learning 
Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the results won't be released until late January or early February -- 
and the district is expected to do well -- the resolution claims that the 1994 
CLAS test was badly flawed and mismanaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: meaningless scores for district comparison and a "waste of public 
funds," the resolution contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to disassociate ourselves with this unreliable data," district 
spokeswoman Jacqueline Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state education official said that so far as he knows Capistrano Unified is 
the first school district to consider taking such a strong position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would disagree with that," said Fred Tempes, director of curriculum, 
instruction and assessment for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would be held equally to account for not publishing the results, 
having spent the money to administer the test." 
</P>
<P>
 The state has spent $55 million over three years on the testing system, Tempes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the test came under fire from critics who contended that it invaded 
students' privacy by asking personal questions in essay sections. Some school 
districts allowed parents to choose that their children not take the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Habermehl, an assistant superintendent of instructional services for the 
Orange County Department of Education, said the 1994 CLAS results might be 
called into question because there was so much turmoil surrounding the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say that the results will be somewhat controversial and I'm sure 
that no one wants to be subject to a comparison of districts that did or did 
not have a full complement of students taking the test," Habermehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano district officials plan to pursue their own testing system to 
measure students' academic growth in basic skills over time, Price said. JEFF 
BEAN

<P>
 Tony Ingegneri, who garnered the third-highest vote among 12 candidates for 
City Council in the Nov. 8 election, was appointed this week to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingegneri, 36, a businessman, will finish the remaining two years of Bruce A. 
Broadwater's term.Broadwater was elected mayor Nov. 8 and will serve for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadwater, Ingegneri and returning Councilmen Mark Leyes and Robert F. Dinsen 
were sworn in Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyes was appointed to the largely ceremonial post of mayor pro tem. It will 
be his second term on the council. It is Dinsen's fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinsen, 77, was appointed to the council in 1980 and won in 1982, 1986 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho Chung, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor against Broadwater and three other 
candidates Nov. 8, retains his seat on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members decided to appoint Ingegneri instead of holding a special 
election, which could cost as much as $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory vote four years ago allows the council to pick the candidate with 
the next-highest number of votes after the winners to fill a vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingegneri received 7,178 votes, behind Leyes (10,647) and Dinsen (8,656). BERT

 Sports fans at Southern California College may no longer have to keep track of 
baseball and soccer scores on their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-foot-high electronic scoreboard may be erected at the college between the 
baseball and soccer fields.But first the city Planning Commission must approve 
it at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Schultze, director of plant operations for the college, will try to 
persuade the commission to allow him to put up the 77-square-foot scoreboard, 
which has been donated to the college at 55 Fair Drive by the Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a school that has occupied this location since 1950," Schultze wrote 
in his application to the commission. "We feel this sign will enhance our 
ability to serve our students and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard, according to Schultze in his report to the commission, will 
only have a "minimal effect" on surrounding properties because trees and shrubs 
will help shield the bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoreboard will be 320 feet west of the property line on Vanguard Way and 
330 feet from condominiums to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers, 77 Fair 
Drive. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BINGO SMOKING BAN DELAYED UNTIL JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A smoking ban on all school district property has been delayed until July 1 by 
school board members, giving one last gasp to fund-raising bingo games on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District board last week approved the second reading 
of a policy required by new state legislation.The policy bans smoking on all 
school district property and in district vehicles, whether or not students are 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state gives school districts until July to implement the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo operators are still looking for a low-cost location for twice-weekly 
games that raise about $60,000 a year for high school instrumental music 
programs. Because smoking is common among bingo fans, most players surveyed 
said they would not attend games if smoking is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Dec. 26, a federal law will prohibit smoking inside all school 
district buildings; bingo operators say they will create smoking breaks. High 
school music boosters say they are unsure what effect the federal law will have 
on bingo profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo operators say it will no longer be profitable to hold the games on 
school district property after July 1. High school music boosters say the cost 
of leasing an alternative location for the games is prohibitive and nonprofit 
organizations are reluctant to allow smoking in their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking ban will not have much effect on the district's 1,050 teachers, 
according to Steve Garretson, president of the Irvine Teachers Assn. Smoking 
was banned at district schools during the school day about two years ago, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few teachers who smoke," Garretson said. "I haven't received 
any complaints." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; IRVINE CO. PLAN CLEARS CITY PLANNING PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine Co. plan to build a 173-home gated community between Jamboree Road 
and the Back Bay in Newport Beach has won the approval of a short-staffed 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental concerns must be resolved with state and federal agencies 
before the plan can go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the Newporter North development's northern boundary is San Joaquin 
Hills Road and the southern boundary is adjacent to the Hyatt Newporter resort. 
The single-family houses would be built on 30 acres; almost 60 more acres would 
be given over to open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes would be on the top of the bluff, with a wilderness park in John Wayne 
Gulch below. The plans include a 12-foot-wide public bicycle trail on the bluff 
top around the housing development and a pedestrian trail below in the gulch. 
</P>
<P>
 But the area is peppered with coastal sage scrub that is a habitat for the 
gnatcatcher, a bird that is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department's list of 
species threatened with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Newporter North site is probably the most environmentally sensitive of 
the (Irvine Co.'s planned housing) parcels," advance planner Patricia Temple 
told the commission last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent environmental survey, four nesting pairs and two solo male 
gnatcatchers were discovered, she said. That has caught the eye of federal 
officials, who want to make sure the birds are protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. is subject to federal regulations protecting threatened species 
and their habitats, even though the city has approved the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife officials could forbid grading in areas where it would be required to 
construct the bicycle trail. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the bicycle trail -- which is planned to connect with others in 
the city's network -- in question, because home buyers could mount a legal 
challenge to building it if the environmental issues are not resolved and the 
trail isn't finished before the homes are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is an ongoing lot line dispute. Two survey maps show the tract 
property lines in different places, so the commission gave permission for lot 
line adjustments, if the shorter boundary line is found to be accurate. HOLLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY COUNCIL TO HEAR ANTI-TACO BELL APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A controversial plan to build a Taco Bell restaurant across Coast Highway from 
the Balboa Bay Club goes before the Newport Beach City Council tonight. 
Residents of the bluff above the proposed site, primarily on Kings Road, have 
opposed the project for months. It won approval from the Planning Commission a 
month ago, but opponents appealed the decision to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Most opponents initially said the proposed 24-hour operations were the 
problem. The feared this would create an all-night hangout and invite crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission limited the hours of operation to 5 a.m. to 2 a.m. and required 
that the dining areas and parking lot be closed from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., so the 
restaurant could offer only drive-through service from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes did not satisfy opponents who also complained of potential noise, 
light and smells from the site. Bluff-top residents complained that on some 
nights they can hear customers making orders at a McDonald's half a mile away 
on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In advance of tonight's public hearing, some opponents have asked the council 
for a moratorium on fast-food restaurants on the Mariner's Mile stretch of the 
highway and a study of whether such businesses are compatible with the image of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked that, at a minimum, the council limit all operations to 6 a.m. to 
11 p.m. weeknights, with a midnight closing time on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Norma Glover, who was chairwoman of the Planning Commission when 
the restaurant was approved, abstained from that discussion and vote because of 
a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Her council campaign received contributions from the former owners of the 
property on which the franchise is to be built, the site of the vacant Malee's 
restaurant, at 1400 W. Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover is likely to abstain again from tonight's discussions, possibly leaving 
an even number of council members to decide the issue. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 A 20-year-old man was shot in the head early Sunday while driving in a car 
with friends and died several hours later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown assailant fired at Marcos Anthony Mondragon, of Santa Ana as he 
drove with three friends, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Anthony Levatino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon's friends immediately drove him to a Santa Ana hospital emergency 
room and he was later transferred to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he 
later died, Levatino said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police say they don't have a motive for the shooting, which took place at 2:20 
a.m. near 1500 W. Edinger Ave. It is being investigated by the department's 
gang unit. Levatino said investigators do not know if the shooter was passing 
in another car or was on foot.

MAN APPREHENDED BY HUNTINGTON POLICE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 37-year-old man died Sunday after jumping from a second-story motel balcony 
and struggling with officers who had been trying to apprehend him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose last known address was in Cypress, was not named pending 
notification of his death to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responding to a robbery alarm Sunday afternoon at the Friendship Inn in 
the 18000 block Beach Boulevard said they found the man standing naked on a 
second-story balcony. Officers ordered the man to come down, but he refused, 
Huntington Beach Lt. Charles R. Poe said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers tried to corner the man on the balcony, he jumped and landed on a 
parked car below, crushing the car's roof and shattering its rear window, Poe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the man, whom they described as being aggressive toward pursuing 
officers, then took off running across Beach Boulevard. Officers sprayed the 
man with pepper spray, but he continued running, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man finally dropped to one knee, where he was pinned down by the officers 
and eventually handcuffed, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in handcuffs, medics noticed he was having trouble breathing and took him 
to Huntington Beach Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death.

HAGGARD IS BACK IN ROLE SHE KNOWS -- MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Candace Haggard was unanimously appointed mayor last week by her City Council 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second time around for Haggard, who has been on the council 
since 1988 and served as mayor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she'll be outstanding," said outgoing Mayor Scott Diehl. "Candy has 
been a very good leader, not only in San Clemente, but in Orange County. We're 
blessed to be able to tap into that kind of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected Councilman Steve Apodaca was named mayor pro tem. Also sworn in 
this week were returning Councilman Joe Anderson and first-time Councilman 
Patrick M. Ahle. 
</P>
<P>
 After turning over the mayor's seat to Haggard, Diehl reflected on a comeback 
year for the city. A series of disasters struck in 1993, particularly a 
rainstorm that caused structural damage to many hillside homes and triggered a 
massive landslide that still has Pacific Coast Highway closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good year, I thought we accomplished a lot," Diehl said. "We 
saw work start to open Pacific Coast Highway and finished major storm drain 
renovations." 
</P>
<P>
 Diehl said 1994 also saw a smooth transfer from a city fire department to the 
county system. A similar turnover of city police services to the county last 
year continued to go well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county bankruptcy filing that froze San Clemente's $35-million share in 
the county investment pool was a black spot, Diehl acknowledged. "It was sad to 
see the turmoil, not only for San Clemente, but for agencies throughout Orange 
County and maybe the whole country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, 1994 was a "very good era of transition," Diehl said. "It was an 
opportunity in San Clemente to see what local government can do for people."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: SHOPPING CENTER SANTAS GO THE EXTRA MILE FOR CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
 When Santa arrived at the Woodland Hills mall, he didn't come from the North 
Pole in a sleigh drawn by Dancer and Prancer. He flew into town from Baltimore 
on a commercial jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Jackson, 52, is among hundreds of seasonal workers listed in one of 
several national registers from which many malls across the country select 
their Santas. In the last three years, Jackson has worked in Chicago, St. Louis 
and Denver, as well as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When he's not Santa, Jackson is an auto inspector for the state of Maryland, 
but he arranges to take off the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas for 
this annual gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he may be sent anywhere in the country, he usually invites his wife to 
accompany him. But this year she was unable to get away for a monthlong 
vacation, so Santa is bedding down alone at the Best Western on Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without his Santa suit, the 6-foot, 4-inch, 265-pounder with the real, 
snowy beard looks enough like Pere Noel that people on the street call out, 
"Hi, Santa" to him. He wishes a "Merry Christmas" to all. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will fly back to Baltimore on Christmas Eve just in time to put on his 
red suit and play Santa for the last time this year to his grandchildren on 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson started playing Santa in his hometown for local organizations like 
Childrens Hospital more than a quarter of a century ago. "My daughter is now 
27, and she's never seen me without my beard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks upon his Santa stint as more fun than work. But there are those 
moments when he wonders what he's got himself into or what gets into other 
people, like the adults who wanted to have their picture taken with Santa with 
everyone wearing ski goggles. Jackson complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the little boy who was obviously a Santa-seeing veteran. When 
Jackson asked him what he wanted for Christmas, the child said to his mother, 
"How many of these guys do I have to tell before I get what I want?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another seasonal Santa, Steve Millar, who says he is thirtysomething, travels 
from his home in Covina to the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, where he puts on 
his red suit and meets the children. 
</P>
<P>
 A marketing and promotion professional, he has two sons, 4 and 10, who keep 
him busy most of the year with Little League, Scouts and other youth-oriented 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 While his youngest still believes in Santa and has no idea that his dad can be 
seen daily ho-ho-hoing in Sherman Oaks in a beard and a suspiciously familiar 
red outfit, his oldest son is in on the secret and thinks his dad is cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Millar played Santa for a community organization and decided 
it was so much fun he'd like to do it at a mall. He too now belongs to a 
registry that supplies Santas to malls across the country and is happy he found 
work near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar says that, like all good Santas, he never promises children anything, 
but says he will do his best to deliver the Power Ranger or Barbie or Pogs the 
kids seem to ask for. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has also had requests to pose with people's pets, and some curious 
brushes with adults who want their picture taken with Santa. "One man wanted me 
to curl up in his lap," says Millar. Millar did. 
</P>
<P>
 What really gets to Millar are the kids who come in and ask for things for 
their parents or other relatives. He particularly remembers one little girl who 
asked Santa to help her grandmother get well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I would do my very, very best," Millar says. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Pernell, 57, Santa at the Valencia Town Center mall, says he also gets a 
lot of selfless requests from children. Pernell, a semi-retired bus driver, 
tells the children he will try to fill their requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell, who is 5 feet, 11 inches and weighs 260 pounds and has his own white 
beard, doesn't need much else to portray Father Christmas, and he can usually 
handle the many requests from adults who want their pictures taken sitting on 
Santa's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell works at the mall during the mornings, and another Santa takes over 
for afternoons and evenings. Pernell divides the rest of his pre-holiday time 
between making special Santa appearances at parties and gatherings and working 
with retarded adults at Lark Ranch, a few miles from his Saugus home. This is 
an ongoing job. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other Santas, Pernell is a family man, with children from 7 to 27. He 
began working with children when he was a counselor at a Scout camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to keep doing the Santa job as long as he's able. He was the original 
Santa three years ago when the Santa Clarita Valley shopping mall opened, and 
he's been doing it ever since. Women's Center Moving to Meet a Sadly, Growing 
Demand 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of too many customers is forcing the San Fernando Valley Friends 
of Women and Children to move its day center from a small bungalow in Van Nuys 
to larger quarters on Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new facility opens in the spring, it will offer food, showers and 
clothing on a drop-in basis, as it now does in Van Nuys, but it will also have 
room for support and parenting meetings, case workers, storage, a laundry and a 
child's play area. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, the day facility, called the Women's Care Cottage, 
will have received more than 6,000 visits from 1,900 women and children. This 
is triple the number served two years ago, says Cynthia Cauffey, executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening will not be a moment too soon for the organization's clients. 
"These days, between 20 and 40 people a day squeeze into the one-bathroom 
bungalow," according to Cauffey, who adds that because of fire laws, the 
waiting line often extends into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the organization is closing escrow on the new facility with the help 
of major donations by the Bannerman Foundation and United Parcel Service, as 
well as about $100,000 in other private donations. It has more than $100,000 to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Brakensiek, president of Friends of Homeless Women and Children, said 
the organization was set up to help homeless women and children back into the 
mainstream, but the group is seeing more and more battered women who are not in 
immediate danger from their abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends organization, in addition to its Women's Care Cottage day center, 
operates a live-in facility in North Hollywood and a child-care center in 
Pacoima to assist working mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the organization was set up in 1984 with the idea that it would 
eventually go out of existence because the need would have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sadly," says Cauffey, "it hasn't worked out that way." Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband calls the treehouse his 'branch' office. He won't let the kids up 
there. He uses it for thinking and reading when he wants to get away from the 
kids."

MAN SHOT AFTER SHOVING CHP OFFICER; CRIME: BICYCLIST IS HIT IN THE LEG 
REPORTEDLY AFTER JUMPING A FENCE AND FLEEING INTO AN ANAHEIM NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police shot an Orange man in the leg early Sunday after he allegedly shoved a 
California Highway Patrol officer and tried to flee into a residential 
neighborhood, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. McCartt, 34, was taken to the UCI Medical Center for treatment, 
Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A CHP officer saw McCartt riding a bicycle on an Orange Freeway off-ramp near 
Ball Road about 6:30 a.m. After the officer tried to stop McCartt to ask him 
questions, McCartt allegedly pushed the officer, jumped over a fence and ran 
into a residential area, Sgt. Thomas Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-minute pursuit, Anaheim police found McCartt in the back yard of a 
home on the 2700 block of East Norm Place. After a police officer shot McCartt 
in the left leg, he was arrested on suspicion of possession of dangerous drugs 
and resisting arrest. Anaheim police would not give the name of the officer 
involved or say why the officer shot the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the sedate, secluded area said they were awakened by a gunshot 
early Sunday morning but did not hear anyone run through their back yards or 
see McCartt before police fired at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police did not release information on the drug or drugs that were 
found on McCartt. The shooting is under investigation by the Orange County 
district attorney's office and the Anaheim Police Department.

$250,000 GIFT WILL BE USED TO FUND U.S. STUDIES CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman University has received a $250,000 gift from the Henry Salvatori 
Foundation that it will use to establish an endowed chair in American 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chair will be called the Henry Salvatori Professorship in American 
Values and Traditions.Jim Miller, a professor of English, American history and 
comparative literature, will be the first holder of the endowed chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has taught at Chapman for 39 years. In addition to the professorship, 
the gift will fund lecturers selected by Miller to speak at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a breakdown in the American family. Why is this happening?" 
Miller said. "Why do we have so many one-parent families? Why is this crisis 
going on in Orange County? Is this the result of greed? Somewhere along the way 
we must have missed the train because things shouldn't be as they are now." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, an Orange resident, addresses these issues and others in his popular 
course on American values called "Faith, Fear and Folly." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatori, 93, a retired geophysicist who emigrated from Italy as a child, 
created his foundation to preserve and revitalize America's principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something Chapman needs," Miller said, "in the sense that it sparks 
an opportunity to pull together and focus on American values. We'll examine how 
these values have lit the torch of liberty for the world and have fit into 
American history."

AILING TIGERS GET NEW START IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big cat growled. Surveying her new home from a bed of straw in a carrying 
crate, she was being jostled about by a crew of men, and not liking it one bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The men lugged the crate a few more feet, wrestling it into position next to 
her new cage. She growled again, a low rumble like a diesel engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew opened the sliding door to the crate. The tiger leaped out into the 
cage and rattled the back fence. She circled about. Then she clambered atop a 
green shed and stretched out to sniff regally at the darkness -- an 
announcement that she had, indeed, arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's thinking this is paradise," said Simon Adams, the British veterinarian 
who helped arrange the journey to the Wildlife Waystation, a refuge in the 
national forest near Lake View Terrace. "And for her -- and the others -- it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old female, a 7-year-old male and two newborn cubs -- Siberian 
tigers kept in what Adams called "the most appalling conditions" on a small 
farm in Ireland -- had been due to be put to death Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Irish branch of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 
acting on a tip, confiscated the animals and arranged for them to be taken to 
the Wildlife Waystation, home to 1,500 animals, including dozens of big cats. 
</P>
<P>
 There, director Martine Colette said, they will stay. "They're going to live 
here a wonderful life," said the French-born Colette, who has nursed thousands 
of animals back to health in her mountain sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults, Colette said, were born in a circus in England and subsequently 
sold to a farmer living in County Limerick, Ireland, south and west of Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer, Stafford Taylor, kept a small menagerie that included tigers, a 
black bear and two baboons. A third adult tiger was in such poor shape that he 
had to be destroyed, Adams said, and Irish press reports indicate that Taylor 
is facing criminal charges of cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the tigers and the bear were kept in a shed five feet high, five 
feet wide and 25 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among the gross things they were fed," Colette said, "were pigs heads." Water 
was supplied naturally, Adams said, as rain seeped through the roof. The stench 
in the shed, she added, was horrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Since intervening, SPCA officials had been searching the world for new homes. 
The baboons went to England, the bear went to Canada and the tigers, including 
the cubs, headed west Saturday to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old male, who should weigh 900 pounds, weighs only 450, Adams said, 
calling him "extremely debilitated." Shortly after he arrived at Wildlife 
Waystation, Colette called out: "I need 20 pounds of red meat." 
</P>
<P>
 The female, who ought to weigh 450 pounds, weighs 300, Adams said. Still, he 
said Sunday, she appeared to have survived the long airplane trip -- Ireland to 
Chicago to Los Angeles -- in fine shape. 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, was especially important because she had been nursing the two 
cubs, 6 weeks old and six pounds apiece. They huddled Sunday in a crate in a 
warm car, mewling and wrestling and nipping at blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 With any luck, Adams said, the mother -- who had been separated from the cubs 
for two days because of the long trip -- will accept them back. And then, he 
said, the story will truly have a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mother accepts the cubs," Adams said, "then we'll have moved the 
entire bloody family of tigers from one side of the planet to the other, just 
in time for Christmas."

LAUNCH PAD FOR THE SPACE AGE; ROCKWELL TEST SITE GAVE ROCKET SCIENCE ITS THRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few things the man said that long-ago spring intrigued Bill Vietinghoff. 
Son, the man from North American Aviation began, the United States is racing 
the Russians to put a man in space and someday, maybe, even on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he asked Vietinghoff to help. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that Vietinghoff -- fresh out of college with a chemical 
engineering degree, a bedroom set and an 8-year-old Dodge coupe to his name -- 
came in 1953 to help birth the Space Age in the dusty canyons of the Santa 
Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 40 years, North American Aviation became Rockwell International, 
and Vietinghoff watched as each new generation of rocket engine was born in 
thunder and fire -- rockets with such evocative names as Atlas and Thor, 
Redstone and Navajo, Jupiter and Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the glory days, when the throaty roars of rocket engine tests 
rumbled regularly across the San Fernando Valley from the west, and the future 
seemed as limitless as the heavens themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6,000 men and women spent those intoxicating days and nights on 
massive test stands shielded from public view by the craggy umber peaks of the 
Santa Susanas west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sunny morning, Vietinghoff returned to those test stands. Now they 
are hauntingly quiet, mute witnesses to a past not so much forgotten as taken 
for granted. Rockets are routine, like cars and telephones. It was so different 
back then. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a thrill to come out and witness a test," recalled Vietinghoff, 
who was charged with figuring out ways to reduce the high-frequency vibrations 
that rattled early engines to pieces. "There were people running up and down 
the stands. They were always either removing or installing a test engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Man made it into space and finally to the moon. With man's reach within his 
grasp, the urgency of the future seemed to wane. In time the number of workers 
at the test facility fell to just over 600. New test stands were built, and the 
old ones offer few hints of their bustling past. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeds poke through cracked pavement. Wind whispers through metal grating. 
Dripping water echoes rhythmically through flame buckets that once captured the 
white-hot power of engines often no larger than a V-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nostalgic," said Vietinghoff, taking in the scene from a high platform. 
"An era has passed." 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket engines were mounted on the stands so they could be monitored by 
dozens of different gauges. Fuel was fed from tanks at the top and the flames 
were caught and tamed by giant flumes at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of rocket engine development in the late 1950s, as many as 17 
rocket tests were conducted in one day. Once, seven tests were done in a single 
day on a single stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Deer and other wildlife became so accustomed to the racket that after a time 
they barely paused at the sound. Rocks around some test stands are blackened by 
soot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the structures seem to fit the landscape of rocks worn smooth by 
millions of years of wind, covered here and there by the paintings of people 
who long ago sought to explain the starry sky with myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Each corner of the winding roads through the Santa Susana Test Facility brings 
another vista, another unsettling scene of man's towers silently guarding the 
harsh canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Form follows function. The very utility of the structures, their decided 
inelegance gives them a certain style beyond the obvious jumble of hoses and 
wires, girders and screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the test stands -- their paint worn thin by weather and heat 
-- evokes memories of the men and women who walked these same steps, who 
checked the now-quaint gauges a hundred times a day and scribbled countless 
calculations into their notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dignitaries such as Charles Lindbergh, Wernher Von Braun and Gen. Jimmy 
Doolittle came out to see and hear and feel the force and promise of rocket 
engines being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those who have conducted them time and again, engine tests are 
memorable events. From their secure vantage points, they see the blast of flame 
spill out a split second before the mechanical bellow reaches them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water cascade down the flame bucket in an 
effort to prevent it and the surrounding test stand from melting in the hellish 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 So much energy is generated that it can be felt deep in the chest. The sound 
swallows all else. And then, it stops. The silence afterward is said to have 
been so profound that it is almost suffocating. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in the early days, each test was a gamble. No one knew when or if 
an engine might blow apart. Technicians would listen intently for the telltale 
whine that signaled trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would start screaming like a banshee," Vietinghoff said. "We had fires 
and explosions. We were still learning the characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point they were trying to find out everything about rocket engines -- 
including how to start them, just how to start them. In the old days, it was 
like walking on eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the tests are less risky. And they are conducted on more modern 
test stands where computers monitor every twitch and wiggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, technicians still spend hours preparing a single engine for its 
initial firing. 
</P>
<P>
 The newer test stands seem smaller, more compact than their older cousins. The 
gauges are shiny, the metal clean. The pavement all around is still black and 
smooth and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The old stands remain unused, but there are no plans to raze them. One day, 
perhaps, they will be called again into service, when eyes look skyward and see 
the frontier once more.

NEW DAWN FOR QUAKE-HIT CHURCH; RELIGION: CONGREGATION IN STUDIO CITY CELEBRATES 
REOPENING OF DAMAGED SANCTUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Almost a year after it was yellow-tagged because of damage from the Northridge 
earthquake, congregants of the First Christian Church of North Hollywood 
celebrated Sunday morning services for the first time in their newly renovated 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "A week ago we weren't even certain that we would be ready -- we were still 
painting," said Erik Torgerson, a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the 
church. "But this is incredible. The feeling of being here is like having goose 
pimples." 
</P>
<P>
 The roof, steeple and south wall of the church were rebuilt and retrofitted 
after they caved in during the Jan. 17 earthquake, Torgerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 families, friends and couples dressed in their Sunday best 
flocked to the 44-year-old brick Colonial church facing Colfax Avenue for the 
10 a.m. service Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 35-voice choir belted out gospel songs welcoming church members, 
accompanied by a small orchestra and organist Glenn Schieke on the church's 
newly donated pipe organ, many worshipers looked up in awe where the damage 
once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come a long way from the earthquake," said Betty Hopper, a member of 
the congregation for the past 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the church was being rebuilt, the 550-member congregation was forced to 
meet in an undamaged social hall for the last 11 months. Consequently, 
attendance at the church dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many things we can do in the church that we couldn't do in the 
hall," said Hopper, a Studio City resident. "It is really great to see everyone 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Stratton, a choir member, said of the refurbished church: "It's like 
coming home. There is just a presence here that you don't get anywhere else. 
It's thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 For a time last week, church officials were still unsure whether they would 
meet their deadline for completion. Pews were being brought in from the social 
hall; huge brass chandeliers were being polished, and the front doors to the 
sanctuary were "being painted in the nick of time," Torgerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a culmination of a very difficult year full of frustration and 
hard work, but it was worth it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation raised $450,000 in donations and pledges to repair the 
quake-damaged sanctuary, church officials said. The total repair cost of 
$500,000 was met by obtaining a few low-interest loans, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the service, the Rev. Robert Bock, the church's senior pastor 
for 25 years, summed up the overall feeling best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it!" he declared.

PUTTING ON THE DOG AT ANNUAL SHOW; PETS: MORE THAN 1,500 CANINES -- 
REPRESENTING 133 BREEDS -- ARE ENTERED IN ANTELOPE VALLEY KENNEL CLUB'S 
COMPETITION. 
</P>

 As the pageant's big moment approached, nails were being trimmed, hair was 
being cut, brushed and sprayed into perfection and feet were being powdered. 
No, make that paws -- paws were being powdered. 
</P>
<P>
 And then it was show time for more than 1,500 of man's best friends, primped 
and primed by doting owners who hoped to walk away with laurels Sunday from the 
Antelope Valley Kennel Club's annual dog show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a show for people that have recognized purebreds and want to show and 
exhibit what they think is a good representation of the breed," event 
chairwoman Nedra Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders use the shows to "prove the worth of their breeding stock," said 
Antelope Valley Kennel Club President Judythe Coffman. 
</P>
<P>
 All but four of the 137 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club made 
appearances at the show at the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds. The place literally 
was littered with dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 There were dogs in crates. And dogs in cages. Others sat patiently atop 
grooming tables as their owners prepared them for the judging. There were dogs 
not much bigger than rats and others heavier than a grown man. Some were little 
more than skin and bones while others had too much skin for their bones. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the sight of so many canines failed to satisfy the most ardent of dog 
lovers, a pack of vendors offered wares that ranged from rawhide dog bones to 
collectible plates adorned with paintings of pooches. There were bronze dog 
statues, dog wall hangings, dog Christmas ornaments, chocolates molded to look 
like paw prints and even holiday gift baskets brimming with doggy delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that people at the show were true dog lovers could be found in the 
parking lot, where custom license plates and bumper stickers testified to 
owners' allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 One plate read "YORKY" while another read "PUDEL." Still another read 
"GR8TDNE." Perhaps the most telling was the plate that read simply, "DOG CRZY." 
</P>
<P>
 Coffman, a Lancaster resident, said the Antelope Valley Kennel Club has 
sponsored a dog show every year since 1957. It is one of the nation's 20 
largest dog shows in the number of entries. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's show coincided with a Time magazine article detailing the genetic 
problems that occur in some purebreds because the focus of breeding has changed 
to creating dogs that look good and win competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Wolfley, a Long Beach resident and beagle breeder who showed some of her 
dogs at Sunday's event, agreed that competition has created problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders, she said, should control their desire to create dogs that just win 
shows. "You have to take an overall view of the betterment of the breed," she 
said. "Dogs that have genetic faults should not be bred." 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Ostrowski, a collie breeder from Santa Ana, said the breeders should 
police themselves. "Some of them do abuse it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coffman noted that even mutts have genetic problems. "The breeds were 
developed for specific purposes," she said. "If you didn't have people 
perpetuating those specific attributes for those specific breeds you would have 
everything revert back to a feral dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people involved in dog breeding, she said, "do it as a labor of 
love. We certainly don't make any money out of it; it's not a money-making 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Lester, a member of the local kennel club, said reputable breeders do 
genetic screening "not to produce the perfect puppy but a healthy puppy."

'DISCLOSURE' EDGES OUT 'SANTA' AT THE BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: MUCH-HYPED 
SEXUAL-HARASSMENT DRAMA PUSHES ASIDE THE TIM ALLEN HEAVYWEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Disclosure," a drama about sexual harassment and other workplace power games, 
bumped "The Santa Clause" off the box-office roof this weekend -- though not by 
much -- while a sky-diving Wesley Snipes fell into a low-flying third place in 
the adventure "Drop Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Top 10 films, such as "Star Trek: Generations," "Interview With the 
Vampire" and "Junior," took major hits from which not all are expected to 
recover, according to preliminary estimates of weekend movie ticket sales. With 
hoped-for bigger guns such as Jim Carrey in "Dumb and Dumber" and Michael 
Keaton and Geena Davis in "Speechless" due on Friday, it was one of those 
things-can-only-get-better weekends -- probably the nadir of the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman-bites-dog saga, "Disclosure," based on Michael Crichton's 
bestseller and starring Demi Moore and Michael Douglas, managed to scratch up 
enough scratch to get off to a promising if not definitively smashing launch 
with an estimated $10.1 million on 1,675 screens. Opening weekend business for 
"Disclosure" was well below industry expectations, based on strong tracking 
studies of audience interest in the film and the previous weekend's sneak 
previews. But there's many a slip between want-to-see and actual ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult audiences may have a bigger appetite for "Disclosure" than they 
demonstrated in the film's first weekend. At least Warner Bros. is hoping so. 
The proof will be in whether the film can build critical mass as the holidays 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids, however, always need to be entertained. And strong Saturday matinee 
business for "The Santa Clause" helped it remain strong for the fifth straight 
weekend against the arrival of "Disclosure." The undisputed hit of the season, 
starring Tim Allen, mirthed its way to $8.9 million on 2,381 screens. The 
$96-million total to date officially put "Santa" ahead of "Interview With the 
Vampire," which dropped to either sixth or seventh with an anemic $2.3 million 
and a $94-million total. Both films will top $100 million soon, "Clause" by the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drop Zone" got any urban adventure-seekers who weren't at holiday parties, 
which only amounted to $6.4 million on 2,020 screens. And however modest that 
was, it came out of the hide of "Low Down Dirty Shame," which plummeted to $2.3 
million and just $21 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a free admission for every pregnant woman (or man) promotion to help 
pull "Junior" out of the doldrums? The $2.9 million collected over the past 
weekend placed the film in fourth place, but the $24 million in tickets sold to 
date is keenly disappointing for an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle, especially 
considering that it was handicapped as one of the season's sure bets and 
received better-than-average reviews.  
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek: Generations" again lost more than half its business from the 
previous weekend, down to $2.8 million with just over $64 million to date. 
Still, it will end up among the top grossers in the never-ending film series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King" lay in wait for the holidays, managing another $2.2 million 
and edging it close to $290 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 20th Century Fox films rounded out the Top 10. "Miracle on 34th Street" is 
hanging by a thread with $1.6 million and has done only about $13 million so 
far. "Trapped in Paradise" dipped to $1.4 million and only about $5 million to 
date.

FOX'S SIZZLING SUMMER SEGUES TO A WINTER OF DISCONTENT; MOVIES: AFTER WHAT'S 
SHAPING UP AS A DIFFICULT HOLIDAY SEASON, 20TH CENTURY FOX IS AT A CROSSROADS. 
INSIDERS WONDER IF THE PROBLEMS ARE TEMPORARY OR LONGER TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a red-hot summer in which 20th Century Fox racked up a pair of 
$100-million-plus hits in "Speed" and "True Lies," the studio has hit a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of four consecutive box-office flops -- "The Scout," "Miracle on 
34th Street," "The Pagemaster" and "Trapped in Paradise" -- has raised 
questions in the industry as to whether the studio is merely the latest victim 
of a cyclical film business or proceeding on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrival in November, 1992, Fox Chairman Peter Chernin has embarked 
on an ambitious restructuring of the studio -- creating a four-division system 
to fill the product pipeline, hiring Disney's Bill Mechanic to serve as 
president of the company, and changing top management in the business, legal 
and international distribution departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though company executives have high hopes for the first half of 1995, there 
are clouds on the horizon. Almost no movies have been set for the latter part 
of the year -- and none is in place for the crucial Christmas holiday period. 
To complicate matters, there's an unfilled void left by the departure of the 
company's marketing head last September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The next six to eight months are a crossroads for the studio," says one 
insider. "They'll either turn the corner or realize things aren't working." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major conflicts revolves around Fox's recent formation of a second 
film division designed to turn out mainstream movies. While Tom Jacobson had 
been the sole head of production, producer Laura Ziskin was brought aboard two 
months ago to run a similar movie unit. The move, studio officials explain, has 
a two-fold purpose: to increase the number of films and get a more varied slate 
from two distinctly differently personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 But, since Ziskin and Jacobson both have their own stable of producers, 
infighting and competition have set in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unwritten policy that Laura's producers are Laura's and Tom's are 
Tom's," one insider says. "The factionalization is not only inefficient but a 
great source of frustration for producers on the lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio's other two recently formed divisions -- Fox's family division, 
headed by Christopher Meledandri, and Tom Rothman's Fox Searchlight Pictures, 
handling "specialized," or art house, films -- are more clearly defined and 
therefore are not as likely to step on another division's toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziskin, a former producer ("Pretty Woman," "Hero") who is a newcomer to the 
executive ranks, hopes to have four to six films underway within the next 18 
months. Though she'll try to steer clear of Jacobson, she admits that at times 
that might be tough. "The reality is, we have different tastes," she says. "But 
that's not to say we won't make the same choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Jacobson: "There's nothing that prevents anyone on the lot from working 
with anyone else. We're doing our best to keep this collegial." 
</P>
<P>
 Chernin declined to be interviewed for this story. But Mechanic took issue 
with the industry's tendency to prejudge the multi-division strategy while it's 
still in its infancy. Entertainment lawyer David Colden agrees. "It is too 
early to evaluate the four divisions, but the studio is in a growth mode with a 
very clear business plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Fox's strategy is even more important given the studio's 
erratic performance this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio gambled and won when it paired Keanu Reeves with first-time 
director Jan de Bont in the low-budget "Speed" -- which became a summer sleeper 
and one of the year's biggest movies. But, despite the fact that Jodie Foster 
in the upcoming "Nell" has been mentioned as a possible Oscar contender, much 
of the schedule was filled with a spate of high-concept, lowbrow comedies such 
as "Airheads," "Baby's Day Out" and "PCU," none of which took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie choices, counters one top Fox executive, are always compromises. "Peter 
had to start from ground zero," he says. "Only 60 projects were in development 
when he arrived. You do the best you can with what you have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though some see the hand of media mogul Rupert Murdoch -- chief of Fox's 
parent company, News Corp -- in the studio master plan, Fox insiders insist 
that Murdoch only shows up on the lot one week a month and has little or 
nothing to do with the movie operation. "Rupert hasn't read a script since I've 
been here," says one. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernin concentrates on the creative end while studio president Mechanic 
focuses on home video and international sales. It is Chernin who has formal 
responsibility for "green lighting" a picture -- but he never does so without 
soliciting the opinion of Mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernin and Mechanic are two different animals. If the affable Chernin is 
perceived as the "good cop," Mechanic is often described as a bull in a china 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill is a fierce competitor, capable of some pretty radical behavior in 
pursuit of his goals," says a filmmaker who has observed him close-up.  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was this more evident than during Disney's recent press junket for 
"The Santa Clause," which turned into a fiasco when Mechanic decided to have 
some fun by placing promotional materials for Fox's competing holiday release, 
"Miracle on 34th Street," on the beds of visiting journalists. An angry Disney 
charged that the move was a violation of Hollywood etiquette -- not to mention 
the hotel guests' right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry also raised its eyebrows at Mechanic's wildly unorthodox 
money-back rebate intended to lure theatergoers in to see "Miracle" -- an offer 
that only .5% took him up on. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing, Fox admits, is a thorn in its side. After the department head, 
Andrea Jaffe, left in September, Chernin, Mechanic and executive vice president 
Tom Sherak had to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big void, which is causing the company major problems," says one 
Fox insider. "This has led to a number of casualties -- 'Miracle on 34th 
Street' among them. Though the movie scored well in theater exit polls, it was 
doomed by a soft, sentimental marketing campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Some raise the question, however, if better marketing could have saved 
"Miracle" or whether it, along with "The Scout," "Trapped in Paradise" and "The 
Pagemaster" (a carry-over from former studio chief Joe Roth), was a bad idea 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's 1995 slate looks stronger and more diverse. The summer brings Lawrence 
Kasdan's romantic comedy "Paris Match," starring Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline; 
Christopher Columbus' "Nine Months" with Robin Williams and Hugh Grant; the 
third "Die Hard" installment, as well as the prospect of a major franchise in 
"The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 On tap for the spring, the studio has Barbet Schroeder's dramatic thriller 
"Kiss of Death" (starring David Caruso and Nicolas Cage) and "A Walk in the 
Clouds," a love story with Keanu Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 One film that won't be on the schedule is "Crisis in the Hot Zone." Racing to 
hit the screen before Warner Bros.' "Outbreak" -- a competing film about a 
killer virus -- the project fell through earlier this year when first Jodie 
Foster and then Robert Redford dropped out. The episode not only alienated 
director Ridley Scott, but cost European investors millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal-wise, however, the studio has made strides. Chernin has signed producers 
such as Lili and Richard Zanuck, as well as directors Christopher Columbus, 
John Woo and De Bont. And, Wesley Snipes, Meg Ryan, Sean Connery and Tom Hanks 
have been given first-look overall deals to develop material in which they 
could star. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its problems, Fox still has its supporters in Hollywood's creative 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last summer, Peter Chernin and Bill Mechanic were hailed as the Second Coming 
after the success of 'Speed' and 'True Lies,' " says William Morris senior vice 
president Joan Hyler. "They're still first-rate people buying first-rate 
projects. How quickly we forget."

HOWARD STERN: WHEN YOU'RE STERN, WHO NEEDS A PR FIRM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD STERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samaritan Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Stern's hands must be calloused and raw from a career of patting 
himself on the back. Sometimes it's a stretch, even for him. But last 
Wednesday, as if the God of Airwaves had personally blessed him, came a public 
relations gift so tailored to Stern's narcissistic agenda that it looked 
suspiciously like a stunt of his own design. But apparently it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, in which Stern used his syndicated morning radio show to help 
stop a seemingly suicidal man from leaping from New York's George Washington 
Bridge, illustrates two things that Stern arguably does better than anyone else 
in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk incessantly and self-promote, also incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
 After climbing over a bridge railing, Emilio Bonilla, 29, called Stern on a 
cellular phone and said he was ready to end his life by jumping into the Hudson 
River. That Stern immediately separated Bonilla from the various noodles who 
regularly call his show was itself amazing. Yet he did. And you had to marvel 
at the way Stern, along with his cohort, Robin Quivers, kept Bonilla 
preoccupied for 4 1/2 minutes until authorities could grab the potential jumper 
(whom police later called a "bona fide, distraught individual") and stop him 
from fulfilling his threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more impressive, though, was the speed with which Stern U-turned the 
incident to his advantage by touting himself as a savior. "This is my Christmas 
present to all of the world!" humanitarian Howard declared with the kind of 
self-mockery that endears him to listeners even on those occasions when he 
stumbles across the taste line like a drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, within a minute of the rescue of Bonilla, Stern had sent himself 
into orbit, transforming someone's apparent near death into an event of 
self-celebration, warning a female motorist who had grabbed Bonilla not to 
"steal my thunder," suggesting he pose for a "photo op" with Bonilla's wife and 
kids "who are now not fatherless because I stepped in," wondering if he would 
receive a financial reward for saving Bonilla and beknighting himself a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call the newspapers, Gary. Call the newspapers immediately!" Stern ordered 
his producer within moments of police arriving to take Bonilla into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Could you believe it? Even as the police car with Bonilla was still making its 
way through traffic, Stern was mapping his self-promotion strategy in detail 
right on the air, sharing it with the world, doing it live, off the top of his 
head. There would be the morning's inevitable press conference at which, he and 
Quivers agreed, he would do his humble act and let her be the one to call him a 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern could say all this openly, knowing that the media's knowing wouldn't 
hurt because his indelible reputation as being blatantly self-serving is 
somehow part of his irresistibility to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The press conference, broadcast live (and later shown, along with excerpts 
from the radio broadcast, on Stern's E! cable show) went as planned. Quivers 
called Stern a hero and, aw shucks, he said he did only what any other citizen 
would have done. "I am always available to the police," he said, magnanimously, 
before asking, with all humility, that the George Washington Bridge not be 
renamed after him. "However, if they want to do that," he said, "there's 
nothing I can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would Bonilla call Stern in the first place? "Did you ever listen to the 
other jerks on the air?" said Stern, displaying his usual generosity toward 
competitors. "Who would call them?" And live to tell about it. Imagine the 
possible result, for example, had Bonilla called Rush Limbaugh instead of 
Stern. If Bonilla had identified himself as a liberal, Limbaugh would have 
urged him to jump. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stern is hardly alone among broadcasters and others who exploit the airwaves 
for personal aggrandizement. In that category is Disney, its just-aired ABC 
special, "The Wonderful World of Disney: 40 Years of Television Magic," being 
in part a stage from which to advertise the company's myriad entertainment 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some self-servers, such as PR bullies Tom and Roseanne, excel temporarily, 
their bad will finally thickening like waxy yellow buildup. Michael Jackson was 
a flame-out, too. Presaged by unproved pedophilia charges, the media backlash 
found him only after his years of successful manipulation, in which news 
cameras were summoned to record the visits to children's hospital wards and 
other scripted good deeds that his image polishers deployed on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Then come the flat-out hucksters. In contrast to the transparent smarminess of 
the bleating Mr. Blackwells and Richard Simmonses is the blustery Limbaugh, who 
orchestrates his self-promotion with a maestro's baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich may have the gift, too, with each 
so-called gaffe that the smart, witty Georgia Republican makes appearing to be 
less a stumble than a calculated step toward some political end. Although 
Republicans complain that the media are giving Gingrich a bad time, they appear 
transfixed by his personality and ready to adore him, in part because he's such 
good copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why sportswriters like unpretentious George Foreman, and why years 
ago they swooned when young Muhammad Ali opened his mouth to promote his 
fights, recording and taking copious notes on the insults he hurled at 
opponents as if they believed he was serious. He wasn't, and reporters knew it, 
but willingly allowed themselves to be bribed by sound bites and enlisted in 
the campaign to attract attention to Ali's fights. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it is with Stern, who understands that the real trick of 
shameless self-flattery is to openly propagandize without alienating, to 
execute in full view so that the media know they're being taken but submit 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to bask in himself on Friday, New York's newest hero reran his 
press conference -- he'll be feeding from this trough for weeks -- but vowed 
never again to take a call like Bonilla's. He'd been warned that if Bonilla had 
ended up in the river, the blame might have fallen on Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, none of Stern's underlings had notified the police about him being 
on the air with a man threatening to jump from the bridge. Not to worry. As it 
turned out, the cops were already listening to his show. Well, it's New York.

YOUNG CONSERVATORY PLAYERS TAKE THE HOLIDAYS OFF; YOUTH THEATER: THE SCR TROUPE 
TYPICALLY OPENS ITS SUBSCRIPTION SERIES IN DECEMBER, BUT ITS DIRECTOR IS TAKING 
A ONE-YEAR HIATUS. 
</P>

<P>
 "Christmas Carols" and "Nutcrackers" abound right now, but if you've noticed 
something amiss in this month's family entertainment lineup, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory's Young Conservatory Players, which typically opens its 
youth theater subscription series in December, isn't doing a show this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? SCR's longtime Young Conservatory director, Diane Doyle, has taken 
a one-year hiatus. In her absence, SCR administrators have trimmed YCP's 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 YCP will present a family show for a two-weekend run in early June on SCR's 
Second Stage; the title of that work has not been announced. In addition, 
advanced Young Conservatory students plan to perform during Imagination 
Celebration, April 22 to May 7. SCR's 1994-95 Educational Touring Production, 
"Birds of a Feather," is also scheduled for public shows at the Imagination 
Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Conservatory classes for children ages 8 to 17 continue at SCR under the 
supervision of Karen Hensel, a longtime company member of the resident theater 
who also directs the theater's Adult Conservatory and Professional 
Conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, SCR's Mainstage and Second Stage offerings this month are both 
suitable for families. The annual Mainstage production of "A Christmas Carol," 
a show for ages 8 and up, continues through Christmas Eve. And on Wednesday, 
SCR will premiere "La Posada Magica," a play by Octavio Solis with songs by 
Marcos Loya.  
</P>
<P>
 It follows a 14-year-old girl as she takes part in Las Posadas , , the Mexican 
Christmas candlelight procession that commemorates Mary and Joseph's search for 
lodging, and unwittingly rekindles the girl's belief in the season. The play is 
recommended for adults and children ages 8 and up and will run through Dec. 24.

 As for Doyle, she's developing a number of new projects, including what she 
calls a "huge" theatrical adaptation of "Jump!," Van Dyke Parks' book about 
folk character Brer Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Southern, it's folk tales, it's fabulous," Doyle said recently during a 
phone conversation from her Santa Ana home. But, she added, "it's not a fairy 
tale; these characters are rough around the edges." 
</P>

<P>
 Doyle says her two-act, 18-character musical will feature songs written and 
recorded by Parks. Because of its length and some dark images, Doyle expects 
the play to be suitable for ages 10 and up as well as adults. She's not 
planning to premiere the piece at SCR and is looking into the possibility of a 
large-scale production with a national touring company. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Doyle and her frequent musical collaborator Diane King Vann are 
preparing for publication several works they have previously written and 
produced through SCR, including "Pinocchio" and a bilingual version of "Clean 
Up Your Act!" Doyle also is consulting with teachers at several elementary 
schools, helping develop theater programs for students.

COUNTERPUNCH: WHEN WILL TV REFLECT LATINO AUDIENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILUKA RIVERA, Miluka Rivera is an actress, director, writer and poet who is 
working for ethnic diversity in the entertainment industry and in the Screen 
Actors Guild, where she served on the group's national board. Based in Burbank, 
she has been active in the New York theatrical community and was the first 
Latino American to receive a New York SAG award for outstanding achievement.

 I was delighted to read "David Who?" (Morning Report, Calendar, Nov. 17) 
regarding Jimmy Smits and the "NYPD Blue" ratings.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the night of Smits' debut on "NYPD Blue," the show scored the 
highest ratings of any network -- 28% -- opposite "Scarlett." This was not a 
surprise to me. Good for Smits! He was also very popular on "L.A. Law." Smits 
and many other talented Latino actors, when given the opportunity, have shown 
TV executives that they can be as "bankable" as anyone else and not the 
financial risk some claim. "Fantasy Island," starring Ricardo Montalban (now in 
"Heaven Help Us"), "Chips" with Eric Estrada and "Chico and the Man" with the 
late Freddie Prinze could also testify to this fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish-language radio station KLAX-FM has topped the Southern California 
ratings for more than a year, and there's considerable evidence that KMEX-TV 
might lead the television ratings if the A.C. Nielsen Co. would use the same 
methodology for measuring all stations that it does for Spanish-language 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Latinos as consumers, DRI/McGraw Hill's Consumer Expenditure Report 
showed that Latinos' U.S. annual purchasing power increased from $242.1 billion 
in 1992 to $292 billion in 1994, the fastest-growing market for almost all 
consumer goods. When it comes to entertainment, 2,128,100 Latinos went to see 
movies and 2,090,300 rented videos in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 What's taking place in Los Angeles is a microcosm of what's taking place 
nationwide; mass media such as Prime Ticket's "La Cadena Deportiva," NBC News' 
"Canal de Noticias," "HBO en Espanol" and "MTV Latino" are discovering the 
profitable Latino market. I hope that Smits' "NYPD Blue" ratings success, as 
well as the recent research, make more producers take notice and open more 
doors for Latino actors in the entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm looking forward to the day when Latinos, the invisible "minority" of 
millions, are represented closer to their true population (at least 10% in the 
United States), rather than their present 1% tokenism on prime-time TV -- as 
measured by the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs -- and 
they're depicted in a balanced manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry has failed to show America's true diversity and the 
contributions we all have made to its greatness. When these truths become 
realistic reflections on our TV tubes and movie screens, then perhaps we may 
observe a drop in suicide rates among our young people and a decrease in crime 
and illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Our media has enormous power and influence on a lot of people. There is a 
responsibility that goes with that power. We need to encourage more positive 
stories and a greater balance of values, not only to Latinos but to all 
Americans. In our young population are the precious jewels of America's and the 
world's future.  
</P>
<P>
 Godspeed to all those who have made and are trying to make a significant 
difference in our media. Congratulations to Jimmy Smits and to the "NYPD Blue" 
production.

COUNTERPUNCH: THERE'S TRUTH IN 'INFINITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY PHILLIPS BUCCI, Peggy Phillips Bucci has been a professional writer 
and public relations specialist for more than 40 years. She was director of 
publicity for Center Theatre Group in the Music Center's Mark Taper Forum and 
Ahmanson Theatres, as well as the L.A. Civic Light Opera at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. She has been a publicist for theater, film and related arts 
in New York, England and California. A Broadway playwright, she has had 
numerous film and television writing credits. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the last remaining blood relatives of Richard Phillips Feynman, I 
have perhaps a different perspective regarding the Matthew Broderick-Patricia 
Broderick film about the noted scientist, "Infinity," due for release next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kristine McKenna's article ("Mr. Feynman's Day Off," Calendar, Nov. 27), 
Ralph Leighton was quoted as saying, "Patricia refused to take suggestions from 
people who knew Richard."  
</P>
<P>
 This was certainly not my experience. Once she heard that I was a first cousin 
of Feynman (his mother and my father were brother and sister), and that I had 
spent my early summers in Far Rockaway at my grandmother's hotel where, growing 
up, most of the cousins worked at one time or another, not only did Patsy 
eagerly solicit my input but she and Matthew invited me to spend many hours 
discussing the characters and possible relevant locations. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point they even sent me a script, requesting that I tape a few pages on 
an audiocassette so that the actress playing Arlene (Richie's first wife) could 
pattern her accent after my own. Although they had requested input from another 
first cousin, Frances Lewine (who works in the CNN Washington bureau), and 
Richie's sister, Joan Feynman Hirschberg Ruzmianken, neither cared to cooperate 
at that time. The script of "Infinity" was deliberately intended to cover only 
a very small portion of Richie's life, but it is a poignant and deeply moving 
part that touched him probably more than anything else ever did, either before 
or after Arlene's death. Those who object to the narrowness of this viewpoint 
can always write their own versions, and probably will. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major correction I made to the script was in reference to Richie's 
mother, my Aunt Tutti (so-called by the family because her given name, Lucille, 
was the same as my mother's), whose speech pattern as written was too 
colloquial. Aunt Tutti was a cultivated, carefully educated woman whose English 
was flawless. As a matter of fact, she taught this language to foreign 
students. She was also a very wise woman who learned early on how to cope with 
the wayward eccentricities of the two most important people in her life -- her 
husband and her son.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richie's father, my Uncle Mel, was a handsome man whose good looks Richie 
inherited, along with his passion for knowledge, a fey high-pitched giggle and 
a hearty appreciation of the female form. In middle life, Mel sought respite 
from his mundane job as a uniform salesman by taking art lessons. Commuting 
from Far Rockaway to Manhattan, Mel stayed in town late two nights a week to 
attend art school, in particular a life class. On those nights, since my family 
lived in Manhattan, Mel used to have dinner with us. It was on one of these 
occasions that he revealed some of his sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the daughter of show business parents, I was still a somewhat naive 
adolescent and remarked on the fact that the lady models appeared to be nude. I 
asked my uncle if this were really so. "Of course," he leered playfully, "why 
do you think I became an artist?" 
</P>
<P>
 The apple does not fall far from the tree. After Arlene died, my main role in 
Richie's life was to provide him access to the backstage environs of the 
Broadway musicals on which I served as press agent. Among these was the 
original production of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," which contained a chorus 
line of some of the most beautiful girls imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 They paraded topless backstage, much to the delight of Richie. Within three or 
four days he had managed to date every one of them, so when his son, Carl, now 
says, "If my father had been alive there's no way he would have let this film 
be made," I can only respond that Carl did not really know his father, for if 
he did, he would realize that nothing -- absolutely nothing -- would have 
delighted Cousin Richie more than all the hoopla attending a gala film premiere 
to which he would of course have been invited, and where he would rub shoulders 
with some of the most attractive and glamorous ladies in the entertainment 
world.

SHOP TALK: OVERTIME RULES VARY FOR NON-STANDARD WORKWEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Question: Our shop is on a 10-hour workday, Monday through Thursday, with 
Friday off. Recently, I was off on a Tuesday for three hours in order to keep a 
doctor's appointment. On Friday of the same week, I worked eight hours of 
overtime. When I received my paycheck, I was paid 40 hours of straight time and 
only five hours of time and a half. Should I have to work overtime for 
straight-time pay? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.G., Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The application of the wage and hour laws to non-standard workweeks 
like yours varies, depending upon the type of business that employs you. Some 
employers must pay overtime for any hours worked on the fifth day of a four-day 
workweek composed of 10-hour days. Others are not required to do so. To find 
out which rules apply to your employer, contact the local office of the 
California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement at (714) 558-4111.

 Question: I worked for nearly five years as a truck driver and I injured my 
back while on the job. I filed a workers' compensation case in 1992. My company 
sent me the paperwork to terminate my pension/profit-sharing plan, dated back 
to the date of the injury, which I signed for my check to be sent this year. 
Would this action be considered grounds for illegal job termination or was that 
just the termination of my benefits to the pension/profit-sharing plan? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.B., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Simply terminating plan benefits does not necessarily mean that you 
have been terminated from your job. Often, employers may terminate the plan for 
all of its employees or may have extended to you the option to terminate it 
prior to the termination of your job, resignation or retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems very strange that they would terminate it, however, as of the date of 
your injury. There are laws that prohibit retaliation against an employee 
because of a workplace injury. Such retaliation could be your termination, 
demotion or the loss of some benefits. The deadline for filing a claim for such 
improper action is one year from the date it was done. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, the easiest thing for you to do would be to simply call 
or write your employer and ask for clarification of your job status. Ask them 
about the reason for the termination of your pension/profit-sharing plan. If 
they fail to respond, send them a certified letter asking for your lawful right 
to inspect your employee file. Perhaps the file will contain documentation 
answering your questions.

 Question: My brother-in-law came out of retirement as a floor salesman in a 
large chain store. He was told that he would be a "part-time" employee that 
would not be entitled to any benefits or premium pay. But for the nine months 
that he's been there, he works eight hours a day and often seven or more days 
in a row. He is called upon to work holidays, and it is not unusual for him to 
exceed 40 hours in a week, yet he doesn't receive overtime pay. Please explain 
the California laws that pertain to part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- E.F., La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: California regulations are silent on the definition of a part-time 
employee. Most employers maintain employee classifications to distinguish 
between full-time and part-time employees not only by the number of hours they 
work each week, but also by the type and amounts of benefits that they enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, a part-time employee classification is defined as an employee who 
regularly works fewer than 40 hours a week whereas a full-time employee 
regularly works a minimum of 40 hours a week on a continued basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not a part-time employee is entitled to benefits is also determined 
by an employer's policies or benefit plan documents. It isn't unusual not to 
have benefits available for part-time employees. Many employers will also 
establish seven-day work weeks to begin and end in the middle of a calendar 
week (i.e., the workweek begins on Wednesday and ends on Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, it is conceivable that an employee can be scheduled to work seven 
or more days in a row, three days will consequently fall in one work week, the 
additional four days fall in the next workweek. This will still maintain 
part-time status because the employee has never worked more than 40 hours in 
the established workweek. This could be the case in your brother-in-law's 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is not the situation, and your brother-in-law is working consistently 
the equivalent of 40 or more hours each week, he should pursue the matter with 
his employer for a change of status and benefit rights if available, unless 
alternative workweek arrangements have been agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, remember that California regulations require overtime pay if an employee 
works more than eight hours a day or more than 40 hours in a workweek.

 Question: I work for a security company and have found out that they are 
charging their customers for overtime holiday pay for the security officers' 
time, yet not paying these officers the holiday pay. In addition, they don't 
pay the officer for the actual time spent on post. (Example: If the employee 
has to work until 5:21 p.m., he or she only gets paid a quarter of an hour of 
overtime. The employee has to work to 5:30 p.m. in order to receive half an 
hour of overtime.) 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any rules as to how parts of an hour are accounted for or can the 
employer make their own rules? Can they do this or is this in violation of 
labor laws? Is there any recourse I can follow for myself and other employees? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.B., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: As to your first question, what your employer is doing is probably 
appropriate. What your employer charges its customers for the services it 
provides is a matter of contract between your employer and the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no labor law requirement that the employer pay its employees in 
exactly the same manner as it charges its customers for the employees' time. As 
to the issue of holiday pay, that, too, is a matter of contract between you and 
your employer. Therefore, if your employer has a policy that certain holidays 
are paid, and you work on one of those holidays, you perhaps should be 
receiving additional pay for the time worked on the holiday. If you believe you 
are not being paid appropriately, you may contact the Division of Labor 
Standards of Enforcement to pursue a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 As to your second question, the general rule is that employers must pay for 
all hours worked, even very small fractions. However, there is an 
administrative enforcement exception that allows employers in paying overtime 
to round off to the nearest 5-, 10 -or 15-minute period, but only if in so 
doing the employees tend to receive overtime compensation for all hours worked. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears from your description that your employer is relying on this 
exception and rounding to the nearest quarter hour in paying overtime. That is 
only acceptable if your employer also allows its employees to benefit by 
rounding off. Thus, using your example, to be allowed to rely on this 
exception, your employer would have to pay a half-hour of overtime to any 
employee who worked from 5:23 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. If your employer is not, it may 
have liability under federal and state labor laws. I would contact the Division 
of Labor Standards Enforcement if you believe that you have a valid claim.

 Question: My daughter-in-law has been working part time for more than a year 
for a medical facility for the orthopedically handicapped. She has worked one 
shift on Saturday and two shifts on Sunday. She received overtime pay at time 
and a half for the second shift on Sunday. Her last paycheck contained no 
overtime pay but was accompanied by a notice -- effective at the beginning of 
that pay period -- that she had been changed to an exempt status. This was her 
first word on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is having financial problems and has brought in a personnel 
director who is making these adjustments. Regular staffers have been 
interviewed individually and offered a four-day workweek of 16 hours a day for 
the same salary an their previous 40-hour week. They have been told not to 
discuss this offer with anyone, with the inference that they will not be hired 
if they do. 
</P>
<P>
 This is obviously a non-union workplace. Perhaps they are hoping that the 
number of employees who do not accept will equal the number they will have to 
lay off to meet expenses. Are there any laws being broken here? If not, what 
actions would you advise? 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.C., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You do not say what job your daughter-in-law performs. Certain 
managerial, administrative and professional employees are exempt from the 
overtime laws. If she falls into one of these categories, which are defined 
rather specifically under state and federal law, she is not entitled to be paid 
overtime regardless of her employer's past practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The "professional" exemption covers only doctors and pharmacists in a 
health-care facility and the "administrative" exemption does not cover clerical 
workers, but rather covers only those who perform specialized or technical work 
or who regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming she is a non-exempt employee, she can be required to work up to 12 
hours per day without overtime, provided she does not work more than 40 hours 
per week and provided that at least two-thirds of the employees in her 
department vote for the 12-hour workday option after written disclosure and a 
meeting to discuss it. She would then be entitled to be paid time and a half 
for all hours over 12 worked in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day, 16-hours-a-day workweek without overtime you mentioned would 
appear to be unlawful, but since it does not affect your daughter-in-law, she's 
probably better off not making an issue of it. With respect to her own pay, she 
should inform the personnel director that the law requires that she be paid 
overtime. If she is not paid overtime thereafter, she can file a claim with the 
state Labor Commissioner. The law contains protections from employer 
retaliation for employees who file such claims.

throughout the Western Hemisphere with the same ease that artichokes from 
Castroville are sold in the markets of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 By committing their economically diverse nations to embark on such a path by 
2005, the 34 participants in the weekend Summit of the Americas laid down a 
benchmark that will become a challenge not just for themselves but, even in the 
short run, for nations around the world as the global economy grows ever more 
interdependent. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement demonstrates just how far the hemisphere has come since the last 
such gathering a generation ago, when the gold braid of generals mingled with 
the business suits of civilian leaders and the common demand was for 
preferential economic treatment. Now the summit is made up of countries that 
are, more or less, democracies. The chance to compete on a level economic 
playing field, rather than hiding behind protective tariffs or demanding 
favorable quotas, is the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is skepticism about whether the political willpower in the United 
States, if not in Latin America, will be sufficient to meet the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the most enthusiastic supporters of the expansion of free trade, 
there is the strong expectation that the summit will have a direct impact, and 
it is this impact that most stands out after the two days of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting a specific goal of negotiating a free-trade pact by 2005, the 
summit nations may well have set off a global competition that will force 
others to send tariffs, quotas and other barriers to global commerce into a 
free fall -- as much as anything happens in an uncontrolled and hasty manner in 
the deliberate world of international trade -- while encouraging a flow of 
investment capital to the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the goal be accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that the most meaningful thing coming out of the summit 
won't be what happens in Miami. It will be what happens after Miami -- to see 
if we continue our cooperation or if we let it drag, and to see if we start 
right away," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said shortly before the meetings 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 There are potential political pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin American nations are lining up to join the North American Free 
Trade Agreement implemented Jan. 1 by the United States, Mexico and Canada. The 
three announced Sunday that they will open talks to include Chile. Argentina, 
Colombia and Costa Rica would like to join quickly, too. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in short, a far cry from just a decade or less ago, when such 
cooperation with the United States, and the abandonment of towering protective 
tariffs intended to keep foreign products from competing with those of local 
workers, would have prompted a huge political outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you asked me 10 years ago, I would have said, 'No, this is not possible,' 
" said Nora Lustig, a senior fellow studying Latin American economies at the 
Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the United States, the North American accord prompted an angry yearlong 
political debate. Its expansion could well bring a replay, with labor 
organizations and environmentalists raising concerns that expansion of free 
trade can hamper protection of worker rights and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Kaufman Purcell, vice president of the Americas Society, who served in 
the State Department's policy planning staff with responsibility for the 
Caribbean and Latin America in the early 1980s, said some U.S. officials, led 
by President Clinton, see the nation moving aggressively to promote free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, the political problems facing Clinton can be compounded because 
others, "with an eye toward 1996," are worried that if the Administration does 
not provide sufficient protection for workers thrown out of jobs by foreign 
competition, it could be thrown out of work itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration has made free trade the horse it hopes to ride, with 
the goal of using it to open markets for U.S. goods and thus keep the economy 
growing while producing higher-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the agreement to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas, following the 
decision made in Indonesia to create such a region among the 18 Pacific Rim 
nations, including the United States, by 2020, the Administration hopes it has 
provided new impetus to efforts to cut tariffs and eliminate other barriers 
that slow down global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 These decisions, along with the rewriting of the General Agreement of Tariffs 
and Trade, which will cut tariffs by an average of 38% around the world, and 
the expansion of the North American pact, "will set the agenda for world trade 
for years to come in ways that benefit ordinary American families, that 
generate more high-wage jobs in this country and more opportunity in the 
countries for our trading partners," Clinton said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics see the summit's free-trade centerpiece as little more than an 
extension of a goal set in June 27, 1990, by then-President George Bush in his 
Enterprise for the Americas, in which he called for a "new economic 
partnership" with Latin America to boost trade and investment with a free-trade 
zone for the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped set off this incredible race toward free trade and lowering 
barriers," Purcell said of the Bush approach. 
</P>
<P>
 But by setting a specific date by which negotiations to accomplish the 
free-trade pact would be completed, the weekend summit went one major step 
beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Miami agreement and the Pacific free-trade goal set in 
November, a global free-trade agenda has been firmly established, said C. Fred 
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research 
organization in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is a process of competitive liberalization," Bergsten said. "All 
this is a dramatic movement toward opening markets and liberalizing the 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major, major step forward," he said, and will likely lead other 
nations and regional trading blocks to join the race to lower tariffs out of 
fear that their own trade barriers would make their products unwelcome around 
the world.

A BUBBLE WAITING TO BURST?; S. KOREAN SALARIES GROWING AT TOO FAST A PACE, MANY 
FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Daewoo Electronics Co. has achieved a small but significant milestone in South 
Korea's drive to join the ranks of the world's advanced industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its South Korean workers now earn more than their counterparts in some of 
Daewoo's Western factories. For example, workers at a Daewoo videocassette 
recorder factory in Kumi, South Korea, now draw average salaries of $1,300 per 
month, while employees of a similar Daewoo VCR plant in Northern Ireland 
average $1,200 per month, according to Bae Soon Hoon, president of Daewoo 
Electronics. The workers at Kumi, unlike their Irish counterparts, also get a 
free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the rapidly rising wages paid by Korean employers such as Daewoo, 
free-spending workers are helping to fuel a booming economy here. After a 
slowdown in 1992 and 1993, gross domestic product is expected to grow by more 
than 8% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Times are good indeed, but they may be too good for some Koreans who worry 
that South Korea is headed for a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages are rising too fast and outpacing increases in production, says Bae, a 
situation that is a "time bomb" threatening to undermine South Korea's 
international competitiveness. He notes that while South Korean wages have 
caught up with Northern Ireland's, Britain's per-capita GDP is still about 2.5 
times greater than South Korea's. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea could be caught in a bubble of expanding wages and consumption 
that cannot be sustained by the country's fundamental economic strength, 
leading eventually to a collapse that would bankrupt some companies and bring a 
jump in unemployment, said Bae, adding, "I hope that will not happen, but it 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 The current boom was ignited by government steps to encourage corporate 
investment, plus the effect of a strong Japanese yen, which makes South Korean 
products relative bargains compared to competing goods from Japan. Inflation is 
running at a tolerable 6%, while wages are up an average of 7% and unemployment 
is down to just 2.2%. South Korea's 1993 GNP of $329 billion made it the 14th 
largest economy in the world, and it is still headed up fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shipbuilding, automobiles, semiconductors, chemicals -- these industries have 
been doing well in the domestic market and also in exports, whereas textiles in 
general, footwear, clothing, these kinds of things are doing relatively 
poorly," said Yoo Jung Ho, a scholar working with the South Korean government's 
Economic Planning Board. "This isn't really surprising, because the industries 
doing well are relatively capital intensive with a higher level of technology, 
whereas clothing and footwear are labor-intensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, Bae said, has seen "steady growth from last year, although 
everything became more luxurious. The bigger cars are selling well, the bigger 
refrigerators are selling well." But this has him worried too: "Consumers 
should recognize this is too big for our economy . . . . I wonder when the 
adjustment is coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in South Korea argue that the economy is already making adjustments 
that will address the concerns raised by Bae. 
</P>
<P>
 With its labor cost advantage gone, the nation is attempting to take advantage 
of the current prosperity to develop technology- driven industries that will 
help it remain competitive with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-governmental Committee on High-Tech Industries, in a report last 
month to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, predicted that by 2005, 
South Korean firms could hold 5.5% of the global market in a variety of 
fast-growing high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
 High-technology industries such as semiconductors, liquid crystal displays, 
industrial robotics and optoelectronics are expected to increase production by 
18% or more each year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 If these growth rates are achieved, South Korean high-technology production in 
2005 would be valued at about $330 billion, or 3.5 times this year's total 
exports of $93 billion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving these goals will require heavy corporate investment, but big firms 
seem willing. Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., for example, has devoted 13% 
of its semiconductor revenue to research and development, said Chang Hong Jo, 
senior vice president in charge of semiconductor research. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations and the government are serious about achieving the targets set 
out in the high-technology report, said Lee Youn Ho, a scholar at the 
Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute. "We have to do it. Without 
achieving this kind of target, we will be a less-developed country forever." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean firms are already having dramatic success in upgrading their 
factories, according to a recent report by Baring Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's 30 largest business groups will invest nearly $19 billion in 
improving factories in the second half of 1994, up 77% from the same period of 
last year, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Japanese firms are struggling just to restore profits after a 
long recession, the report noted, adding: "It is hard to avoid the conclusion 
that, in the years ahead, those Japanese companies who compete head-to-head 
with the Koreans will be facing as difficult and dangerous an opponent as they 
themselves were over the past 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The picture was quite different just a couple years ago. Korean economic 
growth, which sometimes ran at double digits in the 1980s, fell to 4.7% in 
1992, the worst performance since 1980. Then in late 1992, longtime opposition 
leader Kim Young Sam was elected president. Despite his popularity with voters, 
business leaders were worried about his policies, and the economic slowdown 
lingered on for months after he took office in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround came last year when Kim invited about 30 top business leaders 
to one-on-one private meetings at his official residence -- the Blue House -- 
to assure them that the government would support the economy and the private 
sector, said Lee, the Lucky-Goldstar scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He met the owners of the big conglomerates and big companies face-to-face . . 
. and asked them to invest actively," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those meetings, Korean executives said, gave businesses the assurance and 
confidence to move ahead with investments that would stimulate the economy.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; BAKERY TOOK A BEATING BUT RISES AGAIN; GOOD 
STUFF WORKERS BUY FIRM, LOSE SOME BREAD, MAKE PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They've got plenty of crust over at Good Stuff Bakery. Faced last May with 
closure of the 72-year-old business, the workers took substantial pay cuts and 
bought the struggling company. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful gamble for the 350 employees of Good Stuff, which supplies 
bread and rolls to restaurants and institutions. Some of them are still 
uncertain they made the right decision, which will leave the employees owning 
75% of the company in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, the buyout appears to be paying off for Good Stuff's 
well-worn facility north of Dodger Stadium. With six months behind it, Good 
Stuff is making a profit and investing in plant and equipment, said Chief 
Executive Murray Loeterman, an industry veteran brought in by the bakers' union 
to run the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'We're doing good stuff together,' " Loeterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone acknowledges that one thing was clear early this year: Good Stuff was 
crumbling. The debt-laden firm, which recorded nearly $40 million in annual 
revenues, had been laboring under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for nearly 
two years. The owners had filed a plant-closure notice with the state. 
Non-union operators were considering buying the business, which could have 
meant layoffs and deep wage cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a question of alternatives and neither was good," Loeterman said. "To 
close the plant and lose your job or to take a wage cut." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, after many meetings, members of the Bakery, Confectionary and 
Tobacco Workers Union Local 37 and Teamsters Locals 683 and 63, which represent 
most of the Good Stuff employees, agreed to a buyout plan proposed by American 
Capital Strategies, a Bethesda, Md.-based investment banking firm that 
specializes in helping unionized workers buy their companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-million transaction, which closed May 21, was not as high profile as 
last summer's employee purchase of United Airlines, but it worked the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 ACS, brought in by the bakers' unions, advised forming an employee stock 
ownership plan, or ESOP, to buy company stock. An ESOP provides attractive tax 
advantages; it allows a company to shelter income by donating stock to the 
ESOP, said Rick Braun, vice president and a principal in ACS and chairman of 
the board at Good Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, if a company has $1 million in pretax income and is 
taxed at a 40% rate, it will pay $400,000 in taxes. But if the company 
contributes $1 million worth of stock to the ESOP, it pays no taxes. That adds 
to cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, employees end up with 75% of the company after five years and 
ACS and its principals get 25%, although they may sell more stock to the ESOP 
later, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the bankruptcy plan of reorganization, the seller agreed to finance 
the transaction by taking an interest-free $2.5 million note for the company. 
So far, Good Stuff has made all its payments on schedule, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped that the new owners bought only the assets and none of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out with a pretty clean slate," Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers agreed to take pay cuts that were "material," Braun said, although 
he would not say how big they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we got involved, Good Stuff was losing a substantial amount of 
money, mainly because of the debt" and shrinking margins in the baking 
industry, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way of immediately curing the company's ills other than by 
dramatically reducing expenses," he said. "The only viable option in that 
regard was a reduction of employee compensation. You can't go to your 
suppliers, for example, and demand a reduction in the price of flour. You can't 
go to the electric company and demand that they cut your electricity rates." 
</P>
<P>
 That concept remains a hard sell on the bakery floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us that we are an owner, but at the same time we have to wait," 
said baker Jose Monge, who has worked for the company for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good feeling. We've come a long way. But," he said, buttonholing 
CEO Loeterman on a bakery tour, "we have a lot to discuss, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," Loeterman replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult," Loeterman said later. "Initially, it's hard to see past the 
wage cut and I can understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really buying a company on time. It's like buying a layaway present, 
only it's taking five years." 
</P>
<P>
 From midnight until late afternoon there is a steady buzz of people and 
machines at the bakery, which is in Elysian Valley, a collection of homes and 
factories along the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is busy investing in safety measures, equipment and paint -- 
regular maintenance that Loeterman said had been neglected. He recently ordered 
the trimming of a big tree in front of the firm's office only to discover a 
long-forgotten flagpole, tattered flag and a sign proclaiming "Four S Bakery 
Products," the original name of the bakery that is still used on some of its 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Stuff earned about $500,000 in its first six months, but most of that 
will go to pay for smog control filters on oven vents that were ordered long 
ago by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (The aroma of baking 
bread, specifically the ethyl alcohol it contains, contributes to air 
pollution.) 
</P>
<P>
 Good Stuff is working on a business plan to increase its market share, add 
variety and improve the profit margins on its products, Loeterman said. The 
company also intends to expand its tiny retail line, currently is featured at 
Gelson's and Hughes markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But competition is fierce, Loeterman noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bakery industry in general has not been real healthy," he said. "There 
are too many ovens chasing too few customers. And price has always been the 
weapon of choice in the baking industry, which has created a lot of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Management is working on ways to increase employee participation in the 
company and its future direction, Loeterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can lick the internal problems we can be a real factor in this market," 
he said. "We serve customers from the smallest to the largest. Many companies 
don't want to do that. They don't want to sell to the customer that only wants 
$25 or $50 worth of product, but we find that the guy that's real small today 
may be in a different position tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, ACS is talking to other local bakeries interested in setting up 
an ESOP. It closed another deal at Martino's Bakery in Burbank in August, Braun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all very gratifying when it comes together, when you see something 
rising like a Phoenix rising from the ashes," Braun said. "This is a story, at 
its most primal level, of saving jobs, saving 350 jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they had to make concessions . . . but they got to save their jobs."

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most remarkable aspects of the Orange Country financial debacle is 
that so few people saw it coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one newsletter is taking credit for spotting it -- albeit indirectly -- 
along with several other recent news events, including future House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's lobbing of verbal "hand grenades" in the direction of the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based Future News Index, which compiles predictions of business 
and economic trends by monitoring several dozen forecasters who themselves pay 
close attention to astrological developments, claims in its current report that 
it predicted those events by forecasting such things as "geological and 
geopolitical turmoil" and "big moves in the markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Those forecasts, it contends, foreshadowed the recent earthquake aftershocks, 
the guilty plea entered by former Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell, 
Gingrich's fights with the Clinton Administration, and even Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul D. Farrell, president of the forecasting service, said the prediction 
came about with "Jupiter and Pluto both being squared by Mars," which he said 
led to predictions of ripples in the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Future News Index analysis for this week, the Orange County 
bankruptcy filing "was the latest trigger. Ah, the dark side of this bear 
market! Derivatives. Deficits. Debts. All beginning to surface. Biting the 
hands that fed them." Lowering His Expectations 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Brown has discovered the "era of limits" that has long been familiar to 
Californians trying to sell their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The former governor's Pacific Heights spread in San Francisco is on the 
market. And his real estate agent, Florian McGuire Moore, reports that he's 
just lowered the asking price to $1.2 million from $1.4 million. Got a Lovely 
Bunch of Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Hilton owner Merv Griffin is now spinning the wheel of fortune 
in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is paying about $15 million to add the Scottsdale Hilton Resort and 
Spa near Phoenix to his hotel group. The property was put up for sale by 
banking giant Citicorp, along with real estate giant Trammell Crow. Originally 
the lender, Citicorp had become an equity partner as well through a series of 
restructurings. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most real estate assets, the hotel fetched much less than it did the last 
time it changed hands: in the mid-1980s, it went for about $23 million. Pet 
Sounds 
</P>
<P>
 The offbeat seminar business continues to thrive in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent offering by the "Berkeley Psychic Institute of Anaheim" was a "Pet 
Healing and Communication Workshop." 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop brochure asks: "Ever wondered what your pet is thinking? Have you 
known each other before? In this workshop, you will explore these questions and 
more." It further promises attendees will learn "spiritual healing techniques 
that you can use with your pets."

 Appeal Court to Ponder Executive Life: A State Appeal Court in Los Angeles has 
scheduled a three-hour hearing Wednesday on issues growing out of the seizure 
and rehabilitation of the former Executive Life Insurance Co.Among the issues 
to be heard are whether the $3.25-billion sale of Executive Life's 
then-depressed junk-bond portfolio ought to be rescinded. The 1991 sale, to a 
French group led by the Altus Finance unit of Credit Lyonnais bank, has been 
second-guessed ever since because after the junk-bond market revived, the 
portfolio's value has jumped by as much as $2 billion. Some of the failed 
insurer's policyholders argue that a share of those profits belong to them.

 500th Restaurant: Boston Chicken, the rapidly-growing restaurant franchise 
that jumped into the Southern California fast food market in July, will open 
its 500th franchise store in the nation in Brea today. The restaurant, which 
specializes in roasted chicken similar to fare offered by the likes of El Pollo 
Loco and Kentucky Fried Chicken, will be a franchise location operated by 
Boston Pacific, a subsidiary of CKE Restaurants, the Anaheim-based parent 
company of the Carl's Jr. chain, which has had its own competitive troubles in 
the Southland market. Boston Pacific has franchise rights to develop about 300 
new Boston Chicken restaurants in Southern California during the next five 
years.

 Jury Still Out on Spiegel: Jurors in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles today 
will resume deliberations in the criminal case against Thomas Spiegel, former 
chief executive of failed Columbia Savings & Loan.The 46 charges that Spiegel 
faced when the trial began seven weeks ago have been whittled down to just 
three by Judge Robert M. Takasugi. The remaining charges center on Spiegel's 
alleged attempt to profit personally from a 1986 investment that prosecutors 
say should have belonged to Columbia. But Spiegel's defense team portrays the 
case as the result of a "vendetta" by federal regulators who resented Spiegel's 
$9-million 1986 salary, his lavish lifestyle and his aggressive, iconoclastic 
investment style.

 Judge Halts Firm From Ending Retirees' Health Benefits: A federal judge in 
Nashville, Tenn., said Pirelli Armstrong Tire Co. cannot terminate the health 
care benefits of retirees. The United Rubber Workers union sued Pirelli 
Armstrong after the union said the company was terminating retirees' health 
care benefits 90 days after the labor contract expired July 15."The court finds 
that the defendants did not have the right . . . to terminate the retirees' 
benefits unilaterally," U.S. District Judge John T. Nixon wrote in his order. 
Pirelli said during the weeklong trial that the $30 million a year it was 
paying in retirees' health care benefits was draining the company financially. 
The ruling affects about 3,200 retirees and surviving spouses of retirees who 
have died.

 Flight Schedules Shuffled in Wake of Icy Flying Ban: American, Continental and 
Trans World airlines suspended some commuter flights to comply with a 
government ban on flying European-made ATR aircraft in icy weather. AMR Corp.'s 
American Eagle unit, the largest operator of ATR aircraft in the country, 
temporarily canceled all operations into and out of Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport.It plans to restore service in two steps, beginning Dec. 
15. TWA's Trans World Express Inc. canceled all ATR service at New York City's 
John F. Kennedy airport for 72 hours. Continental has canceled some ATR flights 
out of Newark, N.J., including service to Providence, R.I. The cancellations 
follow the ban issued Friday by the Federal Aviation Administration. The ATR is 
the type of plane involved in the Oct. 31 crash of an American Eagle flight in 
Indiana in which all 68 passengers were killed.

 Intel Working on Fix for Pentium Bug: The Santa Clara-based microchip 
manufacturer has called together a group of industry experts to work on a 
software patch that will circumvent the flaw in its popular Pentium chip, the

numerous decimal places in the solution, has been a public relations disaster 
for Intel. The patch will likely be available by year-end.

 Ameritech Tries to Sell Plan to Justice Department: Attempting to win an 
endorsement from federal antitrust enforcers, Ameritech Corp. has offered to 
temporarily scale back its plan to get into the long-distance business, 
proposing a limited trial in the Chicago area, an executive said.If approved by 
a federal judge, Ameritech would be the first regional Bell company to provide 
long-distance service, an experiment that would cover roughly 8 million people 
and be closely watched by other Bells that are clamoring to get a piece of the 
$60-billion-a-year business. Ameritech wants the Department of Justice to back 
its plan before the court. The department is reviewing the plan and appeared 
receptive, Ameritech General Counsel Tom Hester said.

 GM Cuts 30,000 Vehicles From Production Forecast: Affecting fourth-quarter 
production in North America, the reduction was larger than many Wall Street 
observers expected and prompted analysts to trim their earnings estimates for 
the giant auto maker and predict more difficult times ahead for General Motors 
Corp. GM stock lost 37.5 cents per share Friday, closing at $37 1/4 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Since September, GM's stock has fallen by more than a 
quarter amid growing concern about the auto maker's ability to cash in on the 
current auto sales boom.

PACT SHOULD BENEFIT BIG INDUSTRIES IN STATE; SUMMIT: GAINS IN TECHNOLOGY TRADE 
EXPECTED, BUT AGRICULTURE COULD SUFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's high-technology, energy and medical industries should be big 
winners if hemispheric free trade agreement set in motion Sunday by President 
Clinton and 33 other leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Miami comes to 
pass, but the states' agricultural and manufacturing sectors might be among the 
losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the proposed agreement, which would eliminate tariffs and 
other barriers to trade among all the nation's of North and South America, 
would generally benefit U.S. industries that enjoy a clear technological 
advantage: Semiconductor makers and software companies would likely see huge 
markets opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Any expansion of trade engendered by a new free-trade deal would also benefit 
the state's transportation industry, notably its ports. Santa Fe Pacific Corp., 
for example, said its port facilities in San Diego and Los Angeles would see a 
significant increase in ship container traffic from hemispheric free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But industries that depend on low-cost, unskilled labor are in jeopardy, 
because there is no way they can compete with farms and factories staffed by 
impoverished Latin American workers, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although any hemispheric free-trade deal is at least a decade away, 
California's economy could feel the pinch much sooner if Chile gains quick 
admission to the North American Free Trade Agreement, as proposed on Sunday. 
Chile is a big producer of table grapes and wine, which, if allowed to enter 
duty-free, could cause economic dyspepsia for the state's vintners and growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grape, avocado and tree crops growers -- those are some at-risk areas," said 
Ross Starr, a UC San Diego economics professor. The state's citrus industry, 
for one, would face increased pressure from Brazil, whose massive orange juice 
concentrate industry now has only limited access to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 California could also face major problems as a result of the recent passage of 
Prop. 187, according Peter H. Smith, a political science professor and director 
of Latin American studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition, designed to deny illegal immigrants access to education and 
health care services, has created the perception among many South American 
nations that "California is hostile to Latin America," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake to think that Prop. 187 is only going to affect our 
relationship with Mexico," Smith added. "Although the law may be tied up in 
court, the political damage has been done." 
</P>
<P>
 A Western Hemisphere free-trade zone would differ from other trading blocs 
such as the European Union in that it would join countries at very different 
levels of economic development, Starr said. "The danger in such an agreement is 
that we put at risk the wage levels of low-skilled American workers.". 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Lustig, senior fellow for policy studies at Brookings Institution in 
Washington, D.C., said the benefits of increased trade go beyond considerations 
of winners and losers and provides a "net gain overall" that benefits everyone, 
as evidenced by better-than-projected gains of member countries of the European 
Union and NAFTA.

 PUC Sets Date for Decision on Electric Deregulation: The California Public 
Utilities Commission has adopted a new schedule for restructuring the state's 
electric utility industry, an attempt to lower power bills in the state.The PUC 
had earlier expected to settle on a new regulatory structure in 1994, with a 
competitive market for the largest power users to begin Jan. 1, 1996. But since 
last April, various plans have been debated in a lengthy series of commission 
hearings. The PUC now plans to issue a revised proposal on March 22, 1995, with 
final adoption in September. The commissioners left a start date undecided, but 
few observers now expect deregulation to begin by January, 1996.

HOT JOBS: SOME DAYS, FLORAL BUSINESS CAN BE A BED OF ROSES

 Kathy Lyon's start in floral design began shortly after she began dating Jim 
Lyon, who owned a flower shop, Artistic Florists in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working in a bank, but I helped Jim out at the shop," she said. Lyon 
made it her full-time occupation, she said, because she enjoys making people 
happy. "I get calls all the time from customers" complimenting her on her 
designs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon also said she appreciates the generally relaxing atmosphere of the shop. 
Unfortunately, the nature of the floral business is such that it produces 
extremely busy days followed by incredibly quiet ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, the Lyons expect to work through the 
night. Fridays can also be grueling when they have several weekend weddings for 
which to prepare. Since the flowers must be fresh, a florist cannot put its 
arrangements together ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit with surprises quite often, the couple have learned to be flexible with 
their schedules. Customers often want orders made up and delivered immediately, 
such as when babies are born or companies get surprise visits from clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inherent difficulties, the Lyons said it is a pleasant, 
well-paying business. Floral designers can make up to $20 per hour. Many 
designers, once they have established a reputation, eventually set up their own 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "garage designers," who usually only design for events such as 
weddings, are a source of real competition to retail florists, according to the 
Lyons. OCCUPATION: FLORAL DESIGNER 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Floral designers take orders for flowers, select flowers 
for customers and makes the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most floral designers start by working in another capacity 
at a flower shop and work their way up. Some have taken courses in flower 
arranging. They must be able to demonstrate creativity in designing while 
working at a speedy pace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1988, the number of floral designers in the county is projected 
to increase by 11.1% to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Floral designers earn $10 to $20 per hour working in a floral 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Most designers enjoy the creative aspect of their work and working 
with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: The hours are long during holiday periods. Also, customers are often 
in a hurry, so the designers have to be quick to satisfy their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Many designers establish their own floral shops or start an 
independent businesses arranging flowers for special events. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "It is a fun business to be in, but a designer has to be someone who 
can organize her day and then be flexible enough to reorganize it as orders 
come in. Customers call and want their order that day."

BRIDGING GAPS WITH ART, PHILOSOPHY; TRADE: O.C. LAWYER SAYS BUDDHIST IDEOLOGY, 
LOVE OF ASIAN ART HAS HELPED HIM IN BUSINESS, PERSONAL LIFE.

 Two years ago, James A. Davidson's biggest problem was trying to break through 
ethnic and cultural barriers to do business in China and Vietnam. Not only has 
the international lawyer overcome the barriers, but he now sits on the board of 
directors of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said he has still not mastered an Asian language, but has come to 
appreciate the culture of his Asian clients. Chinese art and artifacts 
scattered about his Newport Beach office serve as testimony. He speaks 
carefully and contemplatively about the evolution of Buddhist thought and 
practice as it has traveled eastward from India to China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not a Buddhist, Davidson, 51, embraces much of the Buddhist ideology, 
which he says has helped him in his business as well as personal life. "Through 
understanding Buddhism I have come to understand to control my desire for 
things because that can hurt you to have too many expectations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson is founder and principal of the law firm of James A. Davidson & 
Associates Inc., which advises businesses on import-export matters. He is 
president of Overseas Investment Brokers Inc., which acts as a broker between 
companies looking for joint venture partners abroad. And in the true spirit of 
entrepreneurship, he founded his third business, Research Investment and 
Management Inc., earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the companies offer his clients a package deal on the legality of 
certain international transactions, marketing research and financing of 
international ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important lesson Davidson said he learned from Buddhism was to be 
patient. "So many American companies have a difficult time understanding that 
business relationships in places like China are developed over the long term," 
he said. "Americans just want to get in, turn a quick profit, and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said he has found that developing business relationships between 
companies in the United States that want contracts in China and Vietnam has not 
been easy. Since establishing Overseas Investment Brokers in 1992, Davidson has 
completed two joint ventures in China. The first was a $2-million contract to 
supply kitchen equipment as part of a home building project. The second was a 
medical surgical equipment deal valued at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Local trade experts said that finishing two joint ventures in two years is 
actually a better-than-respectable pace. "Two in two years is great," said 
Susan Thomas, president of Anaheim Hills-based Export Associates. "Negotiating 
these deals takes a long time because it is a new market and there are a lot of 
contacts to be made and groundwork to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said he is working to find joint venture partners for three other 
projects -- a $1-billion oil refinery in China and a refinery and a cement 
factory in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem has been to get American companies to understand that 
doing business in Asia is substantially different from doing business in the 
United States. Davidson said he also did not anticipate the increasing 
political problems that have made his clients in this area doubt the wisdom of 
getting involved in Vietnam, which had its trade embargo lifted in February by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite warming relations between Washington and Hanoi, Orange County's 
Vietnamese community loudly protested a trade mission to Vietnam in September 
that was organized by the Asian Business League of California and the local 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. Davidson said he did not attend the trip 
because he was busy organizing a seminar on international business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue over whether to do business with the Communist government has 
divided the local Vietnamese community and caused many of Davidson's clients to 
reconsider their plans. "People are nervous about even looking at business 
there now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson is unshaken. Though Orange County's Vietnamese community is divided 
over trading with Vietnam, businesses in other countries are eager to get a 
foot in the door there. And being an officer of the Vietnamese chamber should 
be an asset for the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are well known in Vietnam for the position we take about promoting 
business in Vietnam," said Dr. Co Pham, chamber president. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said that what Davidson may lack by not being Vietnamese can be 
compensated for by his involvement on the chamber's board, because establishing 
business deals in Vietnam requires having contacts there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, overcoming emotional and political resistance to doing business in 
China and Vietnam has been the greatest challenges to bringing American 
businesses together with opportunities there, Davidson said. 
</P>

 In fact, to complete his latest joint venture project -- construction of a 
$1.2-billion oil refinery in the Shenzhen province of China -- Davidson said he

 His American clients, he said, were surprised to discover that most of the 
joint venture arrangements placed the majority of the financial risk on Western 
investors, who had expected joint venture partners to share the risk.

 "What they supply are the resources -- inexpensive labor, land -- and what

 The learning curve for most companies beginning to do business in these Asian

worth $17.6 billion in November, up 23.6% over the year-ago period, the State 
Statistics Office reports. The November expansion of industrial production 
compared with the 24.3% year-on-year growth rate recorded for October. Total 
output in the first 11 months of the year was up 17.9% over the same period for 
1993, the bureau said.

 Japan Is Gradually Coming Out of Recession: It may achieve gross domestic 
product growth of slightly more than 1.0% in 1994, according to an Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development annual report.Japan's GDP will 
probably grow about 2.5% in 1995, the report said, given that the recent income 
tax cuts will be extended next year. Consumer spending is leading the rebound, 
and private capital investment will probably resume growth in 1995. But the 
recovery isn't expected to bring a return to the higher growth rates of the 
1980s, when Japan averaged about 4% growth each year.

INVESTORS WOULD DO WELL TO CONSIDER BOND SWAPS; STRATEGY: AN INTEREST RATE 
DEVALUED BOND IS REPLACED WITH ONE WITH A HIGHER COUPON RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even those who study the U.S. Tax Code only on the evening of April 14 know 
that the best investment provides a write-off without actually losing value. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying a house can be such an investment, since homeowners are allowed to 
deduct mortgage interest costs even as the house itself appreciates in value. 
But the Internal Revenue Service is seldom that generous in other investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But bondholders would do well to consider a "bond swap," a once ordinary tax 
strategy made extraordinary by a cranky bond market and potentially lower 
capital gains taxes in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bond swap, an investor replaces a bond that has lost value amid rising 
interest rates with one that's comparably priced but pays out more money each 
year because it has a higher coupon rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old strategy but we've just experienced the worst bond market in 
about seven decades," said Mark Bell, an independent financial planner in 
Chicago. "So a lot of people are sitting with losses inside their portfolios." 
</P>
<P>
 Any bond showing a paper loss of at least a few thousand dollars may be a good 
candidate for a swap, according to financial planners. And while bond swaps 
aren't just for experts, the advice of one is always wise when decoding IRS 
rules. (For example, if one of your devalued bonds is part of the troubled 
Orange County debt, you might want to wait.) 
</P>
<P>
 Say you bought $10,000 of 30-year bonds with a 6% coupon five years ago and 
new 30-year bonds have a 7% coupon. You could sell the old bonds for $8,600 and 
write off the $1,400 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in a combined 37.4% federal and state tax bracket, you would save 
$524 in taxes, so your actual loss would be $876, said Linda Valentic, a 
financial planner in Walnut Creek. The new bonds would bring $100 a year more 
in income and recoup the loss within nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a swap, bondholders are allowed to do what stockholders only dream about: 
Sell a poorly performing investment for the tax loss and buy it back, hoping it 
will perform better in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Swapping a bond for one with a higher coupon guarantees a better rate and, 
while the IRS won't give the break if bondholders repurchase the exact same 
security, you can get around buyback rules by swapping for one that is similar 
in character and price. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the Republicans are more likely to lower capital gains taxes 
now that they hold the majority in Congress, "it makes sense to use swaps this 
year, because next year it won't be as valuable," said Loren Hansen of Northern 
Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaps also let investors anticipate interest rate changes. Since 
longer-maturing bonds typically yield more than shorter-maturing bonds, 
investors who expect rates to fall can swap out of short-term bonds to lock in 
higher yields or swap into shorter maturities if they expect rates will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 When pondering a bond swap, investors also have to consider the rate at which 
their personal income is taxed, since that determines how much savings a tax 
loss would bring. If you're in the highest 1994 federal tax bracket, lowering 
the amount of your income that's taxed at 39.6% would bring more savings than 
for someone whose income is taxed at a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can get rid of a poor-performing bond, improve your overall return and 
get a tax break, then there is incentive to make the change," said Valentic, 
who also warns, "If you have to lose a dollar to save 28 cents, it's not a 
smart way to build wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other potential pitfalls in swapping bonds, one of which results 
directly from the strategy's popularity. Because tax selling has depressed bond 
prices, swaps are becoming less attractive to prospective sellers, said 
financial planner Joel Isaacson, who is holding off swaps for now.

3 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ORANGE COUNTY EXPECT CASH CRISIS; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY WILL RUN OUT OF MONEY BY MARCH IF DENIED ACCESS TO FROZEN FUNDS. 
COUNTY WARNS THAT THOUSANDS MAY NOT GET PAID AFTER CHRISTMAS. 
</P>

<P>
 Less than a week after Orange County filed for bankruptcy, top officials from 
three county school districts said Sunday that they will run out of money by 
March at the latest unless they can withdraw cash from the now-frozen county 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Department of Education also has warned local superintendents 
that, despite repeated promises that payroll demands would be met, it has no 
guarantee that thousands of teachers and other school employees will receive 
paychecks a week after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said aftershocks from the financial crisis will affect 
students in the next several months, possibly forcing the state to step in and 
pay local school bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has told us nothing," said Peter Hartman, superintendent of 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District, which along with Capistrano Unified 
and Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified school districts, face the looming financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line for us is even if we get access to all our property taxes and 
state aid and federal aid," he said, "it will not be enough to keep our schools 
open through the spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes -- the county's new financial adviser 
-- said in an interview Sunday that he and a team from the Salomon Bros. 
investment firm have been working around the clock to protect what's left in 
the county's portfolio. The fund has lost $1.5 billion to $2 billion in value, 
sources close to the restructuring effort confirmed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to systematically and thoroughly re-evaluate the situation and 
the value of the portfolio, then execute a plan of action that preserves as 
much as can," Hayes said. "I don't want to tip my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson announced that he is sending state Auditor General Kurt 
Sjoberg to Orange County to help sort out the financial crisis. A team of state 
auditors is expected to arrive in Orange County today to review all activities 
in the fund since July, 1994, and audits from three previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investment bankers analyzing the portfolio say last week's sales of 
collateral by the county's lenders consumed many of the easiest-to-sell 
securities. That leaves the county holding a higher proportion of complex 
securities that aren't as easily sold; the residual portfolio is also 
especially exposed to changes in interest rates -- an exposure the bankers will 
labor to diffuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment banking sources also said that a lack of crucial documentation 
of the fund's administrative structure is creating a major obstacle to deciding 
how to apportion losses or income among the fund's investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned Dec. 5, has 
offered to help auditors decipher his investment records, according to his 
lawyer. "We'd be more than happy to cooperate with the county and its counsel 
in any way necessary to help," said attorney David Weichert. But county sources 
said Citron earlier rebuffed an effort to gain his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Transportation Authority board will unveil a plan today to 
keep the county's buses, rail services and construction contracts running for 
the next 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * A longtime county government critic is calling for the Board of Supervisors 
to follow Citron's lead and resign. Tom Rogers, a member of a county taxpayers 
association, said of board members, "they're done, they're dead, they're 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who said he has been deluged with calls from others who feel the same, 
said, "I think they are more responsible than he (Citron) is. Ultimately, they 
are the stewards of the county's assets." No Federal Help Seen 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the county shouldn't 
count on a federal bailout. On ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," he said 
state and local governments are responsible for solving crises such as the one 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up to them to do a better job of risk management," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, who spent the weekend in Sacramento, where he lives, would not say 
whether the state was at fault for giving Orange County too much investment 
authority. He also would not say whether the state should do something to help 
bail out the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the power of local government to invest public funds clearly needs 
to be limited in the wake of the Orange County bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a complete re-evaluation is in order," said Hayes, who is on a 90-day 
leave from his job as president of Metropolitan West Securities, which has 
offices in Sacramento and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he had to be careful about disclosing his strategy for the 
portfolio because "the things I say can move the market." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the first goal is to protect the remainder of the fund, putting it 
in much less risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has been much more aggressive in its investments than the state 
of California, and as a result, they have higher bubbles of risks," he said. 
"As interest rates have gone up, the value of the underlying assets have gone 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he was not in position to say whether the ultimate losses will be 
greater than the $2 billion that is now being cited. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not put a timetable on the restructuring, but he said that he would 
be "proactive" in alerting the public when decisions are reached. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hayes' urging, Gov. Wilson also is sending the state auditor general here 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg and a team of his auditors -- charged with reviewing expenditures, 
income and current fund balances -- will arrive today to help determine the 
shape of the county's current finances while Hayes continues to examine its 
investments, said H. D. Palmer, assistant director of the state's Department of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as Tom (Hayes) is trying to get a clear picture of the county's 
investment funds, Kurt's team will look at the operational side," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg's role will be to focus on simple accounting questions, such as 
whether the county has enough money to pay its bills, while Hayes continues to 
try to untangle the complexities of Orange County's investment practices, the 
governor's office said. Tougher Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's action comes as several state legislators began issuing calls for 
tightening up investment guidelines for municipalities, at least bringing them 
in line with more conservative rules the state is required to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Sjoberg released Sunday, Wilson asked the state auditor to 
report back to the governor as he runs across significant findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the immediate implications for the citizens of Orange County as 
well as implications relative to the state of California's credit rating, I am 
requesting that you immediately make information available to the Legislature, 
myself, and the public as you reach your incremental conclusions," Wilson 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg's review will include an examination of fiscal practices as of June 
30, 1994 -- the start of the current fiscal year -- as well as all audits 
conducted over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett Wieder first reacted with anger when a reporter told her 
that Wilson asked the state's auditor to review Orange County's financial 
records. She questioned whether the effort would duplicate the work already 
accomplished by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't need are any more searches into the treasurer's finances; that 
is what happened 10 days ago when the SEC spent hours and doing the same 
thing," Wieder said. "Why spend all this extra time and money and it sounds 
like the same thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder also asked why she had not been informed of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were one of (Wilson's) best friends; aren't we his family?" 
Weider asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wieder later softened her stance. After conferring with Supervisor William 
G. Steiner, Wieder said the move may have been part of the help Wilson had 
promised earlier in the form of financial experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Several supervisors said they were also concerned about reports that Citron's 
records are in disarray. Wieder said the county might need Citron to figure it 
all out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it could probably be helpful since it seems no one else touched those 
things except him," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to a source close to the county's rescue effort, Salomon 
Brothers is having problems such as finding Acting Treasurer Matt Raabe's home 
phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors gave assurances Sunday that schools would be first in line for 
available dollars. And Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said 
the teachers will be paid.

 "To the best of my knowledge, no one has told the schools that the county will 
cut off their payroll Jan. 3," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that in the worst case, the state would be required by law to 
keep schools open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state must provide the education," said John F. Dean, the county's school 
superintendent. "It must keep the schools open. And keeping them open means 
paying the bills." Funding for Schools in County Still Murky 
</P>
<P>
 School superintendents for the first time Sunday demonstrated fears that by 
spring, they will run out of money to operate their schools and have been given 
no guarantees that millions of dollars deposited with the county will be 
available to pay expenses ranging from medical bills to the light bill.

 "People say we like you and want to help you. But you need something you can

 As public school employees face an uncertain Christmas, county transportation 
officials are tackling the next 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting today, the Orange County Transportation Authority board will 
get a plan to keep the county's public transportation moving for the next three 
months, said Stan Oftelie, chief operating officer of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that they have identified funds that will enable them to 
continue with main freeway interchange projects now under construction, and 
will be able to keep buses and Metrolink services operating. Oftelie would not 
give details of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business plan on how we plan to move forward," Oftelie said Sunday. 
"We have operated on the scenario that we won't get money for 100 days." 
Montebello Mapping Out Its Legal Options 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Sunday, city officials in Montebello, which has $47 million invested 
in the Orange County pool, spent 3 1/2 hours behind closed doors mapping legal 
strategy with lawyers from the Los Angeles law firm of Clark & Trevithick. City 
officials stressed they are not planning to follow Orange County into 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chapter 9 bankruptcy is not being contemplated whatsoever," City 
Administrator Richard Torres said in a prepared statement. "This alternative 
has been deemed unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello's most pressing problem is finding $25 million for a six-month 
note, due Dec. 30 and secured by city tax revenue. The city floated the bond 
specifically to invest in the Orange County pool and was counting on 
withdrawing money from the fund to cover the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's stake in the Orange County pool is bigger than its operating budget 
for the entire fiscal year and represents 60% of the city's total investment 
portfolio. The city was projecting $1.9 million in earnings this year from the 
Orange County fund, with half payable this week. But that revenue now appears 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are "making every attempt" to prod Orange County into 
releasing at least some of the city's investment fund. "They're aware of our 
immediate cash-flow needs, but they haven't really said very much," Torres 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber and Lynch reported from Orange County; Craft reported from Sacramento. 
Times staff writers Ken Ellingwood, Susan Marquez Owen, Greg Hernandez and 
Michael A. Hiltzik also contributed to this report, as did Times Sacramento 
bureau chief George Skelton.

 A number of Orange County governmental agencies face imminent deadlines for 
making payments on their debt but may have trouble because money is tied up in 
the county investment fund. A list of those agencies most immediately at risk 
of defaulting -- with little time before December or early January deadlines 
for making bond payments -- was released Sunday night by Moody's Investors 
Service, a Wall Street credit rating agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to find out what kind of sources they are going to use to make the 
payments," said Howard Mischel, a managing director with Moody's. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 19 bond issues that have payments due in the next three weeks, first up 
is the city of Anaheim, which is slated to retire a $2.5-million note issue on 
Thursday, Mischel said. City officials assured Moody's that they will make the 
payment by drawing upon other city funds.

FAA MUST STRIKE BALANCE BETWEEN SAFETY, COST ISSUES; AVIATION: AGENCY HAS TO 
JUSTIFY RULES THAT MAY BURDEN AIRLINES. CRITICS SAY ECONOMICS CARRY TOO MUCH 
WEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Federal Aviation Administration decides whether to toughen airline 
safety regulations, the agency faces a dilemma: It must weigh the cost of 
proposed reforms against the value of human lives lost if nothing is done. 
</P>
<P>
 A life, the government calculates, is worth $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, records show, the FAA passed a regulation in 1992 requiring 
low-altitude warning systems in commuter airplanes, but only after agency 
officials determined that failing to act would cost $95.1 million in lives and 
property -- far more than the $29 million for the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rule finally took effect in April, 126 people had died in accidents 
that the FAA acknowledged may have been prevented by the safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system kind of stinks," said Vinnie Mendolia of Medford, Ore., whose 
brother, Richard, died in one such crash in 1989. "Too bad something has to go 
wrong and people have to die" before regulations are changed. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-month Times review of government documents and scores of interviews 
with air safety officials sheds light on a question hundreds of relatives of 
airplane crash victims and frustrated air safety investigators have asked: 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it sometimes take disaster or the passage of years to get federal air 
regulators to take meaningful action? 
</P>
<P>
 Like the causes of airplane crashes themselves, the answer is complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It is rooted partly in the conflicted nature of the FAA. Serving two masters, 
the agency is charged with nurturing the aviation industry while ensuring the 
safety of the flying public. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA must balance safety against the cost to airlines, manufacturers and 
others whenever it considers changes in safety and equipment regulations. The 
result, according to records and interviews, can be delays in addressing safety 
problems -- and more accidents related to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several fixes on the shelf that did not come off the shelf until 
the second accident, or sometimes the third," said Ira J. Furman, a New York 
attorney who has worked for the National Transportation Safety Board and 
testified before Congress on aviation safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wondered why it wasn't available beforehand. And the answer . . . is 
there are cost-benefit analyses being done all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA's harshest critics don't for a minute believe that the agency 
knowingly waits for an accident to happen. But because the FAA must justify 
changes that require expenditures by the aviation industry, the agency 
sometimes must use past accidents to help make its case. 
</P>
<P>
 And once the agency decides to make safety-related changes, it can take years 
before new rules take effect, in part because the agency must consider the 
ramifications on the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David Hinson said every government agency is required by law 
to justify rules changes that cause financial burdens to government or private 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest that the practice almost requires accidents is "a bit of an 
exaggeration," Hinson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a way for Congress to ensure" that industry isn't "unfairly . . . 
burdened. . . . But we don't compromise safety at any cost that I'm aware of." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's this impression that the FAA stands around, waits for 
accidents to happen and then acts," Hinson said. "Nothing could be further from 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB's Barry M. Sweedler, director of safety recommendations, said the FAA 
has an easier time pushing through safety regulations, particularly those that 
are costly to the industry, when it can justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to go forward to change rules that they can't show a cost-benefit 
for, it's very tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is illustrated by the FAA's handling of a critical safety issue on 
commuter planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA had recognized the benefits of installing "ground proximity warning 
systems" since the mid-1970s when it required their installation on commercial 
jets. The devices verbally warn a pilot if the plane is too close to 
mountainsides or other terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying a series of crashes in the early and mid-1980s, the NTSB on 
Oct. 9, 1986, released a study, saying it was convinced that three recent 
commuter plane accidents that killed 25 people likely would not have happened 
if the aircraft had been equipped with ground proximity warning systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The study noted that commercial airline crashes involving "controlled flight 
into terrain" dropped 75% once the FAA required the altitude devices. The NTSB 
recommended that all turbine-powered airplanes that carry 10 or more passengers 
be required to have one on board. 
</P>
<P>
 But, records show, the FAA and some in the commuter airline industry, while 
acknowledging the life-saving merits of the devices, opposed them, questioning 
whether the cost, at roughly $14,000 apiece, was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents continued. On Jan. 19, 1988, a Fairchild Metro Twin commuter plane 
crashed into a ridge in Durango, Colo. Nine of the 17 people aboard died. A 
month later, a Fairchild Metro III crashed in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., killing 12. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal FAA memorandum dated September, 1988, said 60 of 280 commuter 
airline crashes between 1972 and 1985 may have been avoided with ground 
proximity warning systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "When averaged out over 14 years," the memo said, "this amounts to 
approximately four accidents per year. These 60 accidents accounted for 141 
fatalities." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, at the FAA's request, the Department of Transportation studied 41 
accidents that occurred between 1970 and 1988, concluding that two-thirds of 
them could have been prevented if the planes had had ground proximity warning 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on April 24, 1990, the FAA announced its intent to pursue a rule 
change that would require the installation of altitude warning systems in 
commuter planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year the agency did a cost-benefit analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices would save 56 lives a year at $1.5 million each -- the estimated 
value of a human life at that time -- and would prevent seven injuries at $4.5 
million a year and salvage 16 airplanes worth $6.6 million, according to an FAA 
memo dated March 4, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Total benefit: $95.1 million, nearly $70 million more than the cost of 
requiring the devices on the more than 800 airplanes that would be covered by 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Some airlines requested that the FAA require a cheaper version of the device, 
but the FAA refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA did, however, give the industry two years to comply; in the meantime, 
more accidents happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the FAA, officials recognized the deadly cost of more delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every six months we delay GPWS, we can expect an accident," said one 
official in a 1992 memo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four months before the deadline, Northwest Airlink Flight 5719 crashed in 
Hibbing, Minn, killing 18 people. The NTSB concluded: "This accident, like many 
others, could have been prevented." 
</P>
<P>
 "To lose a son is a terrible thing," said Leonard Falitz, whose son, Marvin, 
died in the Minnesota crash. "There were times when I woke up in the middle of 
the night and went through the flight recorder, every word, every detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Another parent, Dolores Shue, still remembers a day in September, 1985, when 
the phone rang and the official-sounding voice on the other end of the line 
said he was sorry, but he had some terrible news: The plane carrying her son, 
Larry, and 13 others had gone down and, in all likelihood, Larry was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she would learn something nearly as tragic: A ground proximity warning 
device could have prevented the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no good way to learn that" your child has died in a plane crash, 
Dolores Shue said. "I just couldn't believe it. I wasn't crying. I just stood 
in the middle of my living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed like one of those eternal people to us." 
</P>
<P>
 In their last conversation, Dolores Shue spoke to her son, a writer, about the 
upcoming Chicago opening of his successful play, "The Foreigner," and about the 
sitcom pilot he was writing for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The first indication that something was wrong came at 6 p.m. when a Henson 
Airlines official telephoned. "She asked me if there was someone there with me. 
. . . I said: 'Don't tell me there was an accident.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter plane had smashed into the side of a mountain in Virginia's 
Shenandoah Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Shue's wake took place the same day his play was scheduled to open in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Critics say that the FAA, in seeking changes in regulations, depends too 
heavily on accidents that have already occurred. The reason, they say, is that 
in a climate of public outrage over a serious accident, it is easier to push 
reforms through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.) said a heavy reliance on past accidents is 
built into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA "are people who are very high-minded, very committed to safety, but 
then they are told: 'You've got to spend the time doing these analyses,' " said 
Oberstar, the outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Public Works and 
Transportation's subcommittee on aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you get through this, it can be months and years." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the FAA can act, records show, the agency calculates how a proposed 
safety rule will affect the aviation industry -- everything from the public 
perceptions of a specific company or industry to the economic impact. Critics 
feel that sometimes safety takes a second seat to economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, when the agency pondered whether to adopt measures to 
prevent accidents caused by potentially deadly wake turbulence from Boeing 757 
jetliners, FAA officials were concerned about economic health of the Boeing 
Co., internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 In internal memos, they expressed concern about what effect any new safety 
measures would have on sales of the popular jetliner. They analyzed the pros 
and cons of taking action on the turbulence issue. "Boeing's perception" among 
the public was one of the cons listed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two accidents linked to B-757 wake turbulence had already happened, killing 13 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, you can't make safety recommendations in a vacuum," said former 
NTSB Chairman James E. Burnett Jr. "But weighed against human life, (a 
company's) image ought not to have much weight." 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent, if subtler example: The FAA earlier this month called a news 
conference to say that ATR regional aircraft are safe. It followed the Oct. 31 
crash of an American Eagle ATR-72 that killed 68 people in Roselawn, Ind. The 
FAA specifically declared that the planes were safe -- an assurance that some 
observers believed went too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday -- a week after the FAA held the news conference to reassure the public 
that ATR commuter planes were safe -- the agency ordered regional airlines not 
to fly the planes in icy weather. Ice has been a prime suspect in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they ought to be saying is: 'This airplane is complying with the full 
extent of regulations,' " said one aviation safety source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "They declared the aircraft safe. That's not what a 
government regulatory agency should say. In effect, they're a booster for the 
airlines." 
</P>
<P>
 A close relationship between the FAA and the industry is a natural one, given 
the agency's mandate to foster air travel. But critics say that it sometimes 
impedes safety decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 After investigating a 1988 non-fatal accident in Dallas involving a DC-10, air 
safety investigators determined that the brakes on DC-10s were inadequate to 
stop the airplanes during an aborted takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Burnett said, "the FAA was slow to admit there was a problem. That's 
because the people at the FAA had been involved in the certification of this 
aircraft years ago. Admitting there was something wrong now meant they had made 
a mistake the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another example: In 1985, an Eastern Airlines L1011 had to make an emergency 
landing in Miami shortly after takeoff. An investigation showed that the 
airline had a problem with missing O-rings on engines in its L1011s that caused 
seven forced landings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing, the FAA said it had been aware of the problem prior to the 
incident. Officials acknowledged that they relied on a phone call to Eastern's 
vice president to remedy the problem and had not checked his maintenance 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vice presidents don't put on O-rings," Burnett said curtly. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Burnett later said: "The FAA says it has an arm's length 
relationship with industry, but the question is whether it should be just an 
arm's length." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials say their relationship with the airlines and manufacturers is 
proper and healthy, and both are working together to make flying even safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chiames, spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., said: "They are our 
regulators. We have a working relationship with them. Sometimes it's a good 
relationship; sometimes we are at odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "To suggest anything other than that it is a working relationship is 
incorrect. There are plenty of times we feel the FAA oversteps its regulatory 
authority in imposing requirements on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiames defended the FAA's record on safety issues. "What is the (safety) 
record of the industry the FAA regulates? It's the best in the world. Can it be 
better? We want it to." 
</P>
<P>
 In other instances, safety issues at the FAA -- a bureaucracy with 50,000 
employees and a budget nearly equivalent to the state of Alabama's -- have 
simply fallen through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent fatal accident involved one of the FAA's own planes -- a Beechcraft 
Super King Air 300 that crashed into a mountain in October, 1993, in Virginia, 
killing three people. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB determined that pilot error was the chief reason for the crash, but 
the safety board, in a wider investigation, also found some disturbing lapses 
in the way the FAA runs its fleet of 50 planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many planes were missing critical safety equipment, such as cockpit voice 
recorders and ground proximity warning systems, the safety board said. The 
agency had no approved manuals for maintenance procedures and flight 
operations, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar problems were identified by the FAA itself after a 1988 accident that 
destroyed a Rockwell Jet Commander operated by the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB cited failure of the FAA hierarchy "to properly recognize and resolve 
problems within the flight inspection program" of their own agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems, the NTSB said, were not corrected because "management action 
was ineffective, and oversight by senior executives was insufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 "This business of their own flying operations -- they made promises, they said 
they would clean it up and they didn't," one air safety investigator said. 
"Their own audits had pointed it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said the agency doesn't always agree with the accident findings of the 
NTSB, which is responsible for making safety recommendations following crashes. 
FAA has vowed, however, to scrutinize the procedures it uses for its own fleet 
to prevent future accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: How the FAA is addressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Sheila A. Kern and special correspondent Shelby Grad 
contributed to this report. How the Study Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 To complete this report, The Times reviewed about 20,000 pages of internal 
documents obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration through the Freedom 
of Information Act. The newspaper also reviewed a computer analysis of the 
causes of airplane crashes between 1983 and last July by the National 
Transportation Safety Board. The Times also studied dozens of reports by 
government oversight agencies and interviewed scores of present and past FAA 
officials, airline industry sources, aviation safety experts, members of 
Congress, crash survivors and the families of crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Slow Response to Low-Altitude Crashes 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration officials say at least 60 crashes killing more

with ground proximity warning systems. However, it took numerous reports and 
several years for the FAA to require such alarms.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Small Problem Took Years to Fix 
</P>
<P>
 At least seven accidents during the last 15 years have been attributed in part 
to a carburetor defect in Cessna aircraft. The part, known as a two-piece 
venturi, is supposed to moderate fuel and air mixture. Instead, it would 
inexplicably break, causing the engine to run roughly or quit. In the face of 
accidents and warnings, some coming from within its own ranks, the Federal 
Aviation Administration took years before requiring a simple fix of the defect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1963: FAA requires a fix for the carburetor defect, but the change applies 
to only one carburetor model, despite the fact that similar models have the 
same flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 * July, 1984: A Cessna crashes in West Plains, Mo., killing one. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 8, 1985: National Transportation Safety Board, citing 26 incidents and 
seven crashes from 1979 to 1984, recommends that the FAA require the 
manufacturer to design replacement parts for flawed carburetor models and 
require installation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 3, 1987: FAA says it will not order the fix but instead will "monitor 
the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 1988: Carburetor manufacturer, Precision Airmotive Corp., without FAA's 
prodding, designs a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 * March, 1991: General Accounting Office issues report critical of FAA's 
ability to spot and act upon safety problems involving specific airplane 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 21, 1991: A Cessna crashes in West Chicago, Ill., killing two. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 29, 1991: Carburetor manufacturer urges FAA to issue a directive 
requiring replacement of two-piece venturi with one piece, saying the 
"old-style two-piece venturis used in earlier carburetors constitute a 
significant safety of flight problem and must be removed from service." 
</P>
<P>
 * December, 1991: Manufacturer revises its own bulletin to say replacement of 
defective carburetors should be carried out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 24, 1992: Safety board, noting that it first brought this problem to 
the FAA's attention in 1985, again recommends that the agency make the fix. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 29, 1992: Internal FAA memorandum says fix was not ordered after 
manufacturer's October, 1991, request because the "small number" of incidents 
did not warrant it. 
</P>
<P>
 * February, 1992: The FAA, in light of the safety board's latest 
recommendations, says it will consider requiring a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 10, 1992: A Cessna 177 crashes in Maryland; three die. 
</P>
<P>
 * June, 1992: FAA acknowledges carburetor problem, vows to prepare a directive 
requiring fix to be made on all Cessnas within four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 3, 1992: Private Oregon engine inspector tells FAA "to allow up to 48 
months for compliance is to invite the possibility of further accident and 
injury or loss of life."

SELLOFF LEAVES COUNTY WITH RISKIEST ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZI; DEBORA VRANA, ; SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's mass sale of Orange County's portfolio holdings by its lenders 
consumed many of its most conservative and marketable securities, leaving it 
with the riskiest and most exotic investments, financial experts close to the 
county's rescue effort said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The residual holdings, which the bankers valued at $5.5 billion to $6 billion, 
are also "enormously" vulnerable to changes in interest rates, said one source 
familiar with the portfolio -- an exposure the financial team is laboring to 
curtail as it attempts to unwind the county's ill-starred bet on an interest 
rate decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to create a transaction here that stops the bleeding, stops the 
losses," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers' latest estimate of the portfolio value is equivalent to a loss of 
$1.5 billion to $2 billion, about in line with most recent estimates. But they 
cautioned that the figure is a "snapshot" of the portfolio's value and could 
fluctuate sharply with changes in interest rates or with the pace or manner in 
which the holdings are placed on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to say the value is $5.5 billion, I might be dead right at this 
moment," said one source close to the county, "but when you throw $11 billion 
on the market you'll have gaps in the market price." The $11 billion is the 
estimate of how much of the county's collateral its Wall Street lenders sold 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, sources say, the county's advisory team from the Salomon Bros. 
investment firm is trying to develop strategies aimed at unwinding the county's 
investments as cautiously as possible while protecting against its tremendous 
interest rate risk. Such strategies might include using interest rate futures 
and options that become more valuable as rates rise, thus offsetting further 
losses in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go in and price and value every security, then hedge against 
the risk," said one source familiar with the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the situation is the condition of record-keeping at the county. 
Sources close to Salomon said that among the obstacles it faces is that crucial 
documentation establishing the fund apparently does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 That means there are few papers spelling out who controls or legally owns the 
investment fund, as well as how it is governed and what to do in the event of 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that everything was very informal for handling huge amounts of 
money," said a person familiar with the Salomon group's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Such documentation would help to decide how to apportion losses or income from 
the sale of securities among the funds' investors; its absence could 
substantially delay efforts to quickly stanch the funds' losses and sell off 
its riskier holdings, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the advisory team has apparently found many of the same kinds of 
record-keeping discrepancies identified by The Times on Saturday, including 
securities that could not be immediately identified and others that remained 
listed on inventory records even after they matured or were sold, these gaps 
are not considered serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources ascribed the discrepancies largely to "clerical" errors and said 
they are not expected to affect bottom-line calculations of the portfolio's 
value. Such bookkeeping errors are not unusual in comprehensive audits of the 
kind being undertaken with the county investment fund, one source said, and do 
not now point to any fraud on the part of the county's investment guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that doesn't look ultimately documentable," said one source. 
The Salomon team is working largely with records held by the county's 
investment trustee, Bank of America, which are considered to be the most 
authoritative. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the nature of the portfolio is established, the financial team will turn 
its attention to how best to extricate the county from its perilous bet on 
interest rates. This involves selling the riskiest or most volatile and complex 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bankers are particularly determined to avoid a "fire sale" in which 
large blocks are dumped on the market, where they might become subject to 
opportunistic bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Among former county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's purchases were 
securities whose interest payouts were pegged to several different benchmarks. 
Pricing such paper for sale involves assessing the future course of each 
benchmark and their possible interrelationships, a task requiring banks of 
high-powered computers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the selloff of the county's more conventional holdings by its Wall 
Street lenders, such securities are now overrepresented in the portfolio, 
sources said. The residual holdings tend also to be longer-term securities, 
which are more sensitive to interest-rate changes than those that would mature 
-- that is, be paid off by their issuers -- in the nearer term. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, sources familiar with the workout team's deliberations became 
increasingly critical of Citron's investment strategy as the scale of his bet 
on interest rates became clearer over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly dangerous, some say, was his insistence that the portfolio's 
dizzying plunge in value this year represented only "paper" losses of principal 
that did not need to be recorded. As he described it to county supervisors in 
an interim report in September, Citron's policy was to hold all securities to 
their maturity dates, when they would be paid in full and the principal losses 
would disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 That policy, however, allowed him to blind himself to the reality that the 
market was moving sharply against him. In fact, one analyst said, had Citron 
not locked the portfolio so deeply into an expectation of falling rates, he 
would have been able to sell some of his holdings to take better advantage of 
the higher interest being paid on bonds and notes across the investment 
spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the portfolio was saddled with securities that were designed to pay 
out less interest as rates rose -- and those are the securities for which the 
advisory team must now find buyers.

SERIAL BOMBER IS LINKED TO FATAL N.J. BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A videotape-sized mail bomb that killed an advertising executive this weekend 
appeared to be the work of one of the FBI's most elusive quarries: a meticulous 
serial bomber responsible for one other death and 23 injuries in a string of at 
least 14 bombings in 16 years, federal agents said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion in the kitchen of a North Caldwell, N.J., home killed Thomas J. 
Mosser, the newly named general manager and executive vice president of Young & 
Rubicam Inc., the New York advertising agency. Officials said laboratory 
analyses of fragments from the neatly wrapped white package bore the trademarks 
of a mysterious bomb maker code-named "Unabom" by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The law enforcement name reflects the bomber's predilection in other attacks 
for professors and officials of airlines and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The components of the bomb, its construction, make us believe the bombs are 
linked," said Barry Mawn, the agent in charge of the FBI's Newark, N.J., field 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The package was delivered to Mosser's suburban home by the U.S. Postal Service 
on Friday. It detonated Saturday when he opened it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosser's wife, his two children -- 13 years old and 15 months -- and the child 
of a neighbor were at the home but were not injured when the bomb exploded, 
ripping a large hole in a kitchen counter and filling the house with smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, investigators have found the serial bomber to be extremely 
meticulous, creating some portions of his deadly weapons from handcrafted parts 
that would have involved hundreds of hours of painstaking work. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, the bomber -- believed to be a fair-skinned man in his 30s 
or 40s who was once seen with a mustache -- has used elaborate ruses, including 
disguising one bomb as a book and another as a piece of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Mosser might have been targeted is because he was mentioned 
recently in a New York Times story, investigators told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three of the other victims, including two last year, were featured in 
New York Times stories describing them as leaders in their fields, the 
newspaper reported today. A story on Mosser's promotion was published Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosser's death is believed to be the bomber's first attack in 18 months. 
Charles Epstein, a geneticist at UC San Francisco was injured in an explosion 
on June 22, 1993. Two days later, David Gelertner, a computer scientist at Yale 
University, was seriously injured by a letter bomb sent to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the bomb maker sent a letter to the New York Times, calling himself 
"FC" and promising further details. The letter was mailed from Sacramento, as 
were the two bombs sent the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the bombs also contained the initials "FC" and these 
initials could be seen even after the detonations. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of bombings began in 1978, and other blasts occurred in California, 
Illinois, Utah, Tennessee, Michigan and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 11, 1985, a package exploded when Hugh Scrutton picked it up near his 
computer rental store in Sacramento. He became the bomber's first fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is offering a $1 million reward for information in the bombings.

ALARCON CRITICIZED FOR BLOCKING VALLEY PROJECTS; DEVELOPMENT: THE L.A. 
COUNCILMAN CONCEDES HE HAS HIGH STANDARDS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING IN 7TH 
DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since taking office last year, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon has 
doggedly pressured developers of low-income housing to upgrade proposed 
projects in his district in hopes of making them community landmarks instead of 
neighborhood eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process, developers say, he has killed some good projects and made 
them hesitant to offer others in his northeast San Fernando Valley district, a 
blue-collar community with a dire need for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking to rehabilitate earthquake-damaged properties but we have 
heard from others that it's very hard to get his support," said one Los 
Angeles-based developer of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months, Alarcon has scuttled at least two low-income housing 
projects, including a plan by nationally prominent Habitat for Humanity to 
build 11 low-income units in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the project did not conform with his personal idea for land-use," 
said Pete Baron, the group's operations manager. "Our concern was that we got 
so far downstream before he made his philosophy known." 
</P>
<P>
 Other developers say they are reluctant to build in the 7th District because 
Alarcon has an unwritten rule that he will work only with firms based in his 
district or firms that will enter partnerships with local nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Alarcon concedes that he has high standards for low-income 
housing, but says he has no qualms about scaring away developers who are unable 
to build projects that meet his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hard on some" developers, he said. "If someone wants to criticize me for 
being hard on some, then go ahead. . . . (But) by the time I'm done with a 
project it is going to be a project that the community needs." 
</P>
<P>
 As for allegations that he will work only with local developers, Alarcon said 
he prefers working with local nonprofit groups but has no hard-and-fast rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income housing is a vital issue in Alarcon's district, where 26% of 
residents live in severely overcrowded conditions, a statistical measure 
defined as households with more than 1.5 people in each room, according to the 
1990 census. Only three other council districts in South-Central and East Los 
Angeles have worse overcrowding, according to the census. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for inexpensive housing has also become crucial in the Valley since 
the Northridge quake severely damaged about 50,000 housing units citywide, 
including 931 units in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials define low-income housing as units that a family that earns 
only 80% of the county's median income of $38,000 can afford without spending 
more than 30% of its total income. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's philosophy is crucial because city housing officials make it a 
practice to get the approval of each council member before funding a housing 
project within his or her district, thereby making council members the 
gatekeepers for housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gary Squier, head of the city's Housing Department, Alarcon has 
thus far been the most aggressive of all council members in scrutinizing 
proposed housing projects. He has demanded that developers include added 
amenities, such as extra parking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To work in the 7th District, you need to demonstrate to the council that you 
are building housing plus," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon voiced his no-compromise philosophy in October when planning and 
housing officials proposed an ordinance to give developers incentives to build 
more low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentive program, which would eliminate the need for public review by 
allowing administrative approval, would include more relaxed parking and height 
standards for developers who provide a minimum number of low-income units. The 
program is designed to streamline the approval process for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing on the matter, Alarcon opposed the idea, saying it would take 
away the city's powers to scrutinize each project on a case-by-case basis. The 
council is expected to vote on the law within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we not look at each individual case?" he asked housing officials. 
"It's been my observation that whenever we give up on these kinds of things, 
the developer doesn't give a damn about building roughshod housing." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Alarcon said that despite his get-tough philosophy, 
low-income housing continues to be built in his district. Since he took office 
in June, 1993, developers have built or rehabilitated 213 low-income housing 
units in his district, a total exceeded in only three other council districts. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly pointed to two low-income projects currently proposed for his 
district, projects that he said include extra amenities due to the pressure he 
put on developers. One is an 88-unit project in Lake View Terrace that will 
include a long-needed library. The other is a 53-unit project in North Hills to 
include a community center. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite his high standards, Alarcon said, he thinks he is still allowing 
developers to build enough low-income housing to meet his district's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 One development that didn't meet Alarcon's standards was Habitat for 
Humanity's Mission Hills project. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron said Alarcon seemed supportive of the plan several months ago, but ended 
his support about a month ago when neighborhood opposition to the project 
caused the councilman to re-examine it. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy the vacant property for the project, Baron said, the group needed a 
$550,000 loan from the city. But housing officials made it clear to him that he 
wouldn't get the loan without Alarcon's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said residents opposed the project because the two-story condominium 
plan was out of place for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 About six months ago, Alarcon scuttled other plans by a Los-Angeles based 
nonprofit organization to rehabilitate a quake-damaged apartment building in 
Pacoima and convert it into a 35-unit low-income housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the organization said Alarcon opposed a $1-million city loan to 
his group because the councilman preferred to work with local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were addressing what was a priority in the area," said the 
developer, who like others asked not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing 
future projects. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an Alarcon representative said he rejected the project because it was 
"ugly" and the developer tried to rush the councilman into endorsing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing development in Alarcon's district has also generated some controversy 
because Alarcon's former campaign manager, James Acevedo, heads Neighborhood 
Empowerment & Economic Development Inc., or NEED, a North Hills-based nonprofit 
group that has won several city contracts, including a $1.8-million loan to 
build the Library Village housing project in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Some developers say there is an unspoken understanding that Alarcon prefers 
developers who team up with Acevedo's group. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said he does not oppose developers from outside his district, but 
would rather "empower" local groups by involving them in building low-income 
housing.

NEWS ANALYSIS; COUNTY FUND FIASCO SOWS DISSENSION ON WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's financial disaster is causing deep fissures on Wall Street, 
isolating giant Merrill Lynch & Co. -- the county's principal financier -- and 
shining a bright and unwanted light on the brokerage industry's sales, 
marketing and lobbying practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the county's bankruptcy is likely to expose many of the 
contradictions inherent in brokerages' hawking last year of "derivative" bond 
securities that represented a high-risk bet on falling interest rates -- at a 
time when many brokerage executives appeared convinced that rates were 
bottoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the workout of the county's loss-ridden bond portfolio presents a threat 
to Wall Street in that it creates potentially awkward choices for Merrill Lynch 
rival Salomon Bros., which the county has picked to sort out the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon could be asked by county officials to detail whether certain 
transactions either were ill-advised or simply wrong for the county fund. But 
any evidence to that end could indict Wall Street sales practices in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Salomon turns on Merrill for what they did, they (Salomon) might also have 
to admit that they were peddling some of this Kool-Aid themselves" to their own 
clients, one bond trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes now clearly are highest for Merrill Lynch, which enjoyed a close 
relationship with former county Treasurer Robert L. Citron -- selling him 
billions of dollars in securities, and underwriting nearly one-fifth of all 
county and county agency bond offerings since 1990 -- and which from the 
beginning of the crisis sought to rally the rest of Wall Street to the county 
fund's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In reconstructing the days leading up to last Tuesday's bankruptcy filing, 
brokerage executives say the industry at first appeared united in trying to 
halt the county's downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Because major brokerages had more than $13 billion in loans outstanding to the 
$18.5-billion fund, it was thought to be in the interest of all players to help 
the county over its liquidity crisis. That crisis had been sparked by the 
rising cost of the fund's short-term loans, while its long-term bond portfolio 
was falling in value. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to avoid triggering a debacle, brokerages Smith Barney and 
Nomura Securities are believed to have agreed to roll over relatively small 
loan amounts that came due in the days preceding the bankruptcy filing, even 
though they were well aware of Citron's cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all of us took Merrill's tack on this -- that it could be worked 
out," said one brokerage executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, this executive said, had tried to mollify Wall Street by even 
suggesting that he could borrow from the state to pay his bills if necessary, 
even though Gov. Pete Wilson's office has maintained all along that the state 
was not in a position to supply cash. 
</P>
<P>
 By last Monday, worries were mounting on Wall Street that the fund's losses 
were bigger than the $1.5 billion Citron had indicated. Worse for the brokerage 
community, it awoke Monday to learn that Citron -- the fund's mastermind -- had 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch, which had $2.1 billion in loans outstanding to the county fund, 
continued to insist last Monday that it had no plans to cut off credit to the 
fund. But the fund's biggest creditor, brokerage CS First Boston Corp., was 
beginning to waver. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons still unclear except perhaps for the sheer size of its 
$2.6-billion loan to the county fund, CS First Boston pulled the plug Tuesday 
after the county said it was unable to make $1.2 billion in payments that fell 
due. 
</P>
<P>
 By seizing and selling the county-owned bonds it held as collateral for its 
loan, CS First Boston precipitated the bankruptcy filing. Within 24 hours, 
nearly every other brokerage with loans to the county fund also called them in, 
seized the collateral securities and sold them. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, the county reported that collateral bonds worth $11.4 billion had 
been liquidated, and that the only major brokerage creditor remaining was 
Merrill Lynch. Outraged county authorities have sued one of the brokerages, 
Nomura Securities, demanding the return of the bonds, and have said all of the 
other sellers will be sued as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Merrill Lynch has been lashing out at its rivals for turning on the 
county, tying itself even more closely to the county's declining fortunes. 
Although many Wall Street attorneys insist that bankruptcy rules permit the 
liquidation of collateral securities, Merrill's attorneys apparently are taking 
the opposite view. 
</P>
<P>
 One Merrill Lynch official said privately that "they'd (the other brokerages) 
better not spend any extra proceeds from the bond sales because they could be 
giving it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say Merrill's increasing distance from its peers over the Orange 
County case reminds them of now-defunct junk bond giant Drexel Burnham 
Lambert's rapid isolation after the junk market collapsed in 1989. And 
investors are plainly worried about Merrill's ties to the county: The 
brokerage's stock price has tumbled 16% since mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, The Times reported that Merrill Lynch had lobbied extensively 
since 1987 in the state Legislature for laws that expanded county investment 
funds' ability to purchase more complex securities. 
</P>
<P>
 That is likely to accentuate what are already the biggest issues dogging 
Merrill and all of Wall Street as the county's case is dissected by regulators: 
Did Merrill and other brokerages sell the fund high-risk derivative securities 
that were unsuitable for it, and did they essentially take advantage of what 
now appears to be a dangerous and outlandish bet by Citron that interest rates 
would continue falling? 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates reached 20- to 30-year lows in late summer, 1993, Citron was 
insisting to county supervisors that he saw no possibility of rates rising 
significantly for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wall Street, many brokerage officials saw higher interest rates as an 
inevitability in 1994, and were planning accordingly. They also were advising 
many of their clients along the same lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal now viewed as a landmark, Morgan Stanley & Co. and Merrill Lynch in 
summer, 1993, helped Walt Disney Co. sell fixed-rate bonds maturing in 100 
years -- a sign that Disney, among other savvy corporations, believed that 
interest rates had reached depths that might not be seen again for a generation 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in arranging billions of dollars of derivative-bond transactions in 
1993, Wall Street essentially had to talk out of both sides of its mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 For clients such as Citron, who believed that interest rates would keep 
falling, commission-hungry brokerage salespeople naturally touted the 
high-octane returns that certain derivatives would provide if that bet were 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 But to create such a derivative, a brokerage had to find another client who 
was willing to take the opposite side of the bet -- that interest rates would 
rise. That client would have gotten the same glowing pitch from brokerage 
salespeople, only touting the opposite scenario on rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's defense, of course, is that it is nothing more than a 
facilitator, arranging transactions for independent investors who have a right 
to choose which interest-rate scenario to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Merrill Lynch can argue that even within its own executive ranks there 
has been and continues to be dissension over interest rates' direction: Chief 
economist Donald Straszheim is expecting rates to fall, while Thomas Sowanick, 
head of taxable bonds at the firm, is predicting another surge in rates in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Merrill overall appears to have made the right call on interest rates 
as far as its own capital is concerned. Unlike some other major brokerages that 
have lost hundreds of millions of dollars betting on lower rates, Merrill's 
earnings in the first nine months of this year were off just 10% from 1993's 
record pace. 
</P>
<P>
 In his third-quarter report to shareholders, Merrill Chairman Daniel P. Tully 
credited a "well-diversified revenue base" and "effective cost and risk 
management" for protecting the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet by helping the Orange County fund massively leverage its bet on falling 
interest rates -- with little apparent regard to risk management -- Merrill and 
other brokerages that functioned as advisers and securities sellers to the 
county may be at least partly liable for the fund's demise, some brokerage 
industry observers worry. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may have set a dangerous precedent for Wall Street, Bankers Trust New 
York Corp., one of the biggest underwriters of derivatives, recently agreed to 
settle a lawsuit with client Gibson Greetings by absorbing most of the losses 
Gibson incurred on derivative investments -- investments that Gibson contended 
it should not have made and did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, dozens of mutual fund companies this year have swallowed 
derivative-related losses in some of their funds, effectively sending a message 
to shareholders that fund management erred -- and that shareholders should not 
have to pay the price for those errors. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Merrill Lynch has continued to state that it never acted 
improperly, and that Orange County was a sophisticated investor capable of 
making complex investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of Merrill's peer firms saw things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 The current issue of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer newsletter in New York 
reprints a letter Citron sent to brokerage Goldman, Sachs & Co. in October, 
1993 -- just as interest rates were turning up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Citron lambastes Goldman officials in New York, charging that 
while the firm's San Francisco office wanted to do business with Orange County, 
that office "has encountered many objections from your New York office and its 
legal counsel . . . because they don't understand the type of investment 
strategies that we are using." 
</P>
<P>
 In a line that now seems prophetic, Citron caustically wrote that Goldman 
should not seek to do any business with the county if the firm was 
uncomfortable with his use of leverage, because "any major malfunction of the 
(county) treasury could have an affect (sic) on county finances."

MORE SCHOOLS IN STATE MOVE TO OFFER STUDENTS BREAKFAST; HUNGER: IN THREE WEEKS, 
33 CAMPUSES JOINED PROGRAM FOR NEEDY PUPILS. BUT POSSIBLE BUDGET CUTS THREATEN 
EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the jargon of advocates against hunger, they are called "should but don't" 
schools -- institutions with large proportions of poor students that do not 
offer a government-subsidized breakfast on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 such schools dot the Southern California landscape -- from Downey 
to Escondido, Oxnard to Ontario, Garden Grove to Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three weeks, 33 of them have joined a statewide rush to apply for 
the breakfast program, administered by the California Department of Education 
with mostly federal funds. Eight of the applicants -- the largest number from a 
single district -- are schools from the West Covina Unified School District, 
whose Edgewood Middle School was profiled in a recent Times series on hunger. 
West Covina's school board is expected to make a final decision Tuesday on 
whether to start serving breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 60 schools have applied for the program since late November. Dozens 
more report that they plan to apply in the near future to offer school 
breakfast -- which many see as a way to counter hunger-induced learning 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There usually is a surge in start-up applications right before the year-end 
filing deadline, but this year, the volume was surprisingly heavy, said Albert 
Tweltridge, assistant director of child nutrition programs at the state 
Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the most recent applicants, he said, news of hungry schoolchildren 
in suburbia was a wake-up call, increasing school officials' awareness that 
undernourished students are tired, miss class more often and do worse than 
their peers on standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 At schools that balk at providing breakfast, officials offer a number of 
reasons: logistic concerns, bureaucratic inertia, philosophical objections to 
offering a morning meal to children who school officials believe should be 
eating breakfast at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bigger hurdle looms on the horizon: the new Republican majority in the 
House of Representatives has pledged to quickly enact a provision in its 
"contract with America" that would eliminate federal funding for school 
nutrition programs that have traditionally enjoyed broad bipartisan support. 
The move would turn responsibility for the programs over to the states and cut 
funding in fiscal 1996, with further reductions in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is likely that throughout the country, there will be significantly fewer 
schools participating in the national school lunch and breakfast program if 
this passes," Tweltridge said. Food service administrators and anti-hunger 
advocates are convening an emergency meeting Dec. 20 in Los Angeles to draft a 
strategy to combat the possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Any school can offer a subsidized breakfast program. As it stands now, the 
government offers a special incentive -- a higher reimbursement rate -- to 
"severe need" schools, those with 40% or more low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, education officials have renewed a school-to-school battle to 
get more districts to offer breakfast. An eight-page primer, "Better Breakfast, 
Better Learning," currently being mailed to superintendents by the state 
Education Department, urges teachers, administrators and parents to start the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 And California Food Policy Advocates, a nonprofit group, is saturating 
community leaders in high-need districts with its "School Breakfast Action 
Kit," a step-by-step organizing guide on how to prod their schools to feed 
children breakfast in the cafeteria, the classroom, even on the school bus. The 
aim: to get 300 schools -- many in Southern California -- on board by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a county-by-county look at how individual districts in 
Southern California are handling the breakfast issue at their neediest schools: 
LOS ANGELES COUNTY / No Breakfast Option For Many in Need 
</P>
<P>
 Like many urban districts, Los Angeles Unified has long fed breakfast at all 
of its schools. But 12 districts in Los Angeles County -- including 
Cerritos-based ABC Unified, Culver City Unified on the Westside and Pomona 
Unified in the San Gabriel Valley -- have at least one school with a high ratio 
of low-income children who qualify for a free or reduced-price breakfast, but 
can't get it because it isn't offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite breakfast requests for years from principals and parents, no East 
Whittier City school offers the program, says food service director Long Chen. 
"We want to be cautious about every aspect of this," Chen said. She points to 
the district's small kitchen capacity and financial concerns. What's more, Chen 
contends, there aren't hungry children in East Whittier schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But Debbie Norman, a teacher at East Whittier's Evergreen Elementary, 
estimates half of her students are hungry. Norman stocks graham crackers, 
apples and oranges in her classroom closet. "If they are worrying about what 
they are going to eat," she said, "it makes it hard to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the district say hungry students come from families where parents 
have low-paying jobs or are unemployed and struggle to put three meals on the 
table. Other parents, they say, catch early buses to their jobs, leaving young 
children to get themselves up, fed, and to school. Some parents are neglectful. 
"Kids should have breakfast and dinner with their families. But that isn't 
always realistic," said Kathleen Hiatt, president of the East Whittier 
Education Association. 
</P>
<P>
 At schools without breakfast, hunger's toll is evident. A survey last year in 
Pomona Unified found that a third of all visits to the school nurse were 
hunger-related stomach and head ailments, said health services coordinator 
Sharon Goodrich. Three needy schools in the district have no breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra's food service director, Marilynn Wells, has unsuccessfully pushed 
for six years to institute breakfast at Monterey-Highlands Elementary. "It is 
just one more thing they have to deal with. They don't want to," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Education Department survey earlier this year found that philosophical 
objections were the primary reason principals and superintendents give for not 
offering the government-financed meal. "The media attention is putting pressure 
on principals to provide breakfast to their students," said Wells.

COLUMN ONE; PLAYING IT SMART IN TOYLAND; PARENTS -- AND CHILDREN -- ARE BUYING 
THE IDEA THAT LEARNING IS FUN. HOLIDAY SALES OF SOFTWARE, QUIZ GAMES AND ANT 
FARMS ARE SURGING, BUOYED BY A BACKLASH AGAINST VIOLENCE AND AILING SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They rang sleigh bells and handed out miniature body bags along with buttons 
declaring, "No War Toys." But the motley collection of activists who mounted 
holiday protests at toy stores in the 1980s were virtually ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating," recalls Stevanne Auerbach, a San Francisco 
psychologist and toy militant who answers the phone "Dr. Toy." "We couldn't 
sustain that movement. It wasn't a popular message, and we were swimming 
against the tide." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Dr. Toy is absolutely buoyant as she surveys a holiday 
shopping scene marked by strong demand for learning toys, a retail and public 
backlash against violent toys and a proliferation of store chains with monikers 
such as TeachSmart, Store of Knowledge and Noodle Kidoodle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tide is turning," Auerbach proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest toys this season are still the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 
latest incarnation of a perpetual wish-list favorite: the shoot-em-dead, 
beat-em-to-a-pulp plaything. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the popular television program on which the Power Rangers are based has 
come under fire in a number of countries, including Sweden and Canada, where 
complaints about violence have prompted official scrutiny. And there is 
persuasive evidence that American parents -- bombarded with crime-laden news 
reports and worried about deteriorating schools -- are demanding more toys 
designed to encourage learning and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 These demands -- backed by robust numbers -- are reshaping the marketing 
strategies of retailers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while retail giants Toys R Us and KayBee stores cite recent shooting 
tragedies to explain why they quit selling realistic toy guns, the fact is that 
sales have cooled in the past few years, says industry analyst Jill Krutick. 
While overall toy sales were flat last year, nationwide sales of play guns 
tumbled by 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, learning toys in general have made a dramatic leap. 
Sales in the construction category, which has seen an explosion of new entries, 
have surged by 22%. The value of construction toy shipments to retailers 
climbed from $186 million in 1989 to $326 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period, shipments of cardboard puzzles rose from $80 million to 
$103 million; electronic learning aids went from $132 million to $175 million, 
and art supplies, such as crayons and drawing sets, jumped from $172 million in 
1989 to $370 million. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the kind of signals that merchants understand far better than 
protesters' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as consumer demand for more educational gifts surges, even mainstream 
retailers are scrambling to rearrange their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us this year launched sections called Books R Us. And Target stores 
this holiday season have expanded sales space for construction toys by 50%, 
increased the space for electronic learning aids by 40% and broadened the 
assortment of learning-oriented board games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a significant sales increase in these categories," says Dave Clark, 
the Target vice president in charge of toys. "People are more interested in 
gifts for the mind, and we want to be smart enough to offer what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheree Newman, an Orange County mother of four, is one of those parents. She 
recently bought books, puzzles and nature-study kits for her children, ages 2 
to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy a gift unless it has educational value," she says. "My kids don't 
have Power Ranger toys and they don't watch the Power Rangers television show." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Newman, most Americans believe certain toys and games can have a positive 
effect on children, according to a new study by EDK Forecast, a newsletter that 
tracks consumer attitudes. In a nationwide poll of 500 parents, 82% said 
children who play with educational toys tend to do better in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Such beliefs are well-founded, says Karen Shanor, a Washington, D.C., 
psychologist who has lectured on the benefits of learning-oriented toys. Shanor 
said many child psychologists have concluded that educational playthings build 
competence, inspire creativity and promote independent thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, playtime is a serious matter because children are rehearsing for 
lesson-learning that should continue the rest of their lives," Shanor said. 
"More and more parents are beginning to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty stores that cater to learning-oriented parents and children are 
springing up or expanding across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman shops at what has become a prime example of the robust new market: KCET 
Store of Knowledge Inc. After opening its first store in Glendale in April, it 
has added three more in Southern California. The fledgling chain is about to 
open 24 stores in 10 other cities in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain is backed by the Los Angeles venture capital firm of Riordan, Lewis 
and Hadan, formerly headed by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, which owns 
one-third. KCET-TV, the Los Angeles public broadcasting affiliate, which uses 
air time and mailings to promote the retail operation, owns one-third. The rest 
is held by Lakeshore Learning Materials, a Carson company specializing in 
educational school supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 As it expands, the company will work with local PBS affiliates, which will own 
25% of stores in their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the new breed of specialty chains, Store of Knowledge sells science 
kits, books, construction sets, puzzles, learning-oriented board games and 
recreational software that is also educational. 
</P>
<P>
 It also sells items linked to public broadcasting -- videotapes of some PBS 
programs, such as "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
 The tie between PBS and the "smart toy" movement is, of course, long and 
strong. In fact, the federal grant that launched the seminal "Sesame Street" 
series was approved in 1969 by a U.S. Department of Education official named 
Stevanne Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of the veterans of learning-oriented retailing -- for example, 
the 7-year-old Mind Construction and the 4-year-old Learningsmith -- are 
expanding rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith, which also has business associations with some PBS stations, 
expects sales to reach $40 million this year, more than double last year's 
total. The Boston-based company added 14 stores this year and now has 25 in 
eight states, including three in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was wall-to-wall shoppers over the Thanksgiving weekend at Learningsmith in 
South Coast Plaza, where preschoolers stood in line to try out educational 
software at the store's bank of computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many traditional toy stores, many specialty chains whet children's 
appetites by allowing them to sample the merchandise. For example, Imaginarium, 
a chain that caters to younger children, leaves demonstration toys on tables or 
floors. On busy days, an Imaginarium can resemble a kindergarten play room. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers say this marketing technique allows children to have a hand in the 
selection, a hedge against an educational toy gathering dust from non-use. 
</P>
<P>
 TeachSmart, based in the Dallas area, opened its first store in May and 
already has five stores in three states -- Texas, Florida and Arizona. The 
company plans 30 more stores in the next two years, some in California. 
</P>
<P>
 TeachSmart's president, Jim Berk, says demand for educational computer 
software accounts for much of his early success. Each store offers about 800 
titles; 30% of them are suitable for children younger than 5, Berk says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Noodle Kidoodle in New York state, Toys & Treasures in South 
Dakota, Building Blocks in New Jersey and two chains in Pennsylvania -- Boomers 
and Zany Brainy. 
</P>
<P>
 The smart-toy genre finished higher than ever on this holiday season's toy 
industry surveys. Duracell batteries' annual forecast, which is based on the 
views of analysts and manufacturers, predicts that educational and construction 
toys will be among the hottest categories this Christmas. (Action figures and 
dolls will be the other top categories.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The construction toy rage will continue this season because parents are 
looking for toys that offer real hands-on learning," says Jodi Levin, a 
spokeswoman for the New York-based Toy Manufacturers of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin says construction kits with the well-known Lego label and newer entries 
such as K'nex, a color-coded set introduced last year, will be hot, a forecast 
that sales clerks say was borne out over the Thanksgiving weekend. And industry 
analysts see a revival of vintage offerings such as Erector sets, Lincoln Logs 
and Tinker Toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Kerins of Havertown, Pa., is among the growing number of parents buying 
toys designed to combine fun and learning. Kerins and her husband, Michael, 
have two boys -- Michael, 6, and Danny, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerins are so enthusiastic about K'nex that they have acquired about 7,500 
pieces -- more than four times the number found in one jumbo set. With their 
K'nex-smitten mother in tow, Michael and Danny recently used the pieces to 
build a playhouse that was 5 feet high and 6 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like construction toys because I don't need instructions. I can use my 
imagination to make things," says Danny, who has taken some of his best 
creations to show off at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction kits aren't the only toy category making a comeback. The retro 
surge also includes such chestnuts as chemistry sets and ant farms, retailers 
say. They are coexisting nicely on the shelves with higher technology items 
such as computer learning aids and software with animated characters that teach 
reading, writing and arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some new twists in board games are generating impressive sales. 
Mancala -- an ancient Egyptian game requiring math skills -- is making a 
comeback after thousands of years in obscurity. And The Allowance, in which 
players learn to manage play money, is fetching a lot of real-life dollars, 
retailers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The software program Math Blaster constructively indulges youngsters' appetite 
for mayhem: It allows a player to blast dangerous and calculating space aliens 
only after math calculations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy experts say the market for learning-based toys already has been boosted 
this holiday season by dim prospects for video game equipment. Consumers are 
expected to shy away from that market because the industry's two giants -- 
Nintendo and Sega -- will be introducing new game-playing technology next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, video games have taken sales away from certain segments of the 
toy market -- board games, for example," says Frank Reysen, editor of New 
York-based Playthings magazine. "Parents are not satisfied with school system 
performance and are looking for ways to supplement the learning process. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "This year," he says, "some of the dollars normally spent on video hardware 
will be used to buy non-electronic toys or to buy electronic learning toys."

CLINTON PLANS TO PROPOSE TAX CUT FOR MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, plunging into a possible tax-cutting contest with Congress' 
new Republican leadership, said Sunday that he plans to propose a middle-class 
tax reduction -- and believes he can do it without increasing the federal 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to propose one as long as I can pay for it," Clinton told a news 
conference at the end of his three-day summit meeting with 33 other leaders of 
Western Hemisphere nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to see this deficit start going up again," he said. "That is my 
objective. I think we can achieve that objective." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said the tax plan may be unveiled as early as Thursday, when Clinton 
plans a major speech outlining goals and priorities for the second half of his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called for a middle-class tax cut in his 1992 presidential campaign, 
but edged away from the promise when he found it impossible to cut taxes and 
reduce the deficit. Now, he said, "I want to fulfill the commitment of our 
campaign and my commitment to tax fairness." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the strongest such promise yet from the President, who renewed his 
interest in reducing middle-class taxes after Republicans won majorities in 
both houses of Congress last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did not offer any details of the tax relief he may propose, but aides 
said proposals include a tax credit aimed at middle-income families of several 
hundred dollars per child. 
</P>
<P>
 The President posed two conditions for any tax-cut proposal. He said any tax 
cut must not increase the deficit. At the same time, he said, it should not be 
paid for by reductions in federal spending that would come at the expense of 
people he described as the "temporarily poor" and "responsible parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can achieve that objective . . . without hurting poor people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that we should be pitting the middle class against the poor, 
who themselves are willing to embrace the values of work and family and 
community -- and I don't think we have to do that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government funds should not be used to reward irresponsibility," he said. 
"But if people are temporarily poor through no fault of their own, if they're 
doing their best to improve their lot in life . . . I don't think the American 
people want to put a lot of folks in the street." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments reflected the central problem he and his aides have faced in 
devising new domestic-policy proposals: How to combine a middle-class tax cut, 
welfare reform and other reductions in government spending so as to convince 
voters that Clinton is a "New Democrat" centrist -- without alienating too many 
"old Democrat" liberals whose votes he needs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about reports that he has considered eliminating the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies as a way to cut 
spending dramatically, Clinton said: "I wouldn't rule anything out." 
</P>
<P>
 But he insisted that any such action would be a natural outgrowth of his own 
interest in reducing government spending, not just a reaction to Republican 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask me a purely political question -- Do I think it's necessary to do 
that for show? -- the answer is no," he said. Instead, he said, "it is terribly 
important that we continue . . . to downsize the government." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official said it was unlikely that Clinton would announce 
the abolition of HUD or any other major federal agencies in his speech this 
week. "Those ideas are still being studied," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 During three days of economic diplomacy, formal ceremony and a multicultural 
variety show here, Clinton and his aides have yearned discreetly to get back to 
Washington and the central policy battles that will define the 1996 election 
campaign and the rest of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like we've been talking about trade forever," one aide sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Clinton had considered taking a one-day trip to Haiti after his 
time in Miami in order to visit U.S. troops and highlight the success of his 
decision to intervene on the island. But the tour was scrapped so he could 
concentrate on his domestic policy plans. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton pledged that any tax cut he presents will be fiscally 
responsible, other Administration officials rejected out of hand Sunday a 
budget-relief proposal on trimming Social Security and Medicare spending, 
offered by the leaders of a presidential bipartisan commission on federal 
entitlements reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), leaders of the 
panel, said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that reining in the growing cost of 
such massive federal programs was the only way of averting a financial crisis 
after the turn of the century that would punish future recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other changes, the senators are advocating gradually raising the 
eligibility age to 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharply rebuking those who shrink from such ideas, Kerrey said: "Once again, 
this is a situation that people can say: 'Yeah, it needs to be solved,' but, 
God, once they start looking at the ugly things that need to be done, manana 
looks more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 However, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta told the CBS-TV program 
"Face the Nation" that changing Social Security is out of the question. "The 
President made clear during the campaign and before that, that we were not 
going to touch Social Security. And we're not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen blasted Republicans for offering 
cost-saving and tax-reducing ideas that he said were short on specifics or on 
consideration of consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he suggested that Clinton might fight a broad capital gains tax 
cut, which will be pressed by Republicans in Congress. "I'm sure that he would 
not sign one unless he felt sure that it was middle-income America that was the 
primary beneficiary of it," Bentsen said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David 
Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said Clinton will not allow a return to "the experience of 1981," 
which involved "a bidding war as far as the cutting of taxes, and then we saw 
the escalation of debt -- quadrupling it."

AMERICAS SUMMIT ENDS; CLINTON HAILS 'WATERSHED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON and WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and the leaders of 33 Western Hemisphere nations concluded a 
weekend summit Sunday by signing a free-trade agreement that Clinton called "a 
watershed in the history of the hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders promised that the 32-page document, which agrees to create the 
largest free-trade zone in the world, will mean more jobs and prosperity for 
the region's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Future generations will look back on the Miami summit as a moment when the 
course of history in the Americas changed for the better," Clinton said in the 
closing ceremony of the Summit of the Americas at a downtown convention center, 
where he shared the stage with the presidents and prime ministers of Canada, 
Latin America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, they resolved to begin building the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas immediately and to conclude negotiations no later than the year 
2005. Countries or other regional trade groups will gradually be phased in as 
their economies are ready to face competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A key to prosperity is trade without barriers, without subsidies, without 
unfair practices and with an increasing stream of productive investments," the 
leaders said in their Declaration of Principles. 
</P>
<P>
 After the summit ended, Clinton and the leaders of Mexico and Canada also 
invited Chile to join the North American Free Trade Agreement, a step intended 
to signal to other countries that they can be included once their economies are 
in good shape. With the most well-ordered economy in Latin America, Chile is 
expected to be able to complete the negotiations for entering NAFTA in about 15 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 While lavishing praise on the symbolism and promise of the summit, most 
officials acknowledged that Sunday's 34-nation pact is only the beginning of a 
long and ambitious process. Several said they hoped the fact that the United 
States sat down with the rest of the hemisphere -- the first such meeting in 27 
years -- signaled the start of a new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the flight manual that will keep us busy for many years to come," 
Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in history, "Americans are really understanding . . . that 
they need us as much as we need them," said Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de Lozada. "It's a sea change. . . . It's the first time we haven't come to 
resist or to receive instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said: "Many people think to come to 
the United States is to ask for money, and many Americans think we come here to 
ask for money. We came here looking for business, investment and (trade) 
partners." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the upbeat talk, there were words of caution about the difficulties of 
ultimately phasing in the free-trade zone, which will encompass 750 million 
people and goods and services worth more than $14 trillion. It requires a 
number of countries to reform sluggish economic systems, reduce high tariffs, 
eliminate subsidies and set up legal mechanisms to guarantee property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, there is some question about how receptive the U.S. public -- 
which in large numbers turned against Clinton and the Democratic leadership in 
midterm elections -- will be toward the expansion of commercial ties with Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is not ready for a free-trade agreement with Latin America," said 
Mark B. Rosenberg, acting dean of urban and public affairs at Florida 
International University and an expert on Latin America. "In the post-Cold War 
environment, they don't understand what the dominant values are. The pace of 
change is so rapid, and Americans are very insecure." 
</P>
<P>
 And smaller countries fear being left out or put at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Owen Arthur of Barbados cautioned that the coming "tide" of 
free trade could be dangerous for Caribbean island nations if special measures 
are not taken to prepare their economies and give their products a share of the 
hemisphere's market. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rapidly rising tide can and does overturn small boats, especially small, 
unbalanced boats," Arthur said. "The Caribbean has small, unbalanced 
economies." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and other leaders emphasized that the new economic partnership is 
aimed at creating employment and income by increasing the exports of all 
participating countries. Clinton claimed that 100,000 jobs have been added in 
the United States because of the year-old NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia's Sanchez de Lozada expressed optimism that more trade will mean 
development and employment in his country, the poorest in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were talking about at this summit was jobs," Sanchez de Lozada said. 
He said that while Clinton was "obviously talking about American jobs because 
he's got to win an election," the United States must also buy more imports from 
Latin America if the partnership is to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's closing summit ceremony, Clinton gave Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide a place of honor, inviting him to be the final speaker. 
Aristide, making his first trip to the United States since U.S. troops restored 
him to power Oct. 15 after three years in military-imposed exile, used his 
speech to effusively thank Clinton and the other leaders for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, speaking in French, English and Spanish, invited Clinton to visit 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 While much was said about trade at the summit here in balmy Miami, the 
participants failed to take significant action on some of the most serious 
festering problems in the Americas, such as illegal drug trafficking and human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the documents signed Sunday, the presidents and prime ministers agreed to 
"encourage" legislation that would freeze and confiscate assets produced by the 
laundering of drug money, estimated to be a $300-billion business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure was watered down from an earlier proposal that would have 
required such legislation. In addition, a tough U.S.-sponsored plan for 
cracking down on drug production and smuggling never made it to the final 
documents after Colombia, Bolivia and Peru objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activists complained that the summit, by concentrating so heavily 
on trade, ignored abuses that continue to go unpunished in Latin America, still 
a violent region despite the end of most wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The summit participants have sent precisely the wrong signal to human rights 
abusers in the region -- that they can continue to get away with murder," Jose 
Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivanco noted that summit participants pledged to strengthen judicial systems 
to fight administrative corruption -- not to bring human rights abusers to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez de Lozada said the summit declarations did not mention the Communist 
government of Cuba and the U.S. embargo against the island because of 
disagreement among the leaders on how to press for Cuban democracy. But Cuba 
was brought up again and again in the summit's private discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leaders, including those of Mexico and Brazil, oppose the U.S. embargo 
and advocate dialogue with President Fidel Castro, who was not invited to the 
summit. Argentine President Carlos Menem supports the U.S. embargo. Guido di 
Tella, the Argentine foreign minister, said that if the summit had tried to 
reach agreement on Cuba, "there would have been an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action signed by the 34 
leaders was negotiated in advance by lesser officials. The presidents and prime 
ministers made no changes in the documents presented to them for signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went over it very thoroughly but didn't change a word," said Charles 
Gillespie, the State Department's chief negotiator for the summit. As a result, 
the contents are sometimes bland or vague where some would have preferred 
stronger language or more specific commitments, such as in the area of drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs, like Cuba, is an area where we really don't have an answer," Sanchez 
de Lozada said.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE ASSEMBLY: GRIDLOCK IN THE TRENCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaos. Mistrust. Stalemate. "Leaders" looking like deer in headlights. Maybe 
we'll have to get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The present mess in the state Assembly -- its inability to elect a Speaker and 
organize for the new legislative session -- may be less an aberration than a 
new reality. 
</P>
<P>
 We're seeing the unintended consequences of term limits and an honest 
reapportionment. Legislators aren't sure how to deal with either. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits have accelerated turnover, as the voters wanted, and handed 
Republicans their first opportunity in 24 years to seize control from old-guard 
Democrats, namely Assemblyman Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the GOP newcomers have not shown the political skills -- normally acquired 
through tutelage and/or years of legislative combat -- that are needed to 
capture the speakership. Republican Leader Jim Brulte was first elected only 
four years ago with the 1990 class of "term limit babies." Of the 40 
Republicans, 36 have been in the Legislature four years or less. Eighteen were 
elected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative veterans know that to become Speaker, you need 41 votes plus "a 
couple for the double-cross." When the double-cross came -- when Assemblyman 
Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar deserted the GOP, became an independent and voted 
for "the real slick Willie," as President Clinton once called Brown -- Brulte 
had no backup votes. He had failed to make a deal with any Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, Brulte was up against a combat-savvy veteran whose 30 years of 
legislative experience never again will be matched under term limits. So, 
perhaps it will be easier to elect future Speakers when all combatants are 
equally untested. But probably not much. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 redistricting by the state Supreme Court -- a task it accepted after 
the Democratic Legislature and the Republican governor couldn't agree on a plan 
-- was politically neutral. Previous reapportionments had favored the party in 
power. But this one, good until the election of 2002, basically guarantees 
closely divided houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts feel it is unlikely that either party will attain more than 44 of the 
80 Assembly seats well into the next decade. Divisions of, say, 42-38 will be 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now there are 40 Republicans, 39 Democrats and one independent. And it's 
even closer than that because one Republican, Richard L. Mountjoy of Arcadia, 
also has been elected to the Senate and is eager to go there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mountjoy says he'll remain an assemblyman until he is assured Brown cannot 
be reelected Speaker -- even if that means forfeiting the Senate seat and 
running for it later in a special election. "I'm going to stay in the Assembly 
until we change leadership," he vows. 
</P>
<P>
 Turmoil seems in the Assembly's immediate future, meaning gridlock and delay 
of the people's business. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds are Horcher will be recalled and replaced by another Republican next 
spring. The GOP also is threatening recalls of rookie Democrats who implied to 
voters they wouldn't support Brown, then did. Two GOP Assembly members, Ross 
Johnson of Placentia and Doris Allen of Cypress, have indicated they'll run for 
the Senate seat being vacated by Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the stabbing and shuffling, the Assembly probably will revert to 
41-39 Republican, the same as it was before Horcher defected. But that will 
take many months. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Brulte learned, this is not a safe margin anyway. Nor is it likely to 
improve much under term limits and honest redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two solutions are needed: one for the short-term problem of electing a 
Speaker; the other for the long-term dilemma of legislating in a house split 
almost down the middle politically, especially when so many important bills 
require 54 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians will fight for the speakership until nobody's left standing as 
long as it is the second most powerful job in state government. So it should be 
weakened, obviously to get the Legislature through 1995, but also to deal with 
the new reality. The Assembly must become more bipartisan with increased power 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean a co-speakership, the impractical suggestion of some people. 
But it does mean divvying up the committees and other house offices between the 
parties, at least next year and perhaps beyond. More power probably should be 
given to the Rules Committee, as in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, the number of Assembly terms and/or their length should be 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, however, Republicans are thinking just one thing: Getting back 
their 41st vote and outlasting Willie Brown. They can do that, but without 
sharing power it will mean much more chaos and stalemate.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; UNCERTAINTY OVER PAY PUTS CHILL ON TEACHERS' YULE; 
EDUCATION: WITH NO WRITTEN GUARANTEE THAT PAYCHECKS WILL ARRIVE JAN. 3, SOME 
SCHOOL PERSONNEL ARE TAKING A GUARDED APPROACH TO HOLIDAY SPENDING AND 
PONDERING EARLY RAIDS ON SUMMER SAVINGS.

 Teacher Lois Anderson is paying cash for her Christmas presents this year, so 
edgy is she that county paychecks may dry up next month. Gail King-Burney said 
there will be no stocking stuffers of music tapes or perfume for her 
16-year-old daughter -- maybe even no tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nervous teachers talk about dipping into summer savings months early. 
</P>
<P>
 Even normally circumspect school superintendents are publicly voicing anger 
that Orange County has yet to guarantee that school employees will be paid Jan. 
3. Some are predicting that their schools will run out of money by spring 
unless they can somehow get at millions of dollars saved in the now-frozen 
county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pay cash instead of charging things," said Anderson, an eighth-grade 
teacher at Fred L. Newhart School in Mission Viejo. Anderson, who has two 
children in college, heads the Capistrano Unified Education Assn., the local 
teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to buy things I can pay for right now because I don't want to be 
facing a huge credit card bill in mid-January or February when the future is in 
question," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top school officials are calling on county leaders to put in writing their 
promises that the county's 20,000 or so public schoolteachers will get their 
next monthly checks Jan. 3. So far, teachers have received only verbal 
assurances that they will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "During these difficult times, the last thing we need is for tens of thousands 
of public employees and hundreds of thousands of their family members to not 
know the status of their payroll checks from paycheck to paycheck," said James 
A. Fleming, superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 County education officials said Sunday that they hope to get written promises 
in hand as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've had from the county is an oral message (that employees) will be 
paid," said John F. Dean, county schools superintendent. "We fully expect their 
payrolls to be met. But we have no guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
 If the pay issue isn't headache enough, those in charge of the county's 31 
school districts are already facing a new set of potential problems -- how to 
pay millions of dollars in routine bills, ranging from employees' medical 
expenses covered by the schools to the cost of installing computers in a new 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to pay those bills is locked up in the county treasury along with 
the other assets frozen after the financially beleaguered county filed for 
bankruptcy last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has told us nothing," said Peter Hartman, superintendent of the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District, which has $66 million deposited in 
the county treasury. "The bottom line is even if we get access to all our 
property taxes and state aid and federal aid, it will not be enough to keep our 
schools open through the spring." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean said that even in the worst case -- schools running out of money to 
pay for paper and lights -- the state is required by its Constitution to bail 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state must provide the education," Dean said. "It must keep the schools 
open. And keeping them open means paying the bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions over whether the funds will be available anytime soon prompted 
officials to hold off on plans to put the final touches on a 400-student 
elementary school in Foothill Ranch over the coming school vacation and move in 
students after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students temporarily housed at another school may have to stay there," 
Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money now frozen with other county funds includes millions of dollars 
needed by the self-insured school district to pay teachers' medical bills. 
Frozen too is interest income that school planners had counted on to meet 
operating expenses such as utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who may have to go into surgery whose insurance is tied up in 
the funds," said Fleming of the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Among many teachers, Yuletide planning is taking a back seat to pondering 
uncertainties about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody's rushing out to spend more money," said Richard Plum, 
who teaches math at Westminster High School. "Teachers and county employees, if 
they haven't purchased (something) by this time, they probably aren't going 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 King-Burney, a teacher in the Santa Ana Unified School District, said she is 
scaling back Christmas plans because even if the Jan. 3 paycheck comes through, 
there is no guarantee that other paychecks will follow. The anxiety has taken 
its toll, she said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; INVESTORS LOOK FOR EDGE, LAWYERS FOR CLIENTS; 
COUNSEL: SCORES OF ATTORNEYS WOO CITIES AND OTHER AGENCIES, WHICH HOPE TO 
IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF RECOVERY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY USE A DIFFERENT 
STRATEGY IN ARGUMENTS TO THE COURT.

 Even before the first hearing is scheduled in Orange County's landmark 
bankruptcy filing, some of the 187 cities, school districts and agencies with 
assets in the county-run investment pool are looking for a legal edge to 
improve their chances of recovery from the ashes of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty over whose claims have priority -- from the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, with more than $1 billion invested in the pool, to 
the Yorba Linda Elementary School District, with $47,480 at stake -- has 
attracted scores, perhaps hundreds, of bankruptcy attorneys and investment 
consulting firms to Orange County, all trolling for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city administrators say they have been inundated with proposals for legal 
representation, unsolicited investment advice and other suggestions for 
maneuvering within the creditors' committees that will be appointed after a 
U.S. trustee has been assigned in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like sharks, there are so many who have contacted us," said Paul O. 
Brady Jr., Irvine's city manager. He said he plans to interview about a dozen 
law firms beginning today and eventually expects to pay between $200 to $500 an 
hour for legal advice on the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we're looking at, but I do know there's going to be too 
much work for our regular city attorney to handle it all," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims against the troubled fund will be driven by more than just the 
mercenary interests of would-be advisers, however. School districts, which were 
required by state law to invest in the county pool, are mainly concerned that 
their payrolls are met; special districts and cities, which often have fewer 
employees, may be more interested in the long-term value of the fund and their 
ability to finance future projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the difference between schools and other agencies, "basically 
we're on a day-to-day basis for our funds, and they're not," said Colleen Wing 
Chandler, assistant superintendent for the Capistrano Unified School District. 
With 33,000 students, Capistrano Unified is the third-largest school district 
in the county. District officials are hiring a bankruptcy attorney, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the county sent out paychecks as scheduled to 28,000 school bus 
drivers, cafeteria workers and secretaries throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Brady, who is president of the Orange County City Managers Assn., 
said three major groups of creditors will emerge: cities, school districts and 
a hybrid alliance that would include water and sanitation districts. The 
largest creditors -- including the transportation authority, which plans to 
select a bankruptcy attorney at a meeting today, will probably remain separate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, each of the three major groups would be represented by a single 
attorney, Brady said. "The last thing that needs to happen is to have 29 or 30 
or whatever number of attorneys in the courtroom looking for access," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the cities can agree to cooperate in court, the larger investors will 
feel compelled to hire their own counsel, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy attorneys and consultants scouting for clients dismiss as naive any 
talk of minimal legal proceedings. By turning to bankruptcy court last Tuesday, 
they say, county officials admitted their own lack of expertise in the complex 
financial transactions, such as derivatives and reverse-repurchase agreements, 
that helped devastate the fund, which lost an estimated $2 billion since Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 City administrators, often unfamiliar with financial markets, are in greater 
need of professional services, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call us vultures, but it's really that the people we represent need 
our help," said one investment banker, who asked that his name not be used. He 
attended a county news conference in Santa Ana late last week to look for 
creditors who might be interested in his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all bureaucrats, and bureaucrats can't keep up with the sophisticated 
financial instruments that the Wall Street guys are using on this one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bennett, partner at a San Francisco law firm that is also looking for 
Orange County clients to represent, said the uncommon nature of the filing will 
also require additional legal work. Previously, the largest municipality to 
file for Chapter 9 protection under the federal bankruptcy code was the city of 
Bridgeport, Conn., with $200 million in bond debt, a fraction of Orange 
County's. That case was dismissed by a judge after the county was found to be 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some individual bondholders have already filed suits against the 
county, Bennett said "the real work is going to be for all the (municipalities) 
that were part of the investment fund, and each of them has their own 
constituency of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to take a while, in excess of one to two years," to sort 
it all out, he said. "I see an awful lot of constituencies . . . and each one 
of them has different financial requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Ury, a board member of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, 
agreed that his district's situation is different enough to warrant separate 
legal counsel. The district plans to confirm its own bankruptcy attorney, from 
an Orange County firm, at its meeting Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our basic focus is going to be that the state compelled us to put the money 
in the fund, so there's a very good chance that the districts will have the 
opportunity to compel the state to resupply our funds," Ury said. "That's a lot 
different than what the cities are going to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the person on the most familiar ground is Corona del Mar investment 
banker Chriss Street, head of an investment consulting company and an early 
critic of former Treasurer Robert L. Citron's heavily leveraged investment 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Street worked with several creditors in one of the largest Chapter 11 
bankruptcy filings to date, that of steelmaker LTV Corp., and this fall he 
helped a large mutual fund file involuntary bankruptcy charges against 
Greyhound Lines Inc., which had been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
from 1990 to 1991 after a nationwide drivers strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a Chapter 9 case should be significantly different from the Chapter 
11 cases he has worked on, Street said he expected to see greater cooperation 
among creditors than in Chapter 11 filings. In those cases, he said, pension 
funds and labor unions with concerns about members' back pay are often at odds 
with vendors, who would often accept a lower payment rate to reach a swifter 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often in (Chapter 11) bankruptcies you see the creditors fight to make sure 
the company doesn't get in a position to wait out the creditors. Chapter 9 is 
dramatically different," he said, because the debtor -- in this case, the 
county -- has more power to decide when and how it will reorganize itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Street said he had spoken to several of the county's creditors and would like 
to work with any creditor committee appointed by the trustee. "I'd be surprised 
if I wasn't at least interviewed" for such a position, he said.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) A Primer on Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 Some basic facts on the bond market and how bonds work: 
</P>
<P>
 Buying bonds 
</P>
<P>
 Investor lends money to a corporation or government with the promise of 
earning a set interest and being paid back their original investment on a 
specific date. 
</P>
<P>
 BOND ISSUERS 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporations: Use money for operating expenses, expansion and modernization 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Treasury: Finances government activities 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipalities: Pay for public projects, finance operating budgets 
</P>
<P>
 Return on Bond 
</P>
<P>
 Investor gets payments every year until bond matures. Example: A 5%, 10-year, 
$1,000 bond yields $50 annually. At maturity, after 10 years, investor gets 
face value of bond -- $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary Trading 
</P>
<P>
 A bond's interest rate is usually fixed at the time of purchase and typically 
does not change even though market interest rates may. However, an investor can 
sell a bond before it matures. Sample scenarios of a sale: 
</P>
<P>
 Discount Selling 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates rise, investor must sell bond below original face value (at 
a "discount") to attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Premium Selling 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates drop, investor can sell bond above original face value (at a 
"premium") because older, higher rate, is attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond Talk 
</P>
<P>
 * Coupon: The interest return a bond pays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maturity date: When a bond expires and must be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Par value: Dollar amount of bond when it is issued. 
</P>
<P>
 * Short-term bond: Normally repays investor in one year or less. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intermediate-term: Investor is paid back in two to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long term: Investor is paid back in one to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investment grade bonds: Highest rated, considered least risky. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Junk" bonds: Lowest rated, paying high yields because risk of default is 
above average.

U.N. OFFICIALS IN BOSNIA LASH OUT AT SERBS; BALKANS: ANGRY CHARGES COME AFTER 
REBELS HIJACK FUEL TANKERS, BAN ARMED ESCORTS OF RELIEF CONVOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. Protection Force officials Sunday accused Bosnian Serbs of deliberately 
undermining their peacekeeping and humanitarian mission after the nationalist 
rebels hijacked U.N. fuel tankers and banned armed escorts of relief convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents were the latest in a monthlong series of humiliations, 
provocations and sabotage directed at the U.N. mission, which has 24,000 troops 
deployed throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming at a time when Western nations are seriously considering a pullout of 
their vulnerable troops, the actions seemed calculated to encourage the 
international community to leave Bosnia at the rebels' mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen surprised Danish military escorts early Sunday at a 
roadblock near the capital, Sarajevo, chasing most U.N. personnel away at 
gunpoint and stealing three tankers, mission spokesman Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the drivers refused to leave their vehicles and were hijacked along 
with the fuel. They were later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt, the U.N. mission's Sarajevo spokesman, called 
the fuel heist "highway robbery and inflamed banditry." 
</P>
<P>
 Constant harassment of the mission supply lines has endangered most U.N. 
operations in Bosnia. The 400 U.N. troops in the "safe area" of Gorazde have 
been forced to make dangerous foot patrols to keep an eye on that city, and all 
armored-vehicle convoy protection was due to cease this week for lack of fuel 
even before the Serbian announcement banning military escorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherding relief convoys into besieged areas of Bosnia is the main task of 
the U.N. mission, and such a ban would render the presence of most troops 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops also are supposed to protect six designated safe areas -- Gorazde, 
Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac. But their presence in those 
enclaves is largely symbolic and has done little to deter artillery attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that the 
agency would be unable to deliver food, medicine and shelter supplies to 
embattled communities without U.N. military escorts across Serbian lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unacceptable demand on the part of the Bosnian Serbs," Risley 
said. "This indicates an organized attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to create 
conditions for the continued delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians within 
their territory but without any UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) presence. They 
are saying they don't need UNPROFOR." 
</P>
<P>
 That has been the message from the Serbs for weeks as they have grabbed U.N. 
troops as insurance against further air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and have trapped peacekeepers guarding besieged enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 European Union officials who met over the weekend pushed for maintaining the 
troubled peacekeeping mission as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But a deadlock in peace negotiations has heightened concerns in 
troop-contributing countries about the safety of peacekeepers and has escalated 
moves to pull them out.

ISRAEL, JORDAN OPEN EMBASSIES IN EACH OTHER'S LARGEST CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a historic move, former adversaries Israel and Jordan officially opened 
embassies Sunday in each other's largest cities, making Jordan the second Arab 
country to establish an embassy in the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordanian Foreign Ministry official Omar Rifai said the raising of his 
national flag in Tel Aviv marked not only the implementation of an October 
peace treaty that ended a 46-year state of war between Jordan and Israel "but 
also a new beginning in our bilateral relations for the benefit of both our 
peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tel Aviv ceremony drew applause from onlookers, in sharp contrast with the 
opening of Israel's embassy in Amman earlier Sunday, which sparked protests by 
hundreds of Muslim militants and leftists who described the occasion as a 
"black day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassadors will be exchanged in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Amman, Israeli Foreign Ministry official Yaov Biran unveiled a plaque 
reading "Embassy of Israel" in English, Arabic and Hebrew before raising the 
blue and white flag on a pole outside the Forte Grand Hotel in the city's 
financial district. 
</P>
<P>
 Biran said he hoped the move will inspire Syria and Lebanon to reach similar 
treaties with Israel. Egypt, the only other Arab nation with an embassy in 
Israel, made peace with the Jewish state in 1979.

POLITICS; ARIZONA SAYS SO LONG TO AN INSTITUTION; POLLY ROSENBAUM SHAPED STATE 
LAW FOR 22 TERMS. SHE LOST THIS YEAR'S ELECTION, BUT NOBODY COUNTS HER OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN ROVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the state Capitol here, 95-year-old Edwynne C. (Polly) Rosenbaum is 
regarded as an institution -- an indefatigable Democratic lawmaker who has been 
around so long that she can claim friendship with the first governor. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with a deep sense of loss among old-guard politicos that the state 
representative was defeated Nov. 8 after serving 22 consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 She has held her seat since 1949, when she replaced her husband, William G. 
(Rosie) Rosenbaum, who died during his 22nd year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her accomplishments seem suited for display in a museum. Rosenbaum is 
credited with removing spittoons from the House chambers, eliminating 
miniskirts as options for female pages and securing funds for rural libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to run (for reelection) on $100," Rosenbaum said, adding that that is 
not the only thing that has changed for the worse in Arizona politics. 
Lobbyists "are changing into a different breed." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of young whippersnappers who don't think legislators know 
anything," she said. "But I usually can tell them: 'I know more about that than 
you do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Arizona will have to make do without a Rosenbaum overseeing affairs in 
the 4th District, a sprawling mining and ranching region in the eastern part of 
the state, for the first time in 67 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially painful for her admirers: Rosenbaum lost to a 43-year-old 
businessman with no political experience who was put over the top by 
redistricting and the anti-incumbency mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in this state still can't believe she was defeated," said former U.S. 
Sen. Barry Goldwater, 86. "Not because she is a Democrat living in a Democratic 
state, but just because she's so damn good that everybody wanted to see her 
stay in the Legislature as long as she wanted -- and I have a hunch that was 
where she planned to spend her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum is spending her last days in office much like the previous 45 years: 
sprinting through the corridors of power and almost always taking the stairs 
instead of the elevator to her third-floor office. She is also making final 
checks on favorite legislative projects -- to the chagrin of some state 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Rosenbaum was touring historic sites that she saved from the 
wrecking ball -- a mineral and mining museum, a Victorian mansion and the 
Arizona Hall of Fame -- when she spied a staff member taking a break in the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to this handrail? Why isn't it fixed?" she barked, standing on 
the porch of the mansion, which now houses a state tourism bureau. "Who is 
going to take care of all these details when I'm gone?" 
</P>
<P>
 That question is being asked a lot these days. Rosenbaum played a role in 
shaping nearly all of the state's laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a philosophy of "keep your mouth shut and your ears open," she rarely 
authored or lobbied for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 When she did, colleagues looked up and took note. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you'd hear on the floor was: 'That's Polly's bill, that's Polly's bill,' 
" said Edward Guerrero, a Gila County supervisor and former state 
representative who served with Rosenbaum from 1971 to 1987. "And all you would 
see were green lights. When she got behind something, it would move." 
</P>
<P>
 She voted against ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment but spearheaded a 
committee that gutted the state constitution of all gender-specific language. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the sensible thing to do," Rosenbaum said. "Fix the laws you already 
have. Don't make more of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not about to waste Rosenbaum's long institutional memory, Gov. Fife Symington 
is trying to create an appointed post for the former schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet political pundits say it is too soon to eliminate Rosenbaum as a comeback 
candidate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about that possibility, Rosenbaum removed her glasses and, with a 
sparkle in her blue eyes, said: "I wouldn't rule it out."

POLITICS; MAYOR MOVES TO SHAKE UP SANTA FE; DEBBIE JARAMILLO IS LAUDED, 
LAMBASTED IN HER BID TO RECLAIM 'TRUE SOUL' OF ENCLAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Contentious, independent and fiercely protective of this city's vanishing 
Latino culture and traditions, Mayor Debbie Jaramillo is not for those who like 
their civic leaders warm and fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaramillo, 42, was elected in March on a pledge to reverse trends that in less 
than a decade had transformed this 384-year-old former Spanish settlement on 
the southern flanks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains into an enclave for 
wealthy tourists and transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in what some view as a bold experiment to spark cultural regeneration 
through legislation, this self-described "Chicana infiltrator" is trying to 
reshape a government that for years stoked the tourism and development furnace 
with no regard for its effect on average-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaramillo's first nine months in office have brought significant changes to 
this city of 62,000 people -- and negative reviews from critics who contend she 
is "anti-Anglo," an enemy of tourism and vindictive toward anyone who disagrees 
with her philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that many Latino supporters have cloaked Jaramillo in a folk-hero 
myth adds additional pressure on her to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that many people are expecting more out of me than just being a 
mayor. I'm a role model for women and Hispanics too," Jaramillo said. "All I 
want to do is help people who've been neglected for years, and they happen to 
be mostly Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I'm done four years from now," she added, "the term community is 
going to mean something again around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Her critics' sentiments are reflected in a sign tacked above the bar at the 
Bull Ring, a watering hole where Santa Fe's powerbrokers gather for green chili 
stew, beer and gossip. It says: "Debbie Happens." 
</P>
<P>
 There, debates continue about Jaramillo's recent decision to cancel $30,000 
worth of city advertising in the local daily newspaper, the New Mexican, in 
response to articles that criticized her failure to take a public stand against 
recent downtown muggings and rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say her silence about the crimes only confirms suspicions that she is 
anti-tourist and raises fears that Santa Fe could suffer from the kind of bad 
publicity that has hurt Florida tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even find fault with her aim to foster growth of cottage industries in a 
place where high-rollers and movie stars cruise through town in $50,000 Range 
Rovers and walk down the narrow streets wearing the latest creations of 
European fashion designers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cottage industries? That's not who we are," grumbled Jaramillo's predecessor, 
Sam Pick. "Tourists come to this town for the art galleries, the food and the 
opera -- not for homemade earrings and other stuff they could buy on a sidewalk 
in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaramillo says Pick is missing the point. 
</P>
<P>
 This city's ethnic heritage, she argues, is being packaged and sold by 
commercial interests as "Santa Fe-style" in pricey art galleries, boutiques and 
restaurants, and in the fake adobe mansions sprouting up in old Latino 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, average folks are having to migrate to trailer parks on the fringes 
of town because of soaring property taxes and low-paying jobs in fast-food 
restaurants, trinket shops and stop-and-go markets. 
</P>
<P>
 To reclaim the "true soul" of Santa Fe, Jaramillo wants to funnel more tourism 
dollars into local improvements and to create affordable housing in a place 
where an average home costs $100,000 while the median annual income hovers 
around $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 She has already hired a new police chief dedicated to community-based law 
enforcement, which emphasizes cooperation with residents. And she is now 
leading efforts to have developers voluntarily give a portion of their profits 
to the city for affordable housing in return for building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed zoning law to be voted on in March would require developers to 
include affordable housing in their plans, or, as Jaramillo describes it, "mix 
rich and poor in the new neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm here, developers will have to give something back or they 
won't get," Jaramillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her detractors: "I've been blamed for everything from crime to realtors 
going out of business. As long as they're not blaming me for what's going on in 
Bosnia, I guess I'm doing all right."

DELORS DECLINES TO SEEK FRENCH PRESIDENCY; EUROPE: OUTGOING EU OFFICIAL WAS 
MOST POPULAR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE ON THE LEFT. DECISION PAVES WAY FOR A 
CONTENTIOUS BATTLE BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite polls showing him the clear favorite for the French presidency, 
Jacques Delors stunned the nation Sunday night by announcing that he will not 
run to succeed retiring President Francois Mitterrand in elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Delors -- the 69-year-old president of the European Union 
Executive Commission and, like Mitterrand, a Socialist -- took the most popular 
potential candidate on the left out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 It also set the stage for a nasty fight between two conservative contenders, 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, both members of 
the Rally for the Republic party. The two longtime friends are not on speaking 
terms these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors' announcement, made nearly 45 minutes into a live interview on France's 
most popular current affairs program, ended a months-long Socialist Party 
effort to draft him for the April elections. It was a campaign that Delors, who 
will step down next month as EU leader, had not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't an easy decision to take," Delors said, and he cited "lots of 
personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked for 50 years, and in these conditions it's more reasonable to 
envisage a lifestyle more balanced between reflection and action," he said. His 
wife was known to be lobbying against a presidential try. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors, often called "Mr. Europe," is widely respected on the Continent. 
During his 10 years as head of the EU's Executive Commission, internal trade 
barriers in Western Europe have been significantly lowered and the region has 
made important strides toward political and economic unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, more practical political considerations also played a role in his 
decision. As a Socialist president with a right-wing National Assembly, he 
would have had his ability to lead the country severely restricted. And he 
acknowledged Sunday that even if he dissolved the Assembly, new elections 
probably would result in another strong rightist majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the seat held for 13 1/2 years by Mitterrand, who is 78 and has prostate 
cancer, is almost certain to go to someone on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirac already has announced his intention to run. Although Balladur has not 
formally declared himself a candidate, he leads Chirac in the polls and is 
expected to announce soon. Other right-wing candidates might also be drawn into 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of elections is scheduled for April 23, with the two top 
finishers squaring off May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between Chirac and Balladur has fascinated French voters and 
sharply divided the right-wing coalition that swept to power in the National 
Assembly during a decisive victory in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When the right took power, Chirac and other party leaders settled on Balladur, 
a little-known moderate, to keep the prime minister's seat warm until the 
presidential elections. Chirac has said there was a gentleman's agreement that 
Balladur would then step aside for his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Balladur turned out to be a popular prime minister in his own right, 
earning a reputation as a thoughtful, soft-spoken leader willing to listen to 
his critics. Until talk of a Delors candidacy surfaced, he held a strong lead 
in most polls. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Chirac, a former prime minister, is saddled with an Old 
Guard image at a time when French voters are seeking new leaders. And his 
bombastic style is likely to hurt him against the even-tempered Balladur. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Party leaders said Sunday that they will choose their candidate next 
month. Among those mentioned as possible candidates are Lionel Jospin, a former 
eduction minister, and Jack Lang, a former culture minister.

 A bomb exploded on a Philippines Airlines flight carrying 292 people, blowing 
a two-foot hole beneath the passengers' feet and setting the ceiling on 
fire.One passenger was killed and six were injured. The Boeing 747, with 272 
passengers and 20 crew members aboard, made a safe emergency landing about an 
hour later at Naha airport on Okinawa in southern Japan. It had been on its way 
to Tokyo from the Philippines. Several hours later, a caller claiming to belong 
to Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim fundamentalist group, telephoned the Associated Press 
in Manila and claimed responsibility. Police identified the man killed as 
Haruki Ikegami, 24, of Japan, who had been working in the Philippines.

 Witnesses of genocide attacks on minority Tutsis in Rwanda are being singled 
out for execution by extremist Hutus in refugee camps in southwest Rwanda, a 
U.N. spokesman said in Kigali, the capital. Capt. Stephane Grenier said 
violence had increased in the camps in that area. "People have been killed with 
machetes and in grenade attacks," he added. U.N. officials said the slayings 
appeared to be the work of gangs from the former Rwandan army, which was ousted 
by the Rwandan Patriotic Front in July, and members of the Hutu militia known 
as the Interahamwe who were responsible for the attacks on Tutsis.

 Patricia Saveall can still hear the words from the airport official who called 
that day: "The plane has gone down." 
</P>
<P>
 The young mother screamed so loudly she awakened her 8-year-old daughter. "I 
told her Daddy had been in an accident, but we didn't know how bad it was," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, she learned how bad: No one had survived the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Later still, she would find out that air safety investigators believed the 
accident may have been prevented if the commuter plane her husband, Alan 
Saveall, had been riding in had been equipped with a device that warns when a 
plane strays too close to terrain. Such devices weren't required in small 
commuter planes until 1992 -- seven years after Alan Saveall's death in Auburn, 
Me. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash devastated the Saveall family, and Patricia was forced to raise her 
two children, then 6 and 8, on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it all the time, especially when I hear about other air 
crashes," Saveall of Waterville, Me., said. "I think about how he died. What 
his last thoughts were. Why it had to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Saveall last spoke to her husband on the night of the crash when he called to 
say his flight had been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane did not land as scheduled later that evening, she called the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such a big part of our lives. It takes a long time to grieve," she 
said. "I had two children, and I decided they had to come first. I decided I 
had to be strong for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a point of not forgetting him when we lost him," she added. "He is in 
our conversations. I felt the children needed to hear his name. . . . We make 
references to him almost every day, when we see a grimace or a walk that remind 
us of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll never die."

 It's been five years since Aloha Islandair Flight 1712, a commuter plane, 
crashed into a mountainside on the Hawaiian island of Molokai, killing 20 
people, including members of a high school volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sores have healed but the inside is still bleeding," said Rosemay Ku, 
whose nephew Testa Ku, 14, was killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved his sports and outdoors," Ku said. "He was the kind of guy who put 
his mind to it and was victorious." His team had won the volleyball tournament 
and he was overjoyed about coming home. "He was so happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Helm's 16-year-old daughter, Natale, also died in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke to her the night (before the crash)," Helm said. "My last words to 
her were that I'd see her tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the Federal Aviation 
Administration contributed to the crash by not providing sufficient 
surveillance of Aloha Islandair's operation. The NTSB also said that a 
low-altitude warning device "would have provided sufficient warning for the 
crew to have pulled up and overflown the terrain." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was placing my trust in the federal government," Helm said.

 Sixteen-year-old Sandra Schultz of West Chicago had always wanted to fly. And 
that morning in September, 1991, her father, Dennis, was as proud as could be 
to take her up in his Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 They climbed into the tiny plane, got clearance for takeoff, but as the 
aircraft started to climb, the engine sputtered. Dennis Schultz lost control 
and the plane crashed in an industrial park, killing father and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB determined that the plane crashed because of a flaw in a carburetor 
part, known as a two-part venturi, that was first recognized in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my understanding," said Sandra's mother, Cathryn L. Brouwer of Elgin, 
Ill., "the part had been faulty for a long time. And I couldn't understand, if 
it was faulty for that amount of time, why my daughter had to die. Something 
should have been done beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody needs to be held accountable. If it's an accident, it's one thing. 
But this wasn't an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 18 months after the crash, the FAA issued a directive, requiring that the 
flaw be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Schultz had just started her junior year of high school. She wanted to 
be a commercial pilot, and had recently talked to Navy recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a fortune buying flying magazines so she could cut pictures out," 
Brouwer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can't happen. That is their job. They're supposed to be for the safety 
of the people," Brouwer said. "What I want to know is, who does their deciding 
on when they act and when they don't? Does it sit in somebody's box for a 
couple of years and nobody does anything with it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unnecessary. She was healthy, popular, energetic, a dancer, so full 
of life, and to have to die from someone else's mistakes . . ." Brouwer's voice 
trailed off.

RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN WIN RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS FOR 3RD YEAR 
</P>

 Ben Jones didn't have much time Sunday to celebrate his Rhodes scholarship. 
After all, scholars have to hit the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I have a big exam tomorrow.You can't get away from the exams," 
said the 22-year-old Princeton University student, one of 32 Americans who 
received the prestigious academic award. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanical engineering student from Falmouth, Mass., said it was a long 
road to the prize, which offers winners a chance to study next fall at Oxford 
University in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough competition. You . . . feel surprised when you get to be the 
lucky name at the end of it all," said Jones, who also climbs rocks, plays 
piano and guitar and tutors prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 18 women -- a record number for the third straight year -- and 14 
men were named Rhodes scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was created in 1902 and first opened to women in 1976. The program's 
criteria include academic achievement, integrity, leadership and athletic 
prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard led the field with six scholars. Princeton followed with three 
students. Twenty-three schools were represented. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32 Americans were chosen from 1,253 applicants. About 60 scholars were 
chosen from 17 other countries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, administered through Pomona College in Claremont, was established 
by the estate of Cecil Rhodes, a British philanthropist and South African 
colonist.

MAN MISSING 8 DAYS AT BIG SUR IS FOUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Rafael man who disappeared after going for a walk at the Esalen 
Institute eight days ago was found in a hollowed-out tree trunk where he had 
taken refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bloodhounds fixed on David Leon Holt's scent when they were brought into 
the search Saturday and tracked him down in about two hours, said their owner, 
Maury Tripp of Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, 48, was suffering from frostbite on his left foot, hypothermia and other 
complaints. He was hospitalized in serious but stable condition Sunday night, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt was last seen packing his car Dec. 2. He decided to take one last walk 
that afternoon before dinner and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt told Tripp that he found himself in a steep canyon as darkness fell. He 
tried to take a shortcut back to the institute but fell and hurt himself and 
could not walk. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next eight days sheltered in the tree trunk to keep dry from the 
rain, and crawled to a stream every day to drink, Tripp said.

LION SUSPECTED OF KILLING SAN DIEGO WOMAN IS SLAIN 
</P>

 The campgrounds at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park will remain closed until rangers 
determine whether a mountain lion shot to death Saturday night is the same big 
cat that apparently killed a San Diego woman earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to open the park and find out this was not the right lion," 
said Homer Townsend, a chief ranger with the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game trackers late Saturday shot and killed a mountain 
lion near the hiking trail where a woman's mauled body was found around noon. 
</P>
<P>
 She was identified by the county medical examiner as Iris Kenna, 58, a San 
Diego high school teacher. Townsend said Kenna was an inveterate birdwatcher 
who frequently went to the park in the Cleveland National Forest 50 miles east 
of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy results are pending. If Kenna died in such an attack, she would be the 
fourth person killed by a mountain lion in California since record-keeping 
began early in the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lions are solitary and territorial animals and do not often stray 
into another lion's hunting area. For that reason, trackers are confident that 
the German shepherd-sized lion shot Saturday was the one that clawed and mauled 
Kenna. 
</P>
<P>
 A necropsy will include tests to see if there is human blood on the animal's 
claws and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenna's body was found about 50 feet off Cuyamaca Fire Peak Road, a trail 
frequently used by hikers. Investigators speculated that she may have tried to 
run from the lion and was chased and caught from behind.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; AT MALLS, DEBACLE SAPS SPIRITS, NOT SPENDING;

 'Tis the season to be jolly . . . just don't mention the B-word to holiday 
crowds in Orange County's glittering shopping meccas. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration of bankruptcy by one of the nation's richest counties hasn't 
put a bite on most people's Christmas budgets just yet -- but it has taken a 
chunk out of their Yuletide spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly seems to cast a dull glow over the county in general," said 
39-year-old Mark Lerner of Costa Mesa, a real estate attorney who shopped with 
his wife and daughter Sunday at South Coast Plaza. "I think Orange County's 
glamour has certainly been stripped away." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest municipal bond debacle in U.S. history seems so far to have 
pounded residents' pride more than their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are a little embarrassed to be living in Orange County," said 
Dale Jenkins, 35, as he cooled his heels at Fashion Island in Newport Beach. 
"Between the earthquake, the recession and now this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, a financial analyst for an aerospace company, said he still was 
"spending away" -- he'd taken one load of gifts to his car and was working up 
the energy to take another. But he sees trouble ahead, possibly in the form of 
a tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the parking lots were packed at the two posh malls; the lines to Santa's 
lap were long and winding. Yet beneath the buying bustle and good cheer, other, 
less pleasant emotions lurked: fear of what is to come -- and seething anger. 
</P>
<P>
 The way many shoppers see it, former county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron took the people's money and lost it in a giant, unsupervised craps game, 
sticking them with the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of those (tax payments) of mine were made out to R. L. 'Bob' 
Citron?" Lerner said. One of his friends, he said, made his check this year out 
to "Boob" Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to think about it," said Adele Lynas, 40, of San Juan Capistrano, 
who sat outside Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza. "I work full-time. Both me and 
my husband try to make ends meet. As taxpayers, we count on the county to do 
good by (us) and I don't think they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynas' friend Suzan Perez said she can't afford not to think about the 
county's crisis. She is a calendar clerk for South Orange County Municipal 
Court and wonders where her next few paychecks will be coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can tell, that's not my shopping bag," she said pointing to Lynas' 
overflowing sack. Perez's friends and relatives will be seeing a lot more cards 
than packages from her this year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was scant evidence at major Orange County malls Sunday of a 
falloff in consumer demand, the bankruptcy announcement came just as businesses 
were recovering from several lean years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 There's probably enough pent-up consumer demand to buffer the retail trade 
from the county's financial problems, said Tony Cherbak, an accountant who 
follows the retail industry from Costa Mesa for Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect it will have some impact on sales, but it's too early to determine 
just how bad it will be," Cherbak said. "Right now, it's just some really bad 
news coming at a time when people were really feeling pretty optimistic. What's 
bad is that people will start to fear that they're going to be taxed at a 
higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is that we've had fires, riots, earthquakes and a recession," 
Cherbak said. "It's just not something you want to see at the most important 
season of the (retail) year."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; AUDITOR GENERAL NO STRANGER TO TROUBLE; STATE: 
KURT SJOBERG HAS INVESTIGATED SEVERAL FISCAL SCANDALS ON PUBLIC'S BEHALF. BUT 
SOME QUESTION THE CLOUT HIS OFFICE CAN BRING TO THE ORANGE COUNTY SITUATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In enlisting State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg to help unravel the riddle of Orange 
County's fiscal crisis, Gov. Pete Wilson tapped a veteran numbers-cruncher 
whose findings command respect in state government. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not stop some from grumbling that the auditor has no 
follow-through or enforcement powers of his own -- or from wondering when state 
officials might take strong action in response to Orange County's debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg has been the eyes and ears of the public in numerous financial 
scandals since his appointment 16 months ago, the governor's office points out. 
His investigations have uncovered financial irregularities or sloppiness in the 
state lottery, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Education Department and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg is being brought into the Orange County flap by a man who knows well 
the skills that are needed: county financial adviser Thomas Hayes, who was the 
state auditor general before becoming state treasurer in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that Tom recommended to the governor," said H.D. Palmer, 
assistant director of the state Department of Finance. "Tom wants to cover all 
the bases diligently." 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg could not be reached for comment Sunday. But Palmer said he "wouldn't 
concur with any assessment" of Sjoberg that underscores his lack of authority 
to enforce recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt is very respected, and the Legislature has responded well to his past 
findings," Palmer said. "I think a great deal of attention would be paid to 
Kurt's work and the findings by his team." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh dismissed questions about Sjoberg's 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going in to assess the situation and to give Orange County a hand," 
Walsh said. "These are expert accountants and, political criticisms aside, 
their assistance is a valuable resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Sjoberg and his crew will examine Orange County's income to see 
whether it matches what the county needs to pay its bills. But his role will 
not necessarily be limited to that. He may also be relied upon to determine how 
to protect incoming receipts and future revenues from raids by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Sjoberg nearly saw his office shut down because of 
government coffers emptied in the wake of Proposition 140's budget-slashing 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor and Legislature moved in to restore funding after determining 
that the auditor's office saved taxpayers $6 for every $1 spent on its audits.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BANKRUPTCY'S MANY CHAPTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. bankruptcy laws, initially patterned on British provisions, provide for 
the orderly relationship between debtors and creditors. As federal law has 
evolved, states also have enacted their own statutes. But federal laws prevail 
in any conflict, under the supremacy clause of the Constitution. Here are the 
types of bankruptcy under the federal code:  
</P>
<P>
 CHAPTER 7: Colloquially referred to as "straight bankruptcy," this relates to 
liquidation of the estate. It allows individuals to keep some personal 
property. Other assets must be sold to pay at least part of the debt. Those 
eligible to liquidate under this chapter include: individuals, partnerships or 
corporations with a residence or place of business in the United States. 
Railroads, banks, insurance companies and savings and loans are not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 CHAPTER 11: Individuals are eligible for this type of bankruptcy protection, 
but it is designed primarily for reorganization of businesses. It is so complex 
that is of limited value for smaller businesses and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 CHAPTER 13: This allows repayments of debt over time for individuals with 
regular incomes -- wages, welfare payments, pensions, etc. It is limited to 
individuals of modest resources. Extended payments are allowed for up to five 
years.

THE HUNGER WARS; SCHOOLS WITHOUT BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One hundred ninety-three schools in six Southern California counties should 
begin a breakfast program because they have so many low-income children, the 
California Department of Education says. In these schools, 40% or more of the 
students would qualify for a free or reduced-price meal, subsidized by the 
federal government. Numerous studies say breakfast programs significantly 
improve children's health and ability to learn, but many school officials say 
the logistic barriers can be overwhelming. LOS ANGELES COUNTY

 They sang carols slightly off-key. And for a day, during their holiday 
pageant, the children became cardboard Christmas trees and gingerbread men. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the happy appearance of pupils at Riverdale Elementary School in 
Garden Grove lie sobering statistics: About three-quarters of the enrollment, 
approximately 450 students, come from families poor enough to qualify for 
government-subsidized meals. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the students eats breakfast at the school, however. It is one of 22 
elementary and secondary schools in the Garden Grove Unified School District 
that do not offer morning meals, even though they qualify as "needy" schools 
under government criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverdale Principal Fred Clair said the school plans to apply for the 
breakfast program soon, but does not think it is needed. "We're trying to be an 
educational institution and we're evolving into a social institution," he said. 
If first grade Riverdale teacher Patti Burnette sees a hungry student, she 
calls the child's parents to tell them to feed the child. "I feel like people 
need to accept responsibility for their children and it's not the school's 
place to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 31 "needy" Orange County schools qualify for -- but do not offer -- a 
breakfast program largely underwritten by the federal government. Among them 
are two elementary schools in the Orange Unified School District. Judy Ross, 
Orange Unified food services director, has encouraged schools to offer 
before-class meals, as students who qualify for subsidized meals in the 
district have jumped to 37% from 15% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove -- the county's second-largest school district -- officials 
say they are committed to school breakfast, but lag behind other districts in 
implementing the program because changes in families' economic status are 
recent. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grade Garden Grove teacher Jolene Lichty rewards her students with 
snacks -- bear-shaped cookies that she pays for herself. "It really gets them 
to respond," Lichty said. "Some of them are hungry." ALICIA DI RADO

 In Ventura County, only 15% of children eligible for free or reduced-price 
school breakfasts get to eat them, according to the California Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Elementary School District -- one of the county's largest, serving 
some of its poorest communities -- is trying to phase in breakfast at the 
neediest of its 15 elementary schools within a year. Two years ago, officials 
started serving breakfast at Juanita Elementary School in the heart of Oxnard's 
poorest neighborhood, La Colonia. There was a notable jump in student classroom 
performance, says Principal Tony Zubia, who says some officials credit the 
breakfasts with boosting CLAS test scores at the school, now renamed Cesar E. 
Chavez School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were more attentive; we didn't have as many kids coming in to me 
about stubborn problems, or feeling lightheaded because they hadn't eaten," 
Zubia said. Within a month, breakfast will be served at two more elementary 
schools in the 14,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme School District also is phasing in breakfast programs at five 
needy elementary schools in Port Hueneme and south Oxnard, says Associate Supt. 
Jeff Baarstad, who oversees 11 schools and 7,860 students. Three elementary 
schools already serve breakfast. The district has no plans, however, to serve 
breakfast at two needy junior high schools -- Blackstock Elementary and Green 
Elementary. Younger students may not be able to feed themselves if left to 
their own devices, but junior-high students can look after themselves, Baarstad 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel in the school district that our core purpose as an organization is 
academic achievement," Baarstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 No breakfast program exists in the Fillmore Unified School District, where 
more than half the 3,420 students at its five schools are eligible for free or 
reduced-price meals. The district believes the logistics of shifting bus 
schedules, juggling staff schedules and paying for extra custodial and 
cafeteria staff time makes it too difficult, says Barbara Spieler, the 
district's business manager. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the application papers for a special state grant that helps schools 
finance breakfast start-ups arrived too close to the Dec. 1 filing deadline, 
Spieler says. Next year, they'll probably look into it, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some Fillmore teachers share their own food with hungry students, 
or send them to the cafeteria for a free carton of milk to hold them over until 
lunch, one teacher says. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fillmore district nurse Martha Romero continues to lobby hard for a 
breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero sees some poor families who cut out breakfasts to save food money for 
the evening meal. Many parents just do not push their children to eat in the 
morning because they leave early for work or simply do not care, she says. 
Sometimes, hungry children come to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come to the nurse's office complaining of headaches or stomachaches," 
she said. "I ask them, 'Did you eat your breakfast?' and they say, 'No.' 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they focus? How can they concentrate? How can they remember?" she 
asks. MACK REED

 In San Bernardino County, supporters of school breakfast say they struggle 
against resistance from some administrators and teachers, limitations on food 
preparation facilities, and the fact that many buses already roll as early as 
5:30 a.m. to get students to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Robinson, director of food services at Morongo Valley Unified School 
District -- where none of the 11 schools that qualify offer breakfast -- says 
that his schools are spread out in a desert expanse of 1,350 square miles and 
that some students have to catch buses at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all recognize the importance of getting the children fed, but it becomes a 
severe problem of busing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colton Joint Unified is considering trying to deal with the problem by feeding 
students on buses, says food services director Esther Klepper. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monte Vista Elementary School in the Ontario-Montclair School District, 91% 
of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals. The school doesn't offer 
breakfast because it lacks a preparatory kitchen. (Other California schools 
with similar problems offer simple fare that can be delivered: a muffin, juice 
and milk.) Lunch is trucked in to Monte Vista from a nearby middle school, and 
administrators say a proposed expansion of the district's central kitchen will 
allow for a breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've noticed a lot more apparent hunger," said Monte Vista's Edna Hart, a 
teacher for the past 32 years, who says social and economic changes are driving 
the increased need. "They are much more lethargic than in years past." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1975, Jody Novak has been a teacher in the Hesperia Unified district, 
which has nine "high-need" schools that do not offer breakfast. (Two have 
applied to join the program.) For a long time, Novak has handed out snacks to 
hungry students. "I used to give them hard-boiled eggs because I was raising 
chickens," she said. "We have not really dealt with (hunger) as a district or 
as a community." LISA RESPERS

 Riverside County, which has had breakfast programs at most of its 22 districts 
for about four years, has 14 high-need schools without a program. Some are 
continuation high schools, specialized schools for disabled children, or have 
small enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moreno Valley, a small student body makes breakfast economically 
impractical at two of the three schools without a program, says food services 
director Lia Robinson. Still, she said, "We have been promoting breakfast from 
Day One, and we are trying to add those other schools soon." 
</P>

 Community pressure has played a role in getting districts to offer breakfast. 
Claudia Galvez, a community worker for the California Rural Legal Assistance 
Co., saw the need at two elementary schools in the Coachella Valley. She called 
her local school superintendent and inquired about morning meals. Now, all 
schools in the Coachella Valley area have programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Having breakfast programs is particularly important in the Coachella Valley 
because many children of migrant farm workers cannot afford breakfast, Galvez 
says. FRANK B. WILLIAMS

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NOT JUST ANOTHER DAY AT TAX COLLECTOR'S OFFICE; 
REACTION: PROPERTY OWNERS GRUMBLE AND VENT ANGER AT THE SITUATION IN ORANGE 
COUNTY. BUT THEY ARE ALSO RESIGNED TO PAYING THEIR DEBT DESPITE THE DEBACLE.

 No clenching of fists, no stomping of feet, no rending of garments. Only the 
soft, steady tearing of checks from checkbooks was heard at the Orange County 
tax collector's office, where miffed taxpayers said they were making the best 
protest available to them -- holding out on the county until about the last 
possible minute. 
</P>
<P>
 That final moment comes today at 5 p.m., the deadline for the first 
installment of yearly property taxes. Thereafter, taxpayers face a 10% penalty 
-- a fairly rigid posture, some grumble, for a government not able to pay its 
own bills on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to be paid," said Jan Whitman, a Newport Beach homeowner who was at 
the tax office Friday afternoon and who has been chipping into the community 
pot for seven years. "I didn't feel that I have any right at this point in time 
to make a political statement by not paying my taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, property taxes are due Dec. 10. But Whitman and many others assumed 
-- incorrectly -- that with the 10th falling on the weekend and the county 
filing for bankruptcy, the deadline would be moved back to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those protesting or procrastinating taxpayers who flocked to the Santa Ana 
Civic Center to render unto Caesar were resigned -- and also resentful -- about 
paying tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of unease were everywhere. From the overflowing suggestion box -- more 
stuffed than a Christmas turkey -- to the armed guard, stationed behind the 
cashiers after a threat was lodged last week. The mood was tense, even for a 
tax collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smells like the dentist's office," Mike Morrees said to his buddy as they 
walked in during the lunch-hour rush. In fact, many people seemed to be wearing 
a ready-for-root-canal grimace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's horrible that it was such a gross mismanagement of funds," said 
David Obrand, 24, of Laguna Beach. Making his first-ever property tax payment, 
he marveled that a young man should be able to manage money when a corps of 
people his father's age can't. 
</P>
<P>
 "From at least my understanding, there was such a lack of diversity in the 
portfolio," said Obrand, a graduate of Claremont McKenna College. "I think this 
is just mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
 But like almost everyone else who came to the counter Friday, he was not 
throwing a tantrum or scowling at the cashiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to pay it anyway," he said. "So whether or not they go bankrupt doesn't 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Ray Hudson, an Anaheim entrepreneur who urged others to put the 
county's predicament into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he said he did not mind giving Orange County $230 in taxes on his 
little house because he believes the county to be quite vibrant financially. 
The county still has billions in its portfolio, he noted, a sum he considers 
ungodly. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate this notion, Hudson said a million seconds computes to about 12 
days, whereas a billion seconds equals about 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the media," he said, laughing, "they tend to look at the negative 
side of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting perspective on the day was offered by Steve Winston, a 
traffic officer in the Santa Ana Police Department who arrived at the 
collector's office in full uniform, including his dark, Darth Vader sunglasses 
and enormous motorcycle helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like people feel about tickets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Death, taxes "and someday getting a ticket from me," he said -- these are the 
verities of life. "I look at it like it's just one of those things you have to 
go through."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; VOICES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Orange County residents reacted with frustration and anger at the 
county's financial crisis. here is a sampling of comments received from readers 
invited to telephone the newspaper's TimesLine number with their comments.  
</P>
<P>
 Would Robert Citron or Supervisor Riley have mortgaged their homes to bet at 
the horse races? Probably not, but they borrowed and used other people's money 
to do that same thing. I think it is a failure of Orange County management. I 
hope that other people besides Robert Citron are called to account for this so 
that is not put solely on his shoulders.

 I'm an elementary school teacher, and I feel that the school districts are 
being placed in great jeopardy when they are mandated by the state to put their 
funds in county investment situations. I don't feel that school districts 
should be punished for that when they have no choice in the matter. 
</P>

 I feel very concerned about the situation in Orange County, and I think 
taxpayers will end up having to pay for this mess. Robert Citron, as the person 
in charge of this fund, is very responsible, and my question is: Why wasn't 
there a system of checks and balances for somebody who had so much 
responsibility with so much money? 
</P>
<P>

 I don't know quite what Citron had in his mind except that he evidently was 
greedy. But I'm thinking of the county controllers elsewhere in the country who 
said, "I would never invest in any type of instrument I don't understand." 
</P>

<P>
 There have been several warning signs in the last year about the fund that the 
county invested in. When interest rates first turned around and started to 
rise, that was a warning shot across the bow. Then in six weeks to eight weeks, 
another shot was fired and rates went up again. After that point, no one that I 
know could understand why the county didn't start to take preventive measures.

 Chechen Information Minister Movladi Udugov said Sunday that 40 Russian troops 
and six armored personnel carriers had been captured on Chechnya's eastern 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Udugov told reporters that the soldiers and equipment were captured on the 
border with the neighboring region of Dagestan late Sunday. Russian troops 
moved into Chechnya on Sunday to end the breakaway southern Russian region's 
drive for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency said the Russian forces were reported to be moving 
toward Grozny in three thrusts from the east, west and northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said the Russian forces had reached the village of Tolstoy-Yurt, 
only about 10 miles across mountains from Grozny.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHECHNYA INVASION PUTS YELTSIN IN HARM'S WAY; POLITICS: RUSSIA'S 
PRESIDENT RISKS PRESIDING OVER A LONG CONFLICT AND LOSING ALLIES IN PARLIAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has never been known to shy away from 
conflict, but in sending troops Sunday to subdue the fiery Muslims of the 
breakaway republic of Chechnya, he may have picked the nastiest fight of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen men tend to feel undressed without their side arms. They wage 
protracted blood feuds among their powerful clans. The very name of their 
capital city, Grozny, means terrible or thunderous in Russian. The best-known 
Russian line about the Chechens, written by 19th-Century poet Mikhail 
Lermontov, is, "The cruel Chechen is crawling up the riverbank and sharpening 
his knife." 
</P>
<P>
 When Chechen Foreign Minister Shamsedin Yusef said Sunday that "they cannot 
kill every Chechen; there are more than 1 million of us, and every one of us 
will fight," it did not sound like empty rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Caucasian daggers are no match for the might of a former 
superpower. But even if the Russian troops backed by pro-Moscow Chechens end up 
marching triumphantly into Grozny, many expect defiant Chechens to wage 
guerrilla warfare against Moscow for years. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is only one of the risks Yeltsin has incurred by sending troops 
toward Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 When Russians comment on the tensions between Moscow and Grozny since Chechnya 
declared its independence in 1991, they tend to see them in the context of an 
infamous bit of imperial history known as the Caucasus War. For decades during 
the mid-1800s, the mighty czars couldn't manage to subdue the feisty tribes of 
the mountainous region united under a legendary leader named Shamil. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal politician Grigory A. Yavlinsky warned Sunday: "The Chechnya events 
are the prologue to another Caucasus War. . . . They promise decades of 
bloodshed. We'll have to send our children in and bring out coffins. Russian 
citizens will have to shoot other Russian citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the religion factor. As Muslims, the Chechens have been 
inundated for months by moujahedeen from Afghanistan and other Islamic 
countries, to the point that Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev has claimed 
that he no longer controls many of his fighters. The most zealous among them 
don green bandannas and are known as the smertniki , the suicide squads. 
</P>
<P>
 If Chechnya's plight becomes bad enough, foreign policy expert Georgy Arbatov 
cautioned, Azerbaijan, Iran or Turkey could conceivably be persuaded to get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts discount that danger. Caucasus expert Sergei Arutiunov said he 
does not believe that even the other small nations of the Caucasus would be 
willing to come to Chechnya's aid after having seen the wreckage caused by 
ethnic conflicts in the Russian republic of Ingushetia and in the Georgian 
region Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The militant mood of the other Caucasus nations" has died down, Arutiunov 
said. "All the awful consequences of the civil wars have demonstrated that in 
such wars there can be no winners." 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst-case scenarios lie behind alarmist warnings by the likes of 
former Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, who declared last week that if Russia and 
Chechnya go to war, "all countries and republics will get dragged into this 
war; everything will be mixed and intermingled. And this war will go on and on. 
It will not end until the last Russian or Chechen dies." 
</P>
<P>
 By alienating even some of his closest supporters with his militant move, 
Yeltsin also risks losing some of his last friends in a Parliament that is 
already dominated by largely hostile Communists and nationalists. Prime 
Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin barely survived a recent no-confidence vote and 
can little afford to lose support from normally pro-Yeltsin liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foreign policy arena, Yeltsin is also courting trouble. Although the 
United States and other countries have made it clear that they consider the 
Chechen problem purely an internal Russian affair, they were probably not 
counting on a move that could turn out to be so costly in human lives. 
</P>
<P>
 One State Department official said Sunday that the crisis in Chechnya "might" 
increase calls from the U.S. Congress for a tougher line against Russia, "but I 
would tend to doubt it as people analyze the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That prediction of calm wasn't borne out in initial reactions Sunday. Two 
senators influential in foreign affairs, Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), both criticized the incursion and suggested that the United 
States reassess its policy toward Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're seeing the resurgence of Russian imperialism," McCain said on 
the CNN program "Late Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman said the troop movements "will and in fact . . . should" cause 
Congress to reassess its support for large-scale aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the decision to move troops into Chechnya heightened the danger 
of anti-Russian terrorist attacks in Moscow and elsewhere. Moscow police have 
been on special alert in the wake of Chechen threats to make their defiance 
known in the Russian capital, although no attacks were reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 If angry Chechens resort to terrorism, military analyst Pavel Felgengauer 
said, "Russia may have to run anti-terrorist operations for years in Chechnya, 
as England had to do in Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 A more subtle political danger also lurks. Predictions from liberal 
politicians abound that terrorism combined with bloody fighting in Chechnya may 
serve as an excuse for hard-liners in the government to persuade Yeltsin to 
declare emergency rule throughout Russia. Dictatorship could then follow. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many dangers inherent in the decision, commentators such as Yevgeny 
Kiselev of Russia's Independent Television network struggled to understand what 
moved Yeltsin to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiselev noted indignantly that none of the government leaders who actually 
participated in the intervention plan -- Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev, 
Federal Counterintelligence Service chief Sergei V. Stepashin and others -- 
have bothered to explain to the public what is going on and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what Russians got was a much-amended appeal from Yeltsin, released 
only after 9 p.m. Sunday, assuring them that the troop influx into Chechnya is 
meant to ensure a "political solution" to the crisis -- an apparent reference 
to peace talks planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's appeal said the troops are there to defend the civilian population 
from armed Chechen extremists. He also is clearly well within his rights to 
intervene in a region that everyone except its residents considers part of 
Russia. And although polls put those who favor the use of force in Chechnya in 
the minority, many Russians openly long for the imposition of order. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yavlinsky offered perhaps the most biting explanation for Yeltsin's 
tactic. Yeltsin, he told Kiselev in an interview, tends to resort to force 
because he is no good at the tedious process of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like a person who can't play chess, so he kicks over the board," 
Yavlinsky said.

CLINTON TO SET OUT NEW POLICY GOALS; PRESIDENCY: HE PLANS A MAJOR SPEECH THIS 
WEEK, EVEN THOUGH AIDES SAY HE'S UNDECIDED ON HOW TO COUNTER THE GOP. SOME 
QUESTION IF THE TIME IS RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, still shaken by the Republican takeover of Congress in last 
month's elections, plans to deliver a major speech this week designed to 
demonstrate a clear sense of where he hopes to take the nation -- even though 
he himself has not yet determined precisely where that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton is determined to deliver what would amount to a pre-State of 
the Union Address setting out his goals and priorities, he is being pulled by 
conflicting advice from aides and is feeling the pressure of competing 
Democratic and Republican agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 He has held a series of meetings with Republican congressional leaders and 
conferred almost daily with his own advisers, but remains undecided on how to 
counter many of the GOP's plans, including proposals to cut middle-income and 
capital gains taxes, senior aides acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the question of what he should tell the American people about the plans 
he is devising has left the President in a state of uncertainty. Some advisers 
said they felt he should keep a lower profile until the 104th Congress convenes 
on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "What should I be saying?" Clinton asked a longtime political confidant 
several days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," was the reply. "You've talked enough. Give the people a break. Give 
us all a break and let us trim the Christmas trees and get through the holidays 
before you say anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, irrepressible when there's an opportunity to expound on politics, 
rejected the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some aides expressed concern that the speech will serve little purpose except 
to give the Republicans another target for the steady drumfire of criticism 
they have leveled at Clinton's policies since the sweeping GOP victories in the 
November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats have been through an earthquake and we need a temporizing, a time 
to put our house back in order," said a close Clinton adviser. "We don't need 
more speeches right now." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Patrick J. Griffin, Clinton's assistant for congressional relations, 
said the President is intent on laying out his goals for the next two years. 
"He's still thoroughly going through the budget and studying health care and 
other programs, but he has not made up his mind on a number of things," Griffin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't have the final details for his speech -- a lot will still be 
formative -- but he'll give a clear sense of direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior aide who declined to be identified said that while the White 
House was still uncertain about the setting for the speech, tentatively 
scheduled for Thursday, "the President will speak in some forum and talk about 
a major agenda that will include a credible budget and probably a middle-income 
tax cut. But my bet is 'no' on a capital gains tax (cut); he just hasn't made 
up his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who has been noncommittal about a capital gains tax cut, has said 
that while he favors a middle-income tax reduction and doesn't rule out working 
with the Republicans on some of their ideas, his standard will be: "Will it 
help increase incomes for the middle class? Will it promote jobs and growth? 
And can we pay for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 campaign, Clinton promised relief for middle-income taxpayers. 
But once in office, he pushed that pledge aside to concentrate instead on 
lowering the federal budget deficit. Aides say that while he is now studying 
several proposals for a middle-income tax cut, he is still adamant about 
opposing any reduction in taxes that would increase the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the final shape of Clinton's agenda, it is certain to be found 
wanting in the GOP-controlled Congress when it competes with the sweeping 
reform proposals of the House Republicans' "contract with America." Moreover, 
the President must deal with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council's 
"progressive alternative" to the GOP plan, as well as with other proposals 
Democrats can be expected to initiate in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-point GOP contract provides for House votes on a wide range of tax 
cuts, spending reductions, welfare reforms and constitutional changes in the 
first 100 days of the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Progressive Policy Institute, the DLC's think tank, issued a 
statement sharply contrasting its proposals with those of the House Republicans 
and declared that the Democrats' loss of control of Congress frees them "to 
stop defending the status quo" and challenge the GOP for "the mantle of radical 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The DLC is important to Clinton because it was organized a decade ago to give 
voice to the views of moderate Democrats -- views that he himself has espoused 
and that many analysts consider vital to his chances for political recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 With the two competing programs differing sharply in many respects, especially 
in tax and spending proposals, Clinton and his aides have been conferring with 
both camps trying to reach a consensus on some issues that the President can 
support without undermining his budget and his agenda for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's inclination is to go all-out in competing on the policy 
front, some of his advisers have suggested that letting the Republicans get out 
front with some of their more radical proposals would in effect be giving them 
enough rope to hang themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), one of Clinton's closest friends, said he favors 
the give-them-enough-rope strategy, especially in response to some of the 
"gloating" and sharply partisan comments by incoming House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has said he'll cooperate, but not compromise, with 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Pryor said he was encouraged that incoming Senate Majority 
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas appeared at his own request before a closed-door 
session of the Democratic caucus in the Senate and pledged to be less 
confrontational, saying there were things he wants to see settled in a 
bipartisan fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton irritated Republicans earlier in his term by failing to work closely 
with them, and it remains a sore point with some party leaders. Sen. Trent Lott 
(R-Miss.), the incoming Republican whip, said he had not even met Griffin, 
Clinton's congressional relations assistant, until Griffin sought his help on a 
matter recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Republicans control Congress, Clinton aides acknowledge that the 
Administration needs to broaden and improve its relationship with them. 
Griffin, who has met regularly with many Republicans, declined to comment on 
Lott's remark about not meeting him until recently, but said he's looking 
forward to working with the Mississippi senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said he requested meetings with all the new Senate Republican 
committee chairmen immediately after they were named and plans to meet with 
subcommittee chairmen and the heads of House panels as well. He said he is 
asking Republicans how the White House can best work with them as they develop 
their agendas.
