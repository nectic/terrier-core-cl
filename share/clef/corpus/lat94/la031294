KNUT ANDERS HAUKELID; WWII 'HERO OF TELEMARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Knut Anders Haukelid, 82, one of the "Heroes of Telemark" who helped cripple 
Nazi Germany's atomic weapons program in Norway. During the height of World War 
II, Haukelid and eight other Norwegian commandos parachuted into the mountains, 
on what seemed a suicide mission, to destroy a heavy water plant near Rjukan in 
Telemark County.The group stole into the heavily guarded plant on Feb. 27, 
1943, and blew it up just after midnight. All escaped, and Haukelid remained in 
the mountains for the rest of the war as a Resistance fighter. The raid 
inspired several books and movies, including the 1965 film "The Heroes of 
Telemark" with Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris. Haukelid retired as a 
lieutenant colonel in 1973. In Oslo on Tuesday of heart failure.

HENRY F. LIPPITT II; EXPERT ON NATURAL GAS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry F. Lippitt II, executive secretary of the California Gas Producers Assn. 
for a quarter of a century and a leading expert in natural gas regulation, has 
died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippitt died Wednesday in Los Angeles, his family announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as the longtime editor of Reports on Western Natural Gas 
Developments, which became known as the Lippitt Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippitt was instrumental in passage of the California Natural Gas Policy Act 
in 1983 and also worked on other major legislation, including the state's 
natural gas cooperative bill and elimination of a state gas gathering charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 he earned the Glenn C. Ferguson Award given by the California 
Independent Petroleum Assn. for contributions to the industry's future. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Providence, R.I., Lippitt grew up in Santa Barbara and San Diego 
and was educated at San Diego State University, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and Harvard University Law School. During World War II, he served as 
an officer in the Naval Reserve assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he worked briefly as a contracting officer with the newly 
formed Atomic Energy Commission in New York and then joined a New York law 
firm. As a lawyer, he concentrated on natural gas regulatory problems, 
frequently appearing before what is now the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippitt returned to California in 1957 as counsel to the Southern California 
Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961 he helped Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum form the California 
Gas Producers Assn. and served as its executive secretary until his retirement 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippitt organized the California Conference of Public Utility Counsel, served 
as director of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce and the Seaboard Oil 
and Gas Co., was a trustee of the Francis Parker School in San Diego and the 
Cate School in Santa Barbara, and was a director and treasurer of the 
Historical Society of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife of 29 years, the former Ruth Sonja Staub; a sister 
and two brothers, and 11 nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled at 3 p.m. Monday at the Church of the Hills, 
Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Hollywood Hills.

PASSENGER KILLED WHEN PLANE HITS HOUSE; ACCIDENT: CRASH NEAR SANTA MONICA 
AIRPORT SETS VACANT HOUSE ON FIRE. STUDENT PILOT HAD REPORTED ENGINE TROUBLE 
AND IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A single-engine plane crashed into an unoccupied house in West Los Angeles on 
Friday night, killing the passenger and setting the house on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The student pilot, 22, survived the crash with a broken arm and second-degree 
burns on his arms and hands. He was in critical condition at ULCA Medical 
Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the four-seat Piper 28 had just taken off from the Santa Monica 
Airport and was at about 1,000 feet when he reported engine trouble to the 
control tower, Assistant Chief Bob Neamy of the Los Angeles Fire Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed back to the airport, but the engine hood came loose, blocking the 
pilot's view and causing him to lose control and crash into the house, Neamy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters put out the fire at the house, about a mile from the airport, in 
about 10 minutes. But because the plane hit a power line, about 800 customers 
in a four-block area around the house were without power for several hours, 
according the Department of Water and Power officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the pilot and his passenger, a man in his 30s, were not disclosed 
by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in my house, and I heard the boom," said Helen Andranian, who lives 
next door to the crash site. "I think it's time to sell the house and move." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot had been practicing "touch-and-goes" at the time of the crash, said 
Fred O'Donnell, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This involves the pilot touching down briefly and then reapplying power," 
O'Donnell said. "When the plane has enough air speed, the pilot climbs up again 
and makes a 360-degree turn. Then he does it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the most critical phase of any airplane flight is landing and takeoffs 
. . . student pilots need to master this and experienced pilots need to 
maintain their proficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica facility is one of the busiest single-runway airports in the 
nation, the site of more than 200,000 takeoffs and landings a year. Many 
neighbors have expressed frustration over fumes, noise and occasional crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a greater nuisance in the last two years, critics say, because 
of a surge in jet traffic. The neighbors are angry that the airport has allowed 
the sale of jet fuel, and some have hinted that they may file a lawsuit seeking 
to ban jets. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday night's crash, neighbors said they were lucky because the plane 
hit a house that had been vacated and was for rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Hayes, who lives across the street from the accident scene, said she 
is plagued by noise and is worried that a plane will crash into her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous . . . the planes are really low when they come past here," she 
said. "This just brought it closer to home. It could have been our house." 
</P>
<P>
 But airport officials have said the accident rate of one crash per 200,000 
takeoffs and landings is lower than the national average. No one on the ground 
ever has been killed as a result of a crash involving a plane from Santa Monica 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, neighbors say, there have been close calls. In November, a pilot and 
his passenger were killed when their small plane slammed into a Santa Monica 
apartment building after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a pilot was killed when his plane hit a utility pole while trying to 
return to the airport. The plane exploded in a residential area of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, a home-built plane crashed into two houses in West Los Angeles after 
the pilot reported engine problems. No one was seriously injured.

MISTRIAL IN EX-DEPUTY'S COCAINE CASE; COURTS: JURORS DEADLOCK 9 TO 3 IN FAVOR 
OF ACQUITTING RICKEY ROSS OF CONSPIRACY TO PURCHASE 22 POUNDS OF DRUGS FROM 
UNDERCOVER OFFICERS. A RETRIAL IS LIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared Friday in the trial of former Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, who was charged with attempting to purchase 22 
pounds of cocaine from undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost four days of deliberation, the jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of 
acquitting Ross of three counts of conspiracy to purchase cocaine for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Winston said her office will probably seek to retry 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross's attorney, David Herriford, said the case came down to the credibility 
of the prosecution witnesses against Ross, including ex-Dodger Derrel Thomas, a 
former co-defendant. And the jury must have decided, Herriford said, that these 
witnesses "were out-and-out lying." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Lorraine Bolden said prosecutors had contended that Ross "was a big drug 
kingpin" but did not prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many holes in the prosecution's case and they didn't prove 
anything, in my opinion," said Bolden, a customer services manager for an 
insurance company. "And a lot of the testimony against Ross was full of lies . 
. . with people contradicting each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross declined to comment on the case, saying only: "They have continued to 
wreck and destroy my life. They are playing too many games with too many 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The mistrial represents another loss for the district attorney's office in a 
well-publicized case. The Ross case was not as significant a loss as were the 
cases involving the Menendez brothers and the officers charged with beating 
Rodney G. King. Still, Thomas and Ross were well-known figures, and their case 
received substantial news media attention. This could have contributed to the 
jury's decision Friday, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be harder to convince a jury in a high-profile case," Winston said. 
"Maybe there's more pressure on a jury because they feel these cases are being 
so closely watched." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, an 18-year-veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was arrested in 1989 for 
allegedly killing three prostitutes, although the charges were eventually 
dropped. His cocaine conspiracy trial was closely watched, not only because of 
his past, but because Thomas, a local baseball hero, was a co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has claimed that as a result of his multimillion-dollar lawsuit against 
the Los Angeles Police Department for his 1989 arrest, law enforcement agencies 
set him up for the cocaine bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure looks like it could have been a setup," Herriford said Friday. "A 
number of things happened after his arrest that seem to bear that out." 
</P>
<P>
 The long, tortuous road to Ross's mistrial began when a man facing a lengthy 
prison sentence for drug dealing agreed to act as an informant for the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA investigators reportedly told him that, if he acted as an undercover 
informant, his sentence would be reduced. His mission, prosecutor Winston said, 
was to set up a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant told drug agents, according to court records, that he knew 
Derrel Thomas during the 1980s, when he was the manager of the Barbary Coast, a 
topless bar in Gardena. The two had discussed putting together a cocaine deal 
at the time, according to court records, but one never materialized. The DEA 
authorized him to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 When Thomas, who was broke at the time and heavily in debt, was unable to line 
up a cocaine source, drug agents told the informant to turn the deal around. 
The agents would provide the informant with the drugs if Thomas could find a 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and a hostess at the Barbary Coast, Cynthia Patterson, testified that 
they eventually located a buyer -- Ross -- and the cocaine deal was set up. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Herriford said Friday that both Thomas and Patterson, the key 
prosecution witnesses against Ross, were unreliable and had reasons to lie. 
Thomas testified against Ross during the trial in exchange for a prison 
sentence of no more than three years. Patterson was granted immunity from 
prosecution in exchange for her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no dispute that in April, 1992, Ross rented a Cadillac and had 
$151,000 in the trunk when he showed up at a McDonald's parking lot, along with 
Thomas and the informant. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contended that he was there to buy 22 pounds of cocaine from 
undercover agents running a sting operation. But Ross testified that he thought 
the money might possibly be used "for money laundering, not drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' problems began, he testified, in 1989 when he left the Sheriff's 
Department. He had trouble finding steady work and faced foreclosure on his 
Rialto house. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, he was trying to sell movie production companies the rights to 
his story of being wrongly accused and spending almost three months in a 
top-security unit of the County Jail. While he was negotiating with several 
production companies, he testified, he ran into an acquaintance at a bar whom 
he had met years earlier. The man, whom he called "a real wheeler-dealer," 
turned out to be an informant for the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross testified that the informant promised to lend him $12,000 and help him 
set up a movie and book deal if he would transport a shipment of cash. He 
testified that he met an associate of the informant, who placed a gym bag full 
of money into the trunk of the rented car. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he headed to a McDonald's parking lot, along with Thomas and the 
informant. When undercover DEA agents showed him a plastic bag filled with 
cocaine, he said, he initially did not know what it was. When the agents 
persuaded him to take the bag and he saw what was inside, he testified, he 
tried to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution contended that Ross was a "trusted member of a drug 
organization." He removed a small folding knife to test the drugs, Winston 
said, and had no intention of backing out of the deal at the time he was 
arrested.

NONSTOP COLISEUM REPAIRS OKD; LANDMARKS: STATE PRESERVATION OFFICER APPROVES 
IMMEDIATE SEISMIC WORK ON QUAKE DAMAGE. SOME ACTIVISTS HAVE BITTERLY OPPOSED 
THE RENOVATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Breaking a deadlock among historic preservationists that threatened to impede 
earthquake repairs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the state's historic 
preservation officer Friday approved an immediate start to round-the-clock work 
to seismically reinforce the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherilyn Widell authorized beginning full excavation of the concrete slab 
floor of the stadium's badly cracked upper-level concourse. That will allow 
holes to be drilled so that 55-foot caissons can be installed to anchor the 
stadium's outer wall and superstructure to an earthen berm. 
</P>
<P>
 Widell, at a meeting with preservationists and Coliseum officials, also agreed 
to allow 12 concession stands to be demolished and five to be temporarily moved 
to make room for horizontal beams to reinforce the stadium's outer wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees that grow on the berm outside the Coliseum may also be removed. Many of 
these, like the concession stands, are in the way of seismic reinforcement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Widell has legal authority to authorize the reinforcement work despite 
opposition from some of nine historic preservation agencies and private groups. 
The groups have been at loggerheads over the proposed renovations, which have 
made it uncertain whether the repairs could be completed by a September 
deadline for reopening the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Widell said her office will work with the preservation groups to try to 
prevent such bitter exchanges as the ones that occurred at a meeting with 
Coliseum officials Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coliseum project director Don C. Webb sought approval to proceed with the 
repair work, Ray Girvigian, chairman emeritus of the state Historic Building 
Safety Board, said it would damage historic elements of the Coliseum. Some 
others opposed moving the five concession stands that date from the stadium's 
early days. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Friday's agreement, Tutor-Saliba Corp., the contractor for the 
Coliseum repairs, had moved heavy equipment next to the stadium to be ready to 
begin repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The renovation project is estimated to cost at least $34.7 million, but Webb 
said this week that the costs could rise if it is necessary to demolish and 
rebuild the peristyle end of the stadium, where the Olympic torch burned during 
the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The project director said the peristyle -- one the parts of the 71-year-old 
facility most severely damaged during the earthquake -- may have to be 
demolished because the concrete has been found to be weak and mixed with huge 
chunks of granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state authorities have promised to finance the Coliseum repairs, 
and the first $10.9 million has been allocated by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it "negation by delay," Webb expressed alarm after Wednesday's meeting 
that the preservation organizations could dither so long on the repairs that 
the project would not begin this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the commission's 
president, expressed similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the preservation groups said they wanted to proceed. Amy Forbes, 
president of the Los Angeles Conservancy, said her group's board had voted to 
support Webb's concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to getting the thing done . . . to meet their (repair) 
schedule," Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Girvigian said he is opposed to any relaxation of laws "so somebody can 
meet a political deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, no one wants to intentionally delay anything," he 
said. "But if you start to bend the rules . . . then you are not complying with 
the letter and the spirit of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 As the sharp statements began to fly, Widell changed the subject of a 
scheduled meeting so that Webb's requests could be discussed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility to the public to make sure the Coliseum is repaired 
and the character of the building is protected," she said. "It must be done in 
a correct but efficient manner, and it must be done quickly."

CITYSCAPES / DIANNE KLEIN: WOLF-DOG'S LEGACY IN LA CRESCENTA IS A RECALL OF THE 
WILD; 'WE FEEL, INTELLECTUALLY, THAT WE DID THE RIGHT THING. BUT EMOTIONALLY, 
WE REALLY MISS HER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 She had no bark, of course, but she sure could howl. And nobody ever heard her 
in the bushes before she would suddenly appear at La Crescenta's Two Strike 
Park, or on the field of Rosemont Middle School, or in somebody's back yard. 
She had that wolfish gait, stealthy, almost tippy-toed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was those yellow eyes that would really get to you, slanted and narrow, 
and that long, skinny snout. Those big white teeth! Parents would tell their 
children, "Better to eat you with, my dear. . . . Be good or the wolf-dog might 
get you tonight!" 
</P>
<P>
 A few parents, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more likely to dismiss "Little Red Riding Hood" as just more 
anti-wolf propaganda masquerading as fairy tale. After all, not all wolves are 
big and bad. Beneath all her fur, for example, the wolf-dog is rather slight. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, in this funky, family-oriented community in the foothills of Los 
Angeles, the wolf-dog has a lot of friends, of the human and canine kind. And 
even though she has been gone a week now, La Crescenta is talking about her 
still. 
</P>
<P>
 She was captured and taken to a wild animal preserve, for her own good. Or so 
the talk goes. It was for the best, was it not? 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel, intellectually, that we did the right thing," said Candice Woo, one 
of several co-conspirators in the wolf-dog's capture. "But emotionally, we 
really miss her. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "She had a very gentle spirit about her. She really invoked among the dog 
owners a real kindred spirit. . . . She was just crazy about the dogs. She 
would hear Oliver's tags clinking and come on over. She loved to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver is Woo's little white Westy, but like many La Crescenta dog owners, Woo 
considered the wolf-dog part hers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chelsea is crying because they played every single night," said Marcia 
Thomasma of her border collie, who was also the wolf-dog's pal. "We have all 
been grieving." 
</P>
<P>
 But now even the wolf-dog's biggest fans are shaking their heads and saying 
that perhaps this creature should have never been born. More wolf than dog, she 
had no pack of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 She would make do with her rag-tag crew of dogs, who always had human 
chaperons in tow. The chaperons would bring the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, the wolf-dog was probably somebody's pet. But she has 
wildness in her genes. She is a predator above all else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saved her life," said Bob Reda, whose 13-month-old Newfoundland, Vader, 
was one of the wolf-dog's steady dates. "I loved this animal and I played with 
this animal and I didn't want to give her up. But we also knew that she was 
starting to chew on children's clothing and leather. She ripped one lady's 
dress. If you turned your back on her, you didn't know what could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 There were already reports. Two pet rabbits were eaten in somebody's back 
yard. The owner said she understood that the wolf-dog was just doing what came 
naturally, but still . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the wolf-dog had stayed on the streets and in the parks of La Crescenta any 
longer, maybe she would have been poisoned or shot, neighbors warned. Many 
times, she was the target of hurled rocks. After six months on the loose, the 
wolf-dog had broken her leg, perhaps having been hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 So Reda, Thomasma and other neighbors began calling for help from the Wildlife 
Waystation and from Los Angeles County Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
 After a failed attempt to cage her in Thomasma's back yard, veterinarians 
finally shot her with a tranquilizer dart last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first tranquilizer did not immediately take and the wolf-dog ran for 
her life. Vader took off after her and the veterinarians took after him. They 
finally found the wolf-dog and shot her with a dart again. This time, she fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the wolf-dog's keepers at Wildlife Waystation call the animal Tundra. 
She was called Wolfy around La Crescenta, or just Wolf-Dog would do. 
</P>
<P>
 Martine Colette, the founder of the Waystation, believes that the wolf-dog is 
no older than 2 and will be in quarantine for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she will join 40 other wolf-dogs -- known as wolf hybrids -- who will 
spend the rest of their lives there, caught between two worlds. Movies such as 
"Dances With Wolves" and "White Fang" may have made for great box office, but 
animal advocates say they should have come with a disclaimer: Do not try this 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colette says the Waystation gets so many calls from people wanting to drop off 
their wolf hybrids that she will accept only those that are nearly 
indistinguishable from pure wolves. (And the Waystation has 15 pure wolves on 
hand. Although wolves are an endangered species -- and illegal to own -- for 
enough money and some connections, they can be found.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The breeders always tell you about these glorious things," Colette said of 
the wolf-dogs. "But where are they when the problem animals come into the 
shelters? . . . You never know what you are going to end up with when you are 
breeding. These are not pets." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Humane Society -- which has been on a campaign to outlaw the sale 
and breeding of wolf-dogs -- says at least nine American children have been 
killed by wolf hybrids since 1986. In 10 states, it is illegal to own hybrids, 
while 28 states have restrictions on ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 But most wolf-dog owners conceal the fact that they have one around the house. 
And proving wolf heritage is virtually impossible; often even breeders just 
guess, while charging from $600 to thousands of dollars a pup. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, for example, wolf-dog owners are supposed to register 
them as wild animals. At last count, only two had done so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real debate among animal welfare people about hybrids," said Bob 
Ballenger, executive assistant at Los Angeles County Animal Control. ". . . It 
is a predator, bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Such insight is not lost on the wolf-dog fans of La Crescenta. Yes, they did 
do the right thing, of course. But sadness over the wolf-dog's fate lingers. 
Wolfy will live in a cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the wolf-dog is gone, she has left some good behind. With all the 
hubbub over the wolf-dog of La Crescenta, many neighbors have become friends.

THE CASE OF THE MAN IN THE YELLOW SWEATER; FORMER PHOTOGRAPHER SUES TABLOID FOR 
LIBEL OVER KENNEDY ASSASSINATION ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Khalid Khawar's hands trembled as he held the latest copy of the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the spring of 1989, and the supermarket tabloid blared headlines about 
how Marlon Brando was near death, how baldness could be cured with a 
combination of vodka and Alka Seltzer and how the Iranian secret police had 
killed Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles 21 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 And inside was a picture of Khawar, and a caption identifying him as an 
Iranian agent who pulled the trigger. Khawar -- then a photojournalist and now 
a Bakersfield farmer -- was standing next to Kennedy on that night long ago, 
only minutes before the assassination. Khawar was wearing a yellow sweater and 
a camera hung around his neck. In the tabloid, a large black arrow was pointed 
at his head, blaming him for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, based on a book by conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow, said an 
Iranian agent -- not Sirhan Sirhan -- was the real killer and that the camera 
was really a gun loaded with four bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Khawar was stunned, then afraid. At first he kept his mouth shut and hoped 
that no one would notice. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did. So Khawar got a lawyer and sued. This week, his libel suit is 
being played out in Santa Monica Superior Court. It has turned into a lively 
reprise of Robert Kennedy's assassination, complete with video clips and 
testimony from the likes of football great Rosie Grier, who was at Kennedy's 
side the night he died. 
</P>
<P>
 It has offered a glimpse into the strange life and times of conspiracy 
theorists, the supermarket tabloids and, more than anything else, the Man in 
the Yellow Sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 It was odd how things could change in an instant. For years, the picture of 
Khawar standing next to Kennedy had held a place of honor in the office of his 
Bakersfield farm. He treasured the few minutes he had shared the spotlight with 
the heir to the Kennedy legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Kennedy left the podium at the Ambassador Hotel, he was led 
through the pantry on the way to a news conference. There, a Palestinian named 
Sirhan Sirhan lunged toward Kennedy firing a .22-caliber pistol. Kennedy lay 
dying in a pool of blood, an image that remains fixed in the American 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirhan was convicted of the assassination. But the story in the Globe 
suggested that Khawar was the killer. It ran his picture and said he was an 
agent sent by the Shah of Iran on behalf of the Mafia, no less, to kill 
Kennedy. (Curiously, though, the man in the picture was identified as Ali 
Ahmand, a variant of Khawar's father's name.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe it. I was in a state of shock," Khawar said. "I had 
to sit down in a chair before I could read the article." 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe says it is blameless, that it merely printed allegations made by 
Morrow in his book. And they also say it is not their responsibility to 
re-investigate the allegations made in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here simply as a deep pocket," Globe lawyer Anthony Glassman said. "We 
reported a newsworthy event and feel we shouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, who lives in Cincinnati, has not bothered to come to the trial. He 
said he has not libeled anyone and that it would not make any difference in any 
event because he is an old man who does not have any money.  
</P>
<P>
 "I stand by the book because this is the way I understood it," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Morrow has come up with theories that have had a 
bizarre twist to them. He also says he has unwittingly supplied the CIA with 
the guns used to assassinate John F. Kennedy and wrote another book about how 
that happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain of circumstances that landed the dispute in the Santa Monica 
courthouse started in 1962 when Khawar came to Los Angeles from Pakistan to 
study at a technical school, then at Pacific States University. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he said, he began writing articles for a Pakistani magazine, 
covering such topics as agriculture, baseball and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 4, Khawar walked to the Ambassador Hotel, only a few blocks from where 
he was living, to cover the Kennedy camp as the primary results rolled in. As 
the time approached for Kennedy to claim victory, Khawar stepped on stage with 
dozens of other reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameras clicked, flashes blinked, catching not only the image of Kennedy, but 
also of Khawar. He stood so close that he could have reached out and touched 
Kennedy as the presidential candidate delivered what turned out to be his last 
public utterance: "Now it's on to Chicago and let's win there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the terrible events of the next few minutes, with Sirhan killing 
Kennedy. But according to Morrow, someone else was firing as well -- a man he 
called Ali Ahmand but identified in several of the book's pictures as the 
photographer in the yellow sweater: Khalid Iqbar Khawar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahmand watched through his viewfinder as the startled and dodging 
presidential candidate tried to back away from the wild-eyed gunman," Morrow 
wrote in his book "The Senator Must Die," which sold few copies. "Then as Bobby 
literally backed into him, Ahmand pushed the lethal camera up behind the 
senator's ear and pulled the release mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting to note that Morrow says he has gotten his information about 
the assassination from a high-ranking member of the Iranian secret police. 
Morrow said the informant told him he was willing to testify before a 
congressional committee but, as fate would have it, was murdered a few weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 While Morrow paints one picture of what happened, Khawar paints quite another. 
He said he was not able to get to the pantry after shots were fired because the 
way was blocked by the time he got there. In court, Khawar displayed a number 
of pictures taken after the killing, most of them of people weeping upon 
learning that Kennedy had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Khawar said that after the shooting, police interrogated everyone remaining in 
the ballroom, including him. He said he left the Ambassador Hotel at 2 a.m. and 
walked home. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the camera that was supposedly a gun, Khawar said he still owns the 
Nikon that he wore around his neck that night. In court, one of his three 
lawyers, Richard Knickerbocker, walked down the row of jurors with the lens 
removed from the camera body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't see a gun inside there," he said, incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, with his education complete, Khawar returned to the Pakistani 
town of Faisalabad, where he had grown up. But before he left, he said, he 
called the police and gave them a forwarding address in case they needed to 
talk to him further about the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Khawar returned to Los Angeles with his new wife. The 
opportunities in Pakistan had been limited and the political climate was 
unsettled. After working for six years in the electronics field, Khawar struck 
out on his own, buying 150 acres of farmland near Bakersfield. He eventually 
expanded the farm to 320 acres of citrus and grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The family prospered. Three children arrived. Khawar's father came from 
Pakistan to live with them. For all to see, Khawar and his family were moving 
through life in relative obscurity, making no waves, paying taxes and, 
eventually, becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in April, 1989, when the Globe hit the supermarkets.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside was the story, with the headline proclaiming "Former CIA Agent Claims: 
Iranians Killed Bobby Kennedy for the Mafia." And with it was the picture that 
hung in Khawar's office, the same picture that had run in Time magazine in the 
edition immediately after the assassination. The only difference was the arrow 
pointing at Khawar's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got very scared because I had seen on television in 1963 when Lee Harvey 
Oswald was murdered by Jack Ruby even before he was charged or tried in a court 
of law," Khawar said. 
</P>
<P>
 His next instinct was silence, hoping that no one would notice that the 
Bakersfield farmer was the same person in the Globe picture. But his oldest son 
came home one day asking what was going on, what was all this about his father 
and the assassination of Robert Kennedy? 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the telephoned threats, his son's car being vandalized, the house 
being pelted with eggs, the fear that something serious would happen to his 
family. There was another threatening phone call only last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Khawar paid a visit to Bakersfield lawyer Craig Edmunson. Now, there are six 
lawyers lining the tables in the courtroom, three for each side. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected to last at least another week in the court of Judge 
Richard Harris. It is being tried in Santa Monica because Morrow's now-defunct 
publisher, Roundtable Publishing, was located there. Morrow, in a letter 
written to his agent last year, suggested that the whole matter could be 
cleared up in his book by taking out the pictures and changing the name of the 
supposed assassin, Ali Ahmand, to a generic "Mohammed." 
</P>
<P>
 The agent, Andrew Ettinger, said he is surprised the case ever got this far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's bizarre," he said. "There are so many questions regarding the 
Robert Kennedy assassination. This is probably the least of them." 
</P>
<P>
 On a final note, Khawar, who found himself in this predicament because of a 
picture, is now ducking photographers. As his lawyer said: "There are a lot of 
crazy people out there."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; TARGET 
DELIVERS 10,000 ROSES TO PROMOTE STORE OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a promotional stunt, the new Target store opening Sunday delivered 10,000 
roses to city households Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to tell people we're here and we're going to be part of the 
community," said David Parker, store manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The 163,000-square-foot store is in the three-level building at 777 E. 
Colorado Blvd. that formerly housed Robinson's department store. Grand opening 
festivities begin today with an evening laser light show set to music. The 
doors of the new store will open at 8 a.m. Sunday.

VIETNAMESE GANG MEMBERS HELD IN ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Vietnamese American gang members have been charged with invading 19 
homes and torturing the occupants to turn over valuables, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of robbery, burglary, assault and torture were filed this week against 
seven people who have been jailed since their arrests in December, Sgt. Ron 
Black of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks took place between October and December. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges are part of an ongoing investigation by the Asian Organized Crime 
Unit into more than 200 home invasion robberies committed in the San Gabriel 
Valley last year, Black said. Asian immigrants were the targets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven suspects, all Vietnamese immigrants, belong to the "V-Boys," a 
loose-knit gang whose members tattoo themselves with five dots and have an oath 
that, translated, reads in part: "If you snitch, we'll kill you," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are accused of taking $250,000 from 49 victims in 19 home holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers would break into a home at gunpoint, tie up the occupants and 
pistol-whip or burn them with cigarettes until they revealed the location of 
their valuables, Black said.

 Plenty of drops to drink: Robert McCullough of Sun Valley observed a truck 
pull into a parking lot and dump several dozen cardboard cases containing 
six-packs of drinking water. The cans, apparently from the quake-relief effort, 
seemed to have been left up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several onlookers then "converged on this small mountain of cardboard and 
proceeded to start ripping apart the six-packs, pouring the water on the 
ground," McCullough said. "What the hell was going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer became clear when the onlookers began stomping the cans flat. They 
meant to cash them in at a recycling center. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," McCullough asks, "what of the water, that life-saving vital liquid 
taken too much for granted, as the rationing during the quake revealed? Poured 
on the asphalt, it perhaps trickled down some drain, maybe to eventually join 
the Los Angeles River, briefly leaving it slightly less foul."

 Saluting the Mick: After reading about the Fontana Historical Society's tour 
of a home linked to Al Capone, Val Rodriguez wonders why L.A. doesn't fashion a 
tour dedicated to Mickey Cohen (1913-1976). 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the fedora-clad hoodlum, who received prominent mention in the 
movie "Bugsy," grew up in Boyle Heights and was later dubbed Public Nuisance 
No. 1 in Angeltown. And L.A. needs to come up with some innovative ways of 
attracting tourists.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cohen tour could stake out:  
</P>
<P>
 * The corner of Soto Street and Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights, where 
5-year-old Mickey hawked newspapers -- his last honest profession. 
</P>
<P>
 * The former Michael's (now an office building), 8804 Sunset Boulevard, where 
Cohen ran a men's clothing store that was really a front for bookmaking. On 
Aug. 18, 1948, it was invaded by gunmen who killed one of his henchmen but 
missed Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 * The former Sherry's (most recently Gazzari's), 9039 Sunset Boulevard, a 
nightclub that Cohen's entourage was exiting at 4 a.m. on July 19, 1949, when 
gunmen opened fire, wounding Cohen and killing another of his henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite Cohen utterance, quoted in "Fallen Angels" by Marvin Wolf and

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BULLOCKS 
WILSHIRE BUILDING TO BE BOUGHT BY LAW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwestern University Law School has received permission from a bankruptcy 
judge to acquire the shuttered landmark Bullocks Wilshire building, school 
officials said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The school wants to move its library and some offices into the Art Deco 
department store building when a five-year renovation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This important move will guarantee the preservation of an essential piece of 
this city's cultural heritage, and will provide the environment our law school 
needs to continue to serve our community," said Frank L. Ellsworth, vice 
chairman of Southwestern's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern will buy the building for $4.8 million from R.H. Macy & Co., 
which closed the store in April, 1993, after filing for bankruptcy protection. 
The school outbid a retail group in an auction that the New York Bankruptcy 
Court conducted last month, said Southwestern communications director Leslie 
Steinberg. A Southwestern spokeswoman said the law school is negotiating with 
Caltech, which owns the land under the building, to acquire the entire 
property. The 82-year-old law school is across the street on Westmoreland 
Avenue.

$5-MILLION GRANT EARMARKED FOR REPAIR OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $5-million federal grant to repair historic buildings damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake was announced in Hollywood on Friday by Richard Moe, president of 
the National Trust for Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 buildings have been designated as eligible by the California Office 
of Historic Preservation, according to Linda Dishman, a spokeswoman for the Los 
Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said $3.5 million will be used for reconstruction work -- with the 
remainder earmarked for planning, design and other paperwork. Part of the money 
will be available as low-interest loans and part as grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will come from the President's Discretionary Fund for Unanticipated 
Needs, part of the 1994 federal emergency supplemental appropriation for 
disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to make a difference in helping owners save historic homes, 
commercial buildings and other properties," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the commercial buildings deemed eligible is a Spanish-style brick 
structure at Hollywood Boulevard and Kingsley Drive that could be one of the 
city's first mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1930, the L-shaped, two-story building flanks a small parking lot, 
with a pharmacy, a small market and a storefront garment factory on the first 
floor and studio apartments on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Finfer, owner of the building, led federal, state and local officials on 
a short tour Friday afternoon, pointing out large diagonal cracks in the walls 
and a cornice that had tumbled into an alleyway. He estimated damage at more 
than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of other older buildings in that Hollywood neighborhood suffered 
similar damage in the earthquake, and several have been tagged for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe said that while touring the earthquake zone this week, he was "impressed 
by the number of buildings being demolished that didn't have to be demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Finfer, Moe commended his decision to restore the old structure and 
recommended that he ask for help under the aid program, telling him: "There are 
resources available to help you save that building." 
</P>
<P>
 Finfer said he would apply. And when he was told that a total of $5 million is 
available, he grinned and said: "I'll take it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials chuckled with him, but were quick to point out that the maximum 
amount available for any project will be $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million aid program will be coordinated by the National Park Service, 
the National Trust, the Office of Historic Preservation and the conservancy. 
Applications can be made through the conservancy by calling (213) 623-2489.

CENTURY-SAN DIEGO FREEWAY CONNECTOR RAMP OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ramp connecting the westbound Century Freeway to the northbound San Diego 
Freeway opened Friday, one portion of the largest freeway interchange in 
California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramp becomes the fourth of eight connector ramps to open on the 
$145-million interchange connecting the two freeways.The interchange is part of 
the $2.2-billion Century Freeway, which opened in October and stretches 17.3 
miles from Norwalk to El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ramp will greatly improve commuting times for motorists making the 
transition between these two major freeways," said Jerry Baxter, Caltrans 
district director. Since the earthquake, traffic on the freeway has risen as 
motorists seek alternatives to quake-damaged routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining ramps on the interchange are expected to be opened in June.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SHERIFF'S DEPT. LOSES BID OF IMMUNITY IN CRASH DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ruled that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department does not 
have a clearly defined vehicular pursuit policy and therefore cannot claim 
immunity for the deaths of a woman and her unborn child in an auto accident in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Ernest G. Williams ruled this week in the case of David 
Vargas, who is suing the county, the Sheriff's Department and the deputies who 
were chasing the car that struck Vargas' automobile at Broadway and Imperial 
Highway, killing Vargas' pregnant wife, Guadalupe Soto. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means Vargas will be able to bring his suit to trial and the county 
and the Sheriff's Department "will have to reconsider their pursuit policy and 
bring it into compliance" with California's vehicle code, according to Vargas' 
attorneys, William B. Hanley and Juan C. Basombrio. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sgt. Larry Lincoln, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said the ruling 
"does not represent any overall judgment as to whether or not Sheriff's 
Department personnel acted reasonably during the pursuit. . . . (It) simply 
denies an immunity claim and permits the case to move forward in trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators said the accident occurred Nov. 11, 1992, as Deputies 
Bryan McBride and Moses Barraza were chasing a Cadillac believed to have been 
involved in a holdup. The investigators said the Cadillac ran a red light and 
struck the Vargas vehicle broadside.

ROBBERS FIND THEIR VICTIMS IN ADS FOR COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robbers have targeted at least eight owners of Macintosh computers who 
advertised in the weekly Recycler publication, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest case, two men posing as buyers bound, gagged and blindfolded a 
victim at gunpoint Thursday night, then made off with a computer and other 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said essentially the same method was used in the other robberies, which 
took place at homes on the Westside of Los Angeles, in Culver City and in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very new to us as far as advertisements and robberies of this 
nature," said Detective Robert Tapia of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
West Los Angeles station. "This is obviously someone who has a specific item 
they're looking for and this is how they found it." 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the robberies occurred in December. While three assailants were 
reported in one case, there were two robbers in most of the incidents, Tapia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a robber showed up alone at a computer owner's home, then came 
back with an accomplice after saying he was leaving to get some money to make 
the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to computers, the intruders have made off with jewelry, television 
sets and video recorders. In some cases, a knife was used instead of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators speculated that the gang specializes in Macintosh computers 
because they are easy to to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said there is no reason for sellers to stop advertising, Tapia 
suggested meeting with prospective buyers in a public place, or calling a 
neighbor or a friend over if the goods need to be examined in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they know they're seen by a second person, they normally go on their 
merry way," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a majority of the cases, the victims were alone at the time of the robbery, 
Tapia said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Recycler, which features about 110,000 free advertisements a week, 
editor Dia Burke said she was only aware of only one of the computer robberies. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing all we can to work closely with and help out with whatever the 
detectives suggest," she said.

FLEISS LOSES LEGAL BID TO HAVE PANDERING CHARGES DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reputed Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss lost her bid Friday to have pandering 
charges dismissed based on her contention that police targeted her and other 
women for felony charges and ignored their wealthy, male customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Judith L. Champagne rejected the argument of 
discriminatory prosecution and agreed with Deputy Dist. Atty.Alan Carter that 
Fleiss' flamboyant behavior, and not her gender, brought her to the attention 
of police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not find that the evidence supports your suggestion that (the law) is 
applied with an evil eye or unequal hand," Champagne told Fleiss' attorney, 
Anthony Brooklier. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklier contended that discrimination was shown by the fact that Fleiss was 
charged last year with pandering, but no charges have been filed against her 
alleged customers, even though a statute that could apply to them has been on 
the books for 101 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute was created to prevent the enslavement of women for prostitution 
and other purposes, but also prohibits paying someone for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Fleiss' alleged clients paid prostitutes with bank checks, travelers 
checks and perhaps credit cards, Brooklier said, breaking the law. Documents 
from those transactions, along with the testimony prostitutes gave during a 
county grand jury session last year, could be the basis of prosecuting the men, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But no such prosecution has taken place in all the years the law has been in 
place, Brooklier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, however, told Champagne that Fleiss brought attention to herself by 
bragging about running a pricey Hollywood call girl ring. In addition, he said, 
men who run prostitution rings are prosecuted as often as women who do the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting that argument, Champagne set a May 6 trial date for Fleiss on the 
pandering charges and a charge of possession of cocaine.

FIRST ORDER OF BLACK NUNS HEEDS CALL FOR 165TH YEAR; CATHOLICISM: OBLATE 
SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE, FOUNDED TO EDUCATE CHILDREN EXCLUDED FROM SEGREGATED 
SCHOOLS, HAVE WEATHERED ADVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As wintry light filters through the stained-glass windows of Mount Providence, 
several dozen nuns reaffirm their devotion. Wearing habits, veils and silver 
wedding bands, holding hymnals flavored with spirituals, the women appear 
joyful, serene and a bit mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall behind the altar are words that have helped to define them: 
"Therefore Go and Teach All Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 These women belong to the world's first order of nuns of African heritage, the 
Oblate Sisters of Providence. Founded in Baltimore 165 years ago with a mission 
to teach "colored" children, the Oblate Sisters have served schools and 
orphanages in as many as 35 states. Now, as is the case in other religious 
orders, their numbers have dwindled and their members have aged. But their 
sense of purpose remains strong, bolstered by a history of forbearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters have worshiped in basement chapels. They have weathered the 
animosity of white Catholics who objected to seeing black women in habits. They 
have survived periods in which church officials, pessimistic about their 
survival, advised them to "return to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 One 69-year-old sacristan remembers the days when black nuns were permitted to 
take communion only after white communicants had finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oblate Sisters' belief is rooted in the order's extraordinary beginnings. 
In 1817, Elizabeth Lange, founder of the order, came to Baltimore from the 
Caribbean with two major handicaps: She was a free black woman in a slave state 
and a Catholic in what was then a predominantly Protestant city. Furthermore, 
she spoke only French. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Baltimore had become home to thousands of refugees from political 
upheavals in Santo Domingo and other islands. When the emigrants arrived, they 
found a segregated society where their children could not attend schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the Rev. James Joubert, a priest of the Sulpician order, 
Elizabeth Lange started a school that offered free education for black 
children. Next, she persuaded the Vatican to approve a convent to serve this 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rome officially recognized the Oblate Sisters of Providence as a 
religious order, it became the first within the Catholic church to devote 
itself to teaching black children. (The Latin root of "oblate" refers to 
someone who offers his or her life to some form of work.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next century, the Oblates opened and operated many schools around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 147 nuns carry on the work, and most of them live at the motherhouse. 
About half are foreign-born. The order has one white member, Sister John 
Francis Schilling, principal and president of St. Frances Academy in Baltimore. 
(The order's founding rules state that the Oblate Sisters cannot turn away 
aspiring nuns because of race.) Fewer than 10 nuns are under 40, says Sister 
Claudina Sanz, the order's superior general. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mount Providence, copies of Mother Lange's portrait can be seen everywhere. 
The only existing photograph of the founder, taken when she was in her 90s, 
shows her to be a tiny woman with bright, piercing eyes. She looks wise, 
determined and, perhaps, a bit stubborn: She continued to speak French all her 
life even as she fought to expand her congregation in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Now her order is working hard to advance Mother Lange's cause in the Catholic 
Church's lengthy canonization process, a journey that began three years ago 
when the Vatican approved the campaign to make her a saint. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister John Francis Schilling first joined the order in 1967. Now 48, the 
white nun first visited a community of Oblates in Chicago with an African 
American friend who was interested in becoming a nun. Instead, it was Sister 
John Francis who decided to join the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very taken by the sisters' warmth," she recalls. "I had been taught by 
religious all my life, but there was something different about the Oblates that 
appealed to me. They weren't aloof, there was a warmth, a welcoming kind of 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first my parents did not feel I would be accepted in the African American 
community, but I've found it just to be the opposite. I've been accepted 
everywhere I've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the Oblate nuns is Sister Claudina, 52, who grew up on the island 
of Belize, the sixth of eight children. She joined the order in 1961 and became 
its 17th superior general last June. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, she was fascinated by the nuns who taught her, and she read as 
many books as she could find about convent life. She also participated in 
almost every extracurricular activity school offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the Oblate Sisters, she chose to join a black order because of 
the prejudice against black nuns throughout the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, they were one of only two communities who accepted applicants 
who were black," says Baltimore Archbishop William Keeler. "But in the '60s, we 
all became conscious of the need for racial justice. Many other communities 
took a lead from (the Oblates) and opened up to people of different racial 
backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Claudina says, "Even until the 1970s, many of the white orders did not 
accept black girls. I could have joined an order at home, but I would have been 
too close to my family and that would have been difficult. My spiritual adviser 
was a black man who told me to go to the Oblates because he understood the 
racism in the American church." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two other primarily African American orders for women: the Holy 
Family in New Orleans and The Franciscan Handmaids of Mary in New York. Sister 
Claudina believes the black orders have brought important lessons about 
persistence and perseverance to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think black Catholics in the United States have a lot to teach people in 
general about love of God and faith in God and that all humankind is one," she 
says.

CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO ORDAIN WOMEN; PRIESTHOOD: OFFICIALS DESCRIBE TODAY'S 
CEREMONY FOR 33 WOMEN AS A JOYOUS OCCASION. BUT SOME ALIENATED MEMBERS ARE 
LEAVING, MOSTLY FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

 When Christine Clarke drapes a clerical stole across both shoulders, becoming 
one of the Church of England's first woman priests, she will fulfill a calling 
she has felt for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long wait, but now there is a sense of everything coming 
together," said Clarke, 48. "There is a feeling that for this I was born. Now 
we are walking right into the central structure of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of spiritual torment and theological wrangling, women are being 
admitted to the priesthood for the first time since King Henry VIII created the 
Church of England in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The state church's 1,200 woman deacons and their supporters are expected to 
pack Bristol Cathedral today for the ordination of 33 women by Bishop Barry 
Rogerson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be a very joyous occasion, a full house," said the Rev. Paul 
Denyer, communications officer of the Bristol Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's marvelous to have been able to put ourselves out of business," said 
Caroline Davis, director of the Movement for the Ordination of Women, which was 
formed 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's spiritual leader, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, has been 
a strong supporter of ordaining women, but the issue has tested the church's 
traditional toleration of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the humanity of Christ which is important, not his maleness," Carey 
argued before the ordination of women was approved by the General Synod in 
November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the change, the Church of England joined 12 of the 28 self-governing 
provinces of the worldwide Anglican Communion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1,381 women serving as Anglican priests, including 1,031 in the U.S. 
Episcopal Church, according to the Anglican Consultative Council. The Episcopal 
Church has ordained women since 1976, and in 1989 consecrated the first woman 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Clarke and the others will be able to bless the bread and wine at Holy 
Communion, pronounce absolution and the forgiveness of sin, and give blessings 
-- priestly duties previously forbidden to them. They will be allowed to wear 
their clerical stoles "priest-wise," or across both shoulders, instead of 
"deacon-wise," over just one. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, a deacon in Bristol, said she has encountered little opposition to her 
ordination, "but I cannot forget that others in the church are hurting over 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Fortune-Wood, 32, who has three children, holds a doctorate in theology 
and has been a deacon for five years, has "felt called to the priesthood from 
childhood." She said ordination will "remove that hollow center" in her 
ministry: the inability to celebrate Communion. 
</P>
<P>
 She also reported little opposition at her parish church, St. Andrew's in 
Swindon, Bristol Diocese, where she is a counselor to single parents and the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two elderly ladies left early on, but everyone else is supportive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the governing General Synod voted, 35 Anglican clergymen and several 
hundred lay people have quit the Church of England in protest, said church 
spokesman Steve Jenkins. Many joined the Roman Catholic Church, which does not 
permit women to be priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Anglo-Catholic traditionalist group, Forward in Faith, 
released a statement signed by eight serving or retired bishops and 712 priests 
and deacons indicating they intended to forsake the church to become Roman 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a matter of great sadness," said Margaret Brown, co-founder of Women 
Against the Ordination of Women. "We are not just a few cranks. Votes in 
various synods have shown at least one-third of the church opposes women's 
ordination." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Malcolm Widdecombe of Bristol, a prominent dissenter, believes the 
church "is moving into error." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is against the tradition of the church and the teaching of Scripture," 
he said. "Our Lord gave an honored position to women, but he chose men for the 
major tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Widdecombe believes ordaining women will be disastrous for church membership, 
which already is sparse. In a country of 55 million people, about 6.7 million 
belong to Christian churches, according to the United Kingdom Christian 
Handbook. The Church of England claimed 1.47 million, down 21% since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to accommodate dissenters, the General Synod put several 
limitations on woman priests. They may not become bishops, a parish may refuse 
to accept a woman as its priest, and bishops now in office cannot be compelled 
to ordain women or accept them as priests in their dioceses. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod also approved special severance pay arrangements, which became 
effective Feb. 22, for full-time priests who decide in the next 10 years to 
resign rather than accept women as colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, the General Synod -- consisting of laity, clergy and 
bishops -- prohibited discrimination against opponents of woman priests. 
</P>
<P>
 It also permitted dioceses, with bishops presiding, to make their own rules on 
acceptance of female priests. Parishioners may change to dioceses whose bishops 
have acceptable views on women's ordination, and two "flying bishops" have been 
appointed to serve traditionalists throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this, Brown said, in some cases "there is pressure on dissenters 
(among the clergy) to toe the line. Hints are given that they might not be 
promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 Widdecombe says he will continue at his church, St. Philip and St. Jacob, 
"because my parishioners are very supportive and we have something good going." 
He reported receiving inquiries from dissenters in other parishes about joining 
his flock of 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon John Simpson of Bristol cathedral said the first ordination service for 
women will be the same as for men, with "a few changes, such as using more 
inclusive language -- changing 'he' to 'she' -- and some small alterations to 
the prayers on ministry."

 On Sunday, 350 children will lift their voices in song in a tribute to the 
legacy of Natalie Sleeth, one of the most prolific composers of children's 
choir music of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36th annual Ecumenical Children's Choir Festival Service, held this year 
at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, will be a tribute to the composer, 
who died in 1992 at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous experience for the boys and girls to sing in such a large 
choir," said the Rev. David Young, a former president of the Choral Conductors 
Guild of California, whose Los Angeles chapter presents the festival each year 
to raise money for its scholarship fund. The proceeds benefit college and 
graduate students preparing to become church choral directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who is pastor of music ministries at First United Methodist Church of 
Covina, will conduct the third- to eighth-graders, along with a full complement 
of brass instruments, flutes, xylophones, glockenspiels and several handbell 
choirs. The children are members of 12 church and church school choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The choral director said all the musical selections of the service, except for 
hymns, are compositions by Sleeth, who wrote hundreds of anthems and several 
songbooks for children's choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I enjoy about her music is that it really grabs (the children)," Young 
said. "She wrote the text and music herself, and she sold the words on the 
wings of the rhythm . . . so that the children can really minister through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who knew the composer slightly, said that although Sleeth graduated 
from Wellesley College and studied composition at Southern Methodist 
University, she was primarily a homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The service will begin at 3:30 p.m. at 1760 N. Gower St., Los Angeles.

ARMED FORCES TURN TO CONTEMPORARY RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS; BROADCASTING: U.S. 
MILITARY NETWORK NOW OFFERS CHRISTIAN ROCK, BLACK GOSPEL. TRADITIONAL SHOWS 
FEATURING BILLY GRAHAM AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DROPPED OR SHORTENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Religious programming was once ranked at the bottom of the popularity scale by 
the young listeners and viewers of Armed Forces Radio and Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Christian rock music, black gospel singing and Top 10 
contemporary Christian music dominate the five weekly hours of religious radio 
offered to military stations. And the religious television package is livelier, 
too, with magazine-format shows and religious videos done in the MTV style. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation was largely the effort of two chaplains at a little-known 
military facility in the San Fernando Valley -- the Armed Forces Radio and 
Television Service Broadcast Center in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, both radio and television religious programming . . . 
will be compatible with our audience's lifestyles and tastes," Army Maj. David 
Smith, religious program coordinator, wrote to fellow chaplains after the 
revamped schedules were introduced last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feedback was extremely positive from programmers at a meeting here last 
December because 70% of our audience is between the ages of 18 and 28," Smith 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Fry, a civilian who directs programming and news at the Sun Valley 
center, confirmed that the changes have had a good response. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were my choice, I'd put the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on every week," 
said Fry, who has been in broadcasting since 1952. "But the more contemporary 
the program, the more popular they are compared to the old-style religion 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelist Billy Graham's "Hour of Decision," for instance, was dropped along 
with other traditional religious radio shows, including one from the Salvation 
Army.  
</P>
<P>
 The format innovations on the military network were launched by Smith's 
predecessor, Air Force Maj. Richard Davenport. One well-received change, Fry 
said, was the introduction of religious-themed children's TV programs for 
military families with small children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armed Forces Radio and Television Network, heard in 128 countries and on 
ships at sea, selects news, sports, situation comedies, movies, specials and 
other programming. Extra news coverage of disasters is picked up from the major 
broadcast networks and CNN and transmitted by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Its limited budget has diminished because of military cutbacks, so the 
broadcast center relies on the patriotism of networks and on producers to 
donate their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious broadcasters go even further to accommodate the needs of the 
Armed Forces Network. For instance, Pat Robertson's "700 Club" is pared down to 
half an hour by his Family Channel editors and the Rev. Robert Schuller's "Hour 
of Power," the top-rated syndicated religious program in the country, is edited 
to 30 minutes by technicians at the Crystal Cathedral, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "White Heat," a Christian metal music show produced by broadcaster Ken Roberts 
of Torrance, is done free of charge solely for the military network. "Love on a 
Rock" (top hits) and "Amen Corner" (black gospel) also are specially produced 
for the network. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't hear these programs anywhere else," said Smith, 38, a United 
Methodist minister who is halfway through a three-year assignment at the 
broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest concerns, however, are to present programs that appeal to 
a variety of faiths and ethnic groups and to assure that the spiritual 
exhortations do not include pleas for money. 
</P>
<P>
 On radio, "East of Eden," a Jewish program of music and talk, is offered at 
eight holiday times during the year. "Passages," an award-winning program 
featuring interviews of people whose faith helped them overcome traumatic 
experiences, is produced by the Presbyterian Media Mission in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 On television, "The Jesuit Journal" and "Catch the Spirit" offer interviews on 
current faith issues from the Catholic and Methodist perspectives respectively. 
When "Hour of Power" is not showing, the military network offers the upbeat 
"Outreach of Love" Sunday service from an African Methodist Episcopal church in 
Baltimore led by Pastor Frank Reid, formerly of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a chaplain, I don't want to play the ratings game, but if the servicemen 
and women are not listening or watching, then we are not reaching them," Smith 
said.

CONSERVATIVE CATHOLIC WINS $1-MILLION TEMPLETON PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many of his contemporaries, Michael Novak went from anti-war activist in 
the 1960s to conservative in the 1980s. The Catholic scholar's theological 
odyssey won him the $1-million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the award Tuesday, administrators of the prize praised him as a 
pioneer in the theology of economics. Best known for leading lay opposition to 
the U.S. bishops' critique of the American economy, Novak was chosen by a 
nine-judge international panel that included former British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great myth of the 20th Century was for progressive people to imagine that 
the state was the engine of their hopes," Novak said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Templeton Prize was established in 1972 by investment manager John M. 
Templeton to recognize individuals who advance the world's understanding of 
religion. It is the largest monetary prize for achievement in any field. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous winners include Mother Teresa, the Rev. Billy Graham and Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn. Last year's winner was former Watergate figure Charles Colson, 
who later founded a prison ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak, whose writings include "The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism," "Belief 
and Unbelief" and "The Experience of Nothingness," holds the George Frederick 
Jewett Chair in Religion and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, he was a strong critic of the Vietnam War and an advocate of the 
federal government's anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak said his plans for the prize money include establishing merit 
scholarships at Stonehill College in North Easton, Mass., where he received a 
bachelor's degree, and aiding Notre Dame College in Bangladesh. His younger 
brother, Richard, died in Bangladesh during a Hindu-Muslim riot in 1964 while 
on a missionary assignment as a Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Templeton Prize will be awarded at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace 
on May 4.

THE VOTERS MAY NOT BUY IT; BETTER HAVE A BACKUP TO THE BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Along with all the other things that were wrong with it, the Northridge 
earthquake now seems to have had bad political timing. Because the temblor took 
place in an election year, many of the state politicians to whom Californians 
normally might look for bold leadership in the rebuilding effort are instead 
playing it cautious and politically safe. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to be the only reasonable explanation for this week's bad decision 
by Gov. Pete Wilson and some leaders of the Legislature to pay for the state's 
share of rebuilding costs not with a modest and temporary tax increase, as was 
correctly done after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, but with $3 billion in two 
bond issues on next June's primary election ballot -- $2 billion for quake 
repairs to highways and state buildings and $1 billion for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody likes taxes. But bonds, too, must be paid for by the taxpayers. And in 
the long run they cost more than equivalent taxes. For example, with interest 
the $2-billion quake bond issue proposed Thursday will, over 20 years, cost 
taxpayers $3.4 billion. Some bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the bond issue is larger than needed for the state's 
share of repairs, which the Wilson Administration estimates at $1.05 billion. 
It has been padded with funds for highways elsewhere, mostly in Northern 
California -- no doubt to sweeten the package for those voters, and their state 
legislators, who did not suffer damage in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But California voters, if not the politicians, are hip to the dangers of being 
overly bonded, which is why several bond proposals -- even for schools and 
parks -- have been defeated in recent elections. So it would be no surprise if 
the proposed earthquake-rebuilding bonds met a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were to happen, Sacramento, with a state budget already facing a 
deficit, would be left with nothing for repairing quake damage. And that lack 
of state commitment could jeopardize the impressive flow of financial aid thus 
far provided by the federal government, aid that eventually could exceed $9 
billion. Without some state funds, Congress would be justified in asking if 
California deserved further generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few state leaders who has shown the gumption to fight for a 
temporary sales tax increase is Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). In the state Senate Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) has pushed 
the equally reasonable idea of a modest gasoline tax hike to pay for rebuilding 
fallen freeways and retrofitting state highways against future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both should stick to their guns when the quake bond election plan comes before 
the Legislature for its approval next week. At the very least, they should 
fight to get some kind of pay-as-we-go quake tax in place as an emergency 
alternative to the bond issues, should they be defeated in June.

CASE NOT CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office still must answer questions about 
the fatal shooting of one Orange County sheriff's deputy by another during a 
training exercise last Christmas Day, although a county grand jury this week 
decided not to return an indictment in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office had said it wanted to charge Deputy Brian P. 
Scanlan with involuntary manslaughter in the killing of Deputy Darryn Leroy 
Robins.A prosecutor said that criminal charges were a "close call" and the 
matter is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be true legally, but the shooting was so unusual and seemingly 
inexplicable that the district attorney's office should disclose the facts in 
the case to help the public understand how the grand jury reached its decision. 
The Sheriff's Department was slow and grudging in releasing details after the 
shooting and the district attorney dropped the traditional blanket of secrecy 
over the investigation; grand jury proceedings are secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the shooter was white and the victim African American, the case is 
especially sensitive, although there has been no evidence that race played a 
part. Incredibly, the exercise that led to the shooting occurred in a public 
place, the parking lot of a Lake Forest movie theater, rather than at some 
secure location. The use of a loaded weapon was in clear violation of Sheriff's 
Department rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The department must make sure its training prevents similar incidents in the 
future. And the district attorney must lay out all the evidence in order to 
calm public concerns.

FROM TAGGER TO RUNNER; A PROMISING PROGRAM HELPS LOS ANGELES KIDS RUN AWAY FROM 
TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're trying to break a bad habit, a replacement activity is extremely 
important. Otherwise, those old ways will haunt you.For Jason Bender, the bad 
habit was being in a graffiti tagging crew. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most obvious eyesores in Los Angeles is graffiti, an ugly, somehow 
psychologically threatening phenomenon. (Not surprisingly, many of the readers 
who wrote in about the flogging sentence for an American tagger in Singapore 
applauded the harsh penalty.) 
</P>
<P>
 One clue to dealing with tagging perhaps can be found in the story of Bender, 
who has traded in his spray paint for running shoes. "They (the taggers) just 
aren't my friends anymore," explained Bender, 18, of Reseda. The reason is a 
five-year-old program called Students Run L.A., which helps at-risk youths 
develop self-esteem and motivation by training for the L.A. Marathon. The March 
6 marathon attracted 970 teen-agers from Students Run L.A. More than 90% of 
them finished the race, according to Students Run L.A. co-director Marsha 
Charney. It took Bender more than 6 hours to finish, but, Charney says, the 
point "is to complete it, not compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit of the program is the link forged between youngsters and 
teachers. For example, Bender says that Paul Trepani of Aliso Continuation 
School in Reseda is "like a father to me." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who stick it out, Students Run L.A. has produced gratifying results. 
"If they smoked, they stopped," Trepani said. "If they were normally late for 
class, they began showing up on time. If they had no plans to graduate, they 
made them." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Bender plans to become a police officer. Sounds like those 
taggers had better start training, too.

FULL CREDIT FOR THE INQUIRY; BUT THE FINDINGS ABOUT THE HEBRON MASSACRE ARE 
TRULY SHOCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commission of inquiry named by Israel's government to investigate an 
Israeli's massacre of Muslim worshipers in Hebron Feb. 25 has elicited the 
astonishing information that Israeli troops are forbidden to shoot at Jewish 
settlers in the disputed territories, no matter how great the threat or the 
provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 This Israeli army order, which certainly was known to the armed settlers, in 
effect has been an invitation to lawlessness and on more than one occasion 
before the slaughter at the Tomb of the Patriarchs was taken as such. Indeed, 
just weeks before that tragedy settlers engaged in a shooting spree in the 
largely Arab-inhabited town of Hebron while soldiers stood by passively. 
Perhaps if the questions that are being asked now about violence committed by 
some settlers had been asked then, the massacre at the mosque could have been 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin's government deserves full credit for trying to 
uncover the obviously embarrassing facts about the Hebron killings. But no 
matter how vigorously the official inquiry is pursued, it will fall short if it 
fails to prompt some basic changes on the West Bank, in overall security 
procedures and in government policy toward the settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony has shown that Israeli security at the mosque was lax beyond belief. 
Three of the Israeli guards who were supposed to be on duty had overslept, a 
fourth was apparently in the habit of seldom reporting for duty. Baruch 
Goldstein, who carried out the massacre, was allowed to enter the area carrying 
a rifle and a large bag of ammunition and with ear protectors of the kind used 
on firing ranges. His intentions should not have been a mystery to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 For far too long Israeli settlers, and especially the few thousand militants 
among them, have been allowed to act as if they were a state within a state, 
immune from some of the legal constraints that apply to all others who live 
under Israeli law. The price of official tolerance for their activities has 
proven to be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has long been concerned with controlling the Palestinians it governs. 
It invites further tragedy if it doesn't move vigorously now to better control 
its own citizens.

INDEPENDENT STATE OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a strong supporter of reinventing state government and the sponsor of 
legislation to perform a top-to-bottom review of state bureaucracy, I take 
issue with Catherine O'Neill's column "The Millionaire's Club Is Off and 
Running" (Commentary, Feb. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's suggestion that three statewide offices -- the controller, treasurer 
and secretary of state -- be appointed by the governor rather than elected by 
the people fails to recognize the importance of independence from the executive 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, I recently uncovered gross fiscal mismanagement and possible 
embezzlement at Asilomar -- a conference center located on state property near 
Monterey. Our audit, which revealed a scheme to drain Asilomar's treasury of 
funds, led to the firing of the facility's controller, the resignation of its 
general manager and a full-scale police investigation. I am also working with 
the state attorney general to see if Asilomar's board of directors might be 
held liable for this fiscal mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just one of the many independent audits I have performed in the past 
seven years, audits that saved the state hundreds of millions of dollars. These 
aggressive audits of executive departments can best be performed by an 
independently elected controller -- not one appointed by the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 Gov. Pete Wilson tried to shut down the entire Richmond School 
District by denying the district an emergency loan to keep its doors open. If 
Wilson had gotten his way, thousands of children would have been without their 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I rejected the governor's orders and sent Richmond the $19 million 
loan. The Wilson Administration fought me all the way to the state Supreme 
Court and lost. The schools stayed open, the children got their education and 
last month, for the first time in four years, Richmond filed a positive fiscal 
report with my office. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that California must and should review every aspect of state 
government to make it more efficient. But let's not start by dismantling the 
independence of elected officials who provide fiscal independence and a check 
on the executive branch.

U.S.-JAPAN FRICTION OVER TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shintaro Ishihara's column "Imports Make U.S. Industry Go" (Commentary, Feb. 
24) is a prime example of the unmitigated tripe that Japan's trading partners 
must attempt to digest. Ishihara takes relevant facts and weaves a deceptive 
story to entice us into blamingourselves for the well-documented and pervasive 
practices of the Japanese government and businesses in closing their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States takes any equitable action to redress a grievance, the 
Japanese act as though they are the injured party. Those of us who have had to 
deal with the oft-xenophobic Japanese are tiring of hearing and reading the 
same self-serving story that the United States is unfair and that we are the 
problem. 
</P>

<P>
 It would be difficult to deny the existence of one-way barriers to the sale of 
U.S. imports in Japan, just as one would be hard-pressed to deny the negligence 
of many American manufacturers to engage the Japanese market in an 
appropriately responsible way. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the present focus on Japan to compel repair of its discriminatory 
market practices, I would hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that the 
primary cause of our continuing trade imbalance with Japan results from the 
failure of U.S. manufacturers to persevere against foreign competition within 
our own borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese market problem would be little more than a tempest in a rice pot 
if the American auto industry restored its former position in our own home 
market and if, with the coming of new multimedia and high-definition television 
(HDTV) products, the U.S. consumer electronics industry joined in a renaissance 
of made-in-the-U.S. manufacturing.

 Way before Japan's foot-dragging or, better, market-opening-dragging became a 
big news issue, I had long decided that the marketplace was unfair. I 
negotiated my own mini-NAFTA and my own mini-GATT without the help of Mickey 
Kantor. If the product is not grown in the United States, I don't buy it. If it 
isn't made in the United States, I don't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had to make sacrifices, to be sure, but I figure that my action might 
help in a mini-way to prevent the massive deindustrialization of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the billionaire CEOs, whose salaries certainly aren't adjusted tothe 
lowest level of the global market, I think they should register as foreign 
agents. To my way of thinking, that's what they are.

OLYMPIC SPIRIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 For two weeks, we have been spoiled by the gallant acts of courage, 
sportsmanship, and competition. The world has come together, embraced by the 
sheer joy of the Olympic spirit.For two weeks we were one world, once again. 
But now that the majestic harmony of the Olympics has come to an end, it sure 
will be good to get back to the bloodshed in Bosnia, the endless fighting in 
the Middle East, the starvation in Somalia, and the senseless violence raging 
on here at home. Geez, was it just youthful optimism, or for a brief second, 
did I actually believe that the world could really get along together? 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, we've watched athletes, coaches and fans from around the globe 
descend upon a gracious and peaceful Norwegian village. For two weeks, we have 
witnessed the best that man has to offer. Let us bottle some of that Olympic 
spirit -- full of peace, goodwill and love. Please, let's take a lesson from 
our athletes and begin our long march towards peace. In the words of Olympic 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, "Please stop killing. Drop your guns, 
please."

CAR INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a recommendation for dealing with the problem of uninsured motorists: 
</P>
<P>
 If you do not have auto insurance, then you automatically forfeit your right 
to sue another motorist for damages in the event of an accident regardless of 
who is at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not a complete solution, it would reduce litigation and 
encourage those now uninsured, to get insurance. It would also bring a sense of 
fairness to those who do buy insurance.

PLEA FOR A DRY WORLD CUP IS SCOTCHED; SPORTS: PASADENA REJECTS REQUEST FOR 
CITYWIDE BAN ON LIQUOR SALES IN EFFORT TO AVERT FIGHTS AMONG SOCCER FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can hoist your glass: The Cup is not going to cork the keg in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Friday that they have no intention of imposing a citywide ban 
on beer, wine and liquor during the upcoming World Cup soccer games as tourney 
organizers want them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the World Cup Organizing Committee has asked mayors of all nine 
U.S. cities where championship matches will be played to enact the unusual 
drinking prohibition as a way of preventing hooliganism that has marred games 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Game organizers are seeking the "outright banning of sale or consumption of 
alcoholic beverages" in host communities during the games, Committee Chairman 
Alan Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 His group is contemplating such a ban inside the Rose Bowl and at other 
stadiums during the tournament, which runs from June 17 to July 17, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide bans on the sale of alcohol on game days have become common in 
Europe, where drunken fans have turned violent and gained notoriety as soccer 
hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 games became known as the "Teetotaler World Cup" when all 12 Italian 
cities hosting that 52-game series announced citywide alcohol restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not going to happen in Pasadena, Cole promised Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be some Draconian city ban," Cole said. "We haven't even 
checked to see if it's legal. Unless the governor is prepared to issue a 
one-day state of emergency for the city, I don't think we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials said their proposed no-drinking policy comes even though 
one of the games' major sponsors is Budweiser. Anheuser-Busch Co. has paid a 
reported $7 million to support the soccer series. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has rankled brewing company officials in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed. We think it's not only an empty symbolic gesture, but 
could even be problematic," said Joe Castellano, an Anheuser-Busch vice 
president. "It's un-American, you can put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena business owners were ready to toast that news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relief," said Billy Bitonti, who spent $150,000 to double the size of 
his Domenico's Big D Sports Bar in preparation for the games. "I have a big 
security crew. Soccer fans can't be any rougher than 23-year-old college 
drinkers."

CONTROLLING MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "eradication at all costs" approach to the Medfly problem in Southern 
California is one of the reasons that the state Department of Agriculture 
resorts to aerial assaults on residents with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense tells us that it is difficult, if not impossible, to eradicate 
any insect, especially "bad" ones, and most attempts result in strong comebacks 
by the undesirable insects after their natural enemies are also destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 A more reasonable approach would be to control the flies with ground spraying 
and sterile flies. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also tries to make a case for aerial spraying by asking us to 
believe that the $20-billion farm industry in California would be destroyed if 
they don't use aerial spraying. Has farming been destroyed in Hawaii? In 
Florida? 
</P>
<P>
 Does the threat of a Japanese boycott of products cause a program that puts 
economic interests above health and environmental interests of residents in 
Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 Again, a much more common sense approach is control rather than eradication.

<TEXT>
<P>
 To all who criticize Paul Pilkington for having the audacity to win the L.A. 
Marathon, shame on you! The race officials paid him to run a five-minute-mile 
pace in order to ensure a quick winning time. He did just that, for the entire 
race, yet no runner chose to challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the sore loser, Mr. Barzaghi, if you want to run your own pace, fine, 
but in a race, the victory goes to the best competitor. Besides, why have a 
rabbit in the race in the first place, if none of the runners will run 
alongside him because they assume he's going to drop out? 
</P>
<P>
 The point in the marathon is to get from start to finish the fastest. Paul 
Pilkington did that, so he deserves the money and the Mercedes.

 Alan Paulson is a very wealthy man and a true sportsman. His returns can never 
approach his vast investment in horse racing.His rewards are prestige and 
recognition as a major force in the sport he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 However, his horse, Stuka, did not deserve to be given the winner's purse in 
the Santa Anita Handicap, since he finished second and was not involved in the 
incident that caused the disqualification of the winner. It would seem 
appropriate that Mr. Paulson donated the more than $300,000 difference between 
first and second money to a worthy charity, such as a home for indigent horse 
players, or research on the cause of, and cure for, brain damage in racing 
stewards.

</P>
<P>
 Mr. and Mrs. Paulson and their party did not leave their box until the inquiry 
was over and Stuka was declared the winner. The Hersh party was already leaving 
the winner's circle and going down the ramp when we arrived. At no time did Mr. 
Paulson ask anyone to leave the winner's circle. The remark he made was that he 
was sorry their number was taken down and that it had happened to him in the 
past.

HOW MUCH IS LOST WHEN YOU WIN AT ANY COST?

 Congratulations for putting into print what City basketball coaches have known 
for years (March 8). Crenshaw has blatantly recruited players, seemingly with 
the blessing of its administration and the City athletic office since Willie 
West has been coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the athletic office have avoided thorough investigating 
complaints about Crenshaw for so long that Crenshaw, literally, feels it has a 
license to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches with the win-at-any-cost mentality eventually degrade themselves, 
their schools and all associated with their programs. They should not be 
coaching.

 Once again, the L.A. Times and Eric Shepard have chosen to mount an attack on 
Willie West and his Crenshaw High basketball program. After winning the State 
title last year, the Times ran a series of articles alleging various 
allegations of misconduct against Crenshaw and its coaches. The articles led to 
a thorough investigation by L.A. City officials, resulting in no penalties 
whatsoever. Apparently, this has angered Mr. Shepard, who writes that West is 
"obsessed with winning, so much that (he has) compromised principles for 
victories. Values such as respectability, responsibility and sportsmanship have 
taken a back seat to championship trophies." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former teacher and coach, and now an attorney specializing in juvenile 
criminal law, I have known Willie West for 30 years. He is obsessed -- obsessed 
with getting his players scholarships so they can continue their education. 
Obsessed with making them go to class. Obsessed with trying to help them get 
jobs after they have graduated. Willie West was so "obsessed" with winning the 
holiday tournament at South Carolina mentioned by Mr. Shepard that he benched 
his star player for an entire game for violating minor team rules, resulting in 
a loss.

 Congratulations to Eric Shepard for pointing out the obvious abuses of two

costs. These two schools should always have an asterisk (as in tainted) next to 
their names as they top the polls.

GOLF EXPO VISITORS IN SWING OF THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could call it club Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual Golf Expo, being held this weekend at the Anaheim Convention 
Center, is a high-tech paradise for dedicated swingers hoping to drive farther 
and putt straighter or just looking for few new toys to help them better enjoy 
their favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 From laser-guided putting aides to computerized golf courses, the Golf Expo 
offers a wide range of golfing gadgets for amateurs and professionals alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day event, sponsored by the Southern California Professional 
Golfers' Assn., runs through Sunday evening. It features displays by 125 
purveyors of golf supplies, clothes, resort and golf course information, 
country club memberships and the latest in practice equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stuff is small enough to be used at home, such as a 
battery-powered putting green with features that include an automatic ball 
return. Other pieces of equipment, on the other hand, are designed to bring the 
outdoors inside and wouldn't fit in most homes. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those, taking up a corner of the convention hall, is a computerized 
practice machine programmed to simulate the world's toniest golf courses. After 
the golfer hits a special ball toward the green depicted on a large video 
screen, the on-board computer determines how far and straight the ball traveled 
down the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 It even comes with sound effects, like twittering birds, to complete the 
illusion.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CONCESSIONS SHOW JAPAN YIELDING TO U.S. PRESSURE; TRADE: IN 
LATEST MOVE, AUTO MAKERS ARE ASKED TO PLAN MORE PURCHASES OF AMERICAN PARTS. 
EXPERTS SAY MORE DISPUTES LOOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under immense pressure from the United States over its huge trade surpluses, 
Japan has begun making concessions to American demands. But whether Tokyo will 
offer enough to head off a worsening of the trade dispute remains highly 
doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument over access to Japan's cellular telephone market is very close to 
settlement, and Japanese auto makers have begun announcing steps to boost the 
purchase of American auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the high-profile conflicts in these two areas are resolved, other 
disputes are waiting, on topics ranging from semiconductors to insurance to 
intellectual property rights. Also, some analysts believe that by waiting so 
long to yield in these areas, Japan has lost much of the benefit it could have 
gained by taking similar actions months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese stall and stall and stall and there's no movement, and then the 
other side screams . . . and they try to do something," said Paul Summerville, 
an analyst at Lehman Bros. Japan Inc. "I think that now the screaming got so 
loud, and (the threat of U.S. sanctions) is so scary for the Japanese, they're 
caving in." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Japanese concession came Friday, when Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of 
international trade and industry, told a news conference that the Japanese 
government expects auto makers to map out, by the end of March, their plans to 
boost purchases of U.S. auto parts. His statement provides an official boost to 
a process that has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing is done, U.S. sanctions will come one day," Kumagai declared. "I 
believe private companies understand this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced Wednesday that it plans to import about $2 
billion worth of U.S. auto parts in the 1995 fiscal year. Last Saturday, Mazda 
Motor Corp. said it plans to purchase $2.4 billion worth of U.S. components in 
fiscal 1997. Japanese media have reported that Toyota Motor Corp. will unveil a 
plan to purchase $6 billion of U.S. parts in fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by Japan's longest postwar recession, auto firms may actually be quite 
willing to dramatically increase imports of foreign parts, now that the strong 
yen has made imports even more of a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese automobile makers "are not profitable as they're currently 
structured," Summerville said. "They have to take advantage of the strong yen 
to import parts. . . . They can use this pressure from the state as an excuse 
to jettison their smaller suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cellular telephone dispute involving Motorola Inc. and the Japanese 
telecommunications firm Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO), further progress was 
made Friday toward finalizing the details of a deal that would provide the U.S. 
firm with greater access to Japan's market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in the final stage to finish up the negotiations, but there is still a 
possibility to change some parts," said Miyuki Ochi, a spokesperson for Nippon 
Motorola Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement between Motorola and IDO would head off the threat of U.S. 
sanctions on this issue. But a string of other conflicts loom on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The next focus of attention may be semiconductors. Japanese and U.S. officials 
will meet in Hawaii March 22-23 to discuss calculations of the foreign share in 
Japan's semiconductor market for the final quarter of last year. In the third 
quarter, this figure stood at 18.1%. If the final-quarter share is less than 
20% -- a goal mentioned in a 1991 trade pact -- the U.S. side might initiate 
steps leading toward sanctions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe that only a strong economic recovery in Japan would 
provide the domestic demand needed to pull in enough imports to significantly 
cut the nation's huge trade surplus with the United States, which ran at $59.3 
billion last year. But no end to the recession is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-festering trade imbalance has left the Japanese and American sides 
caught up in "posturing and confusion," said T.W. Kang, a management consultant 
at Global Synergy Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of U.S. sanctions may bring positive results in opening up Japanese 
markets, but the risk remains that the conflict could get out of hand, Kang 
said. Mutual dependency exerts a dampening effect on extreme actions by either 
side, but it provides no absolute guarantee against a mutually destructive 
pattern of retaliation and counter-retaliation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If America says, 'Hey, we're willing to shoot ourselves in the foot and go 
through a certain degree of pain to rectify this basic situation,' I think 
that's where things get kind of dangerous," Kang said. "You cannot predict all 
the fallout of such an action."

DOGFIGHT FOR GRUMMAN; WHAT WOULD THE DEAL COST IN LOST JOBS AND FACILITIES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Northrop Corp. buys Grumman Corp., two things are for sure: Some production 
plants will close, and a good many workers will lose their jobs. The question 
is, which ones? 
</P>
<P>
 In a dozen states, ranging from Northrop's home base in Southern California to 
Grumman's major presence in New York and Florida, the merged company would 
surely scrutinize its array of facilities for ways to consolidate and cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these facilities would be permanently shuttered. Thousands of jobs 
would probably be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the combined Northrop and Grumman would have four facilities that 
can build aircraft, but it might need only one or two. It would have four 
electronics manufacturing plants that might be reduced to two or three. And the 
company would have three plants building commercial aircraft structures, while 
one might be ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Which would survive? The outcome is hard to predict, because the combined 
company would have so many different products and a wide variety of plants to 
choose from. What's more, new government contracts could dramatically alter the 
equation. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop officials are providing few insights into the outcome, though the 
company spent about a year examining how Northrop and Grumman might fit 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some winners and losers among localities, though the smart 
thing today for companies seems to be to say, 'Gee, we haven't thought about 
that,' " said John Harbison, a Booz Allen & Hamilton aerospace consultant.  
</P>
<P>
 But the high probability that Northrop would close facilities indicates a good 
strategic fit with Grumman. Prudential Securities aerospace analyst Gary Reich 
said Northrop makes a better match for Grumman than rival Martin Marietta. The 
two companies are competing to acquire Grumman for a price that will surely 
exceed $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost certainly, Northrop would shut down some facilities in Southern 
California and in Grumman's home base of Long Island, though it probably would 
not undertake a wholesale withdrawal from either location, according to 
analysts, consultants and Northrop insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 So much of the intellectual capital of both firms is wrapped up in California 
and New York that the loss of key employees could swamp any cost savings from 
such a move, notwithstanding the fact that both states are among the 
highest-cost areas in the nation to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the issue is Northrop's option to acquire Vought Aircraft 
Co. of Dallas, a structural parts manufacturer of which it already owns 49%. 
Vought's low-cost work force and reputation for quality could influence 
Northrop to transfer its production of 747 jetliner fuselages to Texas, along 
with Grumman's commercial aircraft structure's business in Stuart, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the bid for Grumman, Northrop has been shutting facilities in 
Southern California, including an electronics plant in Anaheim and a drone jet 
plant in Newbury Park. It also elected to build its Tri-Service Standoff Attack 
Missile in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Northrop is hardly fleeing California. In closing Newbury Park, it 
transferred production to Hawthorne, where it will also locate some activities 
from the B-2 plant in Pico Rivera when that closes. Indeed, Hawthorne is 
representative of many aerospace facilities: It has a well-trained work force, 
a mixture of buildings and a neighborhood that has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northrop has invested heavily and its manufacturing technology is 
among the best, portions of the Hawthorne complex date from World War II. In 
heavy rains, employees have deployed buckets to catch leaking water before it 
fell on any valuable equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Apart from machinery and bricks, Northrup's key asset in California is its 
work force, including the world's biggest concentration of stealth experts. 
Similarly, Grumman has 5,200 employees in Bethpage, N.Y. -- the world's largest 
concentration of naval aircraft designers and naval electronics engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman said earlier this year that it would close its old Calverton, N.Y., 
facility and move production of the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft to a plant in St. 
Augustine, Fla. It also operates huge plants with excess capacity in Lake 
Charles, La.; Stuart, Fla., and Milledgeville, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northrop wins the battle for Grumman, one factor that will favor facilities 
in California is that Northrop officials know their own plants best. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tendency to shut down a person's facilities after an acquisition," 
said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc. "It may be a 
case of the evil you already know." Collision Course 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop Corp. and Grumman Corp. operate at opposite ends of the country, but 
the activities at many of their plants are similar. Facilities are sure to be 
closed and thousands of jobs eliminated if Northrop's takeover bid succeeds -- 
but where the cuts would come from isn't clear. A look at some of the firms' 
major facilities: NORTHROP

ITT SHERATON BUYS LUXURY RESORT BUILT BY CHARLES KEATING; HOTELS: THE INFAMOUS 
FACILITY REMAINS A GARISH MONUMENT TO THE S&L DEBACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ITT Sheraton Corp. said Friday that it has purchased the infamous Phoenician 
Golf & Tennis Resort, a 580-room luxury hotel in Arizona that was built by 
Charles H. Keating Jr. for nearly $300 million a decade ago and now stands as a 
garish monument to the nation's savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston-based lodging giant would not disclose the sales price, but said 
the purchase also included the 344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix as well as 63 
acres that surround the Phoenician in Scottsdale.A source familiar with the 
deal said Sheraton paid about $250 million in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheraton bought the hotels and land from the Kuwaiti government, which 
acquired a 45% stake in the property from Keating for $170 million in the 1980s 
and then bought the remaining 55% after federal regulators seized Keating's 
failed Lincoln Savings & Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both hotels are excellent properties and were obviously good investment 
opportunities," said Dolores Sanchez, a Sheraton spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating and his Lincoln Savings began building the Phoenician about 10 years 
ago. Geared toward affluent travelers, it boasted a $25-million art collection, 
seven pools, acres of marble flooring and two presidential suites that could be 
rented for nearly $4,000 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Phoenician's excesses -- coupled with frequent revisions to its 
design, many of which were ordered by Keating -- led to cost overruns that 
seemed to doom the hotel from the moment it opened in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators seized Lincoln in April, 1989, and took control of the 
Phoenician and Crescent hotels later that year. The Kuwaitis purchased the 
remaining interest from the U.S. government for $111.5 million in 1991.

INVESTORS PUSH STOCK BEYOND NORTHROP OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $2-billion takeover fight for Grumman Corp. intensified Friday as 
investors bid the price of Grumman's stock well above what Northrop Corp. 
offered to pay for the defense contractor a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders clearly were expecting Martin Marietta Corp., whose $55-a-share offer 
for Grumman was eclipsed by Northrop's $60 bid Thursday, to make a counteroffer 
approaching $65 a share, or $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, a Bethesda, Md.-based defense giant that has promised an "appropriate" 
response to Northrop's surprise action, remained silent about its plans Friday. 
Northrop, based in Century City, and Grumman, based in Bethpage, N.Y., also 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop, which has more than 21,000 workers in Southern California, makes the 
B-2 bomber and portions of the F/A-18 jet fighter and Boeing 747 commercial 
jetliner. The company also makes defense electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman, once a premier maker of jet fighters, now mainly makes surveillance 
and other defense electronics systems. Martin is one of the industry's largest 
concerns, with interests in electronics, missiles, satellites and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they see a pair of determined foes in Northrop and Martin, both 
of which have secured bank financing well in excess of $2 billion. For those 
reasons, traders had little trouble projecting that the bidding would 
intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marietta wants the company, and it would be ridiculous for them to walk away 
now after one opposing bid," said Thomas Canning, aerospace analyst for 
Standard & Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop and its soft-spoken chairman, Kent Kresa, are viewed as no less 
willing to back down -- as evidenced by Northrop's decision to launch a hostile 
bid for Grumman and thus disregard the normally genteel merger tactics common 
to the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Grumman's stock soared $3 a share to $64.75 in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading. Northrop, meanwhile, edged up 12.5 cents to 
$41.375, and Martin dropped $2 to $44.50, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 With Grumman clearly "in play," there was speculation that some other defense 
contractor might enter the fray. A variety of candidates were mentioned, from 
Lockheed Corp. to GM Hughes Electronics Corp. to Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts played down the idea of a wide-open bidding war, saying the 
battle would likely be left to Northrop and Martin. Still, the analysts had 
also been nearly unanimous earlier this week in predicting that Northrop -- 
which had privately offered $50 a share for Grumman before Grumman embraced 
Martin's merger plan -- would not make a hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop had little choice, however. With $5.1 billion in sales last year, the 
company is faced with either buying another firm or being bought itself, as the 
industry consolidates in the face of shrinking defense budgets. Martin is 
already one of the largest defense players, with $9.4 billion in sales last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Northrop, this is an issue of strategic importance," said Cai von Rumohr, 
analyst at the investment firm Cowen & Co. in Boston.

 Circle K to Increase Staffing: The Phoenix-based company is speeding up plans 
to schedule at least two employees on every shift at its 2,500 convenience 
stores in the wake of a clerk's recent shooting death in New Mexico. The 
announcement came the same day that Circle K was sued by the estate and fiancee 
of another employee who was shot in August as he chased a man who tried to use 
someone else's credit card. The suit alleges that Circle K knew of the dangers 
to clerks working alone on overnight shifts.

 U.S.-Germany Deal Protested: The United States has sealed a controversial 
telecommunications deal with Germany that lifted U.S. sanctions but prompted 
the European Union to initiate proceedings against Bonn, officials said. The 
trade officials could recall no case of a member state breaking with European 
ranks over commerce. While word of a possible deal first surfaced last summer, 
its formal execution caught some European officials short.

AGOURON DISCOVERS STRUCTURE OF ENZYME CRUCIAL TO COLD VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 La Jolla-based Agouron Pharmaceuticals said Friday that it has discovered the 
three-dimensional structure of an enzyme crucial to a family of viruses that 
cause the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the biotechnology company is years away from a marketable product based 
on its finding, Agouron's share price jumped 18% after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading, its stock closed at $14.75, up $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The enzyme, known as rhinovirus 3C protease, or RVP, is necessary for the 
virus responsible for most colds to replicate and produce symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Agouron's aim is to eventually produce a drug that will stop the virus from 
reproducing, gradually diminishing the cold -- a key difference from current 
drugs, which merely treat cold symptoms. But Agouron President and Chief 
Executive Peter Johnson estimated it would take at least five years and $7 
million $10 million to develop and test such a drug. Johnson declined to say 
how much the company has spent on research. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday marked the second time in two weeks that Agouron shares have surged. 
The stock rose 19% on Feb. 28 when Agouron announced that it had received 
additional research funds from Japan Tobacco Inc., which owns 2% of Agouron and 
has a research agreement with the company. LINUS CHUA

STOCKS, BONDS STOP SLIDING; DOLLAR IS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview  
</P>
<P>
 * Renewed buying in the bond market arrested a slide in stocks and bonds. Bond 
yields did not break through the 7% barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar was mixed against major currencies, while gold prices gave up 
some of the gains registered in market nervousness Thursday. Stocks and Bonds  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average spurted 32.08 to 3,862.70, which gave the 
blue chip gauge a gain of 30.40 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader measures also benefited from the buying that accelerated late in the 
day. The New York Stock Exchange composite index added 1.31 to close at 258.53 
and ended the week up 0.83. Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 2.54 to 466.44 
and added 1.70 in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues outpaced declines by more than a 7-6 margin on the NYSE. 
Volume amounted to 303.23 million shares as of 4 p.m., down from 333.46 million 
in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market closed on a firm note, which it hasn't done for some time," said 
Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Peroni attributed the turnaround in stocks to renewed buying in the bond 
market. The 30-year Treasury issue rose about 7/8 point -- recouping about half 
of Thursday's loss and lowering its yield to 6.90% from about 6.97% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders bought for technical reasons after concluding that Thursday's 
frenzied selling was overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial markets seemed to regain confidence gradually as the session 
progressed. The morning was spent in cautious trading, with the markets 
struggling to overcome the gloomy aftereffects of Thursday's rumor-incited 
rout. Rumors related to the Whitewater land development affair raised concerns 
about the Clinton Administration's ability to concentrate on policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 A government reading on retail sales had no lasting impact on the markets. The 
Commerce Department said that despite the bad winter weather in much of the 
nation, retail sales rose 1.5% in February after falling in January for the 
first time in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 February's gain was larger than expected, but January's figure was revised 
downward, indicating that the severe weather and Northridge earthquake 
depressed sales more than previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman gained 3 to 64 3/4 in heavy NYSE trading. After the close of regular 
trading Thursday, Northrop bid $60 a share, or $2.04 billion, for Grumman, 
challenging the Martin Marietta agreement to buy the defense company for $55 a 
share, or $1.93 billion. Northrop rose 1/8 to 41 3/8 and Martin slid 2 to 44 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous among the losers was Redlands-based Pacific Physicians Services, 
which tumbled 9 7/8 to 17 1/2 in heavy Nasdaq trading. The stock's investment 
rating reportedly was downgraded after the company's quarterly earnings failed 
to impress Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial stocks, including banks and brokerages, rose in sympathy with 
the bond market. Banks in particular had been weighed down recently by rising 
interest rates. Citicorp rose 1 1/8 to 39 3/8, Chemical Bank rose 1/2 to 36 3/8 
and Merrill Lynch jumped 2 3/8 to 43 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Los Angeles-based Aames Financial fell 20% in heavy trading on the 
company's projection that third-quarter earnings will slide to 17 to 19 cents a 
share from 28 cents a year earlier. Aames closed at 7 1/2, down 1 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 World markets generally closed lower Friday in the wake of Wall Street's 
weakness Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, stocks fell for the fourth straight session as a 
wider-than-expected Britain trade gap weakened the pound and drove down 
government bonds. The FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares slumped 42.0, or 1.3%, 
to 3191.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, stocks posted small gains after Japanese companies sold stocks to 
raise cash for year-end accounting purposes, traders said. The benchmark 
Nikkei-225 average closed up 24.60 points, or 0.12%, at 20,115.31 for a second 
straight day of advances.

RETAIL SALES RECOVER FROM SLIP IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retail sales surged last month as Americans overcame ice and snow and streamed 
to car showrooms and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government said Friday that sales for the first two months of 1994 
combined were flat, prompting analysts to predict that the latest upswing does 
not mean the buying boom that closed out 1993 will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said sales rose 1.5% in February, rebounding from a 
revised 1.6% decline in January that marked the first drop in 10 months. The 
February increase was led by sales of cars, clothing and food. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures for 1994 so far -- a net decline of 0.1% -- may not signify much, 
said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of unusual weather," she said. "People restocked their larders 
and bought warm clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Barr, an economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the latest 
figures show the January drop "was just a slip on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the new numbers do not alter their view that overall economic 
growth this year is likely to be about half the 7.5% annual rate increase of 
the last three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But merchants said they are encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $181.6 
billion in February, up from $178.9 billion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge was greater than expected. But the 1.6% January drop was revised 
downward from a 0.5% decline, a sign that the severe winter weather and the 
Northridge earthquake took a heavier toll than previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales represent about a third of the nation's economic activity. 
Excluding sometimes volatile car sales, which account for about a fifth of all 
retail buying, sales increased 1% in February.

 Mortgage Delinquencies at 20-Year Low: An improving economy and record 
refinancings drove down delinquencies in the fourth quarter, according to the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn., which predicted further declines this year. Every 
region in the nation registered improvements, although problems persisted in 
California, where the recession continues to batter much of the state, which 
contains 13% of the nation's housing loans.

 Fidelity Federal Parent Posts Loss: As expected, Citadel Holding reported a 
$37.5-million fourth-quarter loss and a $67.2-million loss for all of 1993. The 
thrift holding company attributed the losses to increased provisions for bad 
loans, declining loan revenues and the effects of the California recession. The 
firm said it is going forward with a restructuring plan that includes the sale 
of Fidelity Federal's 42 branches and the simultaneous transfer of about $482 
million in bad loans to a separate Citadel subsidiary.

ORANGE COUNTY'S HOTEL ROOMS GET MORE VISITORS IN '93; HOSPITALITY: THE 3.1% 
INCREASE IS A SIGN THAT THE INDUSTRY IS EMERGING FROM RECESSION, ANALYSTS SAY. 
ROOM RATES FELL, THOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's hotels finished 1993 with a 3.1% increase in room occupancies, 
one of the first clear signs that the industry is emerging from recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Room rates dipped 1.1% for the year, however, showing that hoteliers are still 
cutting prices and offering discounts to stay competitive, according to PKF 
Consulting, a Los Angeles firm that tracks the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, which had an occupancy rate of 66.9% for the year, contrasted 
with 64.9% for 1992, did better than Los Angeles, where the occupancy rate for 
1993 was 61.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Baltin, director of PKF's hotel consulting group, said that Orange 
County's airport area has snapped back, whereas the hotels near Los Angeles 
International Airport have not seen major occupancy gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's airport-area hotels, in fact, had the biggest increase in 
occupancy for the year--a 7.9% rise to 62.7%. Airport hotels typically cater to 
traveling business people, so the increase was seen as a sign of increased 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Los Angeles companies have moved" to Orange County, said Rod Schinnerer, 
manager of the Hyatt Regency Irvine, a large airport-area hotel. "I have seen a 
little more international traffic. That could be the result of Los Angeles' 
loss also." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim area, the county's top tourist and convention destination, did 
well too. Occupancy was 68.3%, up 1.6% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a bad year, but we still see a trend in which the conventions have 
fewer attendees than in past years," said Robert Schrader, general manager of 
the Pan Pacific Hotel, next to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott hotel, said that several 
major groups helped bolster occupancy in December. They included not only 
conventioneers but also football fans headed for the Rose Bowl and Liberty Bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "1993 ended up as a better year than we ever would have forecast. We 
certainly can't argue with the results." 
</P>
<P>
 North Orange County had an occupancy rate of 66.9%, up 1.5% over the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 South Orange County, which draws a resort and corporate getaway crowd, also 
fared well. Its annual occupancy rate was 68.3%, up 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming out of the recession, I believe," said Penny Elia, spokeswoman 
for the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the improving economy, South County got another lucky break during the 
spring and summer last: good weather. When people can't bask in the sun, they 
tend to go elsewhere. Judging by the weather so far this year, hoteliers said, 
their luck could continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quarter, the weather has been better than last year," said Bob Van Ness, 
sales director for the Surf & Sand Hotel in Laguna Beach. "That always bodes 
well." Fewer Empty Rooms 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lingering effects of the economic downturn, Orange County's hotel 
operators reported an upturn in business last year. Many say that they were 
pleased with the increased occupancy rate for 1993 and that it defied their 
expectations. They are still offering discounts to fill rooms, however, making 
their operations less profitable than they would be had the rooms been occupied 
at full price. HOTEL OCCUPANCY RATES 05,14,07,07,07,07 *2*Average *2*December

PHIL & JIM'S CLOSES REMAINING STORES; BANKRUPTCY: ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCE 
CHAIN LAYS OFF MOST OF ITS 70 EMPLOYEES AND PLANS TO LIQUIDATE ITS INVENTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil & Jim's, the financially troubled electronics and appliance chain, closed 
its five remaining stores on Friday and laid off most of its 70 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to sell its remaining merchandise during a liquidation sale, 
but Phil & Jim's President Phil Delgado Jr. would not say whether the events 
spell the end for the 40-year-old chain or whether there are plans to reopen 
one or more of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January, 
previously closed five stores outside Orange County and laid off 180 employees. 
On Friday, the company closed its stores in Anaheim, Anaheim Hills, Lake 
Forest, Huntington Beach and Cerritos and laid off all but a handful of its 
remaining employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's bankruptcy filing listed $16 million in debt and about $7 million 
in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $2 million of that debt involves extended warranties purchased by 
more than 100,000 customers who now have lost that protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The warranties were abrogated in bankruptcy court, Delgado said, and customers 
have been advised to contact manufacturers about warranty questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach resident Pat McCaffrey said Friday that she's facing a $305 
repair bill for a camcorder that broke just months after she purchased it from 
Phil & Jim's. McCaffrey said she also paid more than $100 for extended 
warranties -- now apparently worthless -- on a washing machine and a 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Wednesday, McCaffrey said, Delgado had assured her that Phil & 
Jim's would fix the broken camcorder. "Then I find out they're closing their 
stores," McCaffrey said. "I went and got my camcorder (Friday) because I was 
afraid if I left it there I wouldn't get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Friday's store closings and the as-yet unscheduled retail stock 
liquidation sale, Delgado said the 40-year-old company is still attempting to 
restructure its debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in a Chapter 11 (restructuring) and there's no plan to convert to 
a Chapter 7 liquidation" of the company, said Delgado, adding that "there is 
something that we're working on" to restructure the company's finances and 
debts.' 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado linked the privately held chain's financial woes to increased 
competition from large chains like Circuit City. But the company also has been 
hurt by a long-running feud involving its founding partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge in December ordered the estate of Jim Ousterhout,the 
firm's co-founder, to pay Phil & Jim's an estimated $1 million to settle the 
feud. "We won the lawsuit but haven't been able to collect yet," Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado also blamed "a huge inventory problem left by a previous (manager) 
that was not resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil & Jim's bankruptcy filing listed secured debt of $8.7 million, owed 
mainly to Whirlpool, General Electric Credit Corp. and Maytag Corp. It owes 
$4.8 million to 338 other manufacturers and vendors.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ARMOUR OF GOD': CHAN AS AN ADVENTURER FOR HIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's so much energy and ingenuity in the best of the Hong Kong martial arts 
movies that a routine production like "Armour of God" is bound to suffer in 
comparison -- even if it stars Jackie Chan, who also directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan is his usual impish, infectious self, but his film rambles far too much 
and is vague to the point of incoherence, even taking into account that at 
times there are limits as to how much subtitles can translate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan plays the Asian Hawk, apparently an adventurer for hire. His current gig, 
which takes him to Europe, is to gather for a rich collector the five pieces of 
the so-called "Armour of God," which seems to be a suit of armor plus a sword 
and is considered a sacred relic by a pre-Christian cult. The cult lives on in 
a remote mountain monastery, where its black-robed and hooded "monks" engage in 
the international drug trade and regularly import prostitutes for their orgies. 
</P>
<P>
 The cult is eager to retrieve the entire "Armour of God" suite, which is its 
most sacred ritual treasure. To that end it has kidnaped in Paris the Asian 
Hawk's former girlfriend, Laura (Rosamund Kwan), and is holding her in ransom 
for the three pieces of the armor in the possession of a wealthy count (Boris 
Gregoric). Joining forces in the Hawk's attempt to rescue Laura are her current 
boyfriend, Alan (Alan Tam), a Hong Kong rock star, and Gregoric's elegant 
sharpshooting daughter, May (Lola Forner). 
</P>
<P>
 Filmed -- in 1986 -- largely in an unidentified Yugoslavia, "Armour of God" is 
one of those films in which you're never quite sure what's happening or why and 
are given little reason to care, for its characters are as ill-defined as 
everything else. With so little that's involving, the obligatory spectacular 
action sequences don't count for much. "Armour of God," which is mediocre in 
virtually all aspects, is likely to please only Chan's most uncritical fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with "Armour of God" is "Police Story," the first in the Jackie Chan 
series that shows off his martial arts wizardry and in which he plays a 
fearless, devil-may-care Hong Kong cop who in this first outing is tracking 
down a drug lord.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NAKED SOUL REVEALS AN INTRIGUING POTENTIAL; DESPITE A FEW 
PROBLEMS, THE BAND DELIVERS FORCEFUL SONGS, HINTING THAT IT'S CAPABLE OF 
SOMETHING SPECIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An ideal Naked Soul concert would be a draining but cathartic experience, a 
clenched drama that fully involved an audience in the struggle against 
isolation and rejection that goes on in leader Mike Conley's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa band's short, casual bow Thursday night at Our House was far 
from ideal, but enough good things happened to suggest that Naked Soul's 
recently revamped and expanded lineup is capable of delivering something 
approaching a peak performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a hometown show in homey surroundings, Conley was affable and loose 
and not particularly concerned with involving the half-full house in 
psychodrama. That's not to say that the performances lacked power or resonance. 
While the lyrics may be about grappling with torments, Conley's best songs have 
a soaring quality that conveys yearning for better things. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the sheer force of the music carries the feeling of liberation and 
momentary relief that rock was designed to bring. At times, Naked Soul brought 
just that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Conley has been an inconsistent performer. Catch Naked Soul on 
the wrong night, and he could be unfocused on stage. He'd jerk away from the 
microphone, leaving words inaudible or unsung. He'd spend inordinate amounts of 
time with his back to the audience as he hunkered close to his guitar 
amplifier, coaxing out waves of feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarities between his style and Paul Westerberg's have been noted 
frequently, and the parallel sometimes extended to bouts of onstage moodiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by this show, Conley is now a happy fellow -- happy enough to jump 
and spin in an exuberant response to his band's hefty sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of a second guitar to complement his own was a good move: Bill 
Latas' glancing licks combined with Conley's slashing sallies to give Naked 
Soul a thick, hard presence. 
</P>
<P>
 The new drummer, Shawn Poores (like Latas, a relatively recent transplant from 
Kansas City), was a stout fellow who kept the beat simple and went red in the 
face with his effective labors to make it crudely emphatic. The two new men 
also were capable backing singers. Rounding out the band is a new bassist, Alec 
Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconsistencies in this show were more a matter of faulty design than 
erratic performance. At 37 minutes, the set was at least four or five songs 
short of a full load. 
</P>
<P>
 After a good start with "Dizzy," it bogged down with two undistinguished 
numbers from Naked Soul's 1992 debut EP, "Seed." That EP was indeed a gestation 
period for the band, because Conley's songwriting flowered on the strong 1993 
album, "Visiting Your Planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Another mistake was the mid-set summoning of Fluf's guitarist, O, for a cover 
of "Try," a crude, Seeds-style '60s-throwback culled from the contemporary band 
Overwhelming Colorfast. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pal-like thing to do, but it stalled the set. Better to have saved 
the sloppy fun between buddies for the encore. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensating for those flaws were good, storming versions of the irate "You, 
Me and Jack Kerouac" and the anguished "Helicopter Man," plus a well-wrought 
elegy in "Wishing Again" and a propulsive Who anthem, "So Sad About Us." 
</P>
<P>
 Conley may have gotten his start in an '80s punk band called MIA, but that was 
no excuse for letting the coursing rocker "If It's Cool With You" and the fine, 
dejected ballad "Visiting Your Planet" remain missing from this set's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pieces are there for Naked Soul to shoot for something special in 
its concerts, but that will take a more ambitious approach in which those 
pieces are assembled into a cohesive, emotionally grabbing whole. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting story in last week's Billboard magazine notes how 
Beatles-inspired bands keep coming in waves, even though the '80s and '90s have 
not been kind commercially to Beatlesque rockers. Think of Crowded House, Redd 
Kross, 3D Picnic, XTC and Squeeze, all of whom put a premium on melody, harmony 
and song craft, and none of whom has become a hot seller like many in the 
grunge field. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Permanent Green Light to the ranks of capable, highly skilled bands hoping 
that the masses will become as receptive to the charms of pure pop as they are 
to the latest sludgy rehash of Black Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles trio's harmonizing singers, Matt Devine and Michael Quercio 
(formerly of The Three O' Clock, an '80s psychedelic-revival band), worked the 
upper registers with the songs anchored and rocking -- Devine with stinging, 
well-shaped guitar leads, Quercio with active, McCartney-style melodic bass 
lines, and drummer Chris Bruckner with pinpoint guidance through the songs' 
episodic structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Dada, another L.A. trio that's a promising contender in the neo-Beatles 
mold, PGL had the ability to stretch out instrumentally -- witness the regal 
coda to "Something on Me," and a concluding workout that tossed in sections of 
Pete Townshend's "Overture" (or was it the "Underture"?) from "Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everything was engaging while it was being played. The problem is 
that the songs, most of them culled from the band's current album, "Against 
Nature," don't have the stick-in-the-mind quality of the best pure pop, which 
ought to keep you humming for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Incredible Circus Train, a trio from Hacienda Heights, opened with a set 
of rough-hewn but pop-conscious rock akin to the Lemonheads. It was a tad too 
sloppy at times, and Karl Rumpf's singing needs more presence and vigor. But 
there was some spark there, too, and a heartfelt tug in wistful songs about 
first loves and first heartaches.

CAMERA HOGS DETRACT FROM REAL NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a little late, but I feel this has to be put in print: It is 
understandable that television news needs those man-on-the-street reports. But 
to watch people mobbing around a TV reporter and acting crazy and members of 
gangs showing their gang signs is deplorable. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Channel 7 reporter was interviewing some people who were possibly 
becoming homeless because of the Northridge earthquake, they were nervous, but 
otherwise calm, because of theordeal. But, in the background, there were people 
dancing around, like it's a party, showing their gang symbols, showing no 
respect to the people being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that the news producers -- of all networks -- should show common sense 
and black out that interview and switch to another area. 
</P>
<P>
 We have enough problems with gangs in this great city, so why should we 
glorify them by showing their rudeness?

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; CONCRETE BLONDE'S UNSENTIMENTAL EXIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnette Napolitano wore pajamas to what was billed as Concrete Blonde's final 
gig Thursday at the Wiltern. Guess she's not kidding about calling it a night. 
</P>
<P>
 The full house had every right to see this quits-calling as tragedy, since for 
more than eight years, Concrete Blonde has been L.A.'s most consistently 
rewarding rock 'n' roll band, a power trio for the Angeleno ages. If "leave 'em 
wanting more" was the operative maxim in Napolitano's busting up the band, it's 
a successful exit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was certainly an unsentimental adieu Thursday, with minimal nostalgia waxed 
despite the singer's promise to "be sappy and corny tonight." There were a few 
intimations of possible bad blood, like when guitarist Jim Mankey -- called to 
the microphone by Napolitano -- reluctantly allowed that he would be sad, 
"because I can only look forward to poverty and obscurity." Her cheerful retort 
-- that "many people have poverty and obscurity and joy as well!" -- wasn't 
quite mending enough to lead to any group hugs at the close. 
</P>
<P>
 If they didn't go out arm in arm, the chemistry clicked as ferociously as ever 
in a set strong enough to make you fear they might never go on to circumstances 
so complementary. Napolitano's poignant wail, Mankey's liquid blues and Harry 
Rushakoff's drum thunder had one last go in a nearly two-hour show, culminating 
first with a revival of "Still in Hollywood," then a final ballad about someone 
not still in Hollywood, the AIDS-themed "Tomorrow Wendy." 
</P>
<P>
 If appropriate, the finale felt slightly anticlimactic, emotionally, and two 
conflicting sentiments lingered: All three talents will certainly thrive, and 
say it isn't so. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; RAMONES: AS RELIABLE AS YOUR FAVORITE HOME APPLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ramones pounded out "Teenage Lobotomy" for the billionth time in the 
quartet's near 20-year career Thursday at the Hollywood Palladium, proving as 
reliable as your favorite household appliance. In the world at large, nothing 
could seem so irrelevant, but within the Ramones' own special universe, the 
band was so true to its original sound, that very irrelevance was itself 
irrelevant.  
</P>
<P>
 What counts is that in the process, the band -- which ignited punk rock in 
America by banging out caffeinated tunes as early as 1975 and has influenced 
literally hundreds of bands -- gave its packed-in fans exactly what they 
wanted: a timeless Ramones show. The mop-top band blasted out new and old songs 
at warp speeds that exceed those of its records, which is par for the course 
with a Ramones show, going from one song to the next with little break in 
between, making the set seem like one long Ramones medley that picked up 
momentum as it went. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Ramone lost his voice mid-set, so changed certain lyrics into one 
syllable exclamations -- "Sheena is a yeeeaah " . . . "Rock, rock, rock and 
roll yeeeaah " -- but no one seemed to mind. It wasn't as if any crucial lyrics 
were lost to moshers going wild on the main floor. It wasn't better or worse 
than any previous Ramones shows, but just a good time as usual. Isn't that the 
point? 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Frank Black (formerly Black Francis of the Pixies) fought a 
terrible sound system. But eventually he and his band were able to cut through 
the woolly mixes, exposing buzzing, tweaked surf-guitar and Black's occasional 
banshee screams. He tamed the pumped-up audience, who were chomping at the bit 
to slam to the Ramones, and that's a feat in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ramones and Frank Black will play tonight at Crawford Hall, UC Irvine. 
(714) 740-2000. Tickets are $21. 7 p.m. LORRAINE ALI

ART REVIEW; 'GENGHIS KHAN' RELIVES ANCIENT GLORY; THE INNER MONGOLIA EXHIBITION 
AT THE MUSEUM OF NATIONAL HISTORY IS IMPRESSIVE AND ENLIGHTENING IN ITS SCOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 13th-Century equivalent of the bogyman or the threat of nuclear war was 
something called "The Mongol Hordes." If a frustrated mother in China, Russia, 
India or Iran wanted to scare the kids off to bed, all she had to say was, "If 
you don't shape up Genghis Khan will get you." 
</P>
<P>
 China's legendary Great Wall was built to stop invasions by Genghis and his 
predecessors from the northern steppes. It didn't work. Mongol soldiers shot 
arrows backward from their mounts with deadly precision. Some pierced armor, 
others whistled signals. Cavalrymen could ride for days without dismounting, 
subsisting by sucking blood from wounds in their horses' necks. In 1264 
Genghis' successor Kublai Khan established the Mongol capital at Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he died in 1227, at around age 65, Genghis Khan conquered much of the 
known world. Stretching north from Korea to Hungary, it was the largest empire 
that ever existed. Barbarously cruel, brilliantly gifted, loyal and sometimes 
wise, his name means "perfect warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he lays siege to Los Angeles in the form of a traveling exhibition at the 
Museum of Natural History titled "Genghis Khan: Treasures From Inner Mongolia," 
including some 200 objects. Most have never before been seen out of Mongolia. 
Quite a few are so newly discovered or so long forgotten, they have never even 
been seen in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized by the museum in partnership with the People's Republic 
of China, organized by Adam T. Kessler, a Los Angeles-based archeologist 
specializing in blue and white porcelain. Kessler spent the past several years 
surveying archeological sites in Inner Mongolia, one of five autonomous regions 
of China. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit of his sometimes Indiana Jones-esque adventures is an exhibition 
with two faces, one impressive, the other enlightening. It's being promoted as 
a blockbuster treasure show that could be slightly misleading for anybody 
nurtured on glitzy extravaganzas like "Treasures of Tutankhamen" or "The 
Chinese Exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a scholarly exercise that ends chronologically with Genghis Khan and the 
Yuan dynasty. The first star of this show is Ordos Man, a prehistoric Mongolian 
that proved that Homo sapiens existed on the steppes some 35,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be learned from such a vastness of time? For one thing, the catalogue 
suggests that many of these inscribed artifacts prove their types to have 
earlier origins than presently indicated by conventional museum dating. More 
philosophically, the show suggests common cultural roots for the Chinese and 
Mongolians who have historically been about as chummy as the Serbs and the 
Croats. Just who invented what will probably always remain a poetically apt 
mystery. Real people won't confine themselves to racial or social categories. 
They intermingle. Nowhere is that clearer than here, where the ancient silk 
route was the trading highway between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 If all that makes the show appear a kind of thinking man's blockbuster, those 
who like to go to museums to have their eyeballs entertained will not come away 
unrewarded either. They can marvel at everything from ferocious weaponry to 
textiles so old and delicate they suggest a wistful princess from Shangri-La. 
People who like the museum's dioramas will get a kick out of the tableau of 
Mongolians in native costume standing next to their yurt. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the beginnings of the famous ceremonial bronze wine vessels of 
dynastic China in a small, energetically squat gui that can be no more recent 
than the 4th Century BC. A shallow ewer from the same period is not so unusual 
in its stylized animal motifs, but almost humorously winsome in its humanoid 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pseudo-sophisticates like to jibe at the gold objects in such shows, but the 
fact is artisans lavished their best skills on works in the immortal metal. 
Here is a headdress from the Warring States Period that ended about 200 BC, 
which looks like a crown in two parts. The headband depicts horses and tigers. 
The skullcap bears a turquoise-headed eagle wired together so he moved with the 
wearer. Even more fascinating pictorially are a couple of gold plaques 
depicting fighting animals. They seem to be observed from above as if the 
artist watched from horse or hill. 
</P>
<P>
 A hands-down highlight here is a funerary room from the Liao dynasty of the 
10th to 12th centuries. It centers on a gilded bronze funerary mask of 
wonderful peace and pathos. But here the seduction of gold gives way to the 
astonishment of seeing tomb furniture and a painted coffin of wood that may be 
almost 1,000 years old. The climate of the steppes has preserved these wooden 
objects long after they would have crumbled to sawdust elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much aesthetic gratification here it's enough to make the art 
crowd change museums. Ceramics not only show the vigorous intermingling of 
Asian and Islamic styles, they produce a variety of effects from lyric delicacy 
to the power of unleashed nature. A potbellied Jun -ware censer from the 
Southern Song dynasty looks as solid as a bowling ball, but it's covered with a 
lavender glaze that manages to suggest both moving air and roiling water. It's 
an effect a modern artist would kill to master. It's testament to the genius of 
these ancient civilizations.

SINATRA AT THE GRAMMYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those of us who remember the skinny kid with the big bow tie of the 1940s 
and were thrilled by his rendition of "I'll Never Smile Again," Frank Sinatra 
being cut off in mid-thank you was indeed appalling ("Grammy's Sorry State, 
Frankly Speaking," March 2). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the greatest pop singer of this century deserved a classier intro 
than given by some guy called Bono.(Who is this Bono, anyway? I know he isn't 
Sonny.) Sinatra should have been introduced by someone with class, like Tony 
Bennett -- or, for that matter, Sonny Bono. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Grammy show offered the American people an embarrassing look at the 
current scruffy nature of popular music. The lead singer of one group uttered 
the F-word during his acceptance speech. Other speeches were bleeped. Even 
legendary Frank Sinatra seemed bewildered by it all. 
</P>
<P>
 How could any thoughtful person watching the show need a better answer to the 
questions, "What's wrong with the country; what's wrong with our kids?" Here, 
indeed, was "the talentless entertaining the tasteless." An American tragedy, 
really.

JOHN CANDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I was crossing the Mojave Desert, the radio report of John Candy's death 
was a bit overwhelming. I met him once, and he was a nice guy.The movie 
industry cannot afford to lose such quality comedians as the smiling Candy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the desert road became longer, I remembered the thank-you card I wrote to 
him that I never mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a single father trying to raise four children. Entertainment is not an 
expense I can often afford. I often look for movies that will not offend or 
embarrass my family. I cannot recall one of his movies that ever made me 
uncomfortable about bringing my kids. He made us laugh and yet his characters 
sometimes made you think a little. 
</P>
<P>
 I never saw him use vulgarity to capture an audience. The writers, of course, 
play an important role. However, the actor can choose the script, and Candy 
always seemed to cast himself right. For those who have ever been overweight 
and tormented because of it, then he represented something else as well. The 
world needed John Candy to make us laugh and think at the same time. I guess 
God needed him more. Thanks, John!

THE STRENGTHS IN MILLER'S 'NAKED BREATH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reading Richard Stayton's critique of Tim Miller's "Naked Breath," I found 
it revealing that the aspects of Miller's piece that Stayton saw as weaknesses 
were precisely those I had experienced as the most generous and affecting 
moments of the performance ("Sermon From a Love Pulpit," Feb. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Miller comes "perilously close to hubris" says much about his 
ability and his understanding of the fine line between authentic insight and 
hubris, which he negotiates, in my estimation, quite successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 His more than two years of not only touring his previous piece, "My Queer 
Body," but also facilitating workshops for gay men worldwide, creating a space 
for them to tell their stories of pain, passion, fear, of coming to an 
understanding of themselves as rightful participants in our society, have 
certainly sanctioned his "messianic tone," one I prefer to understand as 
liberating . 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, Stayton acknowledges that "it's a curious confession, at times 
even a compelling one" to Miller's comments: "So what's safe? This kiss? I've 
gotta have it. I get scared. . . . Clap. Amoebas. Herpes. Hepatitis. HIV. This 
fear chews me up for breakfast. I've been trying to turn this fear around." But 
then Stayton observes that "Miller disingenuously asks, 'Am I being too 
sentimental right now?' The answer is yes." 
</P>
<P>
 If "the answer is yes," then I ask, why? Is there a limit, an acceptable 
amount of affection, tenderness, passion and feeling that we, as gay men, 
indeed as people, are allowed to voice? 
</P>
<P>
 Then perhaps Miller's "disingenuous" query to the audience reveals the 
artist's -- possibly the audience's, possibly even the reviewer's -- deepest 
fear, of sentimentality, that fear of the consequences of allowing another 
person to see, hear, understand how he feels, and, yes, even ask for a response 
to that; an acknowledgment that he is , that he exists, as a man of feeling, of 
substance, of validity, and, yes, of vulnerability.

JAZZ REVIEW; HUTCHERSON BRINGS HIS DISTINCT SOUND TO BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Hutcherson, who opened Thursday at the Jazz Bakery for a three-night 
run, is one of a handful of vibraphonists to have brought a distinctive 
personality to the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 At 53 he has behind him a few years of flirtation with the New York 
avant-garde, a long and fruitful California collaboration with Harold Land, and 
more recently an album with McCoy Tyner.For the Bakery gig he used three 
eminent local musicians: Billy Childs on piano, Tony Dumas on bass and Ralph 
Penland on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical Hutcherson solo today may involve long, ingeniously built filigrees 
of sound leading to occasional stop-and-go effects, technically superb and with 
ingenious body English that adds an element of visual value. Sometimes he may 
seem virtually to attack the metal bars; at other points he may hesitate for 
dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs, of course, is a long established artist whose compatibility with 
Hutcherson was no less notable than his ability in each solo to combine beauty 
and the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tunes played, which Hutcherson regrettably neglected to announce, 
were presumably originals; recently he wrote new music for an album with Tyner. 
Of the standards heard, "My Foolish Heart" revealed a lyrical side that 
deserves more exposure. "Witchcraft" was another jubilant variation on a 
familiar theme carried off with typical Hutcherson brio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bobby Hutcherson at Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchinson Ave., Culver City, (310) 
271-9039. No cover or minimum; $20 door charge. Hutcherson closes tonight; show 
time at 8:30.

TV REVIEWS; LUST AND MISERY ON 'WINNETKA ROAD'

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the typical suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got mostly young, gorgeous people, trying -- is it too much to ask? -- 
to find a little love and understanding.You've got the blurry forms of nude 
lovers glimpsed through the frosted glass of a shower door. You've got 
meaningful pauses and lingering looks. You've got a cop named Jack Passion 
(Josh Brolin) reuniting with his former sweetheart, movie actress Terry Mears 
(Paige Turco), who's returned to upper-class Oak Bluff followed by her 
limo-riding, angry ex-boyfriend. You've got a handsome stud (Kurt Deutch) 
renting a garage apartment from a fetching local weirdo (Meg Tilly). You've got 
a square-looking guy (Ed Begley Jr.) who leaves his wife (Catherine Hicks) and 
two kids for another woman. You've got Hicks in her underwear and Eddie 
Bracken, best known as a comic actor from the '40s and '50s, as a blind priest. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Aaron Spelling's "Winnetka Road" is amiable nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by executive producer John Byrum and directed by Peter Werner, the NBC 
series stalks a middle ground between two Spelling successes: ABC's tumultuous, 
self-mocking "Dynasty" and Fox's homogenous "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 And just what kind of trouble is waiting in the wings? As one character says, 
"Personally . . . I think everything's about to go as wrong as it can." 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic attraction is not yet magnetic and the humor is only so-so, but 
"Winnetka Road" is the kind of sanitized lust and misery you hate yourself for 
watching but watch anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Winnetka Road" airs at 10 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

TV REVIEWS; HEPBURN, QUINN AS FILM LEGENDS IN 'LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even Katharine Hepburn and Anthony Quinn can salvage the ordinary and 
predictable light romantic drama "This Can't Be Love" but, then, the script is 
really irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Hepburn and Quinn. Step back. Make room for big faces. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still hard to resist, and he manages to negotiate (narrowly) what is a 
cajoling, down-on-his-luck, out-of-character role. What makes this story about 
the wrenching reunion of two aging movie stars and lovers who broke up 50 years 
earlier so watchable is Hepburn and Quinn's beguiling ability to poke droll fun 
at their very own Hollywood legends and egos.  
</P>
<P>
 It's all sufficiently nostalgic to turn the small screen almost back to 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepburn, who, amazingly enough, was born in 1907, during Teddy Roosevelt's 
second Administration (eight years before Quinn), made a better TV movie 20 
years ago about the same thing, an aging actress falling for an old beau ("Love 
Among the Ruins," co-starring Laurence Olivier). What distinguishes this 
production (directed by Anthony Harvey from a script by co-producer Duane 
Poole) is the ironic, often sardonic light it casts on the stars' real-life 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepburn and Quinn, although playing renowned, fictitious has-beens, are 
indulging a kind of inventive, self-revealing biographical movie here.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the credits, the movie opens up with 10 great black-and-white movie 
stills of vintage Hepburn, and later Hepburn's character reminisces how she 
never actually sat through all her own movies because "it's much too painful 
watching oneself fade away on celluloid." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning a coffee-table movie book with her devoted, young, live-in chauffeur 
(the sweetly affable Jason Bateman), she comes to a portrait of real-life 
Hepburn director George Cukor and casually remarks that "he used very shrewdly 
what I had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 She flips the page and there is a darkly handsome, brooding Anthony Quinn in 
his early Hollywood days, standing in jolting contrast to his movie persona's 
struggling, out-of-pocket former action-adventure star. Will passion rekindle 
when they are reunited? 
</P>
<P>
 In Hepburn's glory days, Hollywood made movies like this all the time. 
</P>

TV REVIEWS; WINNING PORTRAIT OF 'VLADIMIR HOROWITZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words of Wanda Toscanini Horowitz, "His philosophy was to transmit the 
music to the public and not to bore the public," launch "Vladimir Horowitz: A 
Reminiscence" and invite us to share with her an easygoing hour with the 
pianist, who died in 1989. He would have been 90 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Horowitz offers no startling revelations regarding her 56 years as the 
lionized pianist's wife. She does, however, offer a winningly unpuffy portrait 
of the man -- with whom she is concerned more than she is with Horowitz the 
musician, despite her mild protestations to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 We know Vladimir Horowitz well from previous filmed "celebrations," and here, 
as in the past, even some who decried his often hyper-flashy pianism may 
succumb to his puckish personality and refusal to take himself too seriously, 
qualities that emerge in his words and in the witty bravado with which he 
dispatches such frou-frou as Moszkowski's "Etincelles." 
</P>
<P>
 The most moving footage here -- old hat, possibly, for dedicated Horowitz 
watchers -- was taken at a recital in Moscow marking the pianist's return to 
Russia (he was born in Kiev, in Ukraine) in 1986 after an absence of 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense pleasure the pianist takes in his playing, and the rapt attention 
of an audience ranging in age from pre-teens to graybeards, speak with uncommon 
persuasiveness for the power of his art and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest, there are the usual irritatingly inconclusive musical snippets 
-- by Clementi, to whose music Wanda introduced him, his idol, Rachmaninoff, 
Chopin, Haydn, Scarlatti -- as well as a stunningly controlled and passionate 
performance of Scriabin's finger-busting (for other pianists) "Vers la flamme." 
All six deliriously spooky minutes of it, by golly. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vladimir Horowitz: A Reminiscence" airs at 6:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 
28.

TV REVIEWS; TNT, ROEG ATTEMPT CONRAD'S 'DARKNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ho-hum, the ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
 More than nine decades after its literary launch, someone has finally brought 
Joseph Conrad's household-name novella "Heart of Darkness" directly to the 
screen -- albeit the small screen, on TNT cable -- going where Orson Welles and 
so many others tried but failed to steam before. 
</P>
<P>
 But while, in theory, mercurial Nicolas Roeg sounds like an inspired choice of 
director -- with a history of methods as unconventional as the central demigod 
Kurtz's own -- what he uncovers upriver is a spleen of murkiness at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad's source story about a brilliant ivory trader who's gone mad deep in 
the Congo consists mainly of descriptive passages, and is a bit of a clever 
cheat; it assumes our willingness to take the author's word for it that the 
mystery man awaiting the journeyman Marlow deep in the jungle is a genius. 
Dialogue is minimal, and ballyhooed Kurtz himself gets only a few unremarkable 
sentences near the end before dying unremarkably. It's a great screen 
"treatment" in some ways, but, as climaxes go, Conrad wasn't doing foolhardy 
future adapters any favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in a peerless piece of miscasting, Kurtz is played by John Malkovich, 
who filmed this immediately after "In the Line of Fire" and seems to be playing 
a stoned version of the same languidly luciferin character. (Malkovich even 
casually snaps an orangutan's neck just like he did with that woman in the 
Eastwood picture.) True, it's no easy assignment playing dying and 
demagogue-ish at the same time, but the actor proceeds so ineffectually -- 
uttering his famous last lines, "The horror, the horror," as a kind of resigned 
yawn before the infinite -- that it's hard to picture him even in his prime 
having roused any gullible natives into god worship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's inevitable that scripter Benedict Fitzgerald would have to invent a lot 
of dialogue for Kurtz and Marlow; this ends up being mostly Malkovich imparting 
over-obvious pearls like "It is dangerous to tear away the layers from our 
faults and look down into the abyss of our true beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald has also messed with the novella in making protagonist Marlow a 
fairly surly, anti-authoritarian chap right from the beginning, which doesn't 
leave the usually excellent actor Tim Roth any changes to go through. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeg's hand-held camera work brings some needed nervousness to the 
proceedings; technically, the location work in Belize often looks terrific. But 
fans of the source are likely to be annoyed by the changes from the book -- 
some of them apparently for purely P.C. purposes -- and conversely, those who 
haven't read it may be confused by some details that have reverently, 
needlessly been incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to admire the sheer courage of the attempt. But Conrad buffs may walk 
away with a new appreciation for Francis Coppola's very loose -- yet somehow 
more spiritually faithful -- adaptation, "Apocalypse Now"; even Brando doing 
jungle improv had more "horror" than this.

STORIES DELETED FROM TESTS TO BE REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Besieged by charges of censorship, the State Board of Education on Friday 
ordered the writings of two Pulitzer Prize-winning authors restored to the pool 
of literature used in the testing of California schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous voice vote was aimed at defusing a controversy that pitted 
teachers and civil libertarians against Christian fundamentalists and some 
parents over stories by Alice Walker and Annie Dillard. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Marion McDowell, who with another member had initially asked 
that the writings be removed, was asked by reporters if restoring the writings 
was an admission that the works should not have been removed in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to draw your own conclusions," McDowell said. "We are saying they 
are appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Louis Sheldon of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, who 
lobbied last year to remove a Walker excerpt from the test, vowed after the 
vote to continue the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to make sure that kind of material is not going to be in a 
controlled test," he said after the often-angry testimony of more than two 
dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the disputed works now return to the pool of test materials, it is 
not known if they will again be placed before California sophomores taking the 
English assessment tests. The briefly banned stories, "An American Childhood" 
by Dillard, and "Roselily" and "Am I Blue?" by Walker, are a small fraction of 
the many literary works that test officials will draw upon to write the 
statewide examination questions. The choices are not made public. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, who has condemned censorship but stopped 
short of criticizing the board, had no comment on its action, a spokesman said. 
Most members are Wilson appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 The excerpts were contained in the English portion of the state's pioneering 
new California Learning Assessment System tests, which emphasize measuring the 
performance of students in analytical and critical thinking. Critics maintain 
that the tests invade students' privacy in asking questions about their 
religious beliefs and personal values. 
</P>
<P>
 The censorship controversy blossomed in recent weeks from two incidents that 
occurred last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper printed an excerpt in 
October from Walker's "Roselily," which expresses a jumble of thoughts of an 
unmarried mother at her wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Education officials struck the excerpt from this year's tests 
based on protests of fundamentalist Christians and because the confidentiality 
of the test had been breached. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second incident, the state board adopted the 1994 tests, but struck the 
Dillard story and another by Walker on the advice of McDowell and member 
Kathryn Dronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Dronenberg complained that a Dillard excerpt about children throwing snowballs 
might be viewed as violent. McDowell said a piece by Walker, titled "Am I 
Blue?" could be interpreted as advocating a vegetarian lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell told reporters on Friday that the so-called "anti-meat-eating" 
excerpt was excised to protect the sensitivities of rural schoolchildren whose 
parents might raise poultry or livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, McDowell defended the board and the staff of the Department of 
Education. "It is truly unfortunate that some have chosen to characterize our 
actions (as) reflecting bias, racism, censorship or yielding to pressure. The 
characterization is simply not true," McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the board and department were motivated to select "fair and 
equitable" test items for "all segments of our student body." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Walker, a Northern California resident, for a second 
time refused to accept a special literary award from Wilson that declares her 
to be an official "state treasure."  
</P>
<P>
 "A few weeks ago, I would have been honored," Walker said in a statement 
released by her agent in New York. "However, I love California and respect its 
children too much to accept becoming a 'state treasure' in a state whose 
educators consider my work a menace to the 10th grade."  
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Walker said it was unknown whether Walker was aware of the 
board's decision Friday.

CIA OVERLOOKED RED FLAG FROM AMESES' BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suburban Virginia bank in which accused CIA spy Aldrich H. Ames allegedly 
stashed payments from the Russians notified the government of suspicious 
deposits in his account but federal officials never acted on the warnings, 
government sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The notifications were on file at the Internal Revenue Service after CIA 
security officials began having qualms about Ames' wealth, but the CIA did not 
ask the IRS whether excessive deposits by Ames might have been reported, the 
sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 The crucial information might have led to an earlier investigation of the 
Ameses. However, it failed to reach the CIA or the FBI, which conducts 
counterintelligence investigations -- and both the House and Senate 
Intelligence Committees are trying to learn why. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two currency reports on Ames and his wife, Rosario, were filed with 
the IRS by Dominion Bank of Virginia. The reports were made after the couple 
deposited cash sums totaling tens of thousands of dollars in individual amounts 
below $10,000 -- the normal threshold for triggering such reports, the sources 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The bank reports are the latest warning to be made public that law enforcement 
agencies apparently missed in their investigation of Ames, who is accused of 
spying for the Soviets and Russians for nine years. The reports are also 
perhaps the most clear-cut signal of suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' CIA superiors became suspicious after he paid $540,000 in cash for a 
house in 1989. They also questioned him, using a polygraph machine, about his 
finances, but they reportedly never asked the IRS for bank reports. Ames said 
that he purchased the house with money he inherited from his father-in-law, 
which prosecutors said they have determined to be false. 
</P>
<P>
 Other warning signs, previously reported, were the executions or disappearance 
of at least 10 foreign agents cooperating with the CIA at a time when Ames held 
a high post in the CIA's Soviet-East European division. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FBI and CIA officials refused to comment, other sources said that 
Virginia bank executives filed reports with the IRS in the late 1980s or early 
1990s out of concern that Ames was "structuring" cash deposits to keep them 
under $10,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 One report, according to the sources, said that Ames had made deposits 
totaling $20,000 that included some Italian currency. Ames served in Rome from 
1986 to 1989. The CIA now believes he received large payments there from the 
Russians before returning to the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal law requiring currency reports, dating back to 1970, asks banks to 
report "structuring" as well as cash deposits of $10,000 or more. But 
congressional critics long have claimed that the process should be improved to 
increase the ability of law enforcement agencies to make better use of them in 
criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law was designed in part as an early warning signal of narcotics 
trafficking and money laundering, critics said that the volume of reports is so 
great and the information so tightly held that its usefulness is reduced for 
agencies other than the IRS. More than 10 million currency reports are filed 
annually by banks, of which 75,000 are sorted out as suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, after receiving a report of a suspicious transaction, the IRS 
distributes the data to its own criminal investigators but usually not to the 
FBI or the CIA," said Patrick Heck, a currency expert on the staff of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. "However, it's all computerized, so if those agencies 
asked for information by a person's name, they probably could get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Heck added that "most of the time this data is used to validate an agency's 
suspicion about a drug dealer or a money launderer but not to trigger an 
investigation, especially outside the IRS." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on 
oversight, said that he has asked IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson 
for a report on what actions, if any, the agency has taken in response to the 
Ameses' spending habits and their deposits of large sums of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Richardson, Pickle listed a number of activities and said: 
"Which of these transactions were reportable?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said in court papers that by the late 1980s, the couple had paid 
cash for their house in Northern Virginia and made $99,000 in home 
improvements. They later purchased a 1992 Jaguar, although their reported 
family income was only Ames' $69,000 annual salary from the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI did not begin investigating Ames until May 12, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 After the couple's arrest last month on charges of conspiring to commit 
espionage, FBI Supervising Agent Leslie G. Wiser Jr. filed an affidavit 
detailing dozens of their cash deposits. In a five-week period in 1992, for 
example, the couple deposited $58,500 in eight transactions, ranging from 
$1,700 to $8,500, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claim that the deposits followed Ames' return from a secret 
meeting with Russian handlers in Caracas, Venezuela, in October, 1992. In all, 
the Ameses are accused of receiving $2.5 million in espionage payments from 
1985 to 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 An official of First Union Bank of Virginia, which acquired Dominion Bank a 
year ago, said he could not comment on whether Dominion filed currency reports 
on the Ameses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no information about activities of the prior management," said the 
official, Dave Scanzoni. "And even if I did, I could not reveal them as part of 
an ongoing federal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanzoni said it is not uncommon, however, for banks to alert the IRS to 
suspicious cash deposits totaling tens of thousands of dollars, even when 
individual deposits are less than $10,000.

EXECUTIONS UNDERSCORE BOPHUTHATSWANA CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The three white men in ripped khaki uniforms and boots lay sprawled Friday 
beside their bullet-riddled blue Mercedes-Benz. One man was dead, his head in a 
pool of gore, while the other two bled slowly into the red earth as they 
talked. 
</P>
<P>
 They were from Naboomspruit, a farming town farther north, said Fanie Uys, his 
face contorted in pain and sweating in the brutal midday sun. And they had come 
with several thousand other armed right-wing Afrikaners to lend support to the 
embattled black homeland regime of Bophuthatswana's tin-pot dictator, Lucas 
Mangope. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside him, face down in the dirt, Alwyn Walfaardt lifted his bearded head. 
No, no, he said, it wasn't a mistake to come, even though they had been shot in 
a fierce firefight with Mangope's own security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came because the Afrikaner Volksfront asked us to come," he said weakly. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a young black man in a green police uniform walked up and without a 
word shot Uys in the chest with an assault rifle from two feet away. Uys jerked 
and slumped down, his eyes half open in death. Then the man turned and shot 
Walfaardt in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold-blooded execution, in front of a Times correspondent and more than a 
dozen other stunned reporters and photographers, was a grim example of the 
anarchy that seethed in the tense streets of this homeland capital in the wake 
of a right-wing invasion before dawn Friday to put down a popular uprising by 
anti-Mangope protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour later, Mangope capitulated. He announced in a statement 
released here that he would join South Africa's first all-race elections next 
month and agreed to reincorporate his nominally independent territory into 
South Africa after the April 26-28 voting, as the protesters had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 South African President Frederik W. de Klerk subsequently announced in 
Pretoria that he was sending 1,500 armed troops to restore order here, with 
more soldiers standing by, if necessary. He said the deployment of troops would 
"stabilize the situation and ensure the unacceptable situation is immediately 
brought to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the army and the political compromise will end the bitter strikes, 
rioting and bloodshed that have turned this once-neat town into an ugly urban 
war zone remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and medical authorities confirmed at least 22 people were killed in 
clashes, but the final toll could be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk met in a crisis session with Nelson Mandela, head of the African 
National Congress, and both leaders pleaded for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is discounting revenge attacks or other violence. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, armored personnel carriers with South African combat troops 
escorted convoys of Afrikaners to the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of other armed whites retreated from a Bophuthatswana air force base 
that they had occupied beside the main airport. An uneasy calm settled on the 
riot-torn city, punctuated by occasional gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The rout of the right-wingers, who had been urged to come by Mangope to save 
his regime, appeared a victory for the government and ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, the new South Africa had survived its first violent challenge from 
the old. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the South African military and the Bophuthatswana security forces had 
remained loyal in the first major showdown with the extremists who have long 
threatened to launch a civil war rather than submit to democracy and black 
majority rule. The right wing clearly had miscalculated. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mangope, installed as president in 1977 by the white minority regime in 
Pretoria, had finally buckled to pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bophuthatswana, one of 10 homelands and territories created under apartheid to 
permanently separate blacks from whites in South Africa, will officially 
disappear in less than seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome was not always clear. The crisis began Monday when teachers joined 
other striking public servants here. Their initial demand was for pay raises 
and pensions, but the spontaneous protests quickly spread to a general 
anti-Mangope uprising that paralyzed the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday afternoon, many of the police who had wounded scores of 
protesters and filled the streets with choking tear gas suddenly defected, 
joining the demonstrators and demanding free elections. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear if Mangope's 5,000-member defense force would crush the revolt 
or move against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos worsened early Friday when hundreds of cars and trucks filled with 
armed and angry members of the Afrikaner Volksfront, the alliance of white 
supremacists opposed to the elections, roared in to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
 South African officials and reporters estimated anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 
white militants had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangope had welcomed their help, but specifically asked that the Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement, a vicious neo-Nazi faction, stay away. The three whites 
who were killed were all members of the pro-apartheid extremist group. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, roving bands of whites had fired indiscriminately at blacks on 
the street, killing at least two men and one woman in central Mafeking, twin 
city to the capital. Others paraded through town, guns bristling. Several cars 
chased reporters and television crews through the streets at high speed, firing 
shots in at least one case. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Taylor of the Washington Post and John Battersby of the Christian Science 
Monitor were pulled three times from their car, punched, kicked and beaten by 
screaming whites with guns and knives outside the occupied air base. Both 
reporters were cut and bruised in the melee. Other journalists had their 
cameras, tape recorders and other gear stolen at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, gunfire echoed throughout the hot, still air, and 
barricades of burning tires sent plumes of acrid black smoke billowing into the 
air near the charred hulks of burned-out cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs of young black looters ran through the debris-strewn streets, hauling 
cases of beer and bulging sacks and boxes from shattered storefronts. Women 
clutching clothes ran out a broken window at the Guys & Girls Boutique. One man 
attempted to wheel a huge, white exercise bicycle down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, several dozen youths ran down a street and through a field. Fast 
behind them was a pickup truck, with someone inside firing shots at the fleeing 
youths. Other cars and pickup trucks filled with local youths cruised the 
deserted streets, guns poking out of their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 By sunset, law and order had collapsed in the central business district. 
Hundreds of looters openly loaded cars and trucks with new carpets, mattresses, 
washing machines, furniture and other goods from the MegaCity shopping center. 
Two men struggled to carry off a plastic-covered couch, while another man 
wheeled away a portable heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the once-glitzy shopping center still smoldered from a fire set 
earlier. The South African Press Assn. reported that riots had begun in other 
far-flung towns in Bophuthatswana, from Taaung in the northern Cape to Hlabane, 
northwest of Pretoria. Homes of government officials, including a local 
governor and Cabinet minister, were reported razed in Itsoseng. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major skirmish here occurred about 12:45 p.m. at a dusty intersection 
just outside the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 A convoy of 18 vehicles filled with right-wingers roared by a roadblock set up 
by the Bophuthatswana army. Someone in the convoy fired into a crowd of blacks, 
killing a woman. The soldiers ordered the group to stop; a tense standoff 
ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, fierce gunfire erupted. The soldiers fired volley after volley with 
assault rifles from their armored vehicles. The whites fired back from their 
cars with hunting rifles and shotguns. Terrified civilians and reporters 
scrambled for cover behind low brick walls as shots stitched the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the blue Mercedes escaped. At least eight bullets had smashed the 
windshield and flattened a tire. One man, identified only as Fourie, lay 
crumpled and dead in a pool of blood on the left side. He wore the camouflage 
fatigues of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, with the group's swastika-like 
emblem on his sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Uys, a balding, middle-aged man with a mustache, pushed himself slowly out of 
the back seat, holding his hands up in surrender. He slumped to the ground, 
resting his head painfully against a rear tire. Blood oozed from a wound in his 
left hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Walfaardt, a big man with a bushy beard, crouched by the front seat, his hands 
up as well. He was bleeding on both arms but otherwise appeared uninjured. As 
police and soldiers ran up with guns, he threw himself face down in the dirt 
and pleaded for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy is wounded," he said, pointing to Uys. "Can you just get us some 
help, please? Can somebody get us an ambulance? We need an ambulance for this 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 minutes went by, as the two wounded men lay in the hot sun and 
police rifled the car and confiscated their weapons. Photographers gathered 
round in a ghoulish scene, snapping endless photos of their agony. A crowd of 
blacks taunted the pair. "Are you sorry now?" one man shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, they were executed. Homeland in Turmoil 
</P>
<P>
 Bophuthatswana is one of four nominally independent black homelands that were 
created by the white-led government in an effort to keep blacks and whites 
separate. Its government has opposed taking part in South Africa's all-race 
elections in April.

COLUMN ONE; PALESTINIAN MIAS: HOPE FADES AGAIN; WEARY FAMILIES THOUGHT THE 
PEACE PROCESS MIGHT HELP THEM LEARN THE FATE OF THEIR MEN. ISRAEL PUBLICIZED 
SECRET CEMETERIES, PLEDGED NEW HELP. BUT NOW THE BITTER WAITING GAME HAS 
RESUMED.

<P>
 These are the unknown soldiers in the battle for Palestine: Their graves lie 
covered by shifting sheets of grass under a wide sky. Their tombstones are 
four-digit numbers stenciled on haphazard rows of white signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cemetery for the Enemy's Fallen," says a hand-painted sign on a barbed-wire 
fence ringing the graveyard. And Rabbi Zion, who carefully tends the cemetery 
and makes sure its dead Muslims point southeast toward Mecca, wears a Jewish 
skullcap and the green fatigues of the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my great regret, I know all of these cases. This is the job of an IDF 
rabbi," Zion said, sighing as he stood among the graves on a recent afternoon 
while a jeep full of Israeli soldiers waited outside the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the graves lovingly dug by families for the Palestinians who died last 
month in a Hebron mosque, no one visits these. Their location is secret, and 
the cemetery has no name, though it is popularly known as the "Cemetery for 
Trespassing Terrorists." Its silent inhabitants are unknown, except to the 
Israeli army, which says these stark, stenciled numbers identify Palestinians 
who died trying to infiltrate Israel's borders or commit acts of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 In a small hilltop village miles from this windy graveyard, Badriyya Abdullah 
Sabah on Jan. 19 received official notice that her brother, Bassam, missing 
since 1984, is buried beneath the white sign that has 5028 stenciled on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the army has denied family requests to visit, the notice was the first 
indication of Bassam's whereabouts after nearly a decade of anxious searching, 
of visiting hospitals and prisons and filing requests for the return of his 
body, if he was indeed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army's answer was always 'No, there's no body,' " Sabah said. "Now, how 
do I know if this notice is correct? I told the lawyer, if he's dead, let us go 
and visit the graveyard. I want to know 100% that this is the case, so I can 
rest my mind. But it seems this is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Long after Palestinians and Israelis sort out the problems of the living, long 
after the delayed peace negotiations get back on track, the fate of these dead 
men and hundreds of other Palestinians who disappeared in Israel and its 
occupied territories will remain a stumbling block to any lasting Arab-Israeli 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As Israel presses Syria and Lebanon for answers on six Israeli servicemen 
missing from the war in Lebanon, Arabs are raising their own case about missing 
Palestinians, some of whose families have searched for them since the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War. At least 140, and possibly as many as 500, Palestinians are 
unaccounted for in nearly 27 years of recent conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports about some of them have surfaced in mystifying fashion over the years: 
Someone's husband was seen in the orthopedic ward of a hospital in Jerusalem; a 
brother was spotted in a prison by a friend; a maid carried a secondhand 
message from a man long presumed dead saying he was alive and well but 
imprisoned -- all tantalizing details for which there is seldom any hard 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials say they have no official statistics on missing Palestinians 
and have for years given out information on those it knows about only in 
response to formal family requests submitted through the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few queries ever meet with a reply, and some families have unsuccessfully 
petitioned for information for years. But the army's recent willingness to 
publicize its two secret cemeteries -- the second is in northern Israel -- and 
its pledge to return bodies to any family that claims them through the Red 
Cross have raised the prospect that the files of the Palestinian missing may, 
after nearly three decades, finally be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard there is a mission of the United States Congress to trace the 
Israeli missing, which are six persons. This mission should also be informed 
that there are also Palestinian missing. And they are not six persons. They are 
140 or more," said Issa Hamed, head of the Arab Society for Tracing Missing 
Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, after the peace process and the Oslo agreement, people are starting to 
talk more about the missing. Before, there was no hope for them. But they think 
the peace process might help them," Hamed said. "It gives them hope that, after 
this long time, their suffering might be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Other activists for the missing say they hope the fact that one of the 
cemeteries is near Jericho, the West Bank city that will come under Palestinian 
self-rule in coming months if the peace process stays in motion, may allow 
families to visit the graves there for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know if they are going to return the bodies to the families, to 
let the families bury them wherever they want to, and especially, if Jericho is 
going to be an independent area, is it a place where families can now visit 
freely? Are they going to let them have a place where they can go and cry?" 
asked Dalia Kerstein, director of the Hamoked Center for the Defense of the 
Individual, a Jewish organization that has helped many Palestinian families 
trace prisoners and missing relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials say any family that wishes to claim a body can do so through 
the Red Cross; so many go unclaimed, they say, because families may not wish to 
associate themselves with a known terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel has always given information on requests from the ICRC and other 
organizations on a one-to-one basis. Those that had families in the territories 
who wanted to claim the terrorist were given the bodies," said Lt. Col. Yehuda 
Weinraub, spokesman for the IDF. "Many people from the other side (in 
neighboring Jordan or Lebanon) don't even request the information because in 
many countries, belonging to such subversive organizations or having family 
members who do is not well looked on." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sabah was detained and questioned by Israeli security services for 
four days after asking about her brother's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis said he and two associates were killed on Sept. 14, 1984, while 
trying to mount a cross-border terrorist operation from Jordan. What did she 
know about the incident? the officials asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabah wasn't sure. Her brother, Bassam Abdullah Sabah Subih, had been living 
in Jordan because he had been denied permission to live in the family village 
of Mugheir near Ramallah. Sabah began inquiring about him when she read in a 
Jordanian newspaper that he had been killed while trying to cross into the West 
Bank from Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brother came in from Kuwait and began asking questions of his own. As 
recently as December, he learned, someone claimed to have seen Bassam in 
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerstein, who investigated the case, said the alleged witness has remained 
anonymous, fearful of coming forward:  
</P>
<P>
 "Bassam tells this anonymous person: 'My family doesn't know I'm alive. Let 
them know I'm alive. I'm here for medical reasons. I will soon be taken back to 
jail, where I am being held with 16 other persons. We never receive mail. We 
are never allowed visits. We supposedly don't exist.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The army's response to Kerstein's inquiries was the notification that Bassam 
had been killed and was buried in the Jordan Valley cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 But without access to the body itself -- so far -- questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the possibility that they caught him alive, and he died later under 
torture. When they keep the body, it's easy for them to say he was killed in an 
operation," said Issa Hamed, whose organization is also investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerstein is inquiring about another body at the Jordan Valley cemetery, 
allegedly that of a Palestinian man killed in a clash on Israel's northern 
border with Lebanon in 1991. She has produced an affidavit from a witness who 
claims to have seen the man shortly after his disappearance in a prison service 
hospital at Ramle. Another witness swore in an affidavit that he had received a 
letter from the man, written from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the army said the man is indeed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were given photographs -- terrible, terrible photographs -- of the three 
who were supposedly killed in the clash and buried," Kerstein said. "The mother 
who came to us is a Palestinian from Jordan. We contacted her, she came to the 
bridge (linking the West Bank and Jordan), she was asked to identify her son 
from the photographs. She couldn't identify him. It was unrecognizable." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the army has agreed to open the grave where the man is supposedly buried 
and take a tissue sample that will be compared to the blood of the mother and 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases have many families asking whether Israel is holding unidentified 
Palestinian prisoners for possible future exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Reto Meister, chief of the Red Cross delegation in Israel, said that while 
there are Lebanese detainees in Israel to which the organization has no access, 
there has been no evidence of Palestinians from the occupied territories being 
detained without record. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Israel's known Lebanese prisoners is Shiite cleric Sheik Abdel Karim 
Obeid, kidnaped from his home in southern Lebanon by Israeli commandos in 1989 
as a possible hostage to exchange for missing Israeli airman Ron Arad. 
</P>
<P>
 Arad, a captain and navigator shot down over Lebanon during a bombing raid in 
October, 1986, is the only one of the six missing Israelis for whom there is 
some hope that he might be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years, Israel has had the procedure of handing over the bodies of 
killed Palestinians to their families," Meister said. "In recent cases, to our 
knowledge, there are no corpses that have been buried without notification to 
the family by Israeli authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinian families, like the relatives of those missing in war 
anywhere, refuse to give up hope that somewhere, their loved one is alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowaz Abed Youssef Hamad, now 32, was only 6 during the Six-Day War of 1967 
when his father, a builder, left the family home in East Jerusalem to buy milk 
on the third day of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said later that Israeli forces had come into the neighborhood, there 
had been a clash, and Hamad's father, Abed Youssef Hamad, had been shot in both 
legs. He was taken away in a truck of wounded people, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, relatives of the family in Ramallah were contacted by the 
Israeli army, who told them that they could pick up Hamad from the Russian 
Compound jail in Jerusalem. But when the family went to get him, he was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 About three months later, some Jordanian soldiers visited the family and said 
Hamad had been in the hospital in Ramallah but had been taken by the Israeli 
army to another location. But they said they did not know where. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no further word until 1990, when an Arab cleaning woman who works at 
the Alyn Hospital for the Handicapped in Jerusalem spoke to one of the family's 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said there was a man in the hospital by the name of our father," Fowaz 
said. "He asked her to go and tell his wife that he was there. He gave her the 
names of his children -- our names. And the cleaning woman had many details. 
She knew that my mother's brother is a barber. She knew many things about our 
family no one else would know." 
</P>
<P>
 The family went to the hospital, but they were turned away at the reception 
desk. The Red Cross followed up, according to the family, but received no 
indication that Hamad had been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate, one of Fowaz's uncles, who works as a garbage collector for the 
city of Jerusalem, asked a Jewish co-worker to take a photograph of Hamad into 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked to an Arab patient who was handicapped, and he asked him how long 
he had been there. He said, 'Since the '67 war,' " Fowaz recounted. "He showed 
him the picture and said, 'Do you know this man?' He said, 'Yes, he's inside.' 
So the Jewish man wanted to go and look for him, but a soldier caught him and 
said, 'What are you doing?' He said, 'I have work in there.' But the soldier 
said, 'No, your work is outside.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the family gave up until a year ago, when they went back to the Red 
Cross, which did a computer search of the names of all known prisoners. Hamad's 
name wasn't among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Red Cross says for sure he must be dead," Fowaz said. "They tell us: 'Why 
would you think he's in the hospital out there? Why would the Israelis even 
want him? He wasn't a soldier in the '67 war.' But me, I believe he's still 
alive. My opinion is they don't want to release him because then he is going to 
start talking about what happened to him. And people would start to realize 
that there are other people like my father." 
</P>
<P>
 To this faint hope Fowaz clings, as do his sister, an elementary-school 
teacher who was only a baby when Hamad disappeared, and Hamad's wife, who is 
still dressed in black, as she has been every day since her husband left to buy 
milk 27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We read in the newspapers that there are 500 families like this, who don't 
have answers," Fowaz said. "I want to forget, but I can't. I have to keep 
looking for him. If I know he's really dead, then I won't go on looking for him 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Issa Hamed of the Arab Society for Tracing Missing Persons said that opening 
the files on those buried in the secret cemeteries might be the first step in 
determining the fate of the missing. Families want records not only of who has 
died, he said, but of when and how.

 His own brother, Abdel Nasser Hamed, disappeared when Israeli forces on April 
28, 1985, thwarted a navy operation by Fatah -- the dominant wing of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization -- aimed at killing Israel's defense 
minister. Hamed met with eight Palestinian prisoners who survived the operation 
and who said his brother had safely jumped off their ship after it was hit by 
Israeli missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis picked up all survivors and took them to prison, but kept them 
apart for 101 days. No one saw Hamed after that, but Issa Hamed believes it is 
possible that his brother is being held for exchange. Israeli authorities deny 
this; they say the Red Cross has contacted all survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamed said full details about those buried in the secret cemeteries, not just 
responses to individual inquiries from the Red Cross, may help resolve doubts 
like his. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Geneva Convention says you have to send the family a death certificate," 
he said, "including all the information about the place of death, the date of 
death, the reason of death. Place of burial, date of burial. And none of this 
has been complied with."

UNOCAL ADMITS SPILLAGE INTO OCEAN; GUILTY PLEA EXPECTED; POLLUTION: LEAKAGE 
OVER 15 YEARS OF 8.5 MILLION GALLONS OF OILY FLUID OFF CENTRAL COAST IS NOW 
STATE'S LARGEST. 
</P>

<P>
 Unocal Corp. disclosed Friday that it has leaked as much as 8.5 million 
gallons of petroleum thinner at its oil field near San Luis Obispo in what has 
quietly become the largest oil spill in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 15 years, frequent leaks and pipeline breaks at the Guadalupe 
oil field have contaminated the ocean and ground water with a clear, 
diesel-like fluid called diluent -- at times covering beaches along the Central 
California coast with an oily sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal, which has been accused of attempting to cover up the spills, is 
expected to plead guilty next week to as many as three misdemeanor counts of 
failing to report the leaks and to pay a fine of as much as $1.5 million, said 
an attorney who is familiar with the case. The plea would settle a 36-count 
criminal complaint that local authorities filed against the oil giant and six 
current and former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have problems there," said Unocal spokeswoman Janet McClintock. "Yes, 
we take full responsibility for it. We're going to clean it up -- the criminal 
case has no bearing on this." 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the petroleum thinner underground or washed out to sea, 
authorities have had difficulty determining the size of the spill. Since the 
leaks became public in 1990, the company has acknowledged that recovery wells 
have pumped up about 650,000 gallons of the hazardous fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, Unocal announced that three experts hired by the company 
estimate that 4.6 million to 8.5 million gallons of diluent have leaked into 
the ground beneath the Guadalupe field. The estimates do not include the fluid 
that went into the ocean -- an amount that may never be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the smallest estimate of the Guadalupe leak is larger than the infamous 
Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, when an offshore oil well blew out and spilled 
4.2 million gallons into the ocean and onto beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate of 8.5 million gallons would rank Guadalupe as the fourth-largest 
spill in the United States. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil into the waters off Alaska when it crashed onto rocks off Prince 
William Sound in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Central California coast had long complained that some sort 
of oily fluid from the Guadalupe field was contaminating beaches and harming 
dozens of sea lions, seals and other marine animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until 1990 that Unocal first reported the spills and took 
corrective action, including the installation of a bentonite wall on the beach 
to block the flow of diluent and wells to pump it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, the state's recently created Office of Oil Spill Prevention and 
Response began investigating the leaks and staged two raids on Unocal offices, 
hauling away more than 80 boxes of records. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sawyer, a lawyer for the agency, said the investigation indicated that 
there had been 190 leaks of diluent at the field, many of which went 
unreported. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the government's case was weakened when San Luis Obispo County Dist. 
Atty. Barry La Barbera, who was handling the case, filed the criminal charges 
against Unocal more than a year after receiving an initial complaint of 
unreported spills in July, 1992. A judge found that the district attorney 
missed the deadline for the statute of limitations by two days -- a finding 
likely to send the case into years of procedural litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, government agencies and the oil giant have tentatively agreed to 
the plea bargain, which would result in the dismissal of 33 counts against 
Unocal and the employees. Once the criminal case is resolved, however, the 
Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response plans to bring a civil suit against 
Unocal that could result in additional fines beyond those in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from any legal action, Unocal is faced with a massive cleanup job at its 
aging oil field 20 miles south of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 18 plumes of the petroleum fluid have been located underground and in 
some places the diluent sits 5 feet thick on top of ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, diluent was discovered surfacing on the beach beyond the retaining 
wall that was built to prevent further ocean spills. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the company is proposing an emergency action to install a wall farther 
inland and excavate the entire beach area -- all the way down to the water 
table -- where diluent has been surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials said this would mean removing 47,000 cubic yards of sand from 
a 1,000-foot length of beach -- roughly the equivalent of hauling away three 
football fields six feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in an emergency mode to find a solution to the problem," McClintock 
said. "We want to excavate the beach all the way down to the ocean."

CHRISTOPHER IN BEIJING; MOOD TENSE; ASIA: IN CHINA FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
DISCUSSIONS, HE MAKES NO STATEMENT AT THE AIRPORT AND REJECTS BANQUET OFFERS. 
HIS ARRIVAL IS FURTHER MARRED BY A SHOVING MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a tense atmosphere that reflected the shaky state of U.S.-Chinese 
relations, a somber Secretary of State Warren Christopher landed in Beijing on 
Friday night on a mission to try to change human rights policies in the world's 
most populous country. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear immediately upon Christopher's arrival that neither the Chinese 
government nor the United States was in any mood for politeness, smiles or 
routine diplomatic formalities. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials disclosed on Christopher's plane before landing 
that they had scrubbed plans for the secretary of state to make an arrival 
statement. They also rejected Chinese offers of a banquet on the trip and 
decided that he would not visit China's best-known tourist attraction, the 
Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Christopher) wants to set a tone that is focused on the business he is 
here to do," spokesman Mike McCurry explained. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Chinese security officials rounded up two more dissidents, Yang 
Zhou and Wang Fuchen of the Assn. for Human Rights in Shanghai. Yang was 
released this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government had detained several other dissidents in the 10 days 
before Christopher's arrival. Most of the dissidents were later released. 
</P>
<P>
 As Christopher was walking off the plane, a brief shoving match broke out 
between American and Chinese security aides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this how the visit's going to go? Is this how the visit's going to go?" 
shouted one of the American officials to his Chinese counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's trip is designed to try to persuade Chinese leaders that they 
must change their policies to show "overall significant progress" on human 
rights, as President Clinton required in an executive order last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If China fails to do so, it could lose trade privileges that permit Chinese 
goods to be imported into the United States at low tariff rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Months ago, when Christopher's trip to Beijing was first being planned, State 
Department officials imagined that he would calmly encourage Chinese leaders to 
show the United States that they are making progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But China's recent arrests and detentions of democracy advocates have changed 
the tone and the politics surrounding the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials now find themselves on the defensive, trying 
to come to grips with a Chinese leadership that does not seem to care what the 
U.S. government says or thinks about its human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's not the same situation as it was two weeks ago," when 
Christopher's visit to Beijing was announced, Assistant Secretary of State 
Winston Lord said. "But the purpose of the trip remains the same: to carry our 
message (on human rights) directly to the Chinese leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters on Christopher's plane as it flew from Tokyo to Beijing, 
Lord seemed to be trying to downplay expectations for any immediate human 
rights improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be results in the wake of the trip, but not while we're there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is to spend today in meetings with top Chinese officials, 
including Foreign Minister Qichen Qian, Premier Li Peng and President Jiang 
Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to meet with American business executives Sunday and may see a 
group of Chinese lawyers interested in reform of the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Other American officials will hold their own separate sessions with Chinese 
leaders on issues such as the proliferation of weapons and defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's delegation includes Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner, the 
highest-level official from the Pentagon to visit Beijing since a 1988 visit by 
then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. 
</P>
<P>
 While human rights issues will be the most important subject, Lord emphasized 
that "there will be a broader agenda," including discussions with Chinese 
leaders on North Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday, Christopher had been in China on only one occasion, a 1985 trip 
with a group of lawyers while he was in private law practice in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his arrival Friday night, he went to the U.S. Embassy to get an 
update on the situation in China and to prepare for today's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy has a special room protected against monitoring devices, called 
"the bubble," in which American officials can talk without fear of being 
overheard. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's decision not to attend any Chinese banquets during his trip is 
rooted in the turmoil the events have caused in the last five years of 
high-level visits by American leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 When American officials invited a dissident to one banquet with then-President 
George Bush, it proved politically unacceptable to the Chinese regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1989, six months after the Chinese government's deadly crackdown 
on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, the Bush Administration dispatched 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State 
Lawrence S. Eagleburger to the Chinese capital on a mission of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were photographed in a warm banquet toast to Chinese leaders. The 
furor in the United States over the symbolism of that toast galvanized Congress 
to press for tougher U.S. action on human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent critics of Scowcroft's banquet toast included Clinton, who 
in 1992 accused the Bush Administration of "coddling dictators," and Lord, a 
veteran Republican appointee.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty ironic, when you think about it," one U.S. official said Friday. 
"It's five years after Tian An Men (the 1989 crackdown on demonstrations for 
democracy), and the relationship (between the United States and China) is in 
more dire straits now than it has ever been."

DETROIT PROJECT ENLIGHTENED BACKDROP FOR JOBS SUMMIT; ECONOMY: CLINTON'S 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE COULD TAKE CUE FROM BOLD URBAN EXPERIMENT IN 
INDUSTRIAL RENAISSANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the finance ministers of the world's richest nations gather here Monday 
for an international summit on job creation, this tough-fisted city will 
provide a stark urban backdrop. Once the symbol of America's manufacturing 
might, it now stands as a metaphor for industrial decay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ministers' view of Detroit might soften if they travel to where Rosa 
Parks and Oakman boulevards intersect. Scarred by vacant lots, boarded-up 
stores and decrepit housing, this downtrodden Northwest neighborhood is home to 
a bold experiment in industrial renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 A row of abandoned factories -- once occupied by the likes of Ford Motor Co., 
Massey-Ferguson Ltd. and Ex-Cell-O Corp. -- has been transformed into a 
bustling job training and manufacturing enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Operated by Focus:Hope, a grass-roots civil rights group, the project offers 
mostly minorities and women supplemental high school instruction and training 
on precision machine tools. 
</P>
<P>
 But its most ambitious effort is the Center for Advanced Technologies, a 
$100-million factory of the future equipped with state-of-the-art machinery 
that churns out parts for auto makers and other contractors. President Clinton 
is scheduled to visit the center Sunday, on the eve of an international 
conference he called to focus on job creation and job training in 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Focus:Hope program is drawing national attention -- and the help of some 
of Detroit's biggest names, including former GM president Lloyd Reuss, who is 
dean of the high-tech training center. Industry and government experts say the 
program could become a model of how to train young people for manufacturing 
jobs, which increasingly require a high level of math, computer and technical 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have proven this can work, even in an inner-city community abandoned by 
industry," said Barry Stern, a former deputy assistant secretary of vocational 
and adult education in the U.S. Department of Education and now a job-training 
consultant in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 CAT students -- the best and the brightest from Focus:Hope's other programs -- 
work toward engineering degrees while laboring as paid apprentices on the 
factory floor under the watchful eye of veteran engineers and industry mentors. 
Besides learning to operate, maintain and program sophisticated machine tools, 
they take courses in applied engineering, advanced mathematics, computer-aided 
manufacturing and even Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are creating the high-skilled worker of the 21st Century," said Father 
William Cunningham, a rabble-rousing Roman Catholic priest who is the director 
and driving force of Focus:Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those workers-to-be is Marvin Taylor. The 31-year-old Detroit native 
entered CAT with the hope of obtaining skills that will mean future job 
security. Already, he is gaining the kind of daily work experience on 
computerized machine tools that most engineering students do not receive in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting hands-on application of theory," said Taylor, who held several 
low-skill jobs in the auto repair business before personal problems left him 
jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some skeptics. Focus:Hope, they say, is too narrowly focused on 
manufacturing, a shrinking sector of the economy. They also complain that it 
soaks up a great deal of money from government and private sources while 
benefiting only the most able of the disadvantaged, not the hard-core 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to be done on a wider scale across all skill levels," said Willie 
Walker, director of Detroit's Department of Employment and Training. 
</P>
<P>
 Still any help is welcome in a city that has lost much of its manufacturing 
base in recent decades. Today, job choices for Detroit's low-skilled youngsters 
often are between flipping hamburgers or selling drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 The loss of jobs began in Detroit even before the devastating 1967 riots but 
intensified with the white flight that followed. The manufacturing sector was 
depleted further in the early 1980s, when the nation's economy slumped and 
competition from more efficient overseas producers intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the unemployment rate in Detroit is about 12%, nearly double that of the 
nation. If people who have abandoned the search for jobs are included, the rate 
jumps to more than 20%. Joblessness is double that again for black youths and 
in some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The failure of public education, particularly in cities like Detroit and 
Chicago, has consigned a total generation to lower skills than their parents 
for the first time in U.S. history," said David Littman, chief economist for 
Comerica Bank in Detroit. "In an era of global competition, this is a fatal 
error." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet efforts to attract new jobs to Detroit or to train workers for jobs 
largely have failed, despite the expenditure of millions of government dollars. 
Often, experts say, workers are trained for jobs that do not exist -- or else 
the training does not meet employers' needs and standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Successful training requires a coalition between the trainers and providers," 
said Malcolm Cohen, an associate research scientist with the University of 
Michigan's Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus:Hope -- whose operations span 33 acres and include a food bank, day care 
center, Montessori school and four small manufacturing plants -- slowly has 
built just such a job-training partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a rocky road. Created in 1968, Focus:Hope often took on the local 
power structure with lawsuits alleging racial discrimination. While still 
committed to racial harmony, the organization has moved its focus from 
courtrooms to boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reached the very pragmatic conclusion that we would gain more by training 
people for good, high-skill jobs rather than suing some business for hiring 
discrimination," said Cunningham, 64, who is as much at home talking about 
total quality management as he is discussing Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is most visible at CAT, a former Ford engine plant now dedicated to 
stretching the envelope of engineering education. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility was refurbished using $55 million in federal and private grants. 
Operations are supported by the Big Three auto makers, the state of Michigan, 
the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The CAT plant, which began operation last fall, is filled with Star Trek-like 
features. The factory floor is a startling bright apple-green; doors are opened 
by a coded hand-identification system; classes are held in three-story "power 
towers" that overlook the machinery; a natural gas cogeneration system produces 
electricity and uses waste energy to heat the plant's air and water. 
</P>
<P>
 The 180,000-square-foot plant was designed to excite the imagination of the 
youngsters who visit and use it. "The faculty that we want to nurture today is 
imagination," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can earn a three-year associate degree, four-year bachelor's degree 
or six-year master's degree in engineering from one of six participating 
universities, including the University of Michigan and Lehigh University. The 
program is designed to mimic actual work situations, so students work 
eight-hour days on real production contracts. They are paid $7.50 an hour. Any 
profits are used to defray program costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, CAT has a $2-million contract to make pulleys for Detroit Diesel, a 
manufacturer of heavy-duty truck engines. "We are a just-in-time supplier for 
Detroit Diesel," said Marty Niezgoda, who with other students works a 
metal-cutting machine set to tolerances of one-thousandth of an inch. "If there 
is a problem, we hear about it quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is now gearing up for a $3-million contract to provide aluminum 
intake manifolds to Ford for its 1995 Windstar minivan. The manifold also will 
be used in new models of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat Focus:Hope just like any other supplier," said Ron Soukup, a Ford 
purchasing specialist. "They have to make a bid and compete on pricing like 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 When not working in the factory, the students receive instruction from faculty 
and tutoring from industry mentors. The academic curriculum is developed by the 
universities and experts from auto and machine tool companies and the Society 
of Manufacturing Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are breaking new ground here," said Reuss, who joined Focus:Hope as a 
volunteer after being fired in a boardroom shake-up at GM in 1992. "Our focus 
is not only on the acquisition of knowledge, but the application of that 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 students are attending CAT; eventually, up to 150 will be enrolled 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are largely drawn from Focus:Hope's machinist training program. 
It began in 1981 after extensive study showed a severe shortage of skilled 
machinists in Detroit, said Eleanor Josaitis, the program's assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission statement calls for practical action," she said. "This was seen 
as practical and intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainees spend half their time learning to operate mills, lathes and grinders 
and half in math, computer and other classes. About two-thirds complete the 
program. More than 900 students have graduated, and all have been placed in 
jobs that generally offer a starting wage of about $7.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Erick Davis, 28, entered the program after being on the welfare rolls for 
nearly a year. A Detroit native, he joined the Marines, but was discharged in 
the military downsizing at the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "What attracted me to this program was the security that a skill offers," said 
Davis, a single father who lives with his mother and 6-year-old son. He has 
already been offered a job as a machinist technician by a local shop. 
</P>
<P>
 No figures are available on how long graduates stay employed. Focus:Hope 
officials estimate that only 10% to 15% leave their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure rate may be higher. John Gruder, owner of Phoenix Die Mold, 
has hired about 10 Focus:Hope trainees and has let three go. Their training had 
some "shortcomings," he said. Still he is generally pleased with the quality of 
Focus:Hope graduates -- particularly their strong work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 While the center is drawing kudos, even its biggest supporters note that the 
program's impact is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), a key backer, acknowledged that 
Focus:Hope may be difficult to copy because it takes years to develop the trust 
and relationships that make such efforts succeed. Stern, who helped Los Angeles 
County apply for federal support for a program modeled on Focus:Hope, said it 
remains to be seen if the Detroit program can wean itself from federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Can they sustain it long term and without federal aid?" he 
said. "That chapter has yet to be written." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, however, has no doubts about Focus:Hope's sustainability. The 
priest has little patience for those who urge caution and criticizes past job 
training programs, saying billions of dollars have been wasted on efforts that 
brought no jobs -- or offered only dead-end work. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 25 years working with the disadvantaged, he still has the 
fervor of a zealot. But he is preaching a new sermon. Cunningham says Detroit 
and the United States can only regain their competitive edge by adopting new 
ideas and technologies and taking advantage of the nation's diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goals are too limited, our focus is too narrow," said Cunningham. "What 
about helping people to be productive to the extent of their capability? Then, 
we would have an economy."

 BIBLE IN JEOPARDY: We've already learned from school tests that our students 
don't know as much as we had hoped. Now, we hear some adults aren't doing much 
better, at least in regard to Christianity. A new survey shows that 65% of 
Americans don't know what "John 3:16" signifies, and most can't define "the 
Gospel." . . . "We live in a biblically illiterate generation," said a 
Chatsworth pastor. (B15)

 ROUND TWO: Apparently, state Sen. David A. Roberti wasn't satisfied with just

November, Hart's highly regarded cross-country team failed to make it to the

do even better than usual in the section Division I meet in May. . . . Staff

POLITICS; MEXICO'S 65-YEAR-OLD RULING PARTY UNDER PRESSURE TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party celebrated its 65th birthday 
this week amid growing pressure for the official party to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon in the independent daily La Jornada showed party Chairman Fernando 
Ortiz Arana blowing out the candles on a cake that had caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the icing does seem to be melting on the system of ward politics 
that has kept Mexico stable under the iron fist of the PRI, as the party is 
known, since 1929. Demands are growing for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
to match the free-market economic reforms of the last decade with democratic 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, opposition parties now govern in three states -- in two 
thanks to back room deals that followed elections in which the PRI was accused 
of fraud. But increasingly, Mexicans are saying that is not enough, and they 
want a clean election when they vote forpresident Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the Jan. 1 rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas has shed a 
harsh light on the deals with local powerbrokers that have sustained the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's negotiator in peace talks with the rebels has admitted that 
theland reforms at the heart of the 1910 Revolution for which the party is 
named have never been fully realized in Chiapas -- a state that has 
consistently returned astoundingly high percentages of PRI votes on election 
days. Land reform has been one of the insurgents' key demands. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the PRI got the state's votes, the government turned a blind eye to 
the huge stretches of land that local officials and their relatives controlled 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the uprising, citizens throughout Chiapas have staged takeovers at city 
halls, demanding the resignations of mayors they say were fraudulently elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, rebel demands for electoral reform struck a sympathetic chord 
throughout the country, provoking numerous marches in the capital and other 
cities in support of those demands. Opposition leaders gathered in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, site of the peace talks, to lend their support to 
demands for political reform.  
</P>
<P>
 Applying the adaptation skills that have kept the party in power this long, 
PRI leaders have even taken up the cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Nunez, general director of the Federal Electoral Institute, which runs 
national elections, told reporters this week that his agency could be more 
independent if his job were taken by someone without party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI candidate for president, told 25,000 party 
faithful gathered Sunday around the Monument to the Revolution to celebrate the 
anniversary that their party must become more independent of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The era of political competition in our country has ended any assumption 
about the existence of an official party," he said. "The era of political 
competition is a great chance for us as a party to turn our strength into 
independence from the government."  
</P>
<P>
 To help make that point, Salinas and most of his Cabinet sent regrets to the 
PRI anniversary celebration. So did Chiapas peace negotiator Manuel Camacho 
Solis, a party activist since he was in his teens, who some say hopes to use 
his current high profile to launch his own presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a brewing feud between Colosio and Camacho still threatens to split 
the party before Election Day. In addition, opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, a PRI dropout who many Mexicans believe was cheated out of the 
presidency by electoral shenanigans in 1988, is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants us to believe there is a separation," Cardenas said of Colosio, 
"let him explain how, as a Cabinet minister and PRI chairman, he was 
independent of . . . Salinas."

NATIONAL REFORM; WOMEN A POTENT ANTI-YELTSIN FORCE IN RUSSIA; PROTESTERS AT 
RECENT RALLY LONG FOR THE QUIET OLD DAYS OF THE SOVIET REGIME. PRESIDENT 
APPEALS TO HIS NATION'S 'DEAR LADIES' TO HELP REBUILD COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last year, protesters banged empty pots and pans. This year, said organizers 
of the anti-government rally to mark International Women's Day, almost no one 
could spare the pots to dent. 
</P>
<P>
 But they came anyway, about 1,000 women and men, to turn what used to be a 
homey holiday akin to Mother's Day, with flowers given and festive dinners 
consumed, into one more weapon in Russia's political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 And Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin joined in the fray, taking to the 
airwaves to court Russia's "dear ladies" in an appeal that amounted to the 
clearest sign yet that women in the new Russia are coalescing into a real 
political force. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rally in a snowy park near the Russian White House on Tuesday, engineer 
Galina Belova said she was "protesting against the situation of women and of 
people in general in our country." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian women are very peaceful homebodies. We care about our homes and 
children, but life has forced us to go out into the streets because it's gotten 
so bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally appealed to protesters' nostalgia for the quiet old days of the 
Soviet regime, slipping easily from Women's Day congratulations into 
indictments of the Russian government for the falling standard of living and 
general instability. Yeltsin had already preempted the protesters, however, by 
appearing on national television with a smiling holiday speech that also began 
as simple congratulations and then segued into an appeal for support. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman's heart has a unique ability to delicately respond to joys and 
sorrows," Yeltsin said. "It is my conviction that we are all united by our 
common concern for Russia and our interest in establishing a normal life as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much alienation, hatred and even aggressiveness in our society," he 
said. "But still it possesses colossal creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's appeal to Russian women was a variation on what has become his 
central theme in the last two weeks: the country's need to forsake its 
political conflicts and join in constructive work to impose elementary order in 
everything from the economy to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that in this I will have your support -- the support of Russian 
women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Russian women will support Yeltsin remains deeply in doubt, however, 
because many of them are among those who have been hit hardest by his radical 
economic reforms of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 70% and 75% of Russia's unemployed are women, although women make up 
50% of the nation's work force. And women's salaries are falling further and 
further behind men's. Under the Soviet regime, women earned an average of 70% 
what men did; now, under the harsh practices of Russia's early capitalism, that 
figure has fallen to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Women of Russia, the women's party that emerged in last December's 
parliamentary elections and garnered an unexpected 23 seats of 450 in the lower 
chamber, is more closely allied to the Communist opposition than to the Yeltsin 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is striking that Russian women could show nostalgia for the Soviet 
Communist era. The old regime was so indifferent to women's concerns that it 
fostered one of the highest abortion rates in the world by failing to provide 
birth control pills and other contraceptive devices. It was decades behind the 
rest of the world in launching the production of tampons and tolerated poor 
obstetric care and high infant mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike American women who fought to be allowed into the workplace, Soviet 
women had to struggle to be allowed to stay home, because the regime preached 
that everyone should work, even the mothers of toddlers. Feminism is only now 
beginning to take root here, in part because Russian women saw it as part of an 
assault on their femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the Soviet regime's neglect of women, Galina Belova said at the 
Women's Day rally that she would happily go back in time if she could, and that 
she sees Yeltsin as the main enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be at least a secure minimum we could count on," she said. 
"Now, I feel humiliated. I can't get medicine for my sick mother. In the old 
days, I never had to sell anything of mine. Now, I've had to sell my coat." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so long-suffering that, involuntarily, we've gotten involved in 
politics," pensioner Alexandra Romanova said. "If everything were all right, 
we'd be home baking for the holiday."

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES PACKAGE OF ANTI-CRIME MEASURES; LEGISLATION: JUDICIARY 
SUBCOMMITTEE OKS A LONG LIST OF PUNISHMENT AND PREVENTION TOOLS. THE 
INITIATIVES MIRROR CLINTON'S PROPOSALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Placing strong emphasis both on crime prevention and tough punishment, a House 
Judiciary subcommittee approved a sweeping crime package Friday that includes 
mandatory life sentences for the most violent felons and $6.5 billion for 
programs to encourage young people to obey the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Congress is still weeks away from final passage of any crime bill and 
details will continue to change, the package -- approved in a series of 
partisan votes on separate bills -- represents the heart of the anti-crime 
initiative being embraced by the House Democratic leadership and President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno immediately endorsed the subcommittee's action, saying: 
"We are pleased with the progress made today in passing the President's crime 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be included in the initiative are two highly popular provisions: the 
addition of 100,000 police officers across the nation and $3 billion for prison 
construction. Those provisions are likely to be part of the $22-billion omnibus 
bill to be considered next week by the full Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Republicans are certain to introduce alternative bills with a 
stronger emphasis on punishment and prison construction, the essence of the 
Democratic bill is expected to win House approval. 
</P>
<P>
 How it will emerge from a conference to reconcile it with the Senate version, 
however, remains unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the crime bill approved by the Senate last year, the House 
subcommittee's approach focuses more sharply on the most violent criminals and 
at crime prevention methods that get results, said Rep. Charles E. Schumer 
(D-N.Y.), chairman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner 
Jr. of Wisconsin, charged that the panel went off on a "spending spree," adding 
$4 billion for more crime prevention to win the support of liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it cost to get the votes for this thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Schumer noted that the package has virtually everything in it the 
President wants, except a ban on assault weapons. The Senate approved a ban on 
19 rapid-fire weapons in its version of the crime bill, but House leaders said 
such a ban would be considered as separate legislation later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee swiftly approved expansion of the federal death penalty for 
64 additional crimes and authorized, on a 7-5 vote, trials for 13- and 
14-year-olds accused of serious violent crimes -- if federal prosecutors in 
each case sought them. 
</P>
<P>
 A parallel provision in the Senate-passed bill makes it mandatory for 
juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults if they are charged with violent 
crimes, including use of a firearm. The Senate bill extends the federal death 
penalty to 53 additional crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We send the wrong signal when we give up on 13-year-old children," argued 
Rep. Craig Washington (D-Tex.). But Schumer sided with the subcommittee 
majority, saying: "There are some -- not many -- juveniles who should be 
treated as adults." 
</P>
<P>
 In its version of the newly popular "three strikes" provision, the House 
subcommittee voted, 10 to 3, to require a life sentence without parole for any 
felon convicted in federal court of a serious violent crime for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment offered by Rep. Steven H. Schiff (R-N.M.) and approved on a 7-6 
vote would require that a life sentence should be imposed if either a first or 
second conviction is for a serious drug offense normally punishable by 10 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who voted against the "three strikes" 
provision, said there is no evidence that repeat offenders convicted in federal 
courts are "walking the streets." About 96% of all crimes are handled by state 
courts, he said, making the provision unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schumer said that the proposal -- already adopted in California and 
Washington -- is aimed only at "the worst, most violent felons" and would not 
put an undue burden on federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 By adopting the measure, the subcommittee brushed aside objections from a 
coalition of 21 national organizations -- including the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union -- that 
the "three strikes" provision is "arbitrary, discriminatory and wasteful." The 
organizations said that the cost of housing prisoners for life would be 
"devastating," estimating it at $20,000 or more per prisoner annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee included a $2-billion program, known as the Local Partnership 
Act, to allocate federal grants to local governments for crime-prevention 
activities. The funds would be provided by a formula based on poverty levels, 
unemployment, population and local tax-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This part of the bill makes an heroic attempt to bring punishment and 
prevention in the same legislation," said Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), 
chief sponsor of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sensenbrenner contended that the program is a combination of the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Act and federal revenue-sharing that he said were ended 
during the Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the money to share," Sensenbrenner said, foreshadowing a floor 
fight on the issue. "It ain't going to work." Democrats, however, were united 
on the issue and picked up a vote for the package from Rep. Jim Ramstad 
(R-Minn.) as well.

 Eduardo Frei was inaugurated as president on Friday and pledged to fight 
poverty and erase remnants of the Pinochet dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei, a 51-year-old engineer and the son of a former president, succeeded 
Patricio Aylwin, who was elected in 1990 after 16 1/2 years of bloody rule by 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.He will serve for a six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei said he will try to repeal a constitutional clause that prevents the 
president from firing the 78-year-old general, who remains army commander, and 
other military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The swearing-in ceremony occurred in the Congress building in the neighboring 
port city of Valparaiso, attended by 97 foreign delegations, including eight 
Latin American presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei has promised to focus on ending poverty afflicting nearly 4 million of 
Chile's 13 million people.

NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE OUSTS SLOVAK LEADER; EUROPE: POPULIST CRUSADER MECIAR IS A 
VICTIM OF A SAGGING ECONOMY. POLITICAL ALLIES DESERT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Parliament of Slovakia voted Friday to oust populist Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar, who spearheaded the nationalist drive that brought about the 
1993 break-up of Czechoslovakia and set the poorer eastern lands on a course 
for economic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-2 vote of no-confidence in Meciar, cast after a two-day debate in the 
Slovak capital of Bratislava, reflected the political and social turmoil that 
has gradually consumed Slovakia since its damaging split from the Czech lands 
14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Slovak constitution, the Cabinet must resign after a parliamentary 
vote of no-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 President Michal Kovac must then designate an interim prime minister to 
propose a new government, which must secure parliamentary endorsement in 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar, who still enjoys strong popular support despite recent political 
setbacks, became vulnerable to parliamentary ouster after nine deputies 
defected from his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen other lawmakers from the movement and its coalition partner, 
the Slovak Nationalist Party, had switched allegiances in the last six months 
in protest of the prime minister's authoritarian and combative leadership 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from Meciar's coalition abstained from the no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
 True to his pugilist background, Meciar went down fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all know I shall win the elections," he warned the deputies before their 
vote to oust him. "You are opposing something you cannot even grasp." 
</P>
<P>
 The Czech news agency CTK said Meciar spoke for more than two hours, urging 
the Parliament to oust the turncoat deputies rather than his government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slovak Parliament had been virtually paralyzed since the latest 
defections, making it impossible for either the prime minister's coalition or 
the opposition to push through legislation that might have set the nation on a 
path toward recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Czech Republic has surged ahead with reforms since the peaceful Jan. 
1, 1993, divorce of Czechoslovakia into two separate countries, Slovakia has 
watched its antiquated heavy industries slip deeper into bankruptcy while 
unemployment has topped 12% and inflation gallops at triple-digit rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar had been campaigning for early elections in June to cash in on his 
continued voter appeal before living conditions could erode further. But he had 
been encountering resistance from opposition deputies who know their parties 
would fare better later in the year, when the economic crisis has had more time 
to influence voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first task will be to secure a peaceful early election," said Roman 
Kovac, a former deputy prime minister who is considered a possible successor to 
Meciar. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for new elections, but they are likely to be called this 
autumn to resolve the governing crisis that has resulted from so many members 
of the 150-seat Parliament switching parties to protest Meciar's failed 
economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 New elections may do little to simplify the political chaos, as voter 
sympathies appear polarized between the far right and former Communist left.

FUGITIVE FORMER BOLIVIAN DESPOT SEIZED IN BRAZIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Bolivian dictator Luis Garcia Meza, a fugitive sentenced in Bolivia to 
30 years in jail for treason and armed insurrection, was arrested Friday in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has accused Garcia Meza of involvement in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal police inspector Roberto Precioso said Garcia Meza will be charged 
with using false documents and faces up to four years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's Supreme Court is reviewing an extradition request made by Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of Bolivian police and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents had 
followed Garcia Meza for months as he shuttled among Bolivia, Chile and Brazil. 
He was located in Sao Paulo by the DEA because of his contacts with drug 
traffickers. The DEA notified Brazilian police, who handled the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia Meza took over the government of Bolivia in July, 1980, after a bloody 
military coup. He was ousted in an August, 1981, coup.

PREEMPTIVE RAIDS ON NUCLEAR SITES REJECTED; DEFENSE: PENTAGON OFFICIAL 
CLARIFIES POLICY AGAINST SPREAD OF ARMS. OLD METHODS TO BE KEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's new plan to counter the spread of nuclear arms to 
Third World countries does not include preemptive strikes at nuclear 
facilities, a top official said, countering suggestions by some policy-makers 
that such an option might exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashton B. Carter, assistant secretary of defense for international security 
policy, said that those who believe that Washington might bomb such facilities 
before the country involved used its nuclear weapons have "misunderstood" 
Washington's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 He also asserted that the Administration plan, unveiled last December, does 
not mean that Washington is abandoning traditional efforts to persuade such 
countries to give up their nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At a briefing last December -- and in charts and diagrams accompanying similar 
sessions -- officials hinted that preemptive strikes were a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also confirmed that the Pentagon is developing a way to verify the 
dismantling of U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads and is considering the 
possibility of proposing it to Moscow in coming discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would call for each side to dismantle its warheads privately -- to 
protect their design secrets -- then to place the fissionable materials in 
special containers that would enable the other side to measure the amount of 
plutonium removed. By measuring the extracted plutonium, monitors could 
determine how many warheads had been dismantled, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his remarks as the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary William 
J. Perry plans to travel to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 
Wednesday for a week of meetings with officials about dismantling nuclear 
weapons and transforming defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 His visit will be the first by a top Clinton foreign policy-maker since the 
arrest of CIA officer Aldrich H. Ames on charges of selling secrets to Moscow. 
Although both sides have sought to play down the Ames affair, it has prompted 
calls in Congress for a halt to aid for Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's remarks were intended to correct what officials conceded had become a 
widespread impression of the new "counter-proliferation" policy -- that is, 
that the United States might preemptively bomb the arsenals of a potentially 
hostile emerging nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration has never threatened such action against any 
specific country, the idea of launching a preemptive strike -- a reversal of 
previous U.S. policy -- had drawn criticism among some Third World governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter made clear Friday that he was speaking only in general terms and was 
not referring to North Korea. Although Pyongyang often has been mentioned as a 
major threat among emerging nuclear powers, Carter avoided discussing the North 
Korean question. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, U.S. officials conceded that it had been Pentagon 
policy-makers who appeared responsible for most of the impression that the 
Administration might launch preemptive strikes against nuclear targets. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official left just such an impression at a background 
briefing for reporters in December. And charts used in earlier briefings by 
Carter have cited "destroying weapons-of-mass-destruction capabilities in 
peacetime deployment" as an element of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin talked often about the need 
for a policy to contend with the kind of problem faced in the 1991 Persian Gulf 
War, when U.S. bombers were unable to destroy the nuclear warfare facilities of 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

 With 30 Liberal Democrat Party members absenting themselves, Japan's lower 
house Friday voted unanimously to strip a former Liberal Democrat construction 
minister of his parliamentary immunity. Hours later, Kishiro Nakamura, 44, 
accused of accepting a $95,238 bribe from Kajima Construction Co. to quash a 
bid-rigging probe by the Fair Trade Commission, surrendered himself at the 
Tokyo district prosecutor's office and was arrested.

LEADERS OF COUP AGAINST GORBACHEV FACING NEW TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the alleged leaders of the 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev apparently can't be punished, Russia's Supreme Court ruled Friday 
that they must stand trial, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozen men -- who once had been among the most powerful in the Kremlin -- 
were having their cases heard by a military court. But the court stopped their 
trial last week after the national Parliament issued an amnesty for them and 
for leaders of last fall's armed opposition to President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court ordered that the 1991 coup case must go before a new panel 
of judges, but Itar-Tass did not say when the new trial would start.

CHEMICAL ARMS WHISTLE-BLOWER CLEARED; RUSSIA: THE MOSCOW GOVERNMENT SHEDS AN 
IRRITANT TO U.S. RELATIONS. THE SCIENTIST HINTS AT A POSSIBLE SUIT FOR DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for free speech in Russia, charges against a scientist who blew 
the whistle on a top-secret chemical weapons program have been dropped, the 
prosecutor general's office announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By closing the case against Vil S. Mirzayanov, charged with disclosing state 
secrets after writing a 1992 newspaper article about a highly potent new nerve 
toxin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's government has removed an irritant to its 
relationship with the United States, which had protested the chemist's 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said last week that Yeltsin was eager to 
see an end to the Mirzayanov case, which had also drawn criticism from 
international human rights groups and raised questions about the sincerity of 
Russia's commitment to chemical disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 In dropping the case, the prosecutor has shown that "the time has come in this 
country when such dangerous activities as development and manufacture of 
chemical weapons can be countered by legal means," Mirzayanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemist hinted that he might sue the individuals and groups that initiated 
the case against him for damages incurred in 18 months of "illegal 
persecution," under a rarely used section of Soviet-era law. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirzayanov, a quiet and mild-mannered ethnic Tatar, has become a symbol for 
those who claim that democratic reform has yet to penetrate the old Soviet 
military-industrial complex, which has a very different political agenda than 
Yeltsin's. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserted that Russia and other countries have secret programs to devise new 
types of chemical weapons that would not be covered by existing international 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as work continues on new kinds of toxic substances, I will continue 
fighting whether I am arrested again or not," Mirzayanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mirzayanov, who was fired from his job at a Moscow chemical weapons 
laboratory after the Moscow News article was published, and his co-author, 
environmental chemist Lev Fyodorov, warn that Russia has not begun to address 
the dangerous environmental consequences of the secret Soviet chemical weapons 
development program. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov, at a news conference Friday, said that about 5 million people have 
been exposed to poisons as a result of testing, leakage or improper dumping of 
Soviet chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 300 areas on half of Russia's territory have been polluted by toxins 
with long-lasting contaminating effects," Fyodorov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Fyodorov alleges in an article published Friday in the Obshchaya 
newspaper that Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, the head of the Soviet chemical weapons 
program, was less than candid in 1987 when he presented as complete the 
chemical arsenal shown to international observers at the Shykhany testing 
ground in the Ural Mountains region. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the super-toxic V-gas that Mirzayanov's lab helped develop was loaded 
into aviation bombs and strategic missiles but was not on the list sent to 
Geneva for the Conference on Chemical Disarmament, Fyodorov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 An article published a week earlier in the same newspaper alleges that Russia 
will be able to keep the new generation binary chemical weapon that 
Mirzayanov's lab worked on, despite having signed the Paris Convention last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 That treaty, a broad ban on designing, producing, stockpiling and using 
chemical weapons, has been signed by 154 countries but has not yet been 
ratified and will not likely take effect until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little trick was that the components of the binary gas and the gas itself 
were not included in the list of banned substances," the Obshchaya article 
asserts. "Hence, Russia possesses the weaponry without violating the 
convention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian committee appointed by Yeltsin in 1992 to oversee the disposal of 
chemical weapons by 2005, as required by the treaty, is headed by Gen. 
Kuntsevich, the article noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee announced that Russia has 40,000 tons of toxic substances in 
stock, the article said. But it said independent experts, who were unnamed, put 
the tonnage at up to 10 times more than official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a news conference last month, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas R. 
Pickering, while expressing dismay over the Mirzayanov prosecution, said he 
remains confident that international groups have the capability to monitor the 
Russian chemical weapons disarmament program to ensure compliance.

ISRAELI SETTLERS CHECK ARMS AT HOLY SITES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jews asserting their right to be at the Western Wall danced Friday while 
Muslims celebrated the end of Ramadan at an adjacent holy site. Police forced 
settlers to check their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the holy month was potentially volatile in the superheated 
emotional climate that followed the Hebron mosque massacre, in which about 30 
Palestinians were killed by an Israeli settler. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a massive display of police force, Arabs were allowed to enter 
the old walled city only through the gates leading to Al Aqsa mosque, the 
third-holiest in Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were barred from 
entering Jerusalem. A prayer leader criticized Israel, saying that only 20,000 
got through for Friday prayers -- about 10% of those who wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 No violence was reported during Friday prayers, but later dozens of Arab 
youths rioted in East Jerusalem, Israeli radio said.

<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization is ready to resume negotiations with 
Israel on self-rule for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Russia's foreign minister 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat "has taken a very strong position. It is a 
courageous decision through his commitment to the peace process and his 
preparedness to resume the peace negotiations," Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Russian 
foreign minister, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO-Israel negotiations were stalled by the Feb. 25 massacre by a Jewish 
settler of about 30 Palestinians worshiping at a mosque in Hebron, in the 
occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, standing beside Kozyrev, sounded slightly more cautious, suggesting 
that the PLO was still awaiting a U.N. Security Council vote on a measure 
condemning the massacre.

ADMINISTRATION TO DOUBLE FOREIGN AID TO SOUTH AFRICA; POLICY: MONEY WILL COME 
AFTER ALL-RACE ELECTIONS. OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS WILL SEE THEIR ALLOTMENTS CUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration plans to double foreign aid to South Africa, from 
$80 million to $160 million a year, after elections next month that will be 
open to all races for the first time, the Agency for International Development 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 AID officials said that $73 million of the increase will be offset by 
across-the-board cuts in development assistance for the rest of the countries 
in Africa south of the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed AID spending plan, sent to Congress weeks after the rest of the 
government's budget was made public, indicates the magnitude of the 
Administration's program to help the country's first majority-rule government 
overcome the economic troubles that threaten to destroy democracy before it can 
take root. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said earlier that Washington will attempt to increase 
the impact of its aid program by urging businesses to reinvest funds that they 
pulled out of South Africa under pressure of U.S. government-imposed 
anti-apartheid sanctions in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct U.S. investment in South Africa declined from about $2.7 billion in 
1980 to about $700 million a decade later. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the South African private sector is able to respond with the capacity that 
we think is there, and if, indeed, the interest that has already been 
manifested on the part of the American private sector and the private sectors 
in other countries around the world (produces investments), I think that there 
will be rather considerable economic activity," said George Moose, assistant 
secretary of state for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the South African economy "has been distorted by policies of 
apartheid over the last 40 years, and it's going to require significant 
restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 The $80-million aid appropriation for South Africa for the current fiscal year 
that runs through Sept. 30 is the largest for any African country. But unlike 
other countries, the money is funneled through various non-governmental 
organizations to avoid direct subsidies to the white-minority government, which 
is to be displaced by a majority regime after the April 26-28 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 AID officials said the U.S. government is committed to maintaining the 
$160-million assistance level for at least two years, starting with the fiscal 
year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the South Africa program pushed the development assistance budget 
for all of Africa to $791 million for the next fiscal year, up from $784 
million in the current year. But aid to all other African countries falls from 
$704 million this year to $631 million next year, a decline of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial aid program for South Africa could help repair President 
Clinton's relations with the black community, a substantial part of his winning 
electoral coalition in 1992. But the cut in aid to the rest of the continent 
may dilute the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an African American 
foreign policy think tank, said the Administration program for South Africa is 
much too small to overcome the legacy of years of racial oppression.

HUNDREDS FLEE PHILIPPINE VOLCANO

<P>
 Hundreds fled Taal volcano south of Manila on Friday as scientists warned it 
could erupt at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, children and old people, carrying meager belongings, piled into small 
boats in the rain to escape across the spectacular crater lake surrounding the 
volcano island 40 miles from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have evacuated about half the people on the island," Talisay Mayor Romulo 
Degrano said. "They are now living in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 6,000 people live on the volcanic island, which lies inside a huge 
crater and, in turn, has its own smaller crater lake and island. 
</P>
<P>
 Taal's last major eruption was in 1976, when hundreds of people were 
evacuated. A massive blast in 1911 killed nearly 1,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of quakes shook Taal throughout Friday, and thick fog covered the 
volcano. An air force helicopter that flew over the volcano reported wispy 
smoke drifting above the crater.

PROSPECT OF PEACE OPENS DOOR TO SARAJEVO EXODUS; BOSNIA: SOME RESIDENTS SAY 
THEY WON'T LEAVE. OTHERS WORRY THE CAPITAL COULD BE TAKEN BY SERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Inside a dank, three-room apartment they share with 10 other relatives, Aljo 
and Rasma Sepkic pass their idle days plotting an escape from this ruined city 
that has rediscovered peace but not its spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the brutal artillery bombardment that afflicted Sarajevo for 22 
months has ceased -- for now -- the Sepkics fear that there will be no chance 
to provide their two children with any semblance of a normal life for at least 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools operate only sporadically. Running water and electricity still depend 
on the whim of armed Bosnian Serb rebels encircling Sarajevo. Snipers continue 
to menace pedestrians in the center of this city once renowned for its 
harmonious blend of cultures and religions. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Sepkics despair about most is their native city's loss of hope for 
any rebuilding of a tolerant and multiethnic society and for a recovery of the 
prosperity it enjoyed before Bosnia-Herzegovina fell victim to nationalist 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a mathematician, she an economist, and they once knew all the suburban 
comforts enjoyed by their peers in Western Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, there is no local work in either profession, and those 
employed in Sarajevo's few operating offices and industries earn less than $2 
per month in a city where the rudiments of survival are possibly more expensive 
than anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign food aid provides most families with enough flour to prepare a daily 
ration of bread. But meat, sugar, coffee and most vegetables -- smuggled in by 
thriving war profiteers -- sell for more than $20 per pound. Gasoline, for the 
few who can afford it, has topped $60 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "An honorable man will never again be able to make a living here," says 
Sepkic, who has been appealing to friends, relatives and complete strangers in 
the West to give him the chance to perform even the most menial labor if 
Sarajevo's barricades are lifted and he can get his family abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the shattered Bosnian capital, dispirited people await the lifting 
of a Serb rebel blockade, as promised by officials of the U.N. Protection Force 
endeavoring to implement a step-by-step restoration of peace and order. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Sarajevans say they will never abandon their city, despite the 
deprivations inflicted by nearly two years of war. But concerns are mounting 
among both U.N. officials and politicians here that the first consequence of 
liberation might be a mass exodus of desperate civilians, leaving Sarajevo easy 
prey for the Bosnian Serb gunmen who want it as the capital of their own rogue 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government officials concede privately that they would prefer that the 
option of leaving Sarajevo be offered its war-weary residents only after the 
city has been at peace for a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one yet believes the shelling has really stopped," one Sarajevo official 
said. "If the barricades were lifted tomorrow, I think you'd see crowds of 
people rushing to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Sarajevans seeking refugee status in foreign countries are 
already listed with religious and human rights organizations that have been 
negotiating with both the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serb and Croat 
rebel leaders for limited evacuations of those in need of medical treatment or 
reunion with relatives abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the vast majority of the 380,000 people left in the Bosnian capital, 
any departure, whether permanent or temporary, must await lifting of the rebel 
blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 The British commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has 
promised to restore freedom of movement for Sarajevans who have been trapped in 
this city since rebel Serbs launched an artillery siege in the spring of 1992, 
after a majority of Bosnians voted to secede from the former Yugoslav 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's efforts to open civilian traffic corridors in and out of Sarajevo have 
been stymied, however, as Serbian gunmen have refused even to allow restoration 
of foot traffic over the midtown Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity that spans the 
Miljacka River and links the Serbian-occupied Grbavica neighborhood with the 
center of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 For those yearning for a better life elsewhere, such as the Sepkic family, 
escape remains in the planning stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasts of the size of the exodus that would follow genuine liberation of 
Sarajevo vary widely, and the most dramatic projections usually fail to take 
into account the difficulty most Bosnians would have in obtaining the right to 
visit or settle abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia, Slovenia and Austria all require Bosnian refugees to first secure 
visas, even if they plan only to travel through those countries while en route 
elsewhere. And permission to work or settle in the Western destinations most 
desired by those wanting to leave here -- such as Germany, Switzerland and the 
United States -- is even more difficult to obtain in this time of global 
recession and fierce competition for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Bogen, Austria's special envoy to Bosnia who lives in this shattered 
city about two weeks each month, predicts that there would be a massive outflow 
of Sarajevans if all barricades and travel restrictions were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But he firmly believes that most would soon come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who leaves his country sooner or later wants to come back. That was 
our experience in Croatia and I'm sure it would be the same here," said Bogen, 
whose makeshift embassy at the bomb-blasted Holiday Inn still has no 
visa-issuing authority because there is no way for Sarajevans to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here has been saying for 22 months that they want to get out. But we 
have to make it clear to people that they have to be patient, they have to live 
through this, that there will be a future," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim of uncertainty, though, thousands are preparing to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Interlingua private language school in the shattered Skenderija 
neighborhood, nearly 200 Sarajevans have plunked down the relative fortune of 
100 German marks, about $65, to study English, German, French or Italian, most 
in hopes of finding work abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the war, people usually planned to come back" after taking their new 
language skills to Western Europe to find jobs in which they could earn hard 
currency, said Edin Hadzic, director of the 5-year-old school. "Now I think the 
majority wouldn't want to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hadzic himself said he cannot envision choosing life as a refugee over 
fighting to defend what is left of his native country and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the situation improves, if there is no shooting for some months, if it is 
peaceful and Sarajevo is not divided, then I think there is a possibility we 
could all live together again and people would change their minds about 
leaving," the 30-year-old school director said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because normal commerce and travel have been disrupted for two years now and 
there are few encouraging signs that the blockade will be eased any time soon, 
many have given up waiting for relief and, like the Sepkics, look outward for 
any chance to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no chance to rebuild this city. It is divided now. It's dead. No one 
who was a true Sarajevan will want to stay here," said 21-year-old Ariana 
Redzovic, who washes dishes at a cafe patronized by war profiteers to earn 
enough to buy the occasional potato or onion to supplement her charity flour 
rations. "I would go anywhere, absolutely anywhere, even to Albania, if I could 
just get out."

DEMOCRATS PUSH $1.51-TRILLION BUDGET PLAN THROUGH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democratic-led House on Friday approved a $1.51-trillion budget for fiscal 
year 1995 that embraces most of President Clinton's plan. It would help schools 
and the homeless, while trimming defense appropriations and scores of domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 223-175 roll call that included a unanimous "no" vote by Republicans, 
lawmakers accepted a spending plan that advocates claim will drive next year's 
federal budget deficit down to $175.3 billion, the least amount of red ink in 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Budget Committee begins work on the plan next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats said the measure's shift of funds from low- to high-priority 
programs would keep the economy moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy is on a path, said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.), "that's brought more new hope, more family investments and more 
consumer confidence than we've seen in a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before final passage, lawmakers rejected a Republican alternative calling 
for a broad tax cut in the form of a new $500 credit for most children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to put families first," said Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.). "Putting 
families first means first and foremost keeping more of what they earn. It 
means recognizing that the people who do the most important work in this 
country are not congressmen, they're mothers and fathers raising kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats countered that the GOP's proposed tax break would go to families 
making up to $200,000 a year, but not to millions earning less than $16,000 
annually, who pay no income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending plan covers the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. Although it sets 
broad limits for federal spending and taxation, decisions about specific cuts 
and increases in programs are often ignored when lawmakers write annual 
spending bills later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the budget proposes increases above last year's levels for 
programs dealing with transportation, education, health, aid to the poor and 
anti-crime measures. There would be less for programs connected with defense, 
foreign aid, science and space, the environment, agriculture and veterans' 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and lawmakers did the hardest work of reducing the deficit last year 
when they approved his five-year package of spending cuts and tax increases. 
The measure approved Friday proposes only reductions that last year's plan 
required. It has no new tax increases and no new restraints on Medicare or the 
other benefit programs that are the fastest growing portion of the budget.

AVERAGE SPENDING FOR MEDICARE RISES 8.7%

<P>
 Medicare spent $3,940 on average last year for each of its 36 million elderly 
or disabled beneficiaries, the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure represented an 8.7% increase from the year before. The growth rate 
was down from 11.5% in fiscal 1992, the Health Care Financing Administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Total Medicare benefit payments in fiscal 1993 were $142.9 billion, or 10.6% 
more than the earlier year. The total payments grew at a faster rate in part 
because of a 1.7% increase in the number of people enrolled in Medicare.

KEY WHITEWATER FIGURE TO COME FORWARD; PROBE: SUSAN MCDOUGAL, A PARTNER IN THE 
LAND DEAL, IS SCHEDULED TO APPEAR AT A PRESS CONFERENCE. SHE IS REMEMBERED AS 
COLORFUL, FREE-SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 She is the mystery woman of the Whitewater saga -- the one key witness who has 
as yet said nothing publicly about President Clinton's Ozark Mountain land 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan McDougal, 38-year-old former wife of failed savings and loan owner James 
B. McDougal and former partner with the Clintons in the Whitewater Development 
Corp., is in a position to know about many unexplained aspects of the 
controversy now engulfing the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, she could shed light on the central question in the case: 
Did Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton personally benefit from 
savings and loan money funneled illegally into the Whitewater real estate 
venture? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McDougal's version of the Whitewater story is likely to be every 
bit as colorful as it is informative. 
</P>
<P>
 A feisty, fun-loving woman, she is remembered vividly here because she 
appeared in hot pants and riding a white horse in a television commercial for 
one of her then-husband's real estate developments and because her 
free-spending habits helped to bankrupt his savings and loan, costing U.S. 
taxpayers at least $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, McDougal, who has eluded reporters since the Whitewater controversy 
began, is promising to break her silence. Her lawyer, Bobby McDaniel, has 
scheduled a press conference for his client, who is preparing to tell her story 
to Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Because McDougal has been implicated in many of the misdeeds involving her 
ex-husband's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and Whitewater Development Corp., 
she is expected to seek immunity in exchange for her testimony. McDaniel 
acknowledged that he already has talked with the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those who have talked with her recently, McDougal realizes that 
she is in a position to stir up trouble for the President and she is anxious to 
defend herself. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not yet clear whether Clinton should fear her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 While McDougal possesses inside knowledge of the Whitewater project that could 
substantially assist Fiske with his investigation, her friends and lawyers say 
she remains fiercely loyal to the Clintons and insistent that she is not guilty 
of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan McDougal did not knowingly do anything wrong, and no one has shown that 
she did anything wrong," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance added: "I don't think she feels that she has any real 
smoking-gun evidence, but they are going to have to give her immunity to get 
her side." 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal not only denies any fault in the Whitewater matter, she also insists 
that she is not guilty of more recent charges pending against her in Los 
Angeles that she stole $200,000 from famed conductor Zubin Mehta while working 
as his personal bookkeeper after she left Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Levine, her Los Angeles attorney, said McDougal is confident she will 
be proven innocent of charges of embezzling from Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, McDougal's story is one of rags to riches and back to rags. 
</P>
<P>
 From humble beginnings in Camden, Ark. -- one of seven children born to a 
soldier father and Belgium-born immigrant mother -- she became a highly visible 
Little Rock businesswoman with a flashy Jaguar and a reputation for what one of 
her friends described as "a shop-till-you-drop philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1984 and 1986, according to a bank examiner's report on Madison 
Guaranty, she collected more than $1.5 million from the thrift, acting as the 
owner of a subsidiary advertising agency, known as Madison Marketing, that 
drained millions of dollars from the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 She collected 15% commissions for doing the thrift's advertising and public 
relations work, but she actually hired other firms to carry out the work, 
according to the government's assessment of her role. 
</P>
<P>
 In her high-roller days, McDougal is said to have spent $1 million renovating 
and decorating a $200,000 house that she and her former husband bought in West 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Her expensive tastes also dictated the expenditure of $600,000 to convert a 
former dry-cleaning establishment in a historic section of the city into an Art 
Deco headquarters for Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was paper hats and horns -- a party all the time," said an 
acquaintance familiar with McDougal's business practices. "She thought her 
subdivisions were making money even when they were losing money." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, McDougal is back on hard times -- unemployed and living with her 
boyfriend, Eugene (Pat) Harris, a former Madison Guaranty real estate agent, in 
Nashville. By all accounts, she spends her days searching for work, talking 
with her lawyers and avoiding the reporters who frequently stalk her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day is not a party now," commented one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal got to know the Clintons through her then-husband, whom she met in 
1974 when she was a young drama student and he was a teacher at Ouachita 
Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark. She encountered him one day when she 
was trying to get into a locked office at the school and he kicked in the door 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
 James McDougal and Clinton were acquainted from their days working in the 
office of Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1978, when the Clintons and the McDougals decided to develop 
vacation homes together in the Ozarks, Susan McDougal was privy to the many 
internal financial transactions of Whitewater Development for which there 
apparently no longer are complete records. 
</P>
<P>
 As a primary stockholder in Madison Guaranty and the owner of Madison 
Marketing, she may also know about thrift funds funneled through her company 
into the Whitewater venture. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal could be able to explain the circumstances surrounding one 
transaction that has provoked particular suspicion. That is a November, 1985, 
check for $7,500 from Madison Marketing to Whitewater Development that was used 
to make a payment on a personal loan that the Clintons had taken out to build a 
model home on one of the Whitewater lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The check has been characterized by Clinton's critics as evidence that, as 
governor of Arkansas, he may have benefited personally from payments from a 
state-regulated thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investigators hope that McDougal can explain what happened to 
$300,000 she got from a small Arkansas investment firm also enmeshed in the 
Whitewater matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's owner claims that Clinton and James McDougal asked him to loan 
money to Susan McDougal, apparently to help prop up Madison Guaranty as it was 
staggering under the burden of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 She is known to have spent $110,000 to acquire an additional parcel of land 
for Whitewater Development, but it is not known where the remainder of the 
money went. The loan was backed by federal Small Business Administration funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they were business partners, McDougal's former husband seems to 
have no idea how she will answer these questions. He claims that she always 
operated independently of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see it as an adjunct to my activities," he said in an interview. "I 
saw her as an individual with a right to her own ambitions and undertakings." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout their marriage, he said, his former wife kept her finances separate 
from his. "She did not have to ask me when she wanted to buy something," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan McDougal, however, tells a different story, saying in her rare comments 
that he handled the family's money. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDougals separated in May, 1984. In 1986, when they were ousted from the 
management of Madison Guaranty by federal regulators, James McDougal -- his 
health deteriorating -- is said to have accepted the move with quiet 
resignation, but thrift executives remember that Susan McDougal, who remained a 
stockholder, fought to keep her management ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, with the legal system putting pressure on her, she is described by 
friends and acquaintances as "very strong, very loyal, very bright . . , a 
survivor . . , very anxious to have her side of this come out." 
</P>
<P>
 As she points out in conversations with friends, she was never charged with 
any crime when James McDougal was tried and acquitted for bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the McDougals have been separated for nearly a decade, the 
financial web they wove together has kept them "inextricably intertwined," as 
James McDougal put it. They divide the small returns that the land development 
still produces and will share in the proceeds of a defense fund their lawyers 
are establishing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, although their divorce became final in 1990 while Susan McDougal 
was living in California, the McDougals still seem to have a fond sentimental 
attachment. "We go to the same funerals," her former husband said.

CLINTONS PLAN TV APPEARANCE AS PART OF WHITEWATER STRATEGY; PUBLICITY: MORE 
CALL ON FIRST LADY TO SPEAK OUT ON THE CONTROVERSY. TREASURY DEPARTMENT TURNS 
OVER 3,700 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid mounting calls for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak out on the 
Whitewater controversy, the White House planned Friday for both her and 
President Clinton to appear on at least one prime-time television news magazine 
show next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton has remained consistently silent on the issue, and White House 
aides have been split sharply during the last two days on the wisdom of 
appearances that would generate new headlines, even if they succeeded in 
mollifying some critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here has had a slightly different view on it," one senior official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, officials decided that, to be effective, the White House 
strategy of openness on the Whitewater matter could not end with the 
President's explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the television appearances was among several developments Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department surrendered 3,700 pages of subpoenaed documents 
describing contacts with the White House and other federal agencies about its 
investigation of the failure of a savings and loan connected to the Whitewater 
real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials sought to minimize the importance of the records culled from 
the Treasury Department files, the sheer volume of them -- more than three 
times what the White House surrendered on Thursday -- appeared to indicate that 
questionable contacts between regulatory officials and White House aides 
occurred over an extended period and involved large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, a GOP lawmaker claimed to have evidence that federal 
regulators in Washington may have tried to intimidate field investigators 
looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan of Little Rock, 
Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan is at the heart of the Whitewater controversy. The thrift 
was owned by James B. McDougal, who, along with his wife, Susan, was a partner 
with Bill and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp., which was 
established in the late 1970s to build a resort community in the Ozark 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators are trying to determine whether the Clintons received 
improper loans from McDougal, whose thrift later failed and was taken over by 
federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary investigation, being led by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., 
is also trying to determine the role played by Hillary Clinton, then a partner 
in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, in representing Whitewater Development and 
Madison Guaranty. Fiske's team in also looking into the apparent suicide last 
July of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, who had worked on the 
Whitewater matter as a Rose Law Firm partner and later at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton has found herself in an awkward position in the Whitewater 
matter. Since the beginning of the Administration, she has sought to limit the 
kind of the publicity she receives -- calling no full-scale Washington press 
conferences, for example -- in part to head off accusations that she is trying 
to develop an independent political role. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has played a part in several issues stemming from the Whitewater 
controversy. It was she who managed the Clinton family finances, including 
Whitewater transactions, and she was a partner in the Rose Law Firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also been linked to controversial steps taken by the White House after 
Foster's apparent suicide. Her chief of staff, Margaret Williams, was among top 
aides who entered Foster's office after his body was found in a Virginia park. 
Questions raised about the removal of Whitewater-related papers from the office 
led last week to the resignation of White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even some Democrats are coming to the view that the First Lady must more 
directly address these questions to lay them to rest. She "needs to make 
herself available for questioning the same way the President did," Sen. Bob 
Graham (D-Fla.) said at a meeting this week with members of the Knight-Ridder 
news bureau in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Many party members gathered at the spring meeting of the Democratic National 
Committee in Cleveland on Friday argued that the First Lady must be forthcoming 
if Democrats are to avoid becoming saddled with the Whitewater issue in the 
November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for her to find the right venue in which to talk to the American 
people about a lot of this stuff," Lynn Cutler, a longtime party activist, told 
the Associated Press. "Her integrity and effectiveness are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was unclear whether the First Lady would choose to answer specific 
questions on any TV news shows or whether she might decline on grounds that to 
do so could interfere with Fiske's work. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides were considering a joint appearance by the Clintons on the 
CBS-TV program "48 Hours," which is broadcast Wednesday nights. To extend its 
full-access public relations strategy, the White House also planned to put its 
new special counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, on three TV network news shows on Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the documents turned over by the Treasury Department Thursday night and 
Friday morning, a Treasury spokesman refused to say how many employees found 
relevant information in their files, computers and trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it was pretty mundane stuff," said a senior Treasury official who 
asked not to be identified. "Thirty-seven hundred pages may sound like a lot, 
but in reality there's a lot of duplication." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that as much as 80% of the material consisted of documents 
generated in the preparation for congressional testimony, question-and-answer 
sheets for responding to media inquiries about Whitewater, press releases and 
early drafts of such material. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in February congressional testimony that Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Roger Altman revealed that he had briefed top White House officials about the 
criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty. Altman conducted the briefing in 
his role as acting director of the Resolution Trust Corp., the Treasury 
Department unit responsible for disposing of the assets of bankrupt savings and 
loan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 It has since been learned that Treasury Department officials alerted White 
House aides to developments in the case on a number of other occasions. Fiske 
this week began taking testimony under subpoena from White House and Treasury 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, claimed to have evidence that 
federal regulators may have tried to intimidate field investigators trying to 
find why Madison Guaranty failed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had forwarded the evidence to Fiske and expected the allegations to 
emerge as "a central issue" in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers John M. Broder, Michael Ross and James Gerstenzang

NEWS ANALYSIS; WHITEWATER: MEDIA FRENZY UNAVOIDABLE; PRESS: WHILE COVERAGE 
GENERALLY IS SEEN AS EXCESSIVE, EVEN CRITICS BELIEVE AGGRESSIVENESS PROVIDES 
STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST REAL WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, one of President Clinton's top economic advisers, 
Gene Sperling, stuck his head into White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers' 
office with some rare good news about the media. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC was going to lead its telecast that night with the President's new job 
training bill. Terrific, everyone thought. "They want to show they can do other 
things besides Whitewater," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. Not only was the jobs bill not the lead story, it wasn't 
broadcast -- and Whitewater was. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it has been going lately in this city. Another possible scandal 
is afoot, with all the familiar artifacts of disillusionment -- a special 
prosecutor, a grand jury, even the shredding of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last week, the seven largest newspapers in the country have published 
92 stories about the Whitewater land deal. The three major networks have aired 
179. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the press coverage out of control? What are the chances that 
hyperventilated coverage ofWhitewater could seriously harm the President only 
to have it discovered later that there was no criminal wrongdoing? 
</P>
<P>
 Many journalists and critics agree that given the facts now known, the 
coverage is excessive, particularly the comparisons to Watergate leveled by 
Republicans and some media pundits. But even critics of the coverage believe 
that an aggressive press provides strong protection against real wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 History suggests that intense coverage of Whitewater could damage Clinton 
temporarily, sapping his power in Washington as his public approval rating 
drops and attention is diverted to defending against the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the evidence suggests that if there is no serious wrongdoing, the public 
will forgive Clinton in the long run. The worst victims could be the critics 
who pushed Whitewater as a scandal and the media that purveyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is scandal-trained and they discount the hype," said Larry Sabato, 
a University of Virginia professor and media critic who coined the phrase 
"feeding frenzy" as a description of overly aggressive coverage. "Like the 
video generation knows how to interpret television, the scandal generation 
knows how to interpret events like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Several conditions lend such stories to excess. First, there is the nature of 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pictures can't help but blow this up beyond what the contents suggest: 
People to grand juries. Special prosecutors. Subpoenas in the White House. 
Shredded documents," says Jack Germond, the longtime political reporter for the 
Baltimore Sun.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in Watergate and Iran-Contra, where people who testified before the 
grand jury were brought in and out in private, here witnesses who may be guilty 
of nothing run the gantlet of cameras in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Network officials worry that even if their organizations try to give the story 
context and nuance, such tales eventually get reduced to the shorthand of a TV 
graphic labeled "Scandal" as they cascade through the echo chamber from 
newspapers to a three-minute network story to a 45-second summary on local 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is that some Republicans are engaged in score settling. As Rep. 
Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) acknowledged this week, Republicans remember "where we 
were investigated, sometimes frivolously." Given that history, for Republicans 
to act with restraint now would require "a saintliness that is superhuman, 
supernatural . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Garment, the author of "Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American 
Politics," notes that in the 20 years since Watergate, dozens of new procedural 
requirements and ethics rules have been added to government. Each new rule -- 
about who can meet with whom, what one must disclose and who has oversight 
power -- creates "more occasions where someone can be guilty of something, 
however technical, in the course of a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Also lending to the drumbeat is the journalistic form, wherein each time there 
is a new fact the press can write a story that recounts all the allegations, 
says Stephen Hess, who studies the media for the Brookings Institution in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes the facts end up being meaningless. Not long ago the Washington 
Post published a mysterious note found in the office of Vincent Foster, the 
deputy White House counsel who apparently committed suicide, and speculated 
that it may have linked Foster to Whitewater and a possible slush fund. It now 
appears it was simply a list of dates the Clintons deposited money in a school 
account for their daughter, Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Doyle, the journalist and author of "Not Above the Law," argues that 
rumors are published more freely now than before. This week, for instance, 
newspapers drew attention to a rumor that Foster actually died in a private 
apartment in Virginia and his body was moved to the park where it was 
discovered. The papers published on the pretext that the wholly unsubstantiated 
rumor affected the stock market after investors learned of it through an 
economic and political newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage of scandal allegations can have an immediate impact on a President. 
When the Iran-Contra story broke in the late fall of 1986, for instance, Ronald 
Reagan suffered the fastest decline in public popularity in polling history, 
dropping from the mid 60s to the mid 40s in approval of his job performance, 
according to the Gallup Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reagan was never charged with having knowledge of the Iran-Contra 
affair or doing anything illegal, his approval rating did not recover for 
nearly two years, with the signing of peace agreements with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible that enough daily stories could end up causing real damage for 
Clinton and then eventually the press will have to say it is sorry," Hess said. 
"Because unlike the typical scandal, we are not starting with a crime and then 
looking for a perpetrator. Here we have a perpetrator and we are looking to see 
if he committed a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley B. Greenberg, Clinton's pollster and an adviser, said the cost to 
Clinton of a prolonged scandal would be magnified this year because 1994 "is 
the year that defines his presidency, when he's putting the key parts of his 
legislative agenda forward." 
</P>
<P>
 But even journalists who have suspected Whitewater is much ado about nothing 
believe the press has a legitimate reason for engaging the issue aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the behavior of the White House," said William Greider, the highly 
respected Washington editor of Rolling Stone, "it is totally reasonable to 
infer that they have something in the box that they don't want people to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater story can be divided into two elements: the facts of the land 
deal in Arkansas, and the political fallout in Washington. Most of what has 
been written in the last few weeks has been about the political dimensions, 
which the public apparently finds increasingly less compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, for instance, Germond was thoroughly convinced that Clinton's 
presidential aspirations were ruined by allegations by Gennifer Flowers that 
she had an extended extramarital affair with Clinton. No presidential candidate 
had ever survived such a charge. But public opinion polls showed the majority 
of Americans were willing to put the media frenzy aside. That diminished 
response to the coverage eventually caused the press to back away from the 
story, and Clinton's campaign was soon back on track.

NEXT TO SPRING BREAK, BIKE WEEK SET IS BORN TO BE MILD; TOURISM: DAYTONA BEACH 
LOVES THE SOUND OF REVVING HOGS AND RINGING CASH REGISTERS. CITY LEADERS SAY 
BIKERS ARE TAMER THAN COLLEGE KIDS -- RICHER TOO.

 Hogs and choppers begin to rumble down Main Street each day about 8 a.m. and 
before long the curbs are lined with saddlebags and chrome, the sidewalks are 
jammed with tourists in black leather and tattoos and the rumble has become a 
roar that won't let up until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is here for the same reason. It's a bunch of boys getting together 
with their toys," said Ohio dry cleaner Al Oates, 33, as he eased his $15,000 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle into a rare available parking spot across from the 
Boot Hill Saloon earlier this week. "It's just amazing to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even for veterans of this tribal gathering, Bike Week '94 seems like a 
revelation, a noisy, beer-fueled celebration of motorcycles and free spirits 
that over 10 days is expected to draw more than 500,000 people to this resort 
town on the Atlantic Ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 8 million tourists a year come to Daytona Beach, famed for a 
500-mile stock car race, reveling college students on spring break and a 
white-sand beach so wide and hard-packed that motorists are allowed to drive on 
it. But nothing, says the city's public safety director, Paul B. Crow, compares 
to Bike Week. "It's the biggest, best-behaved group we have all year," says 
Crow. "Compared to this, everything else is small." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Bike Week ends Sunday, local tourism officials expect that spending 
will surpass last year's record high of $211 million, while the death toll 
drops to a record low. Last year, eight motorcyclists died during Bike Week, 
all after being struck by cars. Through Friday there had been only one Bike 
Week fatality -- a 49-year-old man who fell off his motorcycle and was run over 
by a police cruiser as the officer was trying to arrest him for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are motorcycle races throughout Bike Week at Daytona 
International Speedway, most bikers are here just to hang out on Main Street, 
ride off to various mud-wrestling and tattoo contests at bars in the county and 
be part of the scene at what is billed as the world's largest gathering of 
two-wheeled vehicles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to this all year," said Bob Landon, 49, who works for Honda 
in Marysville, Ohio, but -- like 95% of those here -- rides a Harley-Davidson. 
"We just like to look at the bikes and ride around a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Michel Bedard, an oil refinery technician who with his wife, Lucille, and 
several other couples trailered their motorcycles into town from Montreal: "I 
can't believe how friendly everyone is. It's happy, a party. I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 For those whose idea of motorcyclists begins with Marlon Brando in the 1954 
movie "The Wild One" and ends with notorious biker clubs like the Hell's Angels 
or the Outlaws, Bike Week might sound like a nightmare. And Daytona Beach has 
had its share of bad dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1988, says George Mirabal, president of the Daytona Beach-Halifax Area 
Chamber of Commerce, "there were a lot of problems. The event just happened and 
the previous city administration did not welcome bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of arrests and fights, and weeks later we used to find bodies in 
the woods, leftover from Bike Week." 
</P>
<P>
 A new city administration and the formation of a Bike Week task force changed 
that. "We turned it into a festival rather than an invasion," said Mirabal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bike Week, if not tame, is a well-mannered affair, where a sizable number 
of the participants are middle-age, graying and costumed for a street party 
where the dress code is basic black. "It's a lifestyle," said John Scott, who 
handles promotions for a 16,000-square-foot Harley super store that opened here 
last month. "We get a lot of affluent doctors and lawyers who stop shaving in 
January to get ready for this week." 
</P>
<P>
 According to market researchers, the average age of those at Bike Week is 43. 
Family incomes average $45,000, and the typical individual here for a few days 
of vacation is prepared to spend $1,500. This weekend, all of Daytona Beach's 
17,000 hotel rooms are full and campgrounds around Volusia County are packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We close at 3 a.m., but it's an hour after that before we can get everybody 
out of here," said Tina Strahan, manager of Dirty Harry's, a Main Street bar 
that is resupplied each day of Bike Week by a truckload of Budweiser. "They 
don't want to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some drunken rowdiness this week, to be sure, and there are 
so-called one-percenters -- members of the outlaw biker clubs -- in town, 
according to Crow, the police chief. But also in town are scores of police 
officers from as far away as Japan, Germany and Australia keeping tabs on the 
outlaw bikers, some of whom have been associated with narcotics and organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a tendency to forget that 99% of bikers are good, family-oriented 
people who have a more sober agenda than the college kids, for example," said 
Crow, a former motorcycle cop who has been police chief for six years. "We deal 
with the 1%, and they work with us too." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people have been arrested this year for minor offenses: men busted 
for carrying open containers of alcohol on the street and women for indecent 
exposure. "Really," said Crow, "our biggest problem is gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 For merchants and hoteliers, Bike Week has grown into such an economic boon 
that many want to promote Daytona Beach as a year-round mecca for 
motorcyclists. A new festival called Biketoberfest, this year scheduled from 
Oct. 20 to 23, is geared to bring bikers back to Main Street, where most of the 
storefronts stand empty most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the town's beaches will be cheek-by-jowl with college students for 
the next six weeks, the spending drops and aggravation climbs. "College kids 
have no money to spend except for beer and macaroni dinners, four for $1," said 
Rheva Lund, who is selling thousands of T-shirts, pins and Harley-Davidson 
doodads from her Main Street shop, Crazy Bob's. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the free-spending ways of the bikers, Lund says: "If you can't make 
money during Bike Week, you shouldn't be in retail."

SHALALA DECRIES DOMESTIC ABUSE, CALLS IT TERRORISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala decried domestic violence 
Friday as "terrorism in the home" and called upon Americans to wake up to the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She promised that the Clinton Administration would do its part, including 
establishing a national telephone hot line for victims of domestic abuse that 
is awaiting congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Four million women each year "are terrorized by the men they know," Shalala 
said at a conference on family violence organized by the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 From 20% to 30% of the injuries that send women to emergency rooms are 
inflicted by their partners, she said. Shalala said there has been a 
"conspiracy of silence" about the problem, which afflicts poor, middle-class 
and wealthy families alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert E. McAfee, president-elect of the AMA, said that too often 
physicians "focus on the twisted ankle, the broken rib" and accept without 
questioning a patient's claim that she fell down the stairs. Less than 15% of 
the time do they put their finger on what actually happened, he said.

FLOODING PERIL FROM SNOW EASES IN MIDWEST; RAINS POSE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The danger of flooding from snowmelt in the upper Midwest was declared over 
Friday, although emergency officials said they are still wary of spring rains. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service forecasters said that a dry, warm late winter has 
allowed rivers to flush melting snow in areas where flooding was the worst last 
year, including southern Minnesota through Iowa and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 But soil moisture levels remain abnormally high, meaning that spring rains 
have no place to go but into rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger of flooding is never over on the Iowa River," said Iowa County 
Sheriff James Slockett. "We get a four-, five-inch rain, that could be very 
harmful to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Midwest flooding caused about $12 billion in damage and was blamed 
for 48 deaths in nine states: Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. That flooding started with 
heavy snow cover and early spring rains at the same time the snow was melting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Ostendorf, head of the Iowa Emergency Management Department's response 
division, said he was encouraged but still watchful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to what we had last year, we're ahead of the ballgame. But the 
ground is so saturated, spring rains could send the rivers up in a hurry," he 
said. "There's no sponge capacity out there."

ACTOR JAMES CAAN MAY BE CHARGED WITH BRANDISHING GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor James Caan, famous for his role as a gangster in "The Godfather," was 
released on his own recognizance Friday after his arrest on suspicion of 
brandishing a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan was arrested at 10 p.m. Thursday after another man accused him of 
brandishing a pistol, Los Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin said.Brandishing a 
weapon is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor said he was going to his brother's North Hollywood apartment when he 
got into an argument with the other man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police continued to interview witnesses Friday, and the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office will decide next week whether to file a charge against Caan, 
Dunkin said. He said the actor apparently had a permit to carry a concealed 
weapon.

SUIT TO OVERTURN GILL NET BAN DISMISSED; COURTS: JUDGE REJECTS FISHING 
INDUSTRY'S CLAIMS THAT PROPOSITION 132 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THE PUBLIC 
WAS MISLED ABOUT THE DANGER TO PORPOISES. HE SAYS FISHERMEN WILL HAVE TO ADAPT 
TO THE CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A San Diego judge Friday dismissed a fishing industry lawsuit aimed at 
overturning Proposition 132, the 1990 ballot measure that bans the use of gill 
nets in California coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), the initiative's major sponsor, hailed 
the ruling by Superior Court Judge Arthur W. Jones as a victory for 
environmentalists and a vindication of the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
 But fishermen who packed the courtroom complained that Allen and other 
initiative backers tricked the public into believing that gill nets, which are 
intended to snag fish by their gills, kill porpoises. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of gill net fishermen have no idea how we'll support our families," 
said Don Tomlinson, who has fished off San Diego for 35 years. "This puts us 
out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said gill net fishermen, like loggers and miners, will have to adapt to 
changes wrought by the political process. He rejected claims that Proposition 
132, which became effective Jan. 1, was unconstitutional because of misleading 
claims made by its backers or because it conflicts with federal marine 
fisheries law. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say (Proposition 132) was the will of the people, the voice of democracy, 
is the same as saying a lynch mob is the will of the people, the voice of 
democracy," said attorney Peter Flournoy, representing the California 
Gillnetters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Goldenhersh, an attorney representing Allen and the San Francisco-based 
Earth Island Institute, said Jones' ruling should please "all Californians 
interested in protecting marine mammals (and) conserving the marine resources 
of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 132, which won by 55% to 45%, prohibits gill net fishing in a 
three-mile-wide zone from Mexico to Point Arguello off Santa Barbara. The 
initiative contains a onetime buyout plan for gill net fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and others contend that gill nets are "killing machines" that have 
trapped thousands of porpoises, dolphins, sea lions, sea otters and sea birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The gill netters say the environmentalists have confused them with the tuna 
seiners whose huge nets surround a school of surface-swimming tuna and 
sometimes catch other creatures. Gill nets are generally allowed to settle near 
the bottom of the ocean in pursuit of halibut, white sea bass, barracuda, 
yellowtail and other species.

2 FBI AGENTS FILE SUIT CHARGING SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY SUPERVISOR; COURT: WOMEN 
SAY SENIOR OFFICIALS RETALIATED AGAINST THEM AFTER THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THEIR 
SUPERIOR IN SANTA ANA OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two women FBI agents on Friday filed a civil rights lawsuit against the U.S. 
Department of Justice, alleging that they were fondled and taunted by a 
supervisor who heads the bureau's white-collar crime unit in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by veteran agents Boni Carr Alduenda, 40, and Heather 
Power-Anderson, 38, is believed to be the first sexual harassment case filed by 
women still working as agents. It follows recent discrimination lawsuits 
against the bureau by gays and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr Alduenda and Power-Anderson allege that they were retaliated against by 
senior FBI officials and targeted for misconduct investigations after they 
first complained in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising Agent John Carpenter, accused of harassing both women, said Friday 
that he was not aware of the lawsuit. He acknowledged an internal investigation 
into the harassment complaints filed against him, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deny everything," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials in Washington, Los Angeles and Santa Ana declined to comment, 
saying they do not discuss pending litigation. Bill Carter, a bureau spokesman 
in Washington, said the FBI "simply does not tolerate sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson has been a special agent since 1984, Carr Alduenda since 1988. 
They are assigned to the bureau's 65-agent Santa Ana field office, where 
Carpenter is a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana names Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
as the defendant. The agents allege that Carpenter taunted them at work, 
grabbing them and making lewd remarks for several months in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cruel irony that the department of the U.S. government vested with 
enforcing the civil rights of our citizens would officially sanction 
retaliation against its female agents in an effort to discourage these women 
from exercising their own rights," said Christopher B. Mears, an Irvine lawyer 
representing the agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson said Carpenter massaged her shoulders, and in one incident, 
kissed her at the back of the neck while she was sitting at her desk. Another 
time, she alleged, Carpenter tore her dress when he attempted to forcibly place 
his hand on her upper thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr Alduenda alleged that Carpenter constantly grabbed her and made lewd 
remarks, including commenting about the size of her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, she said that when she returned from maternity leave in 
September, 1992, Carpenter said to her: "Maternity has been good to you. Your 
breasts are really big. Are you breast-feeding? I wish I was your baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter has been an FBI agent for more than 20 years, according to the 
lawsuit. His wife, Cathy, also is an agent in a white-collar crimes unit in the 
Santa Ana office, though not in her husband's squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the alleged harassment occurred in the presence of other agents and 
employees, the women said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Carpenter once sneaked up behind Power-Anderson and 
placed his hands on her buttocks in the presence of Supervising Agent Linus 
Danilevicius and two other employees. She said Danilevicius didn't respond, but 
remarked, "It's five o'clock, time to go."  
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter allegedly replied, "Goddammit Linus, why did you tell her what time 
it is? If she didn't know she would have stayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The women said the harassment began in early 1992 and continued into October 
of that year, when they complained to James Donckels, agent-in-charge of the 
Santa Ana office.  
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter stopped sexually harassing them after they complained to Donckels, 
but then a new round of recriminations began, the women said in the lawsuit. 
The day after they talked to Donckels, the agents said, Carpenter wrote memos 
criticizing their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Donckels told Power-Anderson that he could not remove her from Carpenter's 
squad and that he could not tell her boss to stop his conduct, the lawsuit 
alleges. Donckels was out of his office Friday afternoon, but a department 
spokesman declined to comment on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Power-Anderson and Carr Alduenda said Donckels discouraged 
them from filing discrimination complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, but advised them to put their complaints in writing so 
that he could forward them to the Office of Professional Responsibility, an 
internal FBI unit that investigates administrative misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual harassment is not discrimination," the lawsuit quotes Donckels as 
saying. "It's administrative misconduct, so OPR takes care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mears, the women's lawyer, said Donckels had a responsibility to send the 
complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Office, not the internal unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only conceivable reason why this (was investigated) internally was to 
launch a retaliatory investigation designed to intimidate and embarrass these 
agents into dropping their complaints," Mears said. "The very nature of these 
gestures are so clearly sexual harassment, it's the only way that Donckels 
could have interpreted them." 
</P>
<P>
 A week after Donckels referred the matter to the internal unit, Power-Anderson 
and Carr Alduenda were interviewed by an OPR panel in Washington. At that 
inquiry, on Nov. 5, Power-Anderson asked why EEOC was not investigating her 
complaint.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Assistant FBI Director Joe Johnson, who holds the 
agency's third-highest rank, replied that "sexual harassment is misconduct, not 
an EEO matter. . . . If you want criminal, go to the D.A. but be prepared, 
they'll look into your character." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mears, a week after the two women were summoned to Washington, 
the same OPR panel came to Orange County, where they interviewed 51 agents and 
employees at a Brea hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, members of the OPR team told the two women that they were 
investigating counter-allegations made against them, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 On the orders of a senior FBI official in Los Angeles, Power-Anderson was 
eventually transferred out of Carpenter's white-collar crime squad in November, 
the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donckels warned her, "You may have gotten off the squad, but you're not 
moving your desk, and you're not reassigning your cases," according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women say they were mocked by some male colleagues, and the lawsuit 
states that in Power-Anderson's case, her work reviews dropped from 
"exceptional" or "superior" rankings before her complaints to "fully 
successful" afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said his clients have suffered stress, including "headaches, stomach and 
gynecological problems." They continue to work in the same office as Carpenter, 
despite their protests, Mears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-Anderson and Carr Alduenda broke the FBI's unspoken code of silence and 
understand the consequences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stand a high probability of being fired, but they are determined to 
assert their legal rights to keep their jobs," Mears said. "The FBI is making a 
big mistake because instead of being intimidated, these women should be 
honored. They embody the very values that all of us want to see in the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Mears said his clients are the first active agents to file a sexual harassment 
lawsuit against the bureau. He said the lawsuit names Reno as the sole 
defendant because she is the only official who can be sued under civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Carter said Friday that he is unaware of any similar actions by 
current agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Former agent Suzane Doucette filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Justice 
Department in September, alleging she was sexually harassed by the head of the 
FBI's Arizona office. She said she was dismissed last year after she pursued 
her complaint, and filed her case after leaving the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, agents calling themselves Special Agent Women Interested in Fair 
Treatment began mailing agents a newsletter about issues affecting women in the 
bureau. But the group's agents do not publicly identify themselves.

ROBERTI SEEKS STATE TREASURER'S JOB; ELECTIONS: ALSO ON LAST DAY TO FILE FOR 
STATE RACES, SAN FRANCISCO PROSECUTOR DROPS OUT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR ATTORNEY 
GENERAL'S POST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the last day to file for statewide races, state Sen. David A. Roberti 
formally unveiled his candidacy for state treasurer Friday, while San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith made the surprise announcement that he is dropping out 
of the race for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, who earlier had indicated that he might seek a seat on the 
lower-profile State Board of Equalization, said he opted for the treasurer's 
race because he felt that office could be transformed into a crime-fighting 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In press conferences in Van Nuys and Sacramento, Roberti reiterated the 
gun-control themes of the bruising San Fernando Valley recall campaign that has 
all but overshadowed Roberti's plans for his political future. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime legislator portrayed himself as a feisty underdog who refuses to 
give his recall opponents the satisfaction of seeing him pass up a run for 
statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall backers who are trying to get Roberti booted from his 20th District 
seat claim he is a soft-on-crime liberal, a carpetbagger who lives outside the 
district and that he failed to put a halt to Capitol corruption during his 
13-year reign as Senate president pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 But because gun-rights advocates are also among the recall's backers, the 
campaign to oust Roberti has become a referendum on the 1989 assault weapon ban 
he authored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say this to assault weapon extremists -- you will not stop me from 
becoming treasurer of California," an impassioned Roberti declared Friday. 
"Because the people of California want a treasurer committed to finding and 
deploying all the fiscal resources possible in the fight against violent 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected treasurer, Roberti said, he would work hard to protect California's 
coffers so more money would be available for crime-fighting programs. In 
addition, Roberti said he would ensure the state has enough funds to build the 
prisons needed as a result of the tough new "three strikes and you're out" 
sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti faces a formidable challenger in Sacramento developer Phil Angelides. 
Angelides, the former state Democratic Party chairman, has raised about $2 
million for his campaign, while Roberti has been forced to shift much of his 
general campaign money to the recall battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone GOP candidate for state treasurer is Board of Equalization member 
Matt Fong of Los Angeles, who charged earlier that Roberti is a career 
politician who is past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 In other statewide races, the biggest news to emerge Friday was Smith's early 
withdrawal from the contest for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who narrowly lost to Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren in 1990 and had 
resumed campaigning in recent weeks, said he was concerned that neither he nor 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), another Democratic candidate for 
attorney general, could unseat Lungren after an expensive primary battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negatives and the high cost incurred in a primary skirmish would only aid 
a sitting attorney general," Smith said, adding that he will now throw his 
support to Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Those filing for statewide office as reported by the secretary of state's 
office or by counties are: 
</P>
<P>
 Governor -- Republican Gov. Pete Wilson; Democrats, state Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden

EARLY RELEASE OF RAPIST SETS OFF DISPUTE; CAMPAIGN: WILSON BLAMES FAULTY 
SENTENCING AND LENIENT JUDGES. BUT RIVAL BROWN CHARGES THAT ADMINISTRATION 
ERRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday decried the imminent release of a Bay Area serial 
rapist after 12 years in prison and angrily denied an opponent's charge that 
bumbling by his Department of Corrections will allow the rapist to go free two 
years early. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, who is running for the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination, is trying to "con the public" and is irresponsibly 
seeking to play on voters' fears of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from the latest Democratic attempts to undercut Wilson's 
image as a tough-as-nails crime fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 With public concern about violent crime dovetailing neatly with Wilson's 
longtime advocacy of stricter sentencing laws, Wilson capitalized on the issue 
during his two-day tour earlier this week to officially open his reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic foes are trying to send a different message: Wilson may talk 
tough on crime, but he does not deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all of Wilson's tough election year rhetoric," Brown said Friday, "we 
are seeing once again that his actions on crime do not match his words." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, Brown's attack may have backfired and allowed Wilson, 
who is no stranger to using the crime issue for political gain, to turn the 
tables and accuse his opponent of exploitation. Wilson also seized the 
opportunity to remind voters that Brown's father and brother were governors 
known for appointing lenient judges to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the scheduled release of Melvin A. Carter, who confessed to raping 
more than 100 women over an 11-year period in Palo Alto, Berkeley and other Bay 
Area towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of 12 of the rapes in 1982, Carter was sentenced to 25 years in 
prison. He is eligible for release after serving just half his term because his 
sentence was reduced by credits for good behavior and for working while behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, relying on a newspaper account, alleged that the Department of 
Corrections could have prevented Carter's release from Soledad prison. She said 
neither Wilson nor the Department of Corrections knew of a sentencing mistake 
in Carter's case until contacted by a reporter days before the inmate was 
scheduled to go free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heads must roll," Brown said in a statement released by her office, urging 
Wilson to fire department officials responsible for what she said was 
incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson on Friday disclosed correspondence showing that prison officials 
more than a decade ago discovered what they contended was the sentencing error. 
Citing technical issues, they said the judge should have set Carter's term at 
29 years instead of 25, which would have kept him in prison for at least two 
more years. 
</P>
<P>
 The department tried several times to get judges to acknowledge the error and 
correct it. The final effort failed earlier this week when an Alameda County 
judge ruled that Carter's original sentence was correct and said there was 
nothing the state could do to stop his release. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charge is utterly false," Wilson said. "It is an outrageous attempt to 
deceive the public and to exploit the public's fear of violent crime. She is 
trying to con the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections' actions, he said, were "commendably diligent." 
</P>
<P>
 As Carter's inevitable release date approached, Wilson said, his office took 
extraordinary measures to obtain the strictest possible supervision of the 
inmate once he was paroled. The restrictions are to include electronic 
monitoring of Carter, state approval of his residence and polygraph tests every 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added: "This issue isn't one about the Department of Corrections. The 
issue is what kind of laws we have to deal with violent crime and what kind of 
judges we have sitting on the bench to apply those laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office in 1991, Wilson has repeatedly sought to lengthen prison 
terms for rapists and is now advocating life in prison without parole for 
first-time sex offenders. He has also tried to curtail the credit system that 
allows inmates to cut their terms in half, as Carter did. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposals have been blocked by Democrats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also noted that the late Superior Court Judge Martin Pulich could 
have sentenced Carter to up to 52 years in prison but was lenient because 
Carter cooperated with authorities after his arrest. Pulich was appointed to 
the bench by former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., Kathleen Brown's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Ms. Brown has raised the issue, it's time for her to come clean and 
level with the public," Wilson said. "Kathleen Brown, if you were governor, 
would you appoint trial judges like Martin Pulich? Or Supreme Court judges like 
Rose Bird, appointed by your brother, Jerry Brown?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown later released a statement repeating her allegations and attacking 
Wilson for ducking responsibility for Carter's release. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is classic Pete Wilson," she said. "He's blaming my father. He's blaming 
a judge who is no longer living. He's blaming the system. He's blaming everyone 
but himself -- and his Department of Corrections."

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FERRETS AS PETS TO GO BEFORE ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Assembly committee has approved a bill permitting ferrets to be kept as 
pets in California, which is one of only four states that prohibits the slinky, 
playful relative of a weasel. 
</P>
<P>
 A 7-2 vote sent the legislation (AB 2497) by Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith 
(R-Poway) from the Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee to the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 California has banned ferrets as pets since the 1930s. The state Department of 
Health Services opposed the measure, arguing that ferrets are dangerous to 
children and can escape from their owners and threaten wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal rights groups also opposed the measure, saying it could lead to another 
overpopulated pet group. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith replied that the ferret issue is "symbolic of the state's 
regulate-until-you-drop mentality." 
</P>

REP. HUNTER'S SELF-IMPOSED 50% PAY CUT TO END AFTER THIS SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after he was caught up in the House bank overdraft scandal in early 
1992, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) announced that he would turn back half of 
his congressional paycheck until the unemployment rate improved in his district 
by 2 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't.It got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 So having already donated $64,000 to the U.S. Treasury -- and facing the 
prospect of nearly $130,000 by the time his term is up -- Hunter on Friday 
announced that the self-imposed sacrifice will come to a halt at the end of 
this session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the half-pay diet "a real character-builder," Hunter said lots of 
other Americans are "having a tough time all over the country. This is no big 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 If he's reelected to an eighth term, Hunter says he'll "start fresh" and end 
his personal deficit-reduction program. Hunter had signaled earlier this year 
that he was thinking of revising the half-pay regimen but didn't confirm until 
Friday that the new arrangement would return his full salary to the family 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter admitted early in 1992 to 399 overdrafts at the House bank. Afterward, 
he flew home and toured his district, spreading the cursed checks on a card 
table at every stop. Several days later, to the apparent amazement of aides, he 
announced the half-pay penalty.

STATE DEMOCRATS INTRODUCE 6-BILL IMMIGRATION PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven California Democrats introduced a package of immigration-related bills 
Friday that would beef up the Border Patrol and require the federal government 
to reimburse states for the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted 
of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to more aggressive responses to illegal immigration, the 
legislation would not curtail emergency health or education benefits, or 
reverse laws granting citizenship to children of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the bills would accelerate the naturalization process, provide more 
education funds to help legal immigrants become U.S. citizens and create an 
independent review panel to investigate civil rights abuses by U.S. Customs and 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals break little new ground but represent a compromise that would 
appeal to Democrats with markedly different views on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The six bills were embraced both by immigrant rights advocate Rep. Xavier 
Becerra (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who 
has favored tougher measures.  
</P>
<P>
 The package does not include Beilenson's call for a tamper-resistant Social 
Security card. Nor was there any talk at the news conference about his advocacy 
of a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in 
the United States whose mothers are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Becerra would prefer to repeal some parts of the landmark 1986 
immigration reform bill that makes employers responsible for checking the 
citizenship of prospective workers. Instead, he is sponsoring a bill to expand 
the government's authority to investigate discrimination complaints over hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the rational way to approach the problem," said Becerra, who warned 
that "in this political year, all sorts of things are being said." 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent reference to an amendment sponsored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) that would have required school districts to report the 
cost of educating illegal immigrants, Becerra said: "None of our proposals make 
kids snitch on their parents." Rohrabacher's amendment failed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The six bills call for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Boosting the Border Patrol to 6,000 full-time officers, up from 3,500 
officers, and upgrading equipment and training, sponsored by Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring the federal government to reimburse states for the costs of 
incarcerating undocumented criminal immigrants, estimated at $18,000 per year 
per prisoner, sponsored by Becerra.  
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing delays in processing applications for naturalization and speeding 
up swearing in of new citizens, sponsored by Rep. Sam Farr (D-Carmel). 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing education and outreach services to legal residents seeking 
citizenship, sponsored by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 * Expanding federal authority to investigate hiring discrimination, sponsored 
by Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a review board to investigate civil rights abuses by federal 
agents, sponsored by Becerra.

COURT EXTENDS CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS TO FILIPINO VETERANS LACKING U.S. RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filipino World War II veterans seeking American citizenship can submit records 
from their homeland as sufficient proof of service, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals ruled this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, affirming a lower court ruling, extends naturalization rights to 
four elderly Filipinos whose records of war service on behalf of the United 
States are not on file at the Army personnel records center in St. Louis.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the broadly written appellate decision is likely to assist thousands 
of other veterans in the Philippines and the United States attempting to take 
advantage of a 1990 immigration law granting citizenship rights to all Filipino 
veterans of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling affirmed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has 
wrongly interpreted the 1990 law by restricting citizenship benefits only to 
those whose records of service can be found in Army records. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, according to trial testimony, accurate service rosters of 
guerrilla soldiers were not maintained because of fears that they would fall 
into the hands of occupying Japanese forces. Other records were lost or 
destroyed in a fire, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS argued that if substitute documents were deemed acceptable, cases of 
fraud could result. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS would have us believe that Congress intended to deny the benefits of 
naturalization to Philippine veterans who actually fought with U.S. soldiers, 
solely because records of their service are not to be found among the U.S. Army 
records in St. Louis," the 9th Circuit ruling states. "Congress has directed 
that citizenship be granted to Filipinos who are otherwise eligible and can 
prove their service with documents . . . including Philippine government 
records." 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt incorporated the 
armed services of the Philippines, then a U.S. colony, into the American 
military and pledged citizenship to Filipinos who took up arms against the 
Japanese. The 1990 law restored citizenship rights to veterans who were stymied 
when Roosevelt's pledge was rescinded in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was hailed Friday by officials of Filipino American veterans 
groups. "We showed loyalty in those days and should be rewarded," said Nazario 
Santos, World War II veterans coordinator for the United Filipino Veterans of 
America chapter in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadio Samia, a retired Filipino schoolteacher who has been denied 
citizenship because of the records hassle, said he has been "dreaming of this" 
for years. "I've prayed to God that this time would come," said Samia, 74. "I'm 
glad I've been able to survive this long." 
</P>
<P>
 Encino attorney Philip D. Abramowitz, who represented the four veterans, said 
he has more than 150 additional clients likely to be affected. "The language is 
pretty broad -- it says in all cases the INS must accept Philippine documents," 
Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Justice Department, which could appeal the case to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, did not return a call for comment.

THEIR FATHERS' GAME; ELDERS SAY LINGERING GOODBY TO FAMILIES' BOCCIE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three decades ago, a tiny community of Italian-Americans moved to Oxnard 
Shores. The 12 families built an apartment complex to live in and, next door, a 
boccie ball court to celebrate their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 The long gravel pit on a vacant lot was more than a luxury for the occupants 
of Villa Anacapa -- it was their social center. 
</P>
<P>
 For hours at a time, the husbands would play the game, which resembles lawn 
bowling. They would joke about each others' abilities, argue over points and 
sip wine. The wives made picnic lunches and kept an eye on the children. 
</P>
<P>
 A photograph from 1964, the year the 12-unit complex was completed, shows 22 
spouses crammed onto a stairway, happily hoisting wineglasses and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court isn't used much these days. The husbands and wives have aged. 
Some became ill, and several have died in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children -- perhaps eyeing the million-dollar beachfront homes 
springing up around the Driftwood Street apartments -- began pressuring the 
old-timers to sell the lot, said Nick Bucci, 87. 
</P>
<P>
 It came down to a vote, and the older generation lost, Bucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids don't have the sentimental attachment (to the court) that we have," 
he said. "It's kept us going all these years. The game is nothing but drinking 
wine and having fun. Not getting drunk, mind you, just having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the old-timers reluctantly stuck a For Sale sign on the parcel five 
months ago, they have not received any offers, said James Emanuel. That suits 
them just fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we sell it, we sell it," said Emanuel, at 70 the youngest of the original 
group. "If we don't, we don't. We're not in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 When they built Villa Anacapa on two lots 30 years ago, the group decided to 
ante up an extra $12,500 for a third lot to build the boccie ball court, Bucci 
said. Many of them were second-generation Italian Americans who learned the 
ancient Roman sport from their parents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They would roll colored wooden balls on the long, gravel court, scoring points 
for their skill at knocking opponents' balls away from a small, white ball 
while staying close to it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, weekends were centered on boccie ball tournaments, with 
friends invited up from Los Angeles, Bucci said. One summer, the group roasted 
a 250-pound pig in an underground pit on the vacant lot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took seven hours," he said. "We got in a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilda Bortolott remembers the many parties on the lot. And she recalls 
acquaintances questioning how long the real estate alliance would last. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always said we'd never get along," said Bortolott, 82, one of the 
original residents. "But we've never had an argument." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was never tempted to sell the lot, even as land values began 
skyrocketing in the 1980s, Bucci said. The boccie court gave them something to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was part of our lives," he said. "If we cashed it in, we would all be 
upstairs twiddling our thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 The court is used perhaps once a month now, only when their friends from Los 
Angeles come up for a visit, Emanuel said. It's hard to get an impromptu game 
going because so many of the older men have died, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chester died. Paul died. Fish is gone. Jesus, all good guys," Emanuel said, 
shaking his head. The children of the original residents use the apartments 
mostly as weekend retreats these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Boccie ball is still popular around the world, but their children weren't 
interested, Bucci said. They were busy with their own lives and families and 
didn't have time to play, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel and Bucci declined to give the names of the heirs who want to sell the 
lot, nor would he disclose the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want me to give their names," Emanuel said. "They don't want to be 
bothered, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the For Sale sign is up, the two men seem confident the lot will 
not sell any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at how small the phone numbers are," Emanuel said with a grin. "You 
can't even read them when you drive by."

ELECTIONS; POLITICAL HOPEFULS SCRAMBLE TO MEET THE DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The field of candidates running for local, state and federal offices 
representing Ventura County got a little more crowded Friday as political 
hopefuls scrambled to meet the deadline for filing nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 candidates filed papers for 11 different offices, including 
everything from county clerk to two congressional seats, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine candidates filed papers to run for two open seats on the Board of 
Supervisors, virtually guaranteeing a November runoff in both races, said Bruce 
Bradley, the county's chief elections official. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not looking at one election; you're looking at two if you want to go 
all the way," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible the number of supervisorial candidates could grow even more. 
Because Supervisors Maria VanderKolk and Vicky Howard are not seeking 
reelection, the deadline for candidates to file for the two seats has been 
extended until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three officeholders -- Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Sheriff Larry 
Carpenter and Tax Collector Hal Pittman -- won't have to worry about 
campaigning this year. All three are unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice not to have that distraction," Bradbury said. "But I don't take my 
job for granted. I love what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 In other local races, two candidates have filed papers to run for tax 
assessor, while two others will run for county clerk. And five people will 
compete in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested race for county 
auditor-controller, whose job is to oversee the county's $836-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowded field of candidates could also force a November runoff in the 
controller's race, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White and defense attorney James Farley will 
go head to head for an open seat on the Superior Court bench. Judge Edwin M. 
Osborne has retired and his seat will remain vacant until after the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty of raising money in a tough economy may have discouraged 
potential legislative and congressional candidates from competing in the June 7 
primary, Bradley said, noting that several candidates are unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a fairly quiet primary," he said. "There was a lot of 
talking early on (by potential candidates), but when it comes to putting your 
money down that's another thing . . . I think people are finding out that it 
costs too much to run for office." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 23rd Congressional District, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) is 
unchallenged in the Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Frank Stephenson, a college placement consultant from 
Ojai, and Kevin E. Ready, a Ventura resident and attorney for Santa Barbara 
County, will compete for their party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats cannot match Gallegly's name recognition or financial 
backing, Ready said they still hold an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "With an 8,000-vote margin of Democrats over Republicans in the district, it 
is the large independent vote that can ensure a Democratic victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Brown of Camarillo has filed papers to run as a Libertarian, and 
Robert Thomas Marton of Simi Valley will run as a Green Party candidate in the 
congressional race. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), whose 24th Congressional 
District includes Thousand Oaks and parts of western Los Angeles County, will 
face Scott Gauke, a resident of Sherman Oaks, in the Democratic primary in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Five candidates are competing for the Republican nomination. They are Mark 
Boos Benhard, an Agoura public relations consultant and one-time assistant to 
former Rep. William K. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton); Robert Kent Hammer, a Newbury 
Park banking consultant; Emery Shane, a commercial real estate investment 
broker from Oak Park; Richard Sybert of Woodland Hills, an attorney and former 
top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, and Sang Korman, a Calabasas resident who has run 
unsuccessfully for Congress three times. 
</P>
<P>
 All the candidates agree that the economy will be the No. 1 issue, noting that 
the district has been among the hardest hit by the recession. Shane said he 
decided to enter the race this week at the urging of business leaders 
throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of jobs" during the past few years, he said. "What I've been 
doing for the last decade is bringing jobs into the Conejo and San Fernando 
valleys. So I think I can help make contributions to businesses both small and 
large." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has no challengers for the 
Democratic nomination in the race to fill the seat being vacated by retiring 
state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). Hart's district includes Ventura, 
Santa Paula, Ojai and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates competing for the Republican nomination are Steve Decker, a 
Santa Barbara real estate investor, and Steve MacElvaine, a cattle rancher and 
former San Luis Obispo County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said the need for more jobs, less crime and improved education will be 
the primary issues in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running because I have the ability to raise money and because I believe 
Steve MacElvaine is not running an aggressive campaign," Decker said. "He 
continues to be an invisible candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said Decker didn't know what he was talking about. He said he has 
been campaigning since announcing his candidacy last April, often using his 
Cessna 182 to hop-scotch around the tri-county district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will all be decided in June," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Republican legislators going unchallenged in their primaries are 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), whose 38th District includes 
Fillmore and Simi Valley, and Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), whose 37th 
District encompasses most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Arce of Chatsworth, who may be the youngest legislative candidate in the 
state at age 18, and Simi Valley attorney David Allan Cocquyt will compete for 
the Democratic nomination in the 38th District. Both are political novices. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocquyt said he has worked for the past seven years on workers' compensation 
cases, representing injured workers. He believes he can add "some meaningful 
ideas to true reform of the system." He said he plans to spend less than $500 
on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's an uphill battle," he said. "But you never know. Anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Wilken of Northridge is running as a Green Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th District, Dorothy Maron, Takasugi's old nemesis on the Oxnard City 
Council, will be his Democratic challenger in November. Maron said she decided 
to jump into the race because she believes she can do a better job of "working 
for the little guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara winery owner Brooks Firestone is unchallenged in the Republican 
primary for the 35th Assembly District, which encompasses Ventura, Santa Paula, 
Ojai and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindy Lorenz of Summerland, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Green 
Party candidate in 1992, and Bob Ream of Santa Barbara, an aide to Sen. Hart, 
will compete for the Democratic nomination in June to challenge Firestone in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said her political experience and her ability to work her way up from 
being a single mother living on food stamps to earning a doctoral degree and a 
California State University teaching job more than qualifies her for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ream said his five years of working as an aide to Hart and helping to 
initiate legislation gives him an edge over his Democratic rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how the system works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Ventura County, voters will go to the polls to decide who will 
replace Supervisors VanderKolk and Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The five candidates competing for VanderKolk's 2nd District seat are City 
Councilman Frank Schillo, former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, 
taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings and attorney Trudi K. Loh, all of Thousand 
Oaks, and Carter J. Ward, a Malibu rancher. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme resident David Goodman dropped out of the race Friday, deciding 
instead to endorse Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The four candidates running for Howard's 4th-District seat are Simi Valley 
City Council members Judy Mikels and Barbara Williamson, Moorpark Councilman 
Scott Montgomery and Jim Meredith of Simi Valley, a longtime member of the 
Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tackling the county's continuing budget problems, the two new 
supervisors will be faced with the challenge of finding a new dump site to 
serve west county cities and dealing with increasing incidents of violent 
crimes, particularly in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough job," Schaefer said in announcing her candidacy recently. 
"There's not a lot of fun it."

OFFENDERS TO BE MONITORED ELECTRONICALLY; CORRECTIONS: SIX-MONTH PILOT PROGRAM 
WILL ONLY BE OPEN TO INDIVIDUALS CONSIDERED LOW SECURITY RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County corrections officials will soon begin using electronic 
bracelets to monitor a small group of offenders placed on house arrest for 
drunk driving and minor drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month pilot project will only be open to individuals who are 
considered low security risks and who have already completed half their 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the county's work-furlough program, bracelet-wearers will be allowed 
to go to a job or school, but if they leave home at other times a radio signal 
will alert probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to put anyone who is a risk to the community on (the 
program)," said Cal Remington, deputy director of the Corrections Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the state, counties have turned to electronic monitoring in recent 
years because of court orders to reduce jail overcrowding. It also is seen as a 
way to save money by reducing housing and supervision costs in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ventura County, the work-furlough program is running below capacity and 
a new jail under construction on Todd Road should relieve overcrowding when it 
opens next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, corrections officials in Ventura County say they view the 
bracelet program as an experiment rather than the solution to a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of in a nice position," Remington said. "We have the luxury of 
taking it slow, as opposed to trying to get a bunch of people out of jail 
because there's going to be a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clarke, a member of the project's oversight 
committee, said his colleagues are far from sold on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges reluctantly agreed to do it," he said. "No one agrees with the 
concept 'Commit a crime, go to your room.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be evaluated after six months, but it seems very unlikely to 
become a permanent option for offenders, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's space in work furlough, that's the preferred punishment," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program, involving up to 50 offenders, could begin as early as April 
11, said Don Krause, an administrator with the corrections agency. Only inmates 
already sentenced to work furlough and who volunteer for the program will be 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will cost about $33,500, which will cover equipment rental, 
clerical work, cellular phones and the leasing of cars used by probation 
officers for home visits. That figure does not include the salaries of 
probation officers who will check up on each offender several times a week at 
their residences and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 As with work furlough, offenders on house arrest will pay for part of the 
program. Corrections officials expect to recoup $3,000 to $10,000 over the six 
months from fees paid by offenders to enter the program. Individuals in work 
furlough now pay an average of $12 to $16 a day for the program, about the same 
amount they will be charged for the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 The house-arrest program relies on a bulky, tamper-proof bracelet worn around 
an offender's ankle. Every 30 seconds or so, a receiver installed in the 
offender's house sends a signal to the electronic bracelet. If the bracelet is 
out of range, an alarm is triggered and probation officers are notified of the 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to wearing the bracelets, individuals on house arrest must allow 
probation officers to search their homes at any time. Their families must 
promise to keep alcohol, drugs and weapons out of the house. And they must keep 
telephone conversations shorter than 10 minutes because the electronic signals 
are sent via phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking the rules can land an inmate back in work furlough or in County Jail, 
depending on the seriousness of the violation, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike inmates in County Jail, offenders on house arrest cannot be awarded 
"good time" and released early. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County -- where an average of 160 people are on home detention -- 
officials found that some inmates chose to stay in jail because of the "good 
time" credit and because they did not want to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Swearingen, a probation officer in Orange County, said that although home 
detention may seem a lighter punishment, it is more challenging for some 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways they're held more accountable," he said. "They have the 
temptations and they have to resist them."

VIOLENCE UP IN SMALLER COUNTY AREAS; CRIME: BUT 10.4% JUMP IN UNINCORPORATED 
REGIONS IS ABOUT HALF THE COUNTYWIDE AVERAGE. ASSAULTS ACCOUNT FOR BIGGEST 
RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Violent crime in the unincorporated areas of Ventura County rose 10.4% in 1993 
over the previous year, but the overall crime rate was about half the county 
average, according to figures released Friday by the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest increase occurred in aggravated assaults, which jumped nearly 23% 
from 171 in 1992 to 210 in 1993. The rise in assaults drove up the overall 
number of violent crimes, though homicides, rapes and robberies all fell 
slightly during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about the continued rise in violent crime," Undersheriff 
Richard Bryce said. "But at least in the unincorporated area, at this time, 
it's confined to aggravated assaults." 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 93,000 people live in small, unincorporated communities spread 
throughout the county. In the western half of Ventura County, the areas include 
Oak View, Mira Monte, Casitas Springs, El Rio and Piru. In the east county, Oak 
Park and Newbury Park account for much of the unincorporated population. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of serious crimes -- murders, rapes, felony assaults, 
burglaries, thefts and arsons -- committed in those areas last year rose from 
1,880 in 1992 to 2,006 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce said he did not know which unincorporated communities were hit the 
hardest by crime. The numbers have not been analyzed for such small areas, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the unincorporated areas recorded 21.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, a 
5% increase over the 1992 rate. That crime rate compared with a countywide 
average of 42.6 crimes per 1,000 residents in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crimes in the same communities rose 4% over 1992, with burglaries 
showing the biggest jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department has not yet released 1993 crime statistics for its 
five contract cities -- Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai and Thousand Oaks. 
Those figures are being reviewed by city officials and are expected to be out 
March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics already released by Oxnard, Ventura, Santa Paula, Simi Valley and 
Port Hueneme showed overall decreases in crime. In Santa Paula, however, 
violent crime surged to its highest level in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Joe Harwell, who is in charge of the sheriff's operations in the Ojai 
Valley, said he has not noticed any significant crime trends in Oak View, Mira 
Monte or Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ralph Wright, who manages his family's market in Nyeland Acres, said his 
neighborhood experienced an increase in violence last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's assaults and burglaries," he said. "Burglaries are a constant problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he had to fend off four attackers on Jan. 31, 1993, when he 
stepped outside his home and was attacked by people he believes were gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "My shoulder was dislocated when one of them took my left arm and put it way 
up behind me," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE CASITAS; CIVIL WAR BUFFS TO STAGE BATTLE 
RE-ENACTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks attorney Ed Mann will roll out his cannon again today as he and 
about 350 other Civil War buffs re-enact the war between the states at Lake 
Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, a member of the Richmond Howitzers unit of the Ft.Tejon Historical Assn. 
in Castaic, said this weekend's war games should be great entertainment for 
anyone attending. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather holds it should be perfect," he said. "We're usually cursed by 
geography with our brown hillsides, but I've seen the field and it's a perfect 
green making it much more like the East where the battles were fought." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of this weekends Civil War re-enactment are hoping a lot of people 
come out and see the two days of battle play. Both days will begin with a 
flag-raising ceremony and a parade of players in their Union and Confederate 
uniforms. The major battles are scheduled for noon, 2 and 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out here for their rehearsal about three weeks ago, and it's quite 
impressive. The ground shakes when those cannons fire," said Dick Wixon of Gold 
Coast Productions, which is organizing the event with the owners of Lake 
Casitas Park. 
</P>
<P>
 During breaks in the skirmishes, people can investigate both camps. Along with 
the guns from the Richmond Howitzers and authentic-looking muskets, visitors 
will be treated to cavalry charges by some of the riders at the event.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, this is good theater," Mann said. "There's also a whole fantasy 
aspect to the whole event. You're out there playing army and it's a lot of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The event runs from 10 a.m. to sundown. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE TO OPEN MONTALVO SUBSTATION 
</P>

<P>
 The Ventura Police Department will open its first community-based substation 
at the end of the month and staff it with two full-time officers, a department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montalvo Station will be set up in a storefront in the Bristol Center 
Shopping Plaza at 6368 Bristol Road.Owners of the shopping center donated the 
space rent-free to the department, Capt. Randy Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we've always wanted to do, but in the past it was 
cost-prohibitive," Adams said. "Now we have the involvement of the local 
community, donating their time to help in the policing of their own community." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the Montalvo area generates more calls for police service than any 
other area in the city of Ventura. He said similar community-based policing 
efforts in Oxnard have proven successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crime problem here," said Karlene Porter, manager of a Laundromat 
and dry cleaners in the shopping center. "It's good to know the police will be 
here and good to get the community involved with their area." 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront will be open a few hours each day, Adams said. The officers 
will very likely use the storefront as a staging point for community patrols, 
Adams said, and other officers not assigned to the area will be encouraged to 
drop by. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from the community are being encouraged to help out at the station. 
Also, Adams said a citizens patrol is being formed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does two things: It gets the officers out in the community and by 
working with local volunteers it encourages people to become involved," Adams 
said. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN GETS 43 YEARS FOR MOLESTING BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient whose soft-spoken, intelligent manner allowed him to befriend 
families in the Silver Strand Beach area and baby-sit children was sentenced 
Friday to 43 years in prison for molesting four young boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Before receiving his sentence, however, 25-year-old Kenji Richmond told 
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell that he did not realize 
he was harming the boys, ages 8 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my childhood I learned a great deal of this . . . " Richmond said, 
referring to abuse he says he suffered as a youngster. "I learned to view it as 
normal. I didn't know any other way because it happened to me so many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond, initially charged with 39 counts of felony child molestation, had 
pleaded guilty to 23 of the charges. On Friday, he told the judge that he 
entered the guilty plea to spare his victims from testifying, but denied 
molesting the children as many times as prosecutors claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela M. Henke-Dobroth asked Campbell to give Richmond the 
maximum -- 57 years. The prosecutor said she had earlier decided to ask for no 
more than 41 years, but changed her mind after hearing Richmond's court 
statement, which she considered unremorseful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line here is that Mr. Richmond is a clearly sick individual. He is 
a pedophile," Henke-Dobroth said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn asked the judge to show leniency and 
give Richmond a sentence of 19 years -- the middle term under state sentencing 
guidelines. He said his client had accepted responsibility for his deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year term includes five years tacked on because Richmond was on parole 
for a robbery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of one of Richmond's victims also addressed the court. She said she 
trusted Richmond and even did his laundry. Now, she told the judge, a long 
prison sentence was needed to aid her son's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only hope to tell my son that Kenji will be in jail until he is an old 
man," the mother said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; FUNDING FOR HOUSING PROJECT IS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore City Council members postponed committing city funds to build a 
low-income housing project this week while they waited to see if the city had 
enough money to first make earthquake repairs in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials said the proposed 60-unit development could be used to house 
people left homeless in the earthquake, council members said they did not want 
to pledge $400,000 to the project when downtown might need an infusion of city 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real concerned that we're taking a piecemeal approach," Councilman Roger 
Campbell told his colleagues at their Tuesday meeting. "If we take a little 
here, a little there, we may have a shortfall in the areas really important to 
this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, however, argued that Fillmore desperately needs 
low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a situation where, in the three years I've been on the council, we 
seem to always come up for a shortfall in low-income housing," said Councilman 
Don Gunderson. "This solves a long-existing problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to the project informally, but postponed committing 
funds at least until their next council meeting in two weeks. The move will 
give city staff time to present the council with a list of spending options.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; SMOKING ORDINANCE TO BE REWORKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After complaints from about a dozen angry speakers, the Camarillo City Council 
has voted unanimously to send a proposed anti-smoking ordinance back to a 
council committee for reworking. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of speakers Wednesday pleaded with the council to not adopt the 
ordinance, which was before the council on a second and final reading. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers said the proposed ordinance would put scores of small restaurants 
out of business, unfairly impact charitable bingo games and unfairly infringe 
upon the rights of smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members asked their own Legislative Committee to further study the 
proposed ordinance in terms of how it would impact restaurants and bar 
operations and charity bingo parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently written, the ordinance would restrict smoking in virtually every 
business accessible to the public except tobacco shops and some bars. Half of 
the rooms in hotels and motels will have to be reserved for nonsmokers. 
Cigarette vending machines will be allowed only if they are in places where 
they can be monitored and are away from access by minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocktail lounges will be exempted, but bars and lounges connected to 
restaurants will be forced to build a separate ventilation system. Bar owners 
would be given 10 months to make the ventilation changes. 
</P>
<P>
 A revised version of the ordinance is expected back before the council late 
next month. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY TO DEDICATE 6 BENCHES AT PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura will formally dedicate six park benches -- a gift from a 
Baja California civic organization -- at Hobert Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from the Tijuana-La Mesa chapter of Rotary International will 
attend the 12:30 p.m. dedication at the park at Telegraph Road and Petit 
Avenue.They will be joined by Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom, City Manager 
John Baker and members of the Ventura East chapter of Rotary International. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff have already installed the ornate aluminum benches on concrete pads 
at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Dulsa, a past president of Rotary's East Ventura chapter, said the gift 
by the Tijuana civic group continues a close relationship the two chapters have 
formed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Rotary's East Ventura chapter have donated farm equipment, medicine 
and medical equipment to residents of the Tijuana area, most recently after 
last year's devastating floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very touching gift," Dulsa said of the benches. "It's a way for their 
members to thank the people in Ventura who have been willing to help others."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 50 PARAKEETS ARE STOLEN FROM AVIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives on Friday were investigating the theft of 50 parakeets 
from a Camarillo aviary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Smith discovered the loss of his parakeets about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday when 
he arrived to feed them at his property in the 4800 block of Pleasant Valley 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith found a large opening cut in the chain-link fence surrounding his 
property. The birds had been flying free inside of an 8-by-8-foot aviary, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody wanted to sell some birds and make some bucks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides nabbing the yellow, blue, green and white birds, the thieves took eggs 
from nesting boxes and threw them on the ground. A dozen baby parakeets were 
left in a cage, but they died from lack of nourishment before being found. Four 
others are barely alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sin," said Smith, 55, who bought the birds about a year ago as a hobby 
and source of income when he retires. Smith also raises orchids in a green 
house on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said investigators have no suspects. Light 
footprints from a sneaker were found, along with some tire tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who lives in Ventura, said it was the second time he has been 
burglarized. Last March, someone stole $20,000 worth of tools from his 
Camarillo property. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have anything nice anymore," he said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN THEFTS FROM BANKS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man who used fake identification and credit cards to withdraw 
$17,800 from seven banks in Ventura County pleaded guilty Friday and faces 
nearly three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 David Jeffrey Wilkinson of West Hollywood is scheduled to be sentenced by 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to the nine most serious charges contained in the 40-count 
complaint against him, said Deputy Dist. Atty. William R. Redmond.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson admitted to four counts of commercial burglary, three counts of 
grand theft and two counts of fraudulent use of an access card, the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson withdrew money from six Bank of A. Levy branches between Thousand 
Oaks and Ventura and one Bank of America branch in Camarillo, Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County East Valley Division sheriff's investigators were able to link 
him to the thefts after he was arrested in a similar case in Santa Barbara 
County, according to Redmond, who said the stolen ID and credit cards 
originated in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was unaware whether Wilkinson is involved in a credit-card ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson remained in custody at the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $25,000 
bail. He faces up to 30 months in prison. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: THOUSAND OAKS; WALK TO RAISE FUNDS FOR AREA CHARITIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 400 people are expected to hit Conejo Valley streets Sunday to take part 
in a 10-kilometer walk to raise money for local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16th annual CROP walk, sponsored by the national nonprofit group Church 
World Services (formerly called CROP), is expected to raise about 
$30,000.Twenty-five percent of the money will go to five local charities that 
serve the hungry in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder will go to Church World Service charities, said Casey Howell, a 
regional director of the Pasadena-based group. The charity holds about 50 walks 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 15 years, the Thousand Oaks walk has raised nearly $380,000. 
Locally, the money has gone to Westlake Village Meals on Wheels, Conejo Valley 
Meals on Wheels, Catholic Charities of Ventura County, Lutheran Social 
Services, and MANNA, a Conejo Valley food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been involved with this walk for as long as I've been here," said 
Pauline Saterbo, administrator for MANNA. "With the money they've raised, we've 
been able to buy toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, canned goods and powdered 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a wonderful thing, because it comes from the heart," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walkers will traverse the loop around the city, starting at Cal Lutheran 
University Stadium. The walkers raise money by getting sponsors and collecting 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk will begin at 1:30 p.m. Sunday. For more information, contact Howell 
at (818) 449-2714. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: CONEJO VALLEY; PICNIC TO KICK OFF FESTIVAL IS SALVAGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers have put together a scaled-down replacement for the traditional 
Conejo Valley Days kick-off picnic, which was canceled this week because of 
financial cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller event, also a family picnic, will be held on the same date and 
time as the planned kick-off.Unlike the giant picnic, the March 20 event will 
not feature sales of beer or commercial items, which will slash the cost of 
security and insurance, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will just be a good, old-fashioned family picnic," said Bob Rickards, 
chairman of the grand marshal competition, who organized the replacement event. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the Conejo Valley Days organizing committee Thursday night, 
community leaders opened their wallets and offered their labor to keep the 
picnic from disappearing altogether, Rickards said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $800 was raised to rent the pavilion at Conejo Creek Park North and to 
provide entertainment at the event, which will last from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
Rickards said. Service clubs have agreed to barbecue chicken and steak with 
proceeds going to the festival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, service clubs selling food were allowed to keep all but 5% of 
the proceeds, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased and I'm very proud of the way people responded to this," 
Rickards said. "They came up with the money in about five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be split by this year's two grand marshal contestants, who 
compete to raise the most funds for Conejo Valley Days so they can win the 
honor of presiding over the festival. BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FUNDING SOUGHT FOR QUAKE COUNSELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County mental health officials are seeking an additional $1 million in 
federal money to provide counseling for residents still trying to cope with the 
aftermath of January's devastating earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the mental health department will ask the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to extend for 60 days a grant that went into effect 
immediately after the Jan. 17 quake, said Bob Benedetto, disaster coordinator 
for the mental health department. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health officials for the county and the American Red Cross are 
continuing to counsel individuals affected by the quake, and have treated 1,291 
people in Ventura County, said Jane Cazavelan, Red Cross mental health 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "That might have been a reassuring 20 minutes or two to three hours," she 
said, adding that some earthquake victims are able to recover with little 
counseling, but others can carry the emotional stress for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the mental health department plans to apply for an additional 
nine-month grant that would provide long-term counseling services for displaced 
residents, Benedetto said. Mental health officials have not determined how much 
money they will ask for, but Benedetto said it would be "substantial."  
</P>
<P>
 "We will be going for the nine-month because of the severity of this 
disaster," Benedetto said. "I think we're only touching the surface now." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedetto said the magnitude of the disaster and the continuing aftershocks 
have made recovery difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding that people are still in shock, they're still trying to get 
over the fact they have lost their homes, their jobs," Benedetto said. "They're 
still feeling . . . that the worst is not over with yet." TRACY WILSON

HIGHER-RENT DISTRICT; MALL EXPANSION WOULD BRING NEW STORES BUT SOME OTHERS 
MIGHT LEAVE 
</P>

 Joseph Dennison remembers the day 33 years ago when he stood with 10 other 
Thousand Oaks businessmen for the ribbon-cutting of the Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 11, I'm the only one still here," the barber shop owner said Friday. 
"And pretty soon, I'll be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison is moving from the mall in a few months because if expansion plans -- 
scheduled to be heard by the Planning Commission on Monday -- are approved, 
higher rents will make it too tough to stay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennison, like many who visit the mall regularly, said he looks forward to 
the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, this place needs a face lift," he said. "If I owned the mall I'd do 
the same thing."  
</P>
<P>
 If the expansion proposal is approved by the Planning Commission and the City 
Council, mall owner Bill Janss will make major improvements to the aging 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-million expansion would bring in a dozen new businesses, including 
major chains such as Mervyn's, Blockbuster Video and Barnes & Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to attract more business in the evening, Janss said he has signed 
agreements with Mann Theaters and several restaurants to move to the shopping 
center near the corner of Moorpark Road and Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're creating a whole new mall," Janss said from his Santa Monica office 
Friday. "But we're keeping the outdoor feel and the historic flavor of the mall 
that has been there for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will debate several items on Janss' expansion wish 
list, including two buildings that exceed city height limits, eight 
free-standing signs that do not meet city code, and on-building signs that 
exceed size limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Janss said he expects only moderate opposition to the plan because of 
community interest in refurbishing the mall, which is the oldest in the Conejo 
Valley and predates the city's incorporation by three years, according to city 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a general interest in this project because of the mall's place 
in this community's history," said Janss, who introduced the plan in two public 
gatherings last year. "By and large, the public has offered us a lot of 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 At the mall Friday, several frequent visitors said they favored the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't come soon enough," said Gladys Canto, who eats lunch almost every 
day at a picnic table in one of the mall's many outdoor walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not concerned about the height," she said. "It can't possibly get bigger 
than that Civic Arts Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Some operators of smaller businesses, however, said they were dismayed by 
plans to double rents after the expansion is complete. Several stores have 
already left the facility, and when the rents climb, they say, others will 
surely follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like this location, but if we have to pay too much to stay here it will 
kill us," said Tom Vlachos, owner of Conejo Camera and Video. "There's only so 
much we can take." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison said the mall had no choice but to bring in chain stores with name 
recognition because of competition from The Oaks mall nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger stores, led by Mervyn's, will pay for about $15 million in 
additions, while Janss will cover about $35 million of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plans are approved, Janss said, construction will begin in June and be 
completed by the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning commissioners were not available for comment because they were 
attending a seminar in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing on the expansion proposal will be held Monday in City Hall 
at 7:30 p.m.

THOUSAND OAKS CENTER WILL FOSTER ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION; BUSINESS: AIDED BY 
GTE, THE 'CLUSTER' WILL OFFER LOW-COST RENTAL SPACE TO ENTREPRENEURS ADDRESSING 
POLLUTION, RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND OTHER NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California's first nonprofit center designed to nurture entrepreneurs 
with bright ideas but bare wallets will open in Thousand Oaks this summer, 
clustering a dozen start-up firms with environmental bents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by a hefty donation from GTE California, the center will offer 
low-cost rental space to business people who may be trying to develop 
pollution-free cars, write save-the-Earth software or build jungle gyms out of 
recycled plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs working out of their homes or struggling to pay for office space 
will be able to expand their operations by moving into the center, also known 
as a business cluster or incubator, said Jim Robbins, a consultant who has 
designed a similar center in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit cluster will offer not only desks and phones but fax machines, 
reference materials and consultants ready to help solve the problems of 
starting a business. 
</P>
<P>
 All that sounds great to Glenn Morris, who well remembers his nerve-wracking 
struggle to create a company to recycle used automotive filters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of stumbling at the beginning, especially with financial 
matters," Morris said. "And cheaper overhead sure would have been nice, since 
everyone who's just starting out watches their pennies. It would be very 
beneficial to start-up firms to have some hand-holding." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris managed to survive his rocky launch five years ago and now employs five 
people in his firm, called Impactor Environmental Products. Such success 
stories have prompted Thousand Oaks City Council members to back the 
environmental cluster, which they hope will nourish small firms and eventually 
bring jobs to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old days when large companies determined where people lived and work are 
passe," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "Now, growth and innovation are coming from 
small- and medium-sized firms. We're trying to establish an entrepreneurial 
culture right here in Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 The cluster, scheduled to open in July, will rely primarily on donated cash 
and services. Already, GTE has offered the use of an empty 10,000-square-foot 
building for two years, a donation worth an estimated $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 To help furnish the building, the Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will 
consider allocating $15,000 in federal block-grant funds and loaning surplus 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about this one," Zeanah said. "The future growth companies are 
the ones that start today." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the business incubator opens in the office on Lombard Street, 
organizers will set up an advisory board that includes city officials, business 
and environmental representatives and members of the Center for the New West, a 
nonprofit group that will run the cluster. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory board will screen potential tenants, looking for the start-up 
firms with the best growth potential or the largest projected impact on the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 From scientists developing electric buses to consultants working on 
ground-water cleanup, any entrepreneur with environmental ideas can apply. By 
clustering related -- but not directly competitive -- firms together, 
organizers hope to encourage networking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may share customer lists or get together to jointly bid on projects," 
Robbins said. "A synergy develops because the cluster has a focus. And 
customers approach them, too, because the cluster is well-defined." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks resident Donna Jamesson hopes to be among the 15 entrepreneurs 
creating incubator synergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's never studied accounting or finance, Jamesson plans to found a 
company to build playgrounds from recycled materials. So far, she has piles of 
sketches, lots of dreams -- and no clue how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a loner in this," Jamesson said. "I'm looking for 
assistance. I have an idea for something unique and different and it's a matter 
of getting people to help me."

JUDGE REJECTS SUIT SEEKING TO ALLOW GILL-NET USE; RULING: DISMISSAL IN SUPERIOR 
COURT UPHOLDS 1990 INITIATIVE OUTLAWING THE PRACTICE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
COASTAL WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Friday dismissed a lawsuit that would have allowed 
Ventura County gill-net fishermen to resume using the nets. 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissal in San Diego County Superior Court upholds the 1990 initiative 
that bans gill nets in Southern California coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of the 60 or so Ventura-based gill-netters attended the packed 
hearing in San Diego, said Hank Hubble, a local gill-net fisherman who has not 
fished since the ban took effect in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of the guys thought we might win," he said. "I knew there wasn't much 
of a chance though, and actually I'm kind of glad it's over. Now I can try to 
figure out what to do next." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), the ban initiative's major sponsor, 
called the ruling by Superior Court Judge Arthur W. Jones a victory for the 
coastal environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so delighted that it's over," she said. "We can finally start to 
concentrate on enforcing the ban and protecting our marine resources." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California voters passed Proposition 132 banning the use of coastal 
gill nets, which are anchored to the ocean floor and stretched out like 
volleyball nets for several thousand feet. The fishermen target halibut, white 
sea bass, barracuda, yellowtail and other species.  
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the ban argued that the nets indiscriminately killed marine 
mammals, such as dolphins and sea lions. They termed the gill nets "killing 
machines," saying the nets also killed many species of fish that could not be 
used and so were thrown away.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Goldenhersh, attorney representing the sponsors of the ban and the San 
Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, said the ruling should please "all 
Californians interested in protecting marine mammals (and) conserving the 
marine resources of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen have said the campaign waged against the small gill net industry 
unfairly associated their work with large tuna seine and gill-net fisheries 
that have wreaked havoc on deep water fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit to overturn the ban, they contended that the campaign was 
misleading. One of the more dramatic television commercials in support of 
Proposition 132 showed a tuna seiner snaring porpoises, the gill netters noted 
in their suit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Judge Jones ruled that both sides had ample time during the political 
campaign to put forth evidence and challenge the other side's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of justice is it when the judge won't even hear the case," said 
Brian Jennison of the Ventura County Fishermen's Assn. "They used guilt by 
association, taking footage from Third World countries' tuna fishing fleets and 
showing them on the television ad campaigns. That's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Flournoy, the attorney representing the California Gillnetters' Assn. 
said he may file an appeal.

JOSE S. RODRIGUEZ; MOORPARK RESIDENT, 102 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lifelong Moorpark resident Jose S. Rodriguez, 102, died early Friday at home 
after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Rodriguez, one of Rodriguez's nine children, described her father as a 
religious man who spent the last 20 or 25 years of his life in retirement, 
gardening, chatting with neighbors and reading his Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always a very religious man, always reading his Bible," she said. 
"Whenever there was time he would sit in the rocking chair that he had and just 
read and read until he finally fell asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez had worked as a yard maintenance employee at Strathearn Ranch until 
his retirement, and his daughter said he continued to enjoy working outdoors 
around his house in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would just kind of stay here at home, outside, doing little odds and ends, 
and sometimes he would meet with the neighbors and talk for a couple of minutes 
about what each one was doing on their own," she said. "He was very active, he 
always wanted to get moving, get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Rodriguez said her father's secret to long life was simple. "He never 
let himself go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the family is still struggling to come to terms with the death, 
having lost their mother years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a mother and father to us, let me put it that way," she said. "We're 
feeling his death so much. My dad was a very friendly, wonderful person, with a 
lot of dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements are being handled by the Pierce Brothers Griffin Mortuary in 
Thousand Oaks.

DUCKS BREAK THE ICE, BUT LOSE AGAIN; HOCKEY: BLACKHAWKS GET A 3-2 VICTORY AS 
ANAHEIM'S PLAYOFF DREAMS SLIP AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The goal of the game, after all, is to score goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks finally managed to put a puck in the net Friday night -- 
ending a scoreless streak of 200 minutes 26 seconds over five games, three of 
them shutout losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other goal of the game -- scoring more goals than the other team -- 
continued to elude them in a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in front of 
17,174 Friday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 'If we get shut out, 3-0, or lose, 3-2, we still lost the game," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "But the bottom line is we took a step this time by scoring a 
couple of goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks remain eight points behind San Jose for the final Western Conference 
playoff spot with 14 games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistically, it probably is slipping away, but we haven't been thinking 
about it too much," Bob Corkum said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were the first team to be shut out three games in a row since the 
1988 Minnesota North Stars. And though the NHL record is eight, league 
statisticians were having a difficult time determining exactly when a team was 
last shut out four games in a row. The Ducks managed to avoid making it 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were already behind, 1-0, with Chicago on a power play when Corkum 
stepped in and picked off Jeremy Roenick's weak cross-ice pass from near the 
left point. Corkum was off on a breakaway -- and to end up without a goal again 
would have been devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corkum faked Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour with his head and shoulders, 
stick-handled, pulled up and tucked the puck inside the right post at 12:03 of 
the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a sigh of relief," said Corkum, who scored both Duck goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal ended Belfour's streak without giving up a goal at 143:25. He shut 
out the Ducks in a neutral-site game at Phoenix on Tuesday and did the same to 
the Kings at the Forum on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his (hard) shot, Ed Belfour probably didn't expect that," Wilson said. 
"The move he made, I've only seen a couple of guys do. He stopped, faked and 
went to his forehand. That requires a lot of skill." 
</P>
<P>
 From the crowd's reaction, it seemed as if the Ducks had never scored before. 
The celebration went on for minutes, and wasn't that different from the one 
back on opening night when Sean Hill scored the first goal in franchise 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Chicago power play had ended, the Ducks got another golden 
opportunity, with Joe Sacco out on another breakaway, but his shot went wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Sacco may have missed on what would have been the turning point," Wilson 
said. "Joe made a great move and the puck bounced over his stick. He had Ed 
Belfour dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Jeremy Roenick broke a 2-2 tie at 16:43 of the second when he was 
found room to wind up from the top of the right circle, beating Guy Hebert for 
his 36th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeremy Roenick rose above everybody else with some big hits and a beautiful 
goal," Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Michel Goulet had given the Blackhawks the early lead at 5:28 of the first, 
and Patrick Poulin made it 2-1 when he deflected Chris Chelios' slap shot at 
17:16 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corkum, having broken the ice, scored again from low in the right circle 
off a pass from Peter Douris, tying the score at 7:55 with his team-leading 
22nd goal.

NOT A GREAT TIME; KINGS' STRUGGLES AND OFF-ICE BAD NEWS TAKE AWAY FROM THE 
MOMENT AS GRETZKY CLOSES IN ON HOWE'S RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The year was 1978. The league was the World Hockey Assn. The team was the 
Indianapolis Racers. The opponent was the New England Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side, playing for New England, was Gordie Howe, the grand old man of 
the game. On the other side, playing for Indianapolis, was the game's rising 
young phenom, 17-year-old Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky was awe-struck. There was his boyhood hero, Howe, in the flesh across 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe knew all about Gretzky as well, having befriended Gretzky before he was a 
teen-ager, when he as already creating a sensation across Canada with his 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 As they warmed up that day in 1978, Howe winked at Gretzky and tapped him on 
the shin pads with his stick as they passed on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky could barely contain his delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the game began. 
</P>
<P>
 On Gretzky's third shift in his second game as a pro, mentor and prodigy met 
in battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe was carrying the puck down the ice when Gretzky stepped in, stole it and 
began skating the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Gretzky felt a tremendous crack across his thumb, causing him to 
drop his stick. It was Howe, wielding his own stick like a whip. 
</P>
<P>
 Stickless, Gretzky watched helplessly as Howe regained control of the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ever embarrass me on the ice," Howe told Gretzky as he took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrass? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 Surpass? Any day now. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing 15 years, the kid has become an even bigger legend than the 
hero he so longed to emulate, the man who played for 26 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the greatest hockey record of all, Howe's 801 goals, is a hat trick 
away for Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Hank Aaron about to overtake Babe Ruth, Walter Payton on the heels of 
Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 These should be the greatest of times for the Great One. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have been anything but great for Gretzky, who has seen: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His hero, Howe, embarrass him by refusing to be part of Gretzky's march to 
hockey immortality. Howe maintains that his true goal record is 975, which 
would include Howe's six seasons in the WHA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His friend and business partner, actor John Candy, die March 4 of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His team, Stanley Cup finalists a year ago, stuck behind an expansion club 
and a third-year team in a humiliating fight merely to get into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His owner and close friend, Bruce McNall, come under financial scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His home badly damaged by the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His mother-in-law, Jean Jones, the nanny for his three children, wind up in 
a hospital where she has been for the last seven weeks, recovering from a 
broken collarbone and an injured leg, all the result of a traffic accident.  
</P>
<P>
 -- His father, Walter, prevented from being as big a part of Wayne's life as 
he once was by a ruptured brain aneurysm suffered 2 1/2 years ago. Walter is 
slowly recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Gretzky has skated relentlessly toward the record. With 33 
goals this year, he will take the ice tonight at the Forum to face the Buffalo 
Sabres with 798 as he nears the end of his 15th NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky has tried to maintain his focus and his enthusiasm at reaching the 
record in the face of all the adversity and the pressure and the controversy, 
but it hasn't been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," said his wife, Janet. "At such an exciting time in his life, 
there is so much trouble with everybody around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for him to jump up and down. What's the record mean when he looks 
at John Candy's wife and kids? He would have loved to have gotten four goals 
the other night for John Candy (Wednesday, the day of Candy's funeral)." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet said her husband's admiration for Howe remains as bright as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps telling himself that Gordie and Colleen (Howe's wife) are good 
people, nice people," she said. "Wayne puts them on a pedestal. He hopes they 
are part of (the record-breaking event). It wouldn't be the same if they 
weren't, but he knows they are entitled to feel the way they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Gordie has done so much for our sport that the last thing I'm going to 
do is to get into a controversy with Gordie Howe," Gretzky said. "I have too 
much respect for Gordie. To this day, I still look at him the same as I did 
when I was 8 or 9 years old. If that's the way Gordie Howe feels, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if the National Hockey League wants to put a separate record in the books 
for professional goals, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky knows his father will be there for the record-breaker, but he says 
it's not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be here when I get to 800 and 801," Gretzky said. "But I know my 
father. He would have been there at 796, 797, and that's where I missed him the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gretzky is still not strong enough to make every trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing really well. He's really come along," Wayne said. "Hey, it's hard. 
He's come so far. Everything happens for a reason. His living habits (are 
better). He hasn't smoked in three years, he rests more, he doesn't worry as 
much and he'll probably live 20 years longer because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the personal anguish, Gretzky has had his excitement over his record 
run tempered by his team's miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that such a great moment in his career is such a low time 
for the Kings," Janet said. "It's put a big damper on the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine the pressure? (Reporters) keep asking, 'What about the 
record?' And he keeps saying, 'Wait, guys, what about the playoffs?' How can he 
be excited when he carries the weight of the team on his shoulders? Wayne is 
Wayne. He cares very much. He's having a hard time with the losing, more than 
I've ever seen him have in his career." Magic Markers

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF; WILTON, CALIF., WOMAN BRAVES WAR-TORN EASTERN EUROPE TO 
RECOVER HER TROTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe, they refer to Judy Hannah as "that persistent American 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, attorney Chris Bardis says of Hannah: "You've got to 
tip your hat to her." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the story of the lady and her horse, a story with a happy ending now that 
Thadrow, once the 3-year-old trotter of the year in California, is back home at 
Judy and Marvin Hannah's small farm, getting ready to race again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spotted a horse trailer the other day," Judy Hannah said. "He acted like 
he didn't like the looks of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thadrow, now an 8-year-old, has every cause to feel road-weary. He is one of 
the most traveled horses in harness history. Through a sale that went sour when 
an $83,000 check proved worthless, he wound up in the former Yugoslav 
federation, racing and being bred to broodmares, while Judy Hannah spent three 
years trying to recover him. Her struggles with international red tape took her 
to Eastern Europe four times, traveling from city to city and jurisdiction to 
jurisdiction. She waged her own private war while a full-fledged war raged 
around her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to have tunnel vision when I was there," Hannah said. "But you 
couldn't miss the tanks. It was pretty scary, with the tanks rolling down the 
streets. If they had ever closed the borders, I was worried that I might wind 
up living there." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hannah and Thadrow came away unscathed, the horse finally taking a 
circuitous route that ended at the Hannahs' farm in Wilton, Calif., 35 miles 
south of Sacramento, on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "He arrived at 8:30 in the morning," Hannah said. "We had a party for him. He 
had lost about 150 pounds since I had last seen him, but they had taken good 
care of him. He knew he was home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hannahs bred Thadrow, matching up the stallion Thadius Hanover with the 
broodmare Beeeee Rowdy. In his first three years of racing, at Los Alamitos and 
the Cal Expo in Sacramento, the colt raced 56 times, winning 16, finishing 
second or third in 25 starts and earning $179,845. 
</P>
<P>
 In February of 1991, shortly before the Los Alamitos season was scheduled to 
open, Cedomir Mihaglovic, an executive with Minolta in Eastern Europe, put 
together an $83,000 package for Thadrow and Cuban Starlet and Little Sur, two 
horses owned by Bardis. The Hannahs were supposed to receive $50,000 of the 
amount for Thadrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thadrow was special to us," Judy Hannah said. "But Marvin had cancer and had 
undergone gall bladder surgery the year before, and we could have used the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Mihaglovic had been in Southern California the year before, buying horses, so 
the Hannahs trusted him and the three horses were exchanged before his 
certified check, written on a bank in Vienna, reached their bank in San 
Francisco. Two months after the sale, with the horses on their way, the Hannahs 
were told by their bank that Mihaglovic's check was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hannahs filed charges in Orange County against Mihaglovic, contacted 
Interpol and Judy Hannah spoke to the horse dealer on the phone a few times. 
"All I got was false promises," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, she received a call from Fritz Haug, a trainer in Vienna. He was 
racing a horse there and said that Thadrow and Little Sur were entered in the 
same race. In a matter of days, Hannah, who works full time as a bookkeeper 
besides tending to the family farm, contacted Austrian authorities and was on a 
plane to Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police were at the track, waiting to arrest Mihaglovic and claim the 
horses, but because of the war in the former Yugoslavia federation, neither the 
man nor the horses were able to get to Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent three days there," Hannah said. "Most of it in the police station." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the racing program in Vienna, Thadrow had raced seven times, with 
two victories and two thirds, since leaving the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Minolta said that they had fired Mihaglovic. Around Christmas of 
1992, Judy Hannah traveled to Eastern Europe for a court hearing involving 
Mihaglovic. He was a no-show, and his trainer appeared to say that he was also 
owed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Desomer, a Belgian driver-trainer who works in California, introduced 
Hannah to an interpreter, and she stayed 11 days, getting videotapes of some of 
Thadrow's races and learning that he had been bred to at least 25 mares. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were coming out of the woodwork, wanting to buy this horse if I could 
get my hands on him," Hannah said. "But their best price was $4,500." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hannah got her passport several years ago, she had intended to visit her 
daughter, who then lived in Japan. Now Hannah was getting all these other 
stamps on the document, and last February she was on a plane again, this time 
headed for Budapest in Hungary. She was there three days, still searching for 
Thadrow, and this time she spent most of her time at the Hippodrome racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her last trip in November, a nine-day stay that resulted in Budapest 
racing authorities conceding that Thadrow was her horse. She had hired Bruno de 
Berdt, an international horse shipper from Acton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had shipped the horses over there for Mihaglovic originally," de Berdt 
said. "I only got about 80% of my money." 
</P>
<P>
 After blood tests for Thadrow cleared, he was shipped to Budapest. Then he 
took a three-day truck ride to Amsterdam. From there, he was flown on Dec. 8 to 
New York, where federal officials were wary of allowing him into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no proof that he had left Yugoslavia, where everything was in 
disarray," de Berdt said. "But finally what documentation we did have was 
convincing enough." 
</P>
<P>
 There were only a few other horses scheduled to make coast-to-coast trips, so 
to save the Hannahs several thousand dollars, Thadrow was vanned instead of 
flown West. He arrived at the Hannahs' farm as a fitting early Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Bardis has written off his part of the deal, a loss of $33,000, and knows he 
will never see his two horses again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't as fortunate," Bardis said. "Since my horses weren't as valuable as 
Thadrow, and knowing what I know about international law, it would have been 
pointless to pursue my end." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Hannah is working again, helping Desomer at the barn at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when Thad will start racing again," Judy Hannah said. "It'd be 
nice if he was able to make it for the opener at the Cal Expo, in late April. 
But whatever we do, we won't be racing him in claiming races. That's for sure."

THIS SALMON IS PLAIN GOOD; ANGEL OUTFIELDER STAYS TRUE TO HIS ROOTS DESPITE 
SIGNING BIGGEST SECOND-YEAR CONTRACT AFTER BEING ROOKIE OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The camera crews were waiting outside the Angel offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters were gathered. Talk-show hosts were standing by their telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon, the 1993 American League rookie of the year, would 
soon be receiving the most lucrative contract of any second-year player in 
baseball history, guaranteeing $7.5 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set for a publicity bonanza. The Angels not only were changing 
their penurious image, but upstaging the Dodgers in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stroke of genius, and the Angels were going to capitalize on it. 
Everyone was going to gather for photographs. The Autrys, the front office, 
agent Ted Updike, Salmon . . . uh, Salmon? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, anybody seen Salmon? 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon was 30 miles away, at his home in Phoenix. He had politely excused 
himself 2 1/2 hours before completion of the contract negotiations, saying he 
needed to take care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
 What could possibly have been so urgent? 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon had to mow his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to sit around all day," Salmon said. "I had a lawn to mow. I 
figured my agent could handle everything without me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, no publicity shots. No press conference. No national exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels make a little history and a neighborhood in north-central Phoenix 
has a freshly mowed lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hours before Salmon even had a chance to tell his wife, Marci, the 
details. If she had known, she could have planned a gourmet dinner in an 
expensive restaurant overlooking the city, celebrating their new financial 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with Salmon bringing it up as casually as if he were reminding her to 
pick up some milk, there was no time for a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The new millionaires sat around the dinner table, said grace, and ate 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of Timothy James Salmon, who chooses obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of guys who play this game just so they can have that 
spotlight," Angel center fielder Chad Curtis said. "Well, Tim has it, and would 
just as soon it go away." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who last November was unaware of the American League 
rookie-of-the-year announcement. When he was named unanimous winner of the 
award, Salmon was vacationing in Hawaii, unable to return for a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who was not even the most publicized rookie on his own team last 
season, taking a back seat to J.T. Snow, and loving every minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who undoubtedly will be overshadowed by Bo Jackson this season, 
and his biggest fear is making sure he doesn't somehow annoy Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to hear his football stories, but I don't want to pester him," 
Salmon said. "He gets hounded by so many people, I don't want to abuse my 
privilege of playing with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon may be a star -- he is on the cover of this year's Angel media guide -- 
but he considers himself nothing more than a small-town kid lucky to be playing 
with his idols. 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would he make sure he got autographed baseballs last season from 
Nolan Ryan, an autographed bat from George Brett, and still kicks himself for 
not getting an autograph from Robin Yount? 
</P>
<P>
 Or why else would he feel embarrassed when people occasionally recognize him 
away from the ballpark, asking for his autograph? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I just don't think of myself as famous," he said. "I don't get 
embarrassed by a kid walking up to me, but by the commotion it creates." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who was shuttled between divorced parents while growing up, makes it 
quite clear that baseball must stand in the on-deck circle while he attends to 
family responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He could easily have equaled his $127,500 rookie salary this winter with 
promotions and card shows, but shunned all but three events. His only national 
endorsement was a brand of baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my agent gets frustrated with me, but I say, 'Ted, how much do I 
need?' " Salmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to use baseball to promote my afterlife. For some guys, this is 
all a show, but that's not me. I don't want to be in the spotlight. I don't 
want my face all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in the future that will change, but I don't want to get caught up in 
things. This is a very humbling game. I don't want to be caught up in meeting 
all these people, and two years down the road if I'm struggling, I'm looking 
for all my so-called friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, 25, can't guarantee that he will be able to hit .283 with 31 home runs 
and 95 runs batted in every season, but he can predict that his personality 
will never change. He's not planning to buy anything extravagant with his new 
wealth, except maybe new tires for the family van. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that they know money won't be a problem, he and Marci are planning to 
give their 9-month-old daughter plenty of playmates. They want to have four 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Step into Salmon's house and you wouldn't even know that he's a baseball 
player. He still has all of the plaques and trophies, but they're stored away 
in an office, where no one else can see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want people to walk in my house and tell them, 'Hey, look at what 
I've done,' " Salmon said. "That's a conceited attitude. I feel awkward even 
having the things in my house, but the question is, 'What do you do with the 
stuff?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if these were football awards, it might be a different story. He still 
has a great passion for football, and tells his younger brother, Mike -- who 
played four years at USC -- that he lived Tim's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 If Salmon had received a football scholarship coming out of Greenway High in 
Phoenix, he would have traded his glove, bat and spikes for shoulder pads, 
helmet and cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was left to vicariously share Mike's football exploits, attending 
every game he could, wanting to jump onto the field himself to catch that 
touchdown pass against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember standing on the sidelines, high-fiving everyone and yelling out, 
'We're going to the Rose Bowl! We're going to the Rose Bowl!' " Salmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it didn't happen, I was devastated. I was depressed for three or four 
days. It got so bad that my brother ended up comforting me. " 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, still brooding over USC's loss to the Bruins, perhaps was playing a 
bit too aggressively a few days later on Thanksgiving morning in his church 
flag-football league. He was rushing the quarterback, spun off the offensive 
lineman, only to slam into another body. His nose began bleeding profusely. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until a few days later that he realized his nose was broken. Of 
course, his pain threshold never has been a problem. In Salmon's first two 
years of professional baseball, he was beaned twice, suffering a broken jaw, a 
broken nose and a mouthful of broken teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon shrugged off the injuries, just as he has all of life's obstacles. He 
refuses to allow distractions to interfere with his ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the All-Star break last season, one national publication omitted him as the 
leading candidate for rookie of the year. The Angels telephoned the newspaper 
for an explanation and immediately stepped up their public-relations effort, 
making sure that the world knew about Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 And Salmon? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was panicking, but I didn't care," he said. "I told them all I can 
do is play the game, and if it's not good enough, no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tim Mead, the assistant general manager who was the media relations 
director last season: "That's the truth. Tim really didn't care about it. He 
was more upset with the team's performance than his own honors. We were two 
games out, and he was worried about closing the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's Tim. There's not flamboyancy, extra pizazz to his personality, 
nothing. He just wants to play baseball the way it should be played." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon indeed is a throwback to the days when baseball was only a game, except 
for one slight difference, says Angel Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never that disciplined," Rodgers said. "This guy is disciplined off 
the field, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salmon: "I know people are going to have tremendous expectations of me, 
and will expect me to act different because of the money. But it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some guys, this is a show and they're on stage. Well, that's not me. I'm 
not going to showboat around the bases, show anyone up, or get people to 
perceive me differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is me, like it or not."

TIM BROWN SIGNS WITH BRONCOS; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDERS HAVE A WEEK TO MATCH 
FOUR-YEAR, $11-MILLION, NO-TRADE OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offer made. Offer accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider wide receiver Tim Brown, a restricted free agent, signed an offer sheet 
with the Denver Broncos Friday that will pay him $11 million over the next four 
years.The contract includes a no-trade clause and a signing bonus that is just 
under $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's up to the Raiders. They can either match the offer and keep Brown, a 
six-year veteran coming off his best season, or pass on the opportunity, giving 
Denver the biggest catch of the free-agent season thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are parts of this contract," said Steve Ortmayer, the Raiders' director 
of football operations, "that are difficult, almost obnoxious, I would say. But 
Al (owner Al Davis) is out of town and we won't start reviewing it until early 
next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have until 1 p.m. Friday to announce their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time this week a Raider receiver accepted another offer. 
Earlier, tight end Ethan Horton, an unrestricted free agent, agreed to a 
two-year, $2.5-million deal with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That move was not unexpected," Ortmayer said. "But we are in control of what 
we choose to do and we chose to go with younger players in regard to Ethan." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught 80 passes for 1,180 yards last season, both career highs. He also 
scored seven touchdowns as a receiver and had another touchdown on a punt 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens is fine," Bronco Coach Wade Phillips said, "because it 
still helps us. It's a win-win deal. We made a blockbuster offer to a guy we 
may get. If we don't, we force them into a situation that will hurt them."

GOLF ROUNDUP; DALY FALLS FOUR SHOTS BEHIND THE LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly slipped four shots off the pace as a couple of non-winners went into 
the lead Friday at the halfway point of the Honda Classic at Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Dougherty, 46, had seven birdies in a six-under-par 65 to share the 36-hole 
lead with Brandel Chamblee at 135, seven under. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamblee, a member of the inaugural Ben Hogan Tour in 1990, shot 68 in the 
gusty winds and, like Dougherty, said he is trying to put out of his mind the 
possibility of scoring his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, playing his first tournament after a four-month suspension, had to rally 
for a round of 70 and remained in a highly credentialed international pack in 
close pursuit of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them were 1993 player of the year Nick Price of Zimbabwe, two-time 
U.S. Open winner Curtis Strange, Bruce Lietzke and Masters title-holder 
Bernhard Langer of Germany.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN DALLAS, SHOWTIME MEANS THE MOVIE IS ABOUT TO START

 Before Dallas Maverick rookie Jamal Mashburn left Kentucky to play in the NBA, 
he read Magic Johnson's biography, especially the part about the wild parties, 
the women throwing themselves at the players, the adoring throngs of fans at 
every stop. 
</P>
<P>
 When none of those things happened to him, Mashburn asked veteran Fat Lever 
why life in the NBA wasn't what Magic said it was. Lever told Brad Townsend of 
the Dallas Morning News what he said to the rookie: 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'This isn't L.A. And we're the Mavericks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What school holds the record for the most consecutive NCAA 
championships in one sport? 
</P>
<P>
 Turnabout: In his 1990 autobiography, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar took pride in the 
fact that he refused to wear high-top shoes. Detroit columnist Joe Falls notes 
that Kareem now appears in Reebok commercials endorsing high-tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Don King? West Virginia and Nebraska, the only college football teams 
that went undefeated in the regular season last year, both want to play in the 
1994 Kickoff Classic, a season-opening game at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N. J. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem -- no one has offered to sign them up. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Woody: Archie Griffin, who won the Heisman Trophy twice while playing 
for Woody Hayes at Ohio State, says his old mentor didn't know anything about 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woody thought uppers were dentures," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a memory: Joe Carter's World Series-winning home run continues to pop up 
on TV screens and radio talk shows, but not around the Toronto Blue Jays' 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cito (Gaston, the club's manager) has let us know it is time to turn the 
page," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 American dream: Cuba's Jesse Ravelo won a Pan American Games gold medal for 
boxing in Canada in 1967, listened to the Cuban national anthem, then walked 
away. But when Ravelo left his country at age 16, he did not leave boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 He boxed until 1983, but he also started coaching in the U.S. Army in 1978 and 
last year became head coach of the Army team that won seven gold medals and 
four silver medals at the military championships. 
</P>
<P>
 It pays to win: According to the Amateur Athletic Foundation's SportsLetter, 
when the Anaheim Bullfrogs won the inaugural Roller Hockey International 
season, it raised the team's weekly player salary from $314 a skater to $880. 
</P>
<P>
 Macho Julio: Ron Borges of the Boston Globe says one of the reasons for Julio 
Cesar Chavez's loss to Frankie Randall "is that he has grown so pampered he 
pays an aide just to remove his socks."

 Trivia answer: Arkansas, with 10 in a row in men's indoor track.

 Quotebook: Basketball analyst Dick Vitale: "When you mention the top players 
in the country, you've got Purdue's Glenn Robinson, Duke's Grant Hill, 
California's Jason Kidd and UConn's Donyell Marshall. And then there's a big 
drop-off in talent." SHAV GLICK

REPEAT BID BY LONG BEACH ENDS AS PACIFIC PULLS OFF UPSET, 87-74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State's hopes of winning a second consecutive Big West Conference 
basketball tournament championship ended Friday as Pacific pulled away in the 
second half for an 87-74 quarterfinal upset at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped third-seeded Long Beach to 17-10, and convinced Coach Seth 
Greenberg that the 49ers won't be invited to the NCAA tournament on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no chance of going," he said, "But we have a chance at the NIT. I 
think a USC-Long Beach State game would be a great matchup. I would be 
disappointed if we didn't get a chance to play (in the NIT)." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Terrell scored 20 points and T.J. Walker added 19 as sixth-seeded 
Pacific (17-13) ended a three-game losing streak and advanced to the semifinals 
to play 10th-seeded UC Irvine, a 78-68 winner over second-seeded Utah State. 
Pacific beat Irvine, 73-71 and 88-79, during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach trailed Pacific, 63-61, with 6:22 to play, but two layups by Walker 
keyed a 9-0 Pacific run in the next 3:28. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Hannibal led Long Beach with 18 points. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / BIG WEST TOURNAMENT; IRVINE FINDS ITSELF IN UNLIKELY SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine, presented with another postseason opportunity for redemption after 
a regular season of disappointment and dismay, seized the day again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who stumbled, staggered and succumbed en route to a last-place 
finish in the Big West, earned a spot in the conference tournament semifinals 
with a 78-68 victory over second-seeded Utah State in the Thomas & Mack Center. 
Irvine (9-19) will meet Pacific (17-13) tonight at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine trailed by 11 points with 17 1/2 minutes to play, but rallied behind 
the outside shooting of guard Chris Brown and an inspired defense that forced 
22 Utah State turnovers. The junior guard scored Irvine's first 13 points of 
the second half -- including three three-pointers in the first 6 1/2 minutes -- 
and 19 of his 26 points after the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 20 years in this game, I've been around some good shooters, but no one, 
hands down, shoots the ball like Chris day in and day out," Irvine Coach Rod 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has built his program around a belly-to-belly man-to-man defense, but 
the Anteaters employed nothing but zone in the second half. They held 7-footer 
Nate Wickizer to four points in the game and guard Corwin Woodard, who had 24 
in the first half, to seven in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the kind of coach who refuses to give the other team credit," Utah 
State Coach Larry Eustachy said. "And I can't help but feel happy for Rod 
because they've had more than their share of adversity. And there's no doubt 
the tougher team won today." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior point guard Lloyd Mumford managed to rally his teammates from a 38-30 
halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting in there at halftime thinking about the possibility of this 
being my last game," Mumford said, "and I looked at the faces of my teammates 
and saw that they were depending on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who scored 26 points and had seven assists, responded by making a 
driving layup and five of six free throws in the final 1:04 as Irvine turned a 
four-point advantage into a runaway victory with help from Eustachy, who drew 
his second technical of the game with eight seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Irvine locker room was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy, but you can see in the guys' eyes that we're thinking about the 
future," Mumford said. "We've come together as a team and we're doing things we 
haven't done in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State 66, Nevada 67 -- Johnny Selvie's dunk with 23 seconds left 
gave the top-seeded Aggies (21-7) the victory in overtime. The Aggies will play 
the winner of Nevada Las Vegas-San Jose State in the semifinals at tonight.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NATIONAL ROUNDUP; LONGSHOT PAYS OFF FOR SETON HALL IN 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone who could shoot was covered, so Seton Hall got the ball and its 
season to someone who can't shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 John Leahy is the first to admit that he might not be the best last-shot 
option for the Pirates, but they had no other option with 4.1 seconds to play 
in overtime Friday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy took a pass from Arturas Karnishovas and hit his only three-pointer in 
the game to give Seton Hall an 81-80 victory over 13th-ranked Syracuse in the 
quarterfinal round of the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arturas passed the ball to me, and there was no one there so I let it go," 
Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one there because Karnishovas had drawn all the attention, as 
befits a player who had already scored 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The again, maybe Karnishovas paid attention in math class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shooting 25% on three-pointers," Leahy said. "I missed my first three. I 
made the last one. The law of averages was with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Pirates (17-11) into today's semifinals against 
Georgetown, an 81-58 winner over Boston College.

</P>
<P>
 Virginia 69, Maryland 63 -- Harold Deane scored 10 of his career-high 22

<P>
 No. 10 Kentucky 95, Mississippi State 76 -- Tony Delk hit five of the 
Wildcats' 12 three-pointers and scored 29 points to lead Kentucky (24-6) past 
the Bulldogs (18-10) and set up a rematch of last year's semifinal between the 
Wildcats and Arkansas.

LAKER COACH PFUND IS GIVEN ONE-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Randy Pfund and the Lakers have signed a one-year contract extension, it 
was announced Friday, a move he realizes guarantees financial security through 
1995-96 but not job security. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jerry Buss approached Pfund after last season and said he wanted to talk 
about adding a year to the contract, then reiterated that during training camp 
by saying he wanted to have Pfund around "in some capacity."But after 
discussing the reassignment provision, the sides agreed to a standard 
coaching-only deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means something to me personally," Pfund said. "I've been in the 
organization. I was hired to be head coach. Without going overboard on it and 
trying to pin too much too it, because I'm a realistic person, I think it 
showed there is some confidence in our management in what I've tried to do the 
last year and a half. I think you can leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something else happens at another point in time and they have interest in 
me doing something else within the organization, that would be another 
arrangement." SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

NBA ROUNDUP; RODMAN BUMPS, GRINDS, IS EJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Antonio's Dennis Rodman wasn't around to see Seattle guard Gary Payton 
make a game-winning 18-foot jump shot with 1.2 seconds to play to give the 
SuperSonics a 100-99 victory at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Rodman had mixed it up with a Seattle player under the basket, gotten 
his second technical foul of the game and departed in the fourth quarter in 
what has become something of a ritual, embellished Friday with a topless 
performance to a standing ovation as he walked off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his second ejection in as many games and fifth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Rodman and I) had a little conversation in the first quarter when he and 
Gary had that little thing," Seattle Coach George Karl said about two earlier 
technicals. "He said one of us is going to get thrown (out). I told him it 
didn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl was around at the end, with a play in mind to get the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The play didn't work, but Payton did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Detlef (Schrempf) were supposed to go on a pick-and-roll, just to try 
and make something happen," said Payton, who was falling out of bounds as he 
took the shot. "Detlef didn't have a chance, so I saw the alley and I just 
tried to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to get to the basket, but the ball went off my foot. 
When it bounced up, I just picked it up, squared up and shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Payton's heroics gave Seattle its eighth victory in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 97, Minnesota 91 -- Alonzo Mourning, playing alongside Larry Johnson 
for the first time since December, had 20 points and 14 rebounds at Minneapolis 
as the Hornets sent the Timberwolves to their seventh consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, sidelined for 31 games because of a sprained lower back, had 10 
points and four rebounds in 17 minutes, all in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 98, Cleveland 96 -- Joe Dumars, averaging 34.5 points in his last four 
games, had 31 points and 11 assists to lead the Pistons at home, where they 
ended the Cavaliers' winning streak at 11 games and won their second in a row 
for the first time since December. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 112, Philadephia 105 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 28 points and grabbed 
21 rebounds at Orlando as the Magic extended the 76ers' losing streak to 15 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 122, Miami 107 -- Cedric Ceballos had 28 points and 12 rebounds and 
sparked a key second-quarter run at Miami. 
</P>

 New York 90, Boston 83 -- Patrick Ewing scored 28 points and Hubert Davis had 
a career-high 25, including five three-pointers, at Boston as the Knicks ran 
their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 100, Denver 93 -- Brent Price made a three-pointer with 1:18 to 
play to snap a 91-91 tie, send the Bullets to victory and give the Nuggets a 
winless three-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 108, Chicago 77 -- Kevin Willis had 23 points and 15 rebounds at 
Atlanta as the Hawks ended a two-game losing streak and stretched their Central 
Division lead to four games over the Bulls.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STRAWBERRY HAS A GOOD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 It has been a long time since Darryl Strawberry came off the field and 
received congratulations from his teammates. But he spent a game doing that 
Friday when he threw out a runner at home, stole a base and knocked in the 
winning run in the 10th inning of the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Baltimore 
Orioles at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, Strawberry caught a fly ball to medium-deep left field 
and threw out Cal Ripken Jr., who was trying to score from third. Strawberry 
went two for five, scored the tying run and beat out a potential double-play 
ball in the 10th inning to score Raul Mondesi for the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his most successful performance in more than a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is successful?" Strawberry smiled. "Each day I play, I show more and 
more signs of my old type of play. But I get more excited about stealing bases 
than anything, because if I can do that, then everything else will take care of 
itself. I had such trouble running the last couple of seasons because of my 
back, the fact that I can run again is the best sign of all." 
</P>
<P>
 Through six games, Strawberry has yet to hit a home run, but he says he's not 
worried. "This is not a spring training where I can just get into shape. I need 
the work, that's the key. There are a lot of muscles that have not been used. I 
have truly missed a lot of baseball, and it is taking a lot of hard work to get 
back, but I feel very encouraged being in the middle of the things again, and 
things will get better."

 Delino DeShields was fitted with a protective mask and is scheduled to play in 
a B game Sunday to adjust to wearing the plastic mask, which is designed to 
protect his broken cheekbone until it heals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to L.A., I'm leaving the mask here," said DeShields, who has been 
sidelined for 10 days. "I can't stand being out of the lineup unless it's an 
off day, then it's OK. It's tough sitting around. I've been doing everything 
but playing, but they want me to wear the mask in case I slide or make contact. 
And I do slide headfirst a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who was hit by a bat two days before the first exhibition game, 
said that he and shortstop Jose Offerman are already comfortable playing 
together. "The more we work together the better it will be, but I feel I can go 
out and play with him in my sleep," DeShields said. "You (reporters) are making 
a big deal of playing with Jose -- he's a major league player." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields says his only problem now is trying to keep his 18-month old son, 
Delino Jr., away from him. "I'm always smacking him around and playing with 
him, and he doesn't know I've had an operation," DeShields said. "Other than 
that, everything is lovely." 
</P>

 Offerman returned to Los Angeles to be with his fiance, Alexis Rivera, who 
gave birth to their daughter, Joseanne. He is expected to return to Vero Beach 
Sunday. . . . Kevin Gross, who is trying to build his arm up slowly from 
tendinitis, pitched in a minor league game and gave up four runs and six hits 
in three innings. . . . Carlos Hernandez, who had arthroscopic surgery on his 
right shoulder, said he is about a week away from catching in a game. . . . 
Cory Snyder, who pulled a muscle in his right side, is taking live batting 
practice but is not 100%. He has not played in a game yet. MARYANN HUDSON

 The light bulbs on the scoreboard revealed yet another Angel defeat Friday 
afternoon, but Manager Buck Rodgers popped out of the dugout as if Ed McMahon 
just announced his name as a lottery winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you believe this is the best day we had in camp?" said Rodgers, 
ignoring the Seattle Mariners' 13-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spring in which the Angels have been desperately looking for anyone to 
emerge as fourth and fifth starters in their rotation, two finally jumped into 
the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Russ Springer, in perhaps his best performance since joining the 
Angels, yielded one hit and struck out six in four innings of the morning B 
game against the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, starter John Dopson yielded two hits and struck out six in the 
A game against the Mariners at the Peoria Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a bonus, starter Joe Magrane pitched off the mound for the first time 
since undergoing arthroscopic surgery last month on his left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you forget about the scoreboard, this has been the best day of spring," 
Rodgers said. "It's the best I've ever seen Russ Springer. It was just a huge 
outing for him. And Dopson threw the best I've seen in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was relegated to the B game as punishment, Rodgers said, letting him 
know the organization hardly has been pleased with his performance. Springer 
responded by facing the minimum 12 batters, allowing only two balls out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one bad outing on a rainy day, and one good outing on a good day," 
Springer said, "so neither is going to make me or break me. All I can do is 
pitch. To tell you the truth, I don't even know who's in the running for this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just how bad has the Angel pitching staff been this spring? 
</P>
<P>
 They have given up 75 runs, 112 hits, 29 doubles, six triples and 13 homers in 
eight games -- for a 9.40 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition is hitting .364, with at least 11 hits in every game. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Bo Jackson's grand slam in the eighth inning of their Cactus League 
opener against Colorado, the Angels (1-7) would be winless. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Dwight Smith will sing the national anthem on Thursday against the 
Chicago Cubs, his former team. "I'm looking forward to it already," he said. . 
. . The Angels optioned six players to their minor league camp: pitchers Troy 
Percival, Ron Watson, John Fritz and Bob Gamez, and catchers Fausto Tejero and 
Jose Monzon. . . . Bo Jackson continues his impressive spring, going two for 
four and raising his batting average to .421. . . . Angel left-hander Craig 
Lefferts gave up six hits, six earned runs and two homers in two-thirds of an 
inning, endangering his job security. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BOXING; LONG BEACH'S WILLIAMS DEFENDS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One heavyweight compares himself to Muhammad Ali. The other used to be 
compared to Mike Tyson. And the winner might find himself fighting Riddick 
Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare match-up of young, undefeated heavyweights, Larry Donald of 
Cincinnati and Jeremy Williams of Long Beach will box here today at the MGM 
Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 The bout will be televised by ABC -- the first network boxing broadcast this 
year -- and is for Williams' World Boxing Council Continental Americas title. 
But there might be much more at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald, who has a 12-0 record with 10 knockouts, has already decided what his 
destiny is in the heavyweight division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am the greatest thing since Muhammad Ali," he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Williams, 15-0 with 12 knockouts, is managed by Bill Cayton, 
Tyson's former manager, and until this year was trained by Kevin Rooney, 
Tyson's former trainer. ABC latched onto Tyson early in his career, televising 
a series of his fights, and is believed to be similarly interested in Williams, 
who is now being trained by his father, Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Muhammad Ali is great to emulate, but you've got to try to be yourself 
first," Jeremy Williams said, with Donald sitting four feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Donald traveled together on amateur tours back when Williams was 
a 175-pound light-heavyweight. The 6-foot-2 Williams weighed in at 210 pounds. 
Donald, a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, is 6-3 1/2 and will fight at 
227. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams has struggled at times against veteran fighters, he has 
scored eight of his 12 knockouts in the second round or earlier. One of 
Williams' most impressive victories was a second-round technical knockout of 
1992 Olympic medalist Danell Nicholson in an earlier match-up of young, 
undefeated heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't any more big names out there, as far as young fighters, that I 
could fight and make a name for myself," said Williams, whose older brother, 
Jason, is fighting on the undercard.

 Zack Padilla, a nonstop puncher in quest of a big-money match with Pernell 
Whitaker, is the headliner tonight in the refurbished Olympic Auditorium's 
second boxing show.  
</P>

 Padilla (19-1-1) boxes Tulsa journeyman Dwayne Swift (41-16) in a 
10-rounder.The card's first bout begins at 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azusa light-welterweight has been a sensation since launching his 1991 
comeback. After a four-year layoff, Padilla, 30, has won 12 in a row, including 
upsets of former world champion Roger Mayweather and previously unbeaten Carlos 
Gonzalez.  
</P>

SAILING; LAW LEADS CONGRESSIONAL CUP

<P>
 Britain's Chris Law ranks 11th on the Omega World Match Racing circuit, but he 
will move up significantly if he sails reasonably well the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Law leads the 30th Congressional Cup at Long Beach with 11 victories, two more 
than San Diego's Peter Isler, with six races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play all the good guys yet, so it's by no means over," Law said.  
</P>
<P>
 Barney Flam has seen to that. Flam's progressive computer seeding for the host 
Long Beach Yacht Club is refigured daily to keep the contenders away from each 
other as long as possible. Law received a late invitation when John Bertrand of 
Newport Beach dropped out a month ago. He scrambled to collect his five-man 
crew, starting with Flam's son, Steve. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Flam had sailed the circuit and has sailed in 12 Congressional Cups 
since he was 14, so he was a natural choice for tactician. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mahaney, the 1992 Olympic Soling silver medalist, is third at 8-4, 
followed by defending champion Rod Davis and Roy Heiner of the Netherlands at 
7-5.

FLORIDA DERBY; CROLL WILL TAKE FATE BY THE HORNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Aug. 13, Rachel Carpenter had her daily midday pool game with a member of 
the household staff at her palatial home on Fire Island, overlooking the sound 
off Long Island, N.Y., then went to her hairdresser's. By 2 a.m. on Aug. 14, 
the 78-year-old A&P heiress was dead, a victim of complications of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 a.m. on Aug. 14, Jimmy Croll, who had introduced Carpenter to racing and 
had trained her horses for 37 years, learned of her death. Croll was hours away 
from running one of Carpenter's horses, Holy Bull, in his maiden race at 
Monmouth Park. Carpenter's lawyer and Croll decided to go ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both thought it would have been what she would have wanted," Croll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull had drawn the rail in a field of nine 2-year-olds going 5 1/2 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was the death trap, so I told the jockey (Luis Rivera) to send 
him (to the lead)," Croll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull never trailed and won by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:03 4/5. Croll, only 
three years younger than Carpenter, stood in the winner's circle with a hollow 
feeling, unaware that in two days he would be told that he was the new owner of 
Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, survived only by a daughter who had no interest in racing, left 
Croll the eight horses they had in training. 
</P>
<P>
 "How valuable were they?" Croll said this week at Gulfstream Park. "Well, Holy 
Bull had been insured for $25,000. There was a filly insured for $50,000 -- she 
was the topper. All eight of them came to less than $200,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull won all four of his races as a 2-year-old and defeated Dehere, the 
eventual division champion, the only time they raced -- albeit on an off track. 
This year, the streak reached five before Holy Bull finally lost, but he is 
still the second choice, at 4-1, at Gulfstream today in the $500,000 Florida 
Derby, one of the major preps for the Kentucky Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 If Holy Bull wins the 1 1/8-mile test, his value will soar into the $1-million 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already had a lot of good offers for him," Croll said. "If I were 20 
years younger, I'd sell him. But I'm not, and the whole family is having fun 
with this horse. I'm a horse lover. I love to race horses." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Croll was training for Leon Levy, the CBS executive, as well as 
for Carpenter. Croll and Carpenter were racing only one horse together at the 
time. Levy didn't want to share Croll with other owners, so he gave the trainer 
an ultimatum to drop Carpenter. Croll refused and about six months later, Levy 
withdrew the ultimatum, keeping his horses with Croll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make it sound like I'm bragging, but maybe I inherited these 
horses because of my loyalty," Croll said. "I know I had heard about 20 years 
ago that Mrs. Carpenter said something about leaving me her horses, but there 
wasn't another mention of it until after she died." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 13-10 favorite in the 1 1/16-mile Fountain of Youth Stakes here on Feb. 
19, Holy Bull and Halo's Image hooked up in a duel for the lead, running the 
first half-mile in 45 3/5. Halo's Image lost all chance when he bolted on the 
turn for home, and Holy Bull quit running in mid-stretch, finishing last as 
Dehere came from far back to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Mike Smith thought that Holy Bull had suffered pulmonary bleeding, but 
a postrace examination showed that the colt had flipped his palate, a temporary 
condition that causes breathing problems. To prevent a recurrence, Croll has 
made some minor equipment changes, which include a noseband and a bit that will 
give Smith more control of the horse's mouth. Croll will also tighten a tongue 
tie farther back in the colt's mouth. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulfstream track is expected to be fast, with temperatures in the high 
70s, for the Florida Derby. . . . The entry of Go For Gin and Crary is the 
favorite at 3-1. The entrants, in post-position order, consist of Line Dance, 
Fabulous Frolic, Crary, Ride The Rails, Amathos, Holy Bull, Halo's Image, 
Dramatic Gold, Lahint, Rocky's Halo, Mr. Angel, Lynn's Notebook, Go For Gin and 
Robannier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulfstream has seven other stakes on today's 12-race card. Bull In The 
Heather, winless since winning last year's Florida Derby, is entered in the 
Creme Fraiche Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Shug McGaughey is bringing a couple of his top horses back to the 
races, running Heavenly Prize in the What a Summer Stakes and Dispute in the 
Safely Kept Handicap. It will be Dispute's first race since she finished fourth 
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. . . . At Oaklawn Park today, Polar Expedition and 
Chimes Band are the favorites for the Southwest Stakes for 3-year-olds.

LOS ALAMITOS; LIGHT FOYLE GETS BETTER WITH AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the only teen-ager racing at Los Alamitos, the 13-year-old gelding Light 
Foyle has every excuse to start slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the opposite has happened. Thursday night, Light Foyle won the final 
of the $5,000 La Palma Pace, his sixth victory in 10 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy, though. Light Foyle trailed the field after the first half of 
the one-mile race and had to move three horses wide on the turn and hold off 
rallies by HR Majik and Kendal Eric to win by a nose. His winning time of 1:58 
1/5 was one of his best of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Light Foyle is several years older than the average harness horse, but he went 
four for four in February. He is owned by Mark Anderson and driven by James 
Lackey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart separates him from the rest," Lackey said. "Kendal Eric was by him, and 
he fought back. And then (near the finish), it looked like (HR Majik) was going 
to catch him, but he stuck his nose in front. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter the sport, you can always find one or two athletes like Nolan Ryan 
who stay competitive longer than the norm. I'm really happy that he won." 
</P>

 Jockey Roman Figueroa is expected to sit out the first six weeks of the coming 
quarter horse meeting after suffering a hand injury in a power-saw accident in 
late February. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, of Cypress, faces several months of major rehabilitation. The injury 
is not expected to permanently disable any of his fingers, but his index finger 
was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing as good can be expected," he said. "I'll go to therapy four days a 
week and I'm starting to get movement in my fingers. Hopefully, the ligaments 
will stay loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, 39, is coming off his best Los Alamitos meeting. He finished fourth 
in the jockeys' standings, winning 87 races, most of them for trainer Blane 
Schvaneveldt, his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa's mounts earned more than $617,000 in 1993, putting him 10th on the 
national list. He won eight stakes last year, among them the Independence Day 
Handicap aboard Sadiesal, the Breeders Sophomore Classic on High Easy Dash, the 
Vandy's Flash Handicap with This Jet Is Royal, and the Directors Handicap with 
Sir Goldminer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most quarter horse jockeys, Figueroa hasn't had many racing opportunities 
since the meeting here ended in mid-December. The injury kept him from 
traveling to Sunland Park in New Mexico in the hope of getting a ride in the 
West Texas Futurity trials on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he will sit out at least the first six weeks of the spring 
meeting, his spirits have remained high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty down the first week, but after I talked with the doctor I was 
pretty positive," he said. "I've had injuries before meetings before and it 
bursts your bubble. Now, I have a chance to wait and come in fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back for the good 2-year-olds," he said. "By then, all the riders 
will be getting off 2-year-olds, thinking something else is better, and I'll be 
there to pick them up."

 Wekiva Springs, who didn't run in the San Rafael Stakes because of a quarter 
crack in a hoof, won't run in the San Felipe Stakes on March 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of his (Wednesday) work sore," trainer Bob Hess Jr. said 
Friday."We've X-rayed him all over, but haven't found any problem. By the way 
he was walking after his work, I thought it might be in his knee or shoulder, 
but they haven't been able to pinpoint it." 
</P>
<P>
 A son of Runaway Groom, Wekiva Springs worked seven furlongs in 1:31 3/5 
Wednesday morning. Owned by Donald R. Dizney, he has won three of four starts, 
including the Santa Catalina Stakes on Jan. 22.

ADDING BITE TO THEIR STING; POP MUSIC: THE SCORPIONS DISPLAY A SOCIAL AWARENESS 
THAT DEPARTS FROM THEIR CUSTOMARY HARD-ROCK HEDONISM. THEY PLAY IRVINE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Scorpions last played the United States three years ago, the band was 
enjoying the biggest success of its career with "Wind of Change," a power 
ballad swelling with peaceful hopes and dreams for a world emerging from the 
Cold War's lingering chill. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the veteran German heavy metal group toured during 1991, singing about 
geopolitical shifts in Eastern Europe, a different wind was starting to blow 
fiercely from the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark, glowering grunge-alternative rock of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden 
and their cohorts was sweeping out of Seattle, changing a hard-rock landscape 
that had long been dominated by old-school metal bands such as the Scorpions, 
which typically served up celebrations of rock hedonism and strutting 
exclamations of prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 As a couple of Scorpions song titles put it, they were "Bad Boys Running 
Wild," who wanted to "Rock You Like a Hurricane." Cries of anguish and 
alienation were not their style. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the grunge-led shift in rock's jet stream has turned the weather a bit 
chillier than the Scorpions might like. Sparked by "Wind of Change," the band's 
1990 album, "Crazy World," sold 7 million copies worldwide, a career peak. But 
the current album, "Face the Heat," quickly melted from the charts following 
its release last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaus Meine, the Scorpions' singer, has been at this since 1971. He is not 
panicking; nor does he see the dominance of grunge as a reason for his band to 
adopt new styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all the established bands get hurt, more or less, when there's a 
change," said Meine, a small man with a large voice that will be a-wailing as 
the Scorpions play tonight at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Scorpions never jumped on any trends," Meine added, chatting over the 
phone from Beverly Hills recently in good, accented English -- the lingua 
franca in which the Scorpions and most other European rock bands write their 
songs. "We do what we do. We saw, in our career, many waves come and go. (The 
ascendancy of grunge) doesn't mean the Scorpions go on stage with shorts (on) 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Meine, 45, doesn't see alternative hard rock as a threat: "I like some of the 
stuff because it's really rough, and very close to the street. It's just real 
people playing music. I like the new Alice in Chains album, and Stone Temple 
Pilots is one of my favorites.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the next wave, the next trend, will be around the corner," he said. 
"Word is out (that) grunge is dying. Whether you call it grunge, hard rock or 
heavy metal, the great bands will survive, like always." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Meine, the Scorpions' lineup includes co-founder Rudolf Schenker on 
rhythm guitar, long-term members Herman Rarebell and Matthias Jabs on drums and 
lead guitar, and a new bassist, Ralph Rieckermann, who joined in 1992 after 
Francis Buchholz, a Scorpion since 1974, was fired in a business dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Scorpions have avoided jumping on a new bandwagon, Meine notes that 
neither do they want to stand still. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the huge success of 'Wind of Change,' we wanted to make an album that's 
more on the hard side," he said. "We wanted the rock fans to know that the 
Scorpions are still a rock band and were far away from retiring in ballad 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 "Face the Heat" has a couple of good-time rockers on it, as well as another 
idealistic state-of-the-world anthem in "Under the Same Sun," the band's new 
single. But it also has several stormy numbers inspired by lyricist Meine's 
outlook on troubling events in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wind of Change" imagined old, historical hatreds as "distant memories . . . 
buried in the past forever." But in the opening lines of "Unholy Alliance," a 
dismayed Meine watches the rise of neo-Nazism in his homeland: 
</P>
<P>
 It came crawling up from the ruins of the past  
</P>
<P>
 And I just can't believe my eyes  
</P>
<P>
 It wears the same old face we thought was dead and gone  
</P>
<P>
 Forever buried by time --  
</P>
<P>
 Unholy alliance  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get over the past," Meine said, reflecting on a key dilemma of 
today's Germany. "But as you see right now, this whole Nazi movement came up in 
the last few years. It's just a minority of people, but we can't deny it's 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to do something about it. Especially as Germans, we 
can't ever let this happen again," he said. "Other German artists write about 
it and make really clear statements (against hatred), which is very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Meine, who joined Jabs in an acoustic version of "Wind of Change" at a large 
anti-Nazi rally in Frankfurt in 1992, cited the release of the film 
"Schindler's List" as a positive development in helping Germany come to terms 
with the Nazi past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen it, but I would love to see it," he said. "It seems like 
everybody's very touched by it. The young generation in Germany must see this 
movie. It's sad to see there are young kids out there who believe in the lies 
of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 With new songs such as "Unholy Alliance," "Under the Same Sun," "Alien Nation" 
and "Ship of Fools" all dealing with the precarious state of the world, the 
Scorpions have moved far from typical old-metal themes of revelry and 
us-against-the-adults teen bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 On their most recent albums, both Aerosmith and Van Halen, two other 
still-popular holdovers from the 1970s, have taken similar steps with socially 
aware songs that depart from their customary hard-rock hedonism. 
</P>
<P>
 One could speculate that it's a calculated way of keeping up with hard rock's 
angry young vanguard, but Meine says that his band's newfound seriousness is 
simply a mark of maturity and a natural reaction to the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s, a lot of stuff was written out of fantasy land," Meine said. 
"Scorpions are not a political band, but it's the '90s, and the Scorpions are 
not a nostalgic kind of band. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're growing up as a person, you're growing up as a songwriter. 'Wind of 
Change' proved to me that it's important to write songs that matter, that come 
straight out of the heart. There's nothing wrong with saying, 'Let's party,' 
but when you're past 40, you don't want to make a fool out of yourself. You 
can't just say, 'Hey, let's chase chicks around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Scorpions and King's X play tonight at 8 at Irvine Meadows, 8800 Irvine 
Center Drive, Irvine. $18.50 to $28.50. (714) 855-6111.

GEE, IT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD IDEA; 'CUTE' REAL ESTATE AD IN THE HOLLYWOOD 
REPORTER GENERATES COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" may be drawing raves this year, but Schindler's Listing is 
drawing mostly outrage in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindler's Listing? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a real estate advertisement for a $7.9-million Los Angeles estate that 
appeared Friday in the entertainment trade paper the Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of people in the movie industry were upset because the ad seemed to 
be a tasteless spoof of the much-heralded Steven Spielberg drama about the 
Holocaust that has garnered 12 Oscar nominations, including best picture and 
best director. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, in an obvious take-off on the film, claims that "Schindler's Listing" 
also has received "12 nominations." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than best picture or best director, the ad says that the 
"nominations" Schindler's elegant residence has received include: best house in 
Los Angeles; best original architecture; best interior design; best pool design 
and best mountain, city & ocean views, not to mention best use of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long before a real estate firm involved in the sale started 
getting angry calls from the Hollywood community. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying, 'This is a disgrace!' and 'You shouldn't use this!' " said 
an employee at Stan Herman, Stephen Shapiro & Associates, who asked not to be 
identified. "We're getting complaints from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 One employee said that many of the complaints came in from virtually every 
major studio, including Disney, Paramount and TriStar, with most the callers 
saying how tasteless they thought the ad was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The title refers to a list of Jews working for Oskar Schindler who would be 
transported to his factory in Czechoslovakia, and thereby saved from likely 
death. Stephen Shapiro, whose real estate company has the listing along with 
Fred Sands Estates, said what many callers failed to realize was that a man 
named Schindler -- European publisher Peter Schindler, to be exact -- is the 
actual seller and, "When you take a listing on a house, it's called a listing." 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate executive said that he was surprised at the negative reaction 
the ad generated, noting that the ad appeared in the real estate section of the 
trade publication -- not in the pages where ads for movies normally run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was meant to be something cute and in the real estate section and draw 
attention to a special house," Shapiro said. "It was not meant to be offensive 
. . . to any race, creed or religion. We're not poking fun. We're trying to 
draw attention to a fabulous house." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said that the ad was a joint creative effort involving the real estate 
firms and the Beverly Hills public relations firm of Bragman, Nyman and 
Casarelli. He said Peter Schindler "understood what was going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Public relations executive Howard Bragman said what people should understand 
is that among "certain people in the real estate industry" the house already is 
commonly referred to as "Schindler's listing." 
</P>
<P>
 An employee at the Shapiro firm, meanwhile, said that the original asking 
price for the estate was $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the controversy over "Schindler's Listing," she wondered if there would 
have been any flap at all if the seller's last name had been, say, Piano -- as 
in "The Piano," the Jane Campion film that has also received Oscar nominations 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would they be saying the same things about 'Piano's Listing'?" the employee 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After the company received complaints all morning, one employee at the firm 
quipped: "(The house) will be lucky if it's standing at the end of the day."

POP BEAT: SPINANES: SUDDENLY VERY VISIBLE; THE PORTLAND-BASED DUO, WHICH WILL 
OPEN FOR LIZ PHAIR AT THE PALACE, OFFERS ANOTHER VITAL FEMALE VOICE IN ROCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans going to the Liz Phair concert at the Palace on Thursday will be primed 
to hear one of rock's vital new female voices -- but they might be surprised to 
find another one opening the show. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Manos," the debut album by the Portland-based duo the Spinanes, 
singer-songwriter-guitarist Rebecca Gates stakes out a territory somewhere 
between Phair's candid confessionals and Polly Jean Harvey's blistering 
broadsides, crafting bittersweet-sounding songs that are, in her words, "about 
people being together and not together in various ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, whose voice and guitar are backed by drummer Scott Plouf, has mixed 
feelings about the persistent issue of women in rock, especially the recurring 
media build-up of yet another round of female artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a sense of being a woman's voice," she says, "but I don't have a 
sense of being part of a new wave or a new trend -- 'the women who are saying 
it like it is.' I think that women have been doing that for a long time, and I 
think that it's really condescending to every year have it be, 'Oh, the women 
are finally doing it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read interviews with L7 where they say, 'We're not gonna talk about 
being women, because we're just rockers.' But I definitely think it's important 
for me and what I do that I am female. That's one of the reasons why I didn't 
feel like it would be moot for me to get on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, if I was a white suburban boy and I just wanted to talk about stuff 
and I couldn't really present anything new, I probably wouldn't get on stage. 
I'd probably just play in my bedroom. Being female is what initially gave me 
strength to feel like I had anything to say that other people would want to 
hear. . . . The reason why I thought we should bring it out of the basement is 
because I'm female, and because I think girls and women need to see other women 
doing that."  
</P>
<P>
 And the Spinanes are suddenly, and unexpectedly, very visible. The unheralded 
album, on the Seattle-based independent Sub Pop label, recently hit No. 1 on 
the College Music Journal's radio chart, a spot reserved in recent months for 
prestige acts with major-label affiliations, including Nirvana, Smashing 
Pumpkins, Tori Amos and the Ramones. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates worked at college radio stations, record stores and distributorships 
before easing into performing with her friend Lois Maffeo, now a prominent 
force in the Northwest's feminist rock scene. That background has helped give 
her an even perspective on the initial success of the Spinanes, who strive to 
remain firmly rooted in the grass-roots values of the rock underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way we don't think about the charts and that kind of stuff. We can't, 
because it would affect what we do. . . . I'm just happy that enough people 
like it that we can continue to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the higher profile presents new kinds of choices -- for instance, do 
they keep touring while the record is doing well or get back to Portland for a 
break? 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of interferes with your life a little bit more," says Gates, who will 
be touring Europe for six weeks instead of relaxing in Portland. "It is a 
little bit new to have to think about that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates figures she has it easy compared to the demands on a hot item like 
Phair. "I don't really know her, but I can't even imagine what she's going 
through. Well, I do know they just went down to the Bahamas to record. I was 
like, 'Hey, maybe we can (do that).' " 
</P>
<P>
 So the ambitions don't remain so modest after all? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gates, "Well, maybe it's just ambition for no phone calls and some 
sunshine."

RICK DU BROW: DRAMAS BITE BACK AT REALITY; TELEVISION: FIVE DRAMATIC SERIES ARE 
ARRIVING FROM THE COMPANIES OF TOP-NAME PRODUCERS. BUT CAN THEY RECAPTURE FANS 
OF THE POPULAR NEWSMAGAZINES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No TV form is a more endangered species than weekly drama series, but the 
success of "NYPD Blue" and "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" has renewed hope for 
their viability. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's a pipe dream, yet the networks are suddenly engaged in a kind of 
tryout season for new dramas, which have been displaced in large numbers by 
sensational reality series that are far cheaper to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in the content problems for weekly dramas -- the "family values" 
pressures highlighted by former Vice President Dan Quayle, the anti-violence 
drive supported by Congress and the Clinton Administration, and the more adult 
material permitted on cable -- and fictional storytelling has been reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 While a handful of solid dramas has managed to survive -- including "Northern 
Exposure," "Picket Fences" and "Law & Order," which was renewed this week for 
next season -- the number is still few and the odds against newcomers remain 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the fact that five series are suddenly arriving for a look-see from the 
companies of top-name producers -- Steven Bochco, Aaron Spelling, Stephen J. 
Cannell, Barney Rosenzweig and the "St. Elsewhere" team of Bruce Paltrow and 
John Tinker -- is at least a ray of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Also tentatively scheduled to arrive around summer, says ABC, is the latest 
one-hour drama from "thirtysomething" creators Marshall Herskovitz and Ed 
Zwick, "My So-Called Life," about a 15-year-old girl, her friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has been more devastating to network drama than the reality shows. 
This week alone, as examples of their fare, "Dateline NBC" interviewed killer 
Jeffrey Dahmer and ABC's new "Turning Point" revisited the Manson case. There 
now are 10 prime-time reality series in the so-called newsmagazine category. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . and yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Along came CBS' "Dr. Quinn" last season and the audience responded to its 
wholesomeness. And along came Bochco's "NYPD Blue" this season, with the adult 
appeal to hold the cable audience for ABC. Both series ranked among the Top 20 
shows in last week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Bochco is helping us bring drama back because ("NYPD Blue") is a 
hit," says Cannell. "And 'Quinn' is in that category. And NBC hanging on to 
'Homicide' and giving it another shot was important." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannell has one of the new network dramas: "Traps," which debuts on CBS March 
31 with George C. Scott and Dan Cortese as grandfather/grandson homicide 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Bochco's company launched the ABC drama "The Byrds of 
Paradise," with Timothy Busfield as a professor who moves his family to Hawaii. 
Created by Charles H. Eglee and Channing Gibson, it is billed by ABC as a 
"family drama." 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, CBS introduced the Paltrow-Tinker drama "The Road Home," with 
Karen Allen, Ed Flanders, Terence Knox, Frances Sternhagen and Alex McArthur in 
a tale about a family on the North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Spelling's latest series, "Winnetka Road," arrives on NBC, dealing 
with "the subculture of working people in a wealthy suburb of a Midwestern 
city" and starring such performers as Ed Begley Jr., Meg Tilly and Catherine 
Hicks. Created by John Byrum, it replaces "Sisters" in its six-episode tryout. 
(See review, F18.) 
</P>
<P>
 On April 3, meanwhile, Rosenzweig ("Cagney & Lacey") and co-executive producer 
Ken Wales introduce the hour drama "Christy," about "a spirited young woman who 
leaves her sheltered city life to teach at a missionary school in a remote 
Appalachian community." The cast includes Kellie Martin, Tyne Daly -- who won 
four best actress Emmy Awards in "Cagney & Lacey" -- and Tess Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the premise of "Christy," Rosenzweig says the success of "Dr. Quinn," 
which deals with a frontier woman physician, was an influential factor: "I 
called Jeff Sagansky (president of CBS Entertainment) and said, 'Do you want to 
make more programs in this arena?' And as a matter of fact there was this book, 
'Christy' (by Catherine Marshall), that he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling, hopeful about the apparent renewed interest in drama, says: "I think 
we're absolutely sated with comedies." He currently has four network series -- 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," "Melrose Place," "Winnetka Road" and a revival of 
"Burke's Law" -- and his recent HBO production of the late Randy Shilts' 
landmark book on AIDS, "And the Band Played On," will be rerun by NBC on March 
28. Not on his agenda, he says, are reality series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been asked to do a couple, but we won't do them," he says. "The thing I 
hate most is that I think they're more likely to be aped by people than fiction 
like 'Columbo' or 'Starsky and Hutch.' But they all get ratings, and that's 
what scares me. We once did a show called 'SWAT' (a violent police drama), but 
I would never do 'SWAT' now." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" is a sometimes violent, sexy but almost always literate and 
stylish series -- and a network benchmark in competing, at least moderately, 
with the frankness of cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most viewers that (networks) have lost," says Bochco, "have not deserted to 
watch half-hour comedies on cable. We've lost them to movies -- and longer 
movies. One of my arguments about 'NYPD Blue' was that we have to compete. And 
clearly I was right. When you put on a drama that has the sound and the feel of 
movies, people come back." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also often more truth about the human condition in a piece of good 
fiction than in the cold, cynical, soulless recitation of the awful deeds that 
comprise so much of reality series. Herskovitz, assessing the flood of 
depressing one-hour reality series, says succinctly: "You come away from those 
shows feeling worse than when you started." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick now is for drama series to take the right pulse of public tastes in 
fiction amid the harsh reality shows of the 1990s. Cannell acknowledges the 
impact of pressures over the family-values and violence issues: 
</P>
<P>
 "This much I will tell you," he says. "I started off saying to CBS about 
'Traps' that I wanted this show to be not about criminals but about ideas. The 
first show is about the generation gap. The second is about changes in police 
work over the years and how it has been redefined since the Rodney King case. 
Another show is about sexism among police." 
</P>
<P>
 For Herskovitz, "The problem is that we have not found a cheap way to tell a 
dramatic story well." Saying there are tightened costs for sets and other 
physical outlays in storytelling, he adds: "When we did 'thirtysomething,' we 
would do something different each week. That free-form creativity is impossible 
today. You have to write the show in such a way that it is containable, which 
puts limitations on the style." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality shows, of course, don't have to worry about such fine points. Just 
grab somebody, point the camera -- and down the tube we go.

SHIRLEY MACLAINE'S PLAYING 'OLD' AND HAVING THE TIME OF HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WERNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Shirley MacLaine hit her 40s -- in this life at least -- she's been 
playing older, often cantankerous characters: the alcoholic movie-star mother 
in "Postcards From the Edge," the tyrannical piano teacher in "Madame 
Sousatzka," the grumpy Ouiser in "Steel Magnolias" and her Oscar-winning Aurora 
Greenway in "Terms of Endearment." It doesn't seem a stretch, then, that now, 
nearly 60 (her birthday is April 24) she's playing a grouchy, imperious former 
First Lady in "Guarding Tess." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that these characters have had such similar temperaments isn't 
entirely her choice, as she explains; it is, instead, simply Hollywood myopia. 
"They (movie executives) seem to have this attitude that if anyone is over 45, 
she's cantankerous," says MacLaine, alternately eating and dropping chunks of a 
bran muffin on the couch of her suite in a Manhattan hotel. "It's like no one 
can think of what anyone from 45 to 60 does." 
</P>
<P>
 That she typically has to play up her wrinkles and pull on a gray wig is 
usually part of the deal, but she says it doesn't bother her. Part of the 
reason is how she looks; in person she's so vibrant that you practically have 
to squint -- neon-red hair, startling blue eyes, pale, fine skin. She's wearing 
a short tight red suit and high heels showing off a trim figure and long 
dancer's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason she's so willing to take on these less than flattering parts 
is the overall tone of her 40-year career -- she was always known for character 
parts ("The Apartment," "Some Came Running" and "Sweet Charity"), not glamour 
turns, as she explains. And in service to a character, you have to abandon your 
vanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people look at parts and think what will the public think," 
she says. "But I never think about whether the public will love me. I've always 
been smearing lipstick and accentuating the lines (on my face). When Mike 
Nichols (director of "Postcards") said, 'We want the wig off and your face like 
a peeled onion,' it was nothing to me. I've seen Debbie Reynolds with her wig 
off. That's what the character would be." 
</P>
<P>
 As Tess Carlisle, crusty presidential widow, she doesn't look quite as drastic 
this time -- the overall look, tight hairstyle and pearls, is rather Barbara 
Bush. Other characteristics are lifted from several First Ladies the 
politically active MacLaine has known, among them Rosalynn Carter, her 
favorite, who contributed Tess' resilience and steeliness, and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, who contributed the sense of equality with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, MacLaine has a great deal of respect for the work of the current 
First Lady, but she still passes along a bit of advice. "I really think she 
should relax and have more fun," she says. "That's what I've found in my old 
age -- that you can facilitate change faster if you relax. I was so much more 
intense when I was younger." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from her familiarity with the political milieu, MacLaine was drawn to 
"Guarding Tess" because of its central relationship, the 
antagonism/affection/devotion between Tess Carlisle and Doug Chesnic (played by 
Nicolas Cage), the lead Secret Service agent assigned to protect her. "I 
thought it was sweet; it made me laugh," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar interaction occurred between her and Cage. "She's very outspoken," 
says Cage. "If she thinks something, she'll say it. She'll tease you, point it 
out with a very frank attitude, but always in good humor. She also loves to 
mimic people and she'd imitate me just before my take. So I would joke with her 
about her magic powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cage may have been joking but he took some of what she had to say seriously. 
"He asked me for advice about everything," says MacLaine. "Child-rearing, 
comedy, what he should do after this. After all, I've lived 3,000 years longer 
than him." She roars with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 When MacLaine first publicized her explorations into spiritual phenomena and 
past lives in the third of her seven memoirs, 1983's "Out on a Limb," she was 
attacked as a New Age eccentric. As a result, she had to develop a sense of 
humor about it -- which she displayed in Albert Brooks' "Defending Your Life," 
as the hostess of the Past Lives Pavilion. But now, she says, she feels 
redeemed. "Everyone from Jesse Helms to the President is saying we're in a 
spiritual crisis," she says. "So the stuff I'm writing doesn't make your eyes 
roll anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Her explorations and her writing are the most important things in her life, 
she says. She describes a recent meeting in which she discussed 
extraterrestrials with a Zulu shaman consulted by both Nelson Mandela and South 
African President F. W. De Klerk, a trip to Rio with the Dalai Lama (who, she 
says, is something of a flirt) and a visit to Cambodia with companion Andrew 
Peacock, the former foreign minister of Australia, to talk with the U.N. 
commanders about the democratic elections. "Now that is a life," she says 
proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also looking forward to reprising Aurora Greenway again in the "Terms 
of Endearment" sequel, "Evening Star," set to begin production in Texas in May. 
And she's trying to figure out whether to have a big party for her 60th before 
she moves out of Los Angeles to take up permanent residence on her New Mexico 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as always, otherworldly voices interrupt. "I just had a revelation," she 
says, her eyes flickering. "If I act on it, I'll tell you about it." Then she 
smiles. She is, after all, writing her next book.

 Nicholson Settles: Jack Nicholson has struck a deal with the man who claimed 
the actor struck his car with a golf club. Nicholson settled a lawsuit filed by 
Robert Scott Blank, who accused the actor of bashing his car's hood and 
windshield while he was stopped at a red light Feb. 8. Blank said Nicholson 
apparently thought he had been cut off in traffic. Details of the settlement 
were not available. Nicholson, 57, still faces arraignment March 31 on 
misdemeanor charges of vandalism and assault. TELEVISION

 Making a 'Point': ABC News says that the 18.1 rating, 30 share for Wednesday's 
debut of Diane Sawyer's "Turning Point" received the best national Nielsens 
ever for a weekly newsmagazine premiere. Although condemned by critics for its 
story about the Charles Manson family murders, the series topped NBC's "Law & 
Order" and more than doubled the ratings for CBS' "48 Hours," with a look at an 
Oregon murderer's controversial parole. Meanwhile, Tuesday's "Dateline NBC" had 
its best ratings ever by devoting nearly an hour to serial killer Jeffrey 
Dahmer.

 * Tinseltown Time: Comedy Central's popular "Politically Incorrect" and its 
host, Bill Maher, will focus on the politics of Hollywood next week. Topics

the most addicting drug of all?" An hourlong Academy Awards special will air 
Friday at 8:30 p.m. Among the week's panelists: Shelley Winters, Corbin 
Bernsen, Tim Allen, John Malkovich, Tom Arnold, Brett Butler, Grant Tinker, 
Dick Clark and Steve Allen. 
</P>

 * Supreme Beings: C-SPAN says it made TV history this week when the Supreme 
Court agreed, for the first time, to allow coverage of an entire event inside 
its chambers. But the event was not a court proceeding. It was the first in a 
series of six panel discussions about the history of the high court during the 
Civil War era. The 90-minute session will be shown at 9 a.m. Sunday.

 No Show: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York has abandoned plans to 
present a retrospective exhibition of Robert Irwin's work, which was organized 
by L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art and appeared there last summer. "We really 
wanted to have the show, but the timing didn't work out," Catherine Vare, the 
Guggenheim's head of public affairs, said. Commitments to other projects 
prevented Irwin from scheduling time to construct a special installation for 
the New York exhibition, she said. The Guggenheim had planned to host the 
exhibition next year, but the museum had not signed a contract with MOCA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collecting Collections: One of the world's most comprehensive private 
collections of the works of scientist Charles Darwin has been given to the 
Huntington Library in San Marino. Warren D. Mohr, a retired businessman from 
San Francisco, donated his entire 1,500-volume library to the Huntington, 
including all the early editions and important translations of Darwin's seminal 
publication "On the Origin of the Species" and an 1835 printing of excerpts 
from letters Darwin wrote during his expedition on the H.M.S. Beagle. 
Selections from the collection are expected to go on display in June. MOVIES

 David Ford's "Too Good to Be True" will be given a staged reading at 7:30 p.m. 
Monday at South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive. The play, about 
employees of a national AIDS charity, won second prize last week in SCR's 
California Playwrights Competition for unproduced scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, a director and performance artist, lives in Oakland and, according to 
SCR, has collaborated either as director or co-creator of a variety of 
productions in the Bay Area, including "Memory Tricks" with Marga Gomez, which 
won a Bay Area Critics Circle Award and was recently produced at the Public 
Theatre in New York, and "Looking for Black Women on the Radio" with Bill 
Talen. 
</P>
<P>
 The top winner of the SCR competition, "Green Icebergs" by Cecilia Fannon, 
will be given a reading at the theater May 2. Both readings will take place on 
the Mainstage. General admission is $7. (714) 957-4033.JAN HERMAN

FEMA PROMISES REBUILDING AID, BUT CSUN WARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an early sign that Cal State Northridge may avoid past earthquake recovery 
pitfalls, federal officials are promising to help pay for upgrading many CSUN 
buildings to modern seismic standards instead of authorizing only 
"patch-and-paint" repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latter was a common response to past disasters, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency earlier this month adopted a new repair policy for 
public facilities damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials, however, admit to being wary of the "new" FEMA and its 
promises. That is because the "old" federal agency left a legacy of 
still-shuttered buildings and bureaucratic repair disputes at other California 
universities damaged in past earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four and a half years after the Loma Prieta quake, repairs have yet to start 
on some closed buildings at Stanford and San Francisco State universities. And 
it took Cal State Los Angeles five frustrating years to reopen the final 
building that was closed by the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our frustration came as we really could never rely on any agreement with FEMA 
as things came together and then fell apart," said Valerie Veronin, Stanford's 
acting director of facilities project management. "I can write a book after all 
this is said and done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two months have passed since the 6.8-magnitude temblor battered 
Southern California on Jan. 17. With work nearly completed on a mini-city of 
portable classrooms erected to replace still-closed permanent buildings, CSUN 
officials are beginning to focus on rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 But FEMA officials insist that the agency has changed under the Clinton 
Administration. If they deliver on their promises, the rebuilding at Northridge 
could be relatively smooth and quick, requiring perhaps a couple of years. If 
the task becomes a replay of the past, the campus faces a long ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson said it is still too early to tell which path 
lies ahead. Thus far, she and other campus officials have nothing but praise 
for FEMA's initial response. But Wilson added: "We haven't gotten to the nuts 
and bolts and dollars and cents of our claim yet, either." 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials are still tallying the costs of their quake damage and may not 
have an official figure for some time. But they have made unofficial estimates 
of $250 million to $350 million, which would amount to the costliest disaster 
ever for an American university. 
</P>
<P>
 How FEMA treats CSUN is crucial to its recovery because the federal 
government, under a Clinton decree, has promised to pay for 90% of the damage 
to public facilities. The state is responsible for the other 10%. In past 
disasters such as Loma Prieta, the federal share was only 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, some CSUN officials predict that major disputes are unlikely, at 
least partly because they would reflect poorly on Clinton. Those officials say 
the President has made a commitment to CSUN, at least in a political sense, 
telephoning the school when classes resumed Feb. 14 and sending Vice President 
Al Gore to visit shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEMA promise to help pay for seismic upgrades at the Northridge campus 
also is an important first sign. The past disputes at other universities often 
have centered on whether damaged old buildings should be simply patched up or 
more fully fixed to meet current codes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the CSUN community, that is not just a bureaucratic question but perhaps 
one of life and death. Most of the major concrete buildings on the 353-acre 
campus were built in the late 1950s and 1960s -- generations ago in terms of 
how resistant buildings are to collapse and earthquake damage in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-earthquake repair methods have been an open question in the past because 
most building codes, including the one that governs state facilities such as 
CSUN, generally do not spell out seismic-retrofit guidelines, except for much 
older, un-reinforced masonry structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, however, FEMA and state Office of Emergency Services 
officials signed an agreement laying down minimum seismic repair standards for 
public buildings. Top FEMA officials said their agency has never before made 
such a commitment, calling it a reflection of FEMA's new approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement obliges FEMA to pay to help bring an entire building up to 
current code if the expected cost of structural repairs is at least 50% of the 
building's replacement cost. A public agency also could choose demolition and 
get 90% of the replacement value for a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 If the repair cost is between 11% and 49%, FEMA will help pay to bring at 
least the damaged portions of a building up to current seismic standards, 
although engineers said such partial work often must be broadened to the entire 
building. Only if the damage is 10% or less would old standards be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has yet to officially categorize CSUN's heavily damaged buildings. But 
under the new policy, "virtually everything we're doing will exceed the 10% 
value," said Charles Thiel, chairman of the Cal State system's Seismic Review 
Board and the official deciding building safety issues at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel said FEMA's policy would fund seismic upgrades for most of the 
university's major older buildings. Those he cited, most of them still closed 
due to quake damage, include the administration building, the Oviatt Library, 
Sierra Tower, the science complex, engineering building, the south library, and 
fine arts and speech-drama buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel predicted seismic upgrades also would occur in the University Park 
Apartments, about half of which remain closed, and the high-rise University 
Tower Apartments, which were closed before the quake because of seismic and 
asbestos problems but sustained severe damage in the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it is too early to make a cost estimate for the seismic 
repairs, although a 1990 state report using conservative figures estimated a 
$46-million price tag to retrofit about a dozen campus buildings. Thiel said 
that, once upgraded, the buildings would have a life-safety level for occupants 
equal to new structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs, which make buildings more resistant to collapse, would vault CSUN 
ahead of many other Cal State campuses in seismic safety, Thiel said. Without 
the earthquake, he added, many of the buildings likely never would have been 
upgraded by the university system because of its vast number of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 (The 20-campus Cal State system was criticized after the Loma Prieta quake for 
not having a seismic policy for its buildings. Trustees adopted such a policy 
in May, 1993, and plan to start the first in a series of upgrade projects at 
five other campuses this year using state bond funds). 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to go in and repair the buildings and have them re-damaged" in 
a future quake, said Craig Wingo, director of FEMA's Infrastructure Support 
Division. He said FEMA Director James Lee Witt had made hazard mitigation "the 
cornerstone of this agency." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, Wingo said, "there's no doubt the agency position was more 
conservative on a repair-only philosophy." He noted the Stanford, San Francisco 
and Los Angeles university cases arose under the Republican administrations of 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, FEMA officials were at Stanford trying to resolve the university's 
appeal of FEMA's decisions. Still at issue are eight damaged buildings that 
FEMA maintained needed about $2 million in repairs compared to the university's 
estimate of about $30 million, Veronin said. 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly different list of eight Stanford buildings, including an art museum 
and two major classroom facilities, remain closed because of unrepaired damage. 
And the university is still using dozens of portable classrooms set up after 
the October, 1989, quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Like officials elsewhere, Veronin said FEMA was responsive at first, but then 
the process bogged down in disputes over repair methods, as well as what campus 
officials called FEMA's lowball damage estimates based on minimal repairs. 
Stanford officials estimated that the campus suffered damage in excess of $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Francisco State, officials said a major high-rise dormitory, Verducci 
Hall, also remains closed due to Loma Prieta damage because FEMA's last 
estimate for structural repairs was about $3.5 million. Campus officials have 
estimated the damage at up to $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Comptroller Don Scoble said his campus's debate with FEMA deteriorated into 
arguments over how large the cracks had to be for FEMA to agree to pay for the 
repairs. "My sense is they have been guided in the main by the desire to 
safeguard taxpayers' money," Scoble said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Los Angeles, the Salazar Hall classroom building finally reopened 
early last year, five years after the October, 1987, Whittier Narrows quake. A 
student died in the quake when she was hit by a concrete panel that fell from a 
parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Art Flores, vice president for operations, said Salazar Hall now leaks 
because FEMA officials insisted that its damaged roof be patched rather than 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an inordinately long process," Flores said. "Hopefully, Northridge 
won't have that experience."

 LOOKING BACK: At the Old Courthouse in Santa Ana this afternoon, you can step 
back to 50 years ago, when America was deep into World War II. The Old 
Courthouse Museum Society will preview its new yearlong exhibit, "Homefront 
Orange County." . . . It commemorates those years -- when the county housed 
40,000 soldiers -- with film, posters, pictures and memorabilia. "Those of us 
who are older will do a lot of remembering," says society President Elynore 
Barton. "For young people, we hope it will be an education." 
</P>
<P>
 WOMEN'S WORK: The exhibit includes many written remembrances by local 
residents about their lives at home during the war. Barton, a granddaughter of 
Orange County's first sheriff, Theo Lacy, says women here "did more than dance 
with soldiers." . . . She worked in a war support factory, and her mother 
organized a local home away from home for soldiers. Women also turned in grease 
from breakfast bacon, which the government used to make ammunition. "We all did 
what we could," Barton says, "and the exhibit is going to include many 
wonderful stories." 
</P>
<P>
 WELCOME PRAISE: The past year wasn't kind to Gene Lu, whose Advanced Logic 
Research computer company in Irvine took an 18% sales drop. But here's some 
good news for him: Fortune magazine this month still picked him among its 40 
smartest "Young Entrepreneurs." It praised his willingness to make serious 
changes to combat sales losses. Says a Lu spokeswoman: "How nice of them." 
</P>
<P>
 FINAL STEPS: More than 50 elderly residents born in Vietnam are scheduled to 
show up at the Asian Senior Center in Santa Ana today to take their U.S. 
citizenship tests. The center, which conducts the tests monthly, has never had 
this many applicants. . . . Says Minh Le, center director: "I guess the main 
reason there are so many people who are interested in becoming a citizen now is 
because they finally realized that this is the one important thing they must do 
to become a part of this country."

UMBERG PRIMARY FOE QUITS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE; POLITICS: GARDEN GROVE 
ASSEMBLYMAN IS ELATED BY ARLO SMITH'S MOVE. HE'LL FACE INCUMBENT DAN LUNGREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith announced Friday that 
he is dropping out of the race for attorney general, setting up a showdown 
between Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Orange County and Republican 
incumbent Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who narrowly lost to Lungren in 1990 and had been campaigning 
aggressively in recent weeks, said he was concerned neither he or Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove) could unseat Lungren after an expensive primary battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negatives and the high cost incurred in a primary skirmish would only aid 
a sitting attorney general," Smith said in a press release, adding that "Dan 
Lungren must be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, now the lone candidate in the Democratic primary for attorney general, 
said he was shocked by Smith's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won the primary!" said the gleeful assemblyman, who had raised eight times 
more campaign money than Smith. "I think he saw the writing on the wall. We 
were gaining momentum, we were getting endorsements. . . . We needed the 
primary to demonstrate strength, and we demonstrated strength by forcing Arlo 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and the only Orange County Democrat 
holding state or federal office, said Smith called Friday afternoon to give him 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very gracious about it," said Umberg, a two-term assemblyman. "He said 
that he thought we should be devoting our mutual efforts toward electing a 
different attorney general, that a primary might be divisive. He thought for 
the greater good, he would get out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's campaign manager, Joanne Stabler, was also taken aback by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arlo's such a fighter," she said. "It did surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Sacramento insiders suggested that Smith might have been persuaded to 
pull out by Democratic kingpins. On Thursday, Smith paid a visit to the state 
Capitol, holding discussions with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other 
Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith could not be reached for comment on the talks. Dennis Collins, Smith's 
campaign manager, said he was not privy to the meetings with Brown and the 
others, but played down any effect they might have had. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impact that had on his decision I don't know," Collins said. "There were 
no threats or coercion. I think there might have been a very pragmatic 
discussion of the way things stood and decisions were made accordingly. It was 
a real hard decision on Arlo's part." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's camp said they did not ask for Brown or anyone else to intervene on 
their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made no effort to get Arlo out," said George Urch, Umberg's campaign 
manager. "As a matter of fact, we were looking forward to running against Arlo. 
A rigorous primary has its benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he said, a primary battle could have helped boost Umberg's name 
identification around the state. Outside Orange County, Umberg is little known. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith now out of the race, Umberg will be able to marshal his forces and 
save a bundle of campaign cash -- he had estimated the primary alone would cost 
him $1.2 million. Last month, Umberg reported about $300,000 cash on hand 
compared to $36,000 for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from holding a substantial fund-raising edge, Umberg had the backing of 
more than two dozen colleagues in the Legislature, a powerful campaign weapon 
because those lawmakers can provide strategic help and a ready soapbox to 
promote a statewide candidate in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Urch said, Umberg should gain a hefty measure of respect for 
"slaying Arlo Smith before he's even started." Urch also suggested that Smith's 
departure will allow Umberg to begin assailing Lungren's record all the sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's Dan Lungren who is the target," Urch said. "We're now on an equal 
footing with the Republican attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler said Lungren didn't care who he faced. The attorney general, she said, 
will run on the strength of his record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't change our campaign strategy all that much," she said. "We're just 
going to go forward and focus as we have been on the November general election. 
Frankly, I'm excited about this. Now we have a defined opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 In other statewide races, Democratic state Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys 
formally unveiled his candidacy for state treasurer Friday. Roberti had also 
been eyeing a seat on the lower-profile State Board of Equalization, but said 
he opted for the treasurer's race because he felt that office could be 
transformed into a crime-fighting unit. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, Roberti must face a recall campaign in his San Fernando Valley 
Senate district being led by gun-rights activists angered by the senator's 
support of a 1989 assault weapon ban. The longtime legislator portrayed himself 
Friday as a feisty underdog who refuses to give his recall opponents the 
satisfaction of seeing him pass up a run for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected treasurer, Roberti said, he would work hard to protect California's 
coffers so more money would be available for crime-fighting programs. In 
addition, Roberti said he would ensure the state has enough funds to build the 
estimated $6.6 billion worth of prisons needed as a result of the tough, new 
"three strikes and you're out" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti faces a formidable challenger in Sacramento developer Phil Angelides, 
who has also declared he will run for the Democratic nomination for state 
treasurer. Angelides, the former state Democratic Party chairman, has raised 
about $2 million for his campaign, while Roberti has been forced to shift much 
of his general campaign money to the recall battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides said Friday he has endorsements from both of California's senators, 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as former Los Angeles Assemblyman 
Mike Roos, who co-authored the assault weapon ban that now haunts Roberti in 
the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am running for state treasurer to create 100,000 jobs by investing in 
California," Angelides said in a statement. "It is time for new leaders who can 
rebuild California." 
</P>
<P>
 The lone GOP candidate for state treasurer is Board of Equalization member 
Matthew Fong of Los Angeles, who charged earlier that Roberti is a career 
politician who is past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the governor's race, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson filed his 
declaration of candidacy for reelection as expected before Friday's 5 p.m. 
deadline. The three Democrats opposing him, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) also filed their papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Controller Gray Davis filed to run for lieutenant governor to 
replace Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is retiring. Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak 
Run), who wants to split California into three separate states, and Sen. Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) will oppose each other for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat, filed to replace his old 
boss, March Fong Eu, who resigned after being nominated to a U.S. 
ambassadorship. Other Democrats in the same race are former Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles. Former 
Assembly Republican leader Bill Jones of Fresno is seeking the nomination on 
the GOP side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state controller's race, Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) will 
face Democrats Kathleen Connell, a Westside financial consultant and former Los 
Angeles housing director, and Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata. Former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks is running for the GOP nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), the chairman of the Senate Insurance 
Committee, and Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), the chairman of the 
Assembly Health Committee, filed the necessary papers to run for state 
insurance commissioner. So did Republicans Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush 
of San Jose, former director of the Department of Consumer Affairs Jim Conran 
of Orinda, and Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach, an insurance agency owner who 
was the 1990 GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) and Maureen DiMarco, the governor's 
cabinet-level adviser for child development and education, filed for the 
nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction.

DEPUTY'S LAWYER LAUDS GRAND JURY; RULING: O.C. PANEL AVERTED 'DOUBLE TRAGEDY' 
IN DECIDING NOT TO INDICT LAWMAN IN DEATH OF FELLOW OFFICER, ATTORNEY SAYS. 
HOWEVER, MINORITY LEADERS MAY AGAIN ASK FOR PROBE.

 Even as angry minority leaders called a countywide meeting to plan their next 
step over Sheriff's Deputy Brian P. Scanlan's fatal shooting of a fellow 
officer, some of Scanlan's supporters spoke out for the first time Friday to 
laud this week's grand jury decision not to indict him. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking a 10-week silence in the case, Scanlan's lawyer said in a statement 
that the Orange County Grand Jury acted wisely Thursday in averting a "double 
tragedy" by refusing to bring criminal charges against the Sheriff's Department 
training officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say that Scanlan, 32, and Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, 30, were 
running through an impromptu training exercise behind a Lake Forest movie 
theater during a slow Christmas Day patrol when the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official account of the incident released this week, Robins 
was playing the part of the driver in a car stop when, simulating a technique 
used by Los Angeles gang members, he reached for a small pistol hidden behind 
the sun visor of his patrol car to get the drop on the training officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A startled Scanlan -- who was holding a loaded gun in apparent violation of 
department training policies -- fired and shot Robins in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "No crime was committed, and perhaps the grand jury saw the wisdom of saving 
law enforcement resources for genuinely serious crime problems," said Scanlan's 
attorney, James A. Stotler, who had refused to talk about his client's case 
since the fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan's brother, Michael, a Long Beach police sergeant, said in an interview 
at his Garden Grove home that his younger sibling remains deeply shaken by the 
shooting but has been comforted by signs of understanding and compassion from 
the widow of the slain deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Scanlan said Rosemary Robins has passed along supportive messages to 
Brian through others. "That's what helped him -- her support. . . . A lot of 
different people and political groups were drawing sinister conclusions, and 
she didn't allow that to affect their relationship," he said. Associates have 
said Scanlan and Robins were friends on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts by Scanlan's supporters and law enforcement officials to bring to 
a close one of the tensest chapters in the 105-year history of the Sheriff's 
Department did little to mollify representatives of black and Latino groups, 
who have sharply questioned the handling of the case by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, a day of reflection after the grand jury's decision appeared to 
have embittered some black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of a system do we have here?" pleaded Van Roberson, president of 
the Baptist Minister Fellowship Conference of Orange County, who has helped 
form a coalition of black leaders to press for more information on the death of 
Robins, who was black. Scanlan is white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is dead, he's gone, what more information do you need to know that 
something is not right?" Roberson said. "Is that (grand jury decision) telling 
me that a black man doesn't mean anything in this community? You can shoot 
somebody and get away with it? 
</P>
<P>
 "A black man is nothing, he's almost less than a dog. If it was the other way 
around, if it was a black guy that shot this Scanlan, I guarantee you it would 
have been different." 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on pursuing the case, Roberson and other civil rights leaders planned a 
7 p.m. meeting Monday night at Tippen's Seafood, 1229 W. 5th St., in Santa Ana, 
to discuss the grand jury's decision and plan what steps they make take now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want everyone interested in this issue to come so we can get a consensus 
on how the county feels about this," said Randall Jordan, publisher of a 
black-oriented monthly magazine called Black Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority leaders acknowledge they have no evidence that race played a part in 
the killing, or in the way authorities handled it, and they have encountered 
charges from critics of inflaming the issue with racial rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But they nonetheless insist that the slow release of public information and 
the close relations between the Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office have only fueled suspicions of wrongdoing in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very lingering, ill ease within our community about this 
particular case," said Amin David, a Latino activist with Los Amigos of Orange 
County, who met with members of the grand jury several weeks ago to discuss 
this and other cases of minority interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said it had recommended to the grand jury that 
it indict Scanlan for involuntary manslaughter because of his "grossly 
negligent" conduct. But the panel -- in a rare rejection of the district 
attorney's recommendation -- decided not to indict. 
</P>
<P>
 David said the unusual nature of such a decision makes him wonder how 
strenuously prosecutors pushed for an indictment. "I don't have a sense that it 
was pursued with vigor at all. Had it been, the grand jury would have done the 
most reasonable thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley defended his office's handling of the 
case in an interview Friday, saying that "we went in with one of our best trial 
deputies and asked for an indictment. . . . There's not much more we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could have brought a criminal complaint on their own, but Conley 
said the office wanted to bring the case before the grand jury in order to test 
it against "the conscience of the community" and see how it might fare before a 
jury at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the law enforcement people (in the district attorney's office) agree this 
is horrible, but they're not the final line," Conley said. "You're getting into 
the gut feeling of a jury, rather than a panel of lawyers. A jury might see it 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the case of the grand jury, it did. 
</P>
<P>
 David and other minority leaders said they want to look at the possibility of 
renewing their calls for state and/or federal investigators to open their own 
investigations into the case -- if Robins' family supports such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robins' family members, who could not be reached for comment Friday, have 
appeared reluctant in the past to join forces with Orange County minority 
groups that have rallied around the cause. And state and federal officials 
interviewed Friday gave little indication that they would intervene in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at both the state attorney general's office and the U.S. attorney's 
office said they would likely consider reviewing the shooting if formally 
requested by someone in Orange County. But asked if there was any immediate 
indication of federal involvement, Jean Kawahara, assistant U.S. attorney in 
charge of the Orange County office, said: "I'm not aware of any." 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate inquiry will focus on the question of what disciplinary 
action may be taken against Scanlan and whether he will be allowed to return to 
the force. The Sheriff's Department will review the question, and Scanlan will 
remain on paid administrative leave pending a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said Friday that he had asked to see all evidence compiled 
by the district attorney and presented to the grand jury. Since grand jury 
matters are cloaked in secrecy, it is unclear how much of the evidence -- 
transcripts, interviews and reports -- will be available to the Sheriff's 
Department for its own investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through 90 days here of a lack of knowledge, and now we have a 
process that's taken place in the grand jury, and I'm not sure how much access 
we're going to have to that information," said Gates, expressing concerns over 
"all the unanswered questions that we all have." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan could not be reached for comment Friday, and his ranch-style house 
stood empty in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Michael, said the former Army private has been helped by ongoing 
therapy sessions and by the support shown by fellow deputies. "He's been real 
busy working on his house. Friends have been helping him by socializing with 
him, knocking a golf ball around with him," he said. And now, he will await the 
outcome of his administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Michael Scanlan added, "whatever happens to his career -- that's all 
secondary. He'll have to live with this the rest of his life."

DENTIST FILLING A NEED; HEALTH: DENTAL CARE FOR THE DISABLED POSES SPECIAL 
PROBLEMS, BUT ONE PROFESSIONAL SEEKS SUCH PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Jerry Minsky worked quickly on his patient in the Kaiser Permanente 
Hospital operating room here recently, quietly giving instructions to his 
anesthetist and two nurses as machines beeped and buzzed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such a setting may be typical for a heart or brain surgeon, but not for a 
dentist simply cleaning or filling teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Minsky is not your typical dentist. He is the only one in Southern 
California whose clinic targets people with disabilities, according to the 
California Dental Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Anaheim Hills resident, who works out of his clinic in the Los 
Cerritos Mall and at 10 local hospitals, sees 600 disabled patients annually, 
representing about half his practice. Their disabilities include mental 
retardation, cerebral palsy, autism, Parkinson's disease and severe arthritis, 
he said. Their ages range from 2 to 95 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of and organizations for the disabled say it is difficult to find 
dentists willing to take on such patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a major problem to locate a dentist," said Joanne Miner, executive 
director of United Cerebral Palsy of Orange County. "You have to find a dentist 
who is comfortable working with a patient who has special problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest," she said, "a lot of our people just go without dental care and 
their oral hygiene often needs a lot of work. They frequently lose teeth, then 
they can't chew properly, and that means they can't get the proper nutrition." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his disabled patients "have lost their teeth on their own before they 
even see us," Minsky said. "For others, their teeth are so loose or diseased by 
the time we see them, we have to pull them." 
</P>
<P>
 Minsky uses operating rooms and general anesthesia because many of his 
patients are unable to hold their mouths open voluntarily for long periods or 
are difficult to control. Given that situation, even the most routine dental 
procedure can be dangerous for a person with disabilities, Minsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of (the disabled) have overlying medical problems with their hearts or 
with something else, and we have to make sure those are adequately addressed 
before we treat the patient," Minsky said. "That's why I do a lot of the work 
in a hospital, because there are people available who have acute emergency 
medical training." 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Thompson, a Laguna Beach resident, said she searched for a long time 
before finding Minsky, who treats her son Gary, 25, who is autistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud what he does because it is not easy to deal with someone like my 
son," Thompson said. She said her son must be taken to the hospital and 
anesthetized for even the most minor dental work. "He would probably kick the 
doctor or bite him if he wasn't put to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Minsky, who received his undergraduate degree at Cal State Fullerton and his 
dental training at Georgetown University in Washington, began seeing patients 
with disabilities on a regular basis in 1986, four years after he left dental 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nursing home that had several mentally retarded patients was calling every 
dentist in the phone book trying to find someone to treat their patients," 
Minsky said. "These were patients who would need hospital care. I had hospital 
operating training, and I always enjoyed it, so I took the patients. That led 
to some referrals to some government agencies and a lot of word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Dental treatments for the disabled are costly, but Minsky says he is not 
getting rich doing it. Most disabled people's dental insurance is through the 
state Medi-Cal program, which pays only 25% as much as private insurers, Minsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is trying to reach out to younger people with disabilities, because 
if their problems become so advanced that the teeth must be pulled, the teeth 
cannot be replaced. Fitting a disabled person with dentures is rarely an 
option, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of their limited dexterity, disabled patients have a tough time 
putting dentures in properly," Minsky said. "And if the dentures dislodge, they 
can lodge in the back of the patient's throat. If the person can't reach back 
there and get them out, they can suffocate and die." 
</P>
<P>
 Treating the patients before serious problems arise, he said, results in 
happier patients who can lead healthier lives.

COURT IS LAST RESORT FOR REFUGEE BRIDE; LAWSUIT: STATE DEPARTMENT STYMIED 
IMMIGRATION OF VIETNAMESE WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The last time Bai Phan saw his wife, they had just exchanged marriage vows at 
a city hall in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he flew home to Westminster to begin the paperwork to bring his bride, 
Phuc Doan, to the United States. Doan, then 19, returned to the refugee 
detention camp in Hong Kong to count the days until the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in November, 1991. For the next three years, he says, he supplied 
whatever paperwork U.S. officials requested for her immigration. And still 
nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last month, Phan was notified that his wife was one of 10 Vietnamese the 
Hong Kong government planned to put on a plane and deport to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last-minute effort, the 28-year-old man joined a 250-plaintiff 
class-action suit, alleging that the U.S. government violated a federal act and 
discriminated against Vietnamese nationals who are in detention camps by not 
processing their immigration visa applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do or who to turn to," said Phan, a landscaper who 
immigrated to the United States in 1984 and who is now a naturalized U.S. 
citizen. "When I was told about the lawsuit, I knew it was my last chance -- my 
and my wife's last chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Phan and the other plaintiffs received an eleventh-hour reprieve when the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in an emergency meeting Sunday 
ordered the State Department to begin processing visas to prevent the forced 
repatriations. A hearing has been set for April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs, who include people in detention camps and their relatives in 
the United States, argued in the lawsuit filed Feb. 25 by the Virginia-based 
Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers that State Department officials 
had violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by refusing to issue visas to 
Vietnamese who applied. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, in turn, has said only "political refugees" as defined 
by international agreement may qualify for U.S. visas. For other immigrants, 
only their own countries can issue passage to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that Doan and about 26,500 Vietnamese "boat people" have been 
languishing in Hong Kong detention centers. The British colony hopes to empty 
the camps by the time the colony is returned to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 According to attorneys for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service already had approved immigration petitions for Doan and 
most of the plaintiffs. But the State Department then abruptly refused to 
continue the process.  
</P>
<P>
 "What the U.S. government has also done is it has given these people false 
hopes and now it's trying to pull the carpet out from under these people," said 
Dan Wolf, founder of the asylum group and lead attorney in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with Phan, alleged local group volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan and Doan first knew each other through correspondence. They had heard 
about each other through a mutual friend, and for two years, religiously wrote 
to one another. They finally met in 1991 and were married in the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the ceremony, we just sat across each other and smiled and were happy," 
Phan recalled, speaking in Vietnamese. "We didn't say much and didn't even hold 
hands because the camp security guard" who had escorted her to the ceremony and 
who would take her back "was watching us at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he said, he has done everything the INS requested.  
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, the INS informed him that the petition for his wife's 
immigration visa has been approved. All he had to do was pay the $834 to cover 
her transportation processing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid the money and I kept waiting for the day for someone to call me to 
tell me to go to the airport on such time and such date to pick up my wife," 
Phan said as he sifted through a pile of official documents, letters and 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead the U.S. consulate office in Hong Kong sent him a letter last December 
informing him that Doan would be sent back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the saddest and scariest day of my life," Phan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Doan "doesn't understand what's going on, and I don't know what to tell her," 
he said, still bewildered. "For the past three years, they tell me what forms 
to send and I send them. I thought I've done everything possible, so I can't 
even tell my wife what went wrong."

FUGITIVE HAS NO CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER; BURGLARIES: A FRIENDLY, CONVICTED THIEF 
WHO DEFTLY GUTTED UNIVERSITY COMPUTERS THROUGHOUT THE WEST IS ARRESTED NEAR HIS 
PRODUCE MARKET IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the story of a friendly fugitive who police say stole more than $1 
million worth of computer chips over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Avram Morar, 24, of Fullerton began his lucrative career in 1992, targeting 
University of California campuses and other schools in California, Oregon, 
Arizona and Washington state, according to Detective Mary Ranalli of the Cal 
State Fullerton police. 
</P>
<P>
 Morar, a Romanian national, allegedly sold the computer chips at swap meets 
and trade shows in Southern California and Las Vegas. With the proceeds, he 
bought a Mercedes-Benz and a Romanian produce market in Fullerton, Ranalli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morar's method of operation was unique: He would often scale the outside of 
buildings like the comic book character Spiderman, slip through unlocked 
windows, wrench open locked doors with lengths of pipe and remove the memory 
chips from computers, Ranalli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fellow knew exactly what he was after, exactly what he was looking for. 
He was quite gentle with the computers," a Portland, Ore., police official once 
said. "He simply opened them and took the parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranalli said she first came across Morar in May, 1992, when she arrested him 
in connection with the theft of about $50,000 worth of computer chips from Cal 
State Fullerton and Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 She was so intrigued by Morar's method of operation that she asked him if she 
could videotape him re-enacting a break-in, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Sure, I'll do it for you,' " the detective said, describing Morar 
as "charming" and "relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that cartoon 'Spiderman'? That's how that guy is. It was 
unbelievable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranalli said Morar's congeniality was also unique. "You get people in custody 
who deny and deny, then you get someone like Avram and you say, 'Now do you 
want to cooperate?' and he says, 'OK,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morar was convicted in October, 1992. He was fined $30,000 and sentenced to a 
work-furlough program in Fullerton. The following year, he left the program and 
burglarized Cal State Fullerton again, then fled to Washington state, Ranalli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, Morar and his wife left their 10-day-old infant with a nanny in 
Canada and returned to Fullerton. They shipped packages of clothes back to 
Canada for the baby, using a Fullerton return address, Ranalli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Morar was arrested trying to steal computer chips at the 
University of Washington. He was charged with felony burglary and released on 
$100,000 bail. He jumped bail, returning with his wife to Canada, where they 
retrieved their baby and fled back to Fullerton, Ranalli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morar started a fresh round of chip thefts, burglarizing UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC 
San Diego and Cal State Long Beach, Ranalli said. He also committed burglaries 
at the University of Portland in Oregon and at Arizona State University, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in part on the videotape Ranalli had made of Morar in 1992, the schools 
realized who their suspect was. Warrants were issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, NBC's "Prime Suspect" aired a story about Morar. When the Canadian 
nanny saw the show, she called California authorities to give them the 
Fullerton address, which turned out to be Morar's produce store. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday at 10 a.m., Ranalli and her partner Tom Gehrls went to the store 
and found Morar's Mercedes parked outside. A woman working there said she did 
not know where Morar was. But "we could hear movements in the ceiling tiles," 
Ranalli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Morar popped out from the crawl space above the ceiling and bolted 
from the store. He dashed across a parking lot and through an apartment complex 
and jumped into a drainage ditch, which police officers surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught him in a drainage ditch and gave him back," said Fullerton Police 
Sgt. Roger White, whose department was called in to help. "He ran like a deer. 
We surrounded him and cut off his escape, and when he saw there was nowhere to 
run, he gave up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranalli took Morar, who had bleached his hair and grown a mustache, to the 
police station, where he cheerfully confessed to the thefts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also offered some friendly advice: "You people got to learn to tighten up 
your security," he told Ranalli. 
</P>
<P>
 Morar, who is being held without bail in Orange County Jail, is expected to be 
extradited to Washington state. He is also wanted in Arizona and Oregon, as 
well as in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Ranalli estimates that Morar stole more than $1 million in 
computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he isn't going to be able to rip off the universities and cost taxpayers, 
and us, a lot of money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the fugitive, Ranalli said: "I wouldn't take him to dinner or a barbecue, 
but I like him because he cooperates, and we learn from him how the criminal 
mind works."

SLAIN OWNER OF RECORD STORE IS EULOGIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 400 people gathered Friday afternoon to mourn the death of Peidad 
Preciado, who was gunned down in the small, family-owned record store that she 
and her husband had painstakingly built from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 In a funeral service at Saint Matthew American Catholic Church, family and 
friends eulogized Preciado as a compassionate and determined woman, who 
persevered through hardships to make a better life for her family and 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started out from the bottom," said Preciado's 23-year-old daughter Cindy 
Preciado, who dropped her mother off at the Santa Ana store moments before the 
slaying. "But she kept building and building her businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very caring, very generous person. Everyone admired her for her 
strength. Not everyone had that kind of strength," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made no arrests in the killing of Preciado, who was shot in the 
face at point-blank range about 10 a.m. March 5 while opening her 
Spanish-language music store, "Discoteca Guadalajara." 
</P>
<P>
 Although police originally believed the attack was part of a botched robbery 
attempt, relatives said no money was stolen from the business -- one of three 
music and video stores the Preciado family owned in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the shooting, two men armed with handguns confronted and 
shot Preciado as she cleaned the store's glass display case, according to 
police. Conscious long enough to stagger outside, Preciado collapsed on the 
sidewalk, according to eyewitnesses. She was later pronounced dead at Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled in a late 1960s or early 1970s model car described as a 
beige, two-door compact hatchback with zebra-patterned seat covers, say police. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon, tearful mourners attending burial services at the Holy 
Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange struggled to understand the tragic killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the most perplexing thing to everyone here," said Helenee Cruz, a 
longtime family friend. "No one can fathom who would want to kill her." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would understand if she were involved in something illegal," added Cindy 
Preciado. "But the violent way she died . . . it just makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Peidad Preciado left Jalisco, Mexico, about 30 years ago, and started a family 
with her husband Ruben in Santa Ana. In addition to managing the family 
business, Peidad Preciado was active in church activities that included helping 
to feed the poor and sending much-needed medical supplies to Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a giving person. She never would turn anyone away," Cruz said. "She 
was the kind of person you didn't need to ask her for something, she would 
already know and give it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Peidad is survived by her husband Ruben, their three adult children, Cindy, 
Brenda, and Roland; her mother Marie Uribe, and father Elias Michel. She also 
leaves behind three brothers and one sister, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members say they will soon be offering a reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of her assailants. Anyone wishing to contribute to 
the reward fund can call (714) 490-3749.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FIRE OFFICIALS WARN ABOUT SOLICITATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in three years, the Garden Grove Fire Department has 
issued a statement disavowing telephone solicitors seeking donations for 
disabled Garden Grove firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Bill Dumas said the department felt compelled to issue a statement 
warning the public about misleading phone solicitations after receiving a rash 
of public inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that other fire departments, including those in Anaheim, Newport 
Beach, Fullerton and Orange, have complained about similar problems in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been receiving a number of complaints and inquiries throughout the last 
two or three weeks, and a severe increase in the last 10 days," said Dumas. 
"We're getting at least two or three a day, up to 15 a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Dumas said people have complained about callers who became abusive or 
threatening, or who falsely led them to believe that the solicitation was being 
made on behalf of the Garden Grove department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumas said that about 80% of the calls to his department involved 
solicitations apparently made by the Foundation for Disabled Firefighters, a 
registered nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kowalsky, president of the foundation, said it occasionally encounters 
such reaction from fire departments and that their complaints are baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been in existence since 1986. We're bona fide, registered with the 
state. We've had problems with one or two fire departments who don't like it 
because we help firefighters that they won't," he said. The foundation raises 
about $25,000 to $30,000 a year, according to Kowalsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was established by now-deceased firefighter Robert Greenwell in 
1986, and is a state-registered nonprofit charity organization affiliated with 
United Liberty Productions in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was founded purely with the interest of helping disabled firefighters and 
their families," said a United Liberty Productions official who declined to be 
named. "It doesn't call in the name of anybody but its own." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dumas said that the people who have called the department claimed the 
foundation does use names of local fire departments to mislead them. "I can't 
imagine that many people could be wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Liberty Productions official said the names of individual 
firefighters who received money raised by them were confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official showed letters from the Orange County Burn Assn. in 1990, the 
San Clemente Firemen's Assn. in 1989 and the UC San Diego Regional Burn Center 
in 1990 thanking the foundation for donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumas added: "We're not denying they don't have all the necessary paperwork. . 
. . We're (complaining about) . . . their tactics and process of solicitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chavez, president of the Anaheim Firefighters Assn., said the group 
caused the same flurry of complaints last year in Anaheim. "We've had some 
difficult experiences with this," he said. "It's been really frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Newport Beach firefighters union along with Fullerton and Orange 
fire departments distanced themselves from a variety show the foundation was 
organizing as a fund raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Liberty Productions official denied that the foundation has ever 
attempted to raise funds inappropriately, and suggested the Garden Grove 
department did not want the foundation competing with its own fund-raising 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dumas said, "These people are capitalizing on our reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 He, Chavez and other fire department officials encouraged the public to call 
the fire department whose name is used in any phone solicitation. AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; 7-YEAR PLAN UNVEILED FOR SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A seven-year spending plan for the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School 
District presented earlier this week includes provisions for a new elementary 
school in Yorba Linda and moving sixth-grade students to Kraemer Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plans proposed expenditures of more than $27 million, far more than 
the estimated income of about $17 million from developer fees and redevelopment 
income. District officials conceded they have no alternative funding source in 
mind, though they hope to develop some. The district budget this year is about 
$95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole list of different avenues we can explore," said district 
planner Mike Bailey. "But that is another step in the process. This report 
merely identifies the need." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan has not been approved by the district board, the top 
priority appears to be a proposal to expand Kraemer Middle School to include 
sixth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a $45,000 outlay designated for the current school year to 
design a larger commons and cafeteria area, the proposed expansion would cost a 
total of $1.3 million over the next seven school years. It would also add 
classrooms and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending plan also includes an allotment of $40,000 in 1995-96 to identify 
possible sites for a 10-acre elementary school in the eastern part of the 
district. It would most likely be in the northeast portion of Yorba Linda. 
During the subsequent three years, the plan allocates $4 million to purchase 
property, $5.1 million to build the school and $750,000 to furnish and equip 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the price tag for the five-page list of projects 
exceeded the anticipated revenue from school-designated developer fees, 
district officials nonetheless called the proposals essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed projects include renovation and expansion of Esperanza High 
School in Anaheim, renovation of Bradford Stadium at Valencia High in Placentia 
and the addition of high-tech labs to each of the district's high schools and 
middle schools. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CLUB TAKES PRODUCTIONS OFF CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of students and parents who had been involved in Fountain Valley High 
School's drama productions have moved off the campus to form their own 
community theater group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theater Arts Parents Assn., a booster club that in previous years raised 
money to put on plays and musicals at the high school, will present their first 
independent production, "Up the Down Staircase," Saturday night and next week 
at Kazuo Masuda Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The move defied a district decision that major productions would be held at 
the School for the Performing Arts at Huntington Beach High School. That school 
was started this school year for students districtwide interested in pursuing 
studies in performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But some involved in the Theater Arts Parents Assn. "wanted to keep the 
opportunity to put on their own productions," said president Marlene Peroutka. 
So they took the cast and crew of nearly 40 to another stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent and director Bob Hoxsie, who has worked with children's theater groups 
for more than 20 years, added, "We wanted to continue to do what we had been 
doing in previous years -- but we no longer were welcome on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Students such as senior Beth Foster, 17, a cast member of "Up the Down 
Staircase," opted to be part of that production because it gives her the chance 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't fit drama class into my schedule. Because of that, it means I 
can't have theater at my school? It's ridiculous. I don't like having one 
performance center," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, Peroutka said, the booster club raised money to put on one 
musical a year, a two-act play and theater workshops, and gave a senior the 
chance to direct a play in the spring. The group also gave out awards and 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We no longer wanted to be a part of Fountain Valley High School," Peroutka 
said. "It was doing no good to stay on campus because we couldn't do anything 
anyway: no more productions, no more awards, no more scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Gary Ernst that said under the district's new performing arts 
guidelines, the school agreed not to put on musical performances and a drama 
teacher was hired this year to teach beginning drama. 
</P>
<P>
 But some members of the booster club didn't agree with their new role on 
campus or the new drama program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some philosophical differences on who was going to control the 
program and the direction of the booster club," Ernst said. "A portion of this 
parent group chose to withdraw and form a community production group." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst said under the school's new theater program, classroom productions will 
be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is not compete with (the School for the Performing 
Arts) but still provide entry-level students theatrical experiences to help 
them get ready to go to the performing arts school if they choose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances of "Up the Down Staircase" will also be held Wednesday -- 
captioned for the deaf -- and Thursday at Masuda Middle School, 17415 Los 
Jardines West. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtain is at 7:30 p.m. for all performances. Tickets are $3 for seniors and 
students and $5 general admission. DEBRA CANO

<P>
 An eighth-grade student who brought a Swiss army knife to school has been 
expelled by the Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The unnamed student was expelled Thursday.The decision was announced at a 
school board meeting by Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has a "zero-tolerance" policy, under which any student who 
brings a weapon -- including any type of knife -- to school faces expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is pretty clear: You bring a knife, you're expelled," said Trustee 
Larry Crandall. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, brought the knife to an 
unidentified school on a key chain, district officials said. No further 
information on the incident was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said boy did not use the knife in a threatening way toward any student. 
He said the boy can apply next month to be allowed back into a district school. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsion is the fifth this school year attributed to a student bringing a 
weapon onto a campus, Sedlak said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 4 SAY THEY'LL FIGHT RECALL AS A TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four City Council members facing a recall election on June 7 have decided 
to fight the recall effort as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to present a united front," Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman said 
Friday."This recall is against an action by the council, not against us as 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters union is leading the effort to recall Bohman, Mayor Charles 
V. Smith and Councilmen Craig Schweisinger and Tony Lam over last year's cuts 
in the Fire Department budget that included layoffs of department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters contend that by approving the cuts, the council members 
placed public safety in jeopardy and that they therefore should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we did because it was fiscally responsible," Bohman said. "Either 
we increase taxes or make the cuts (to balance the city budget). We made the 
cuts. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the county Registrar of Voters certified that recall proponents had 
gathered more than the required 6,938 valid signatures for each petition to 
qualify for the ballot. On Wednesday, the council set the recall election for 
June 7, to coincide with the state primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the citizens' ballgame," Schweisinger said this week. Voters "have to 
decide who is telling the truth -- the firefighters union or the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gilbrook, president of the firefighters union, said this week that 
firefighters from around the country have sent in more than $100,000 in 
contributions to help in the recall effort. He said he is confident that the 
four council members will be ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election is the easy part," Gilbrook said. "The hardest part was to ask 
the voters to sign" the recall petitions. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; YOUTH EXPELLED FOR PELLET GUN INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Imperial Middle School student was expelled from the La Habra 
City School District this week for threatening to hurt three other students 
with a pellet gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grade student allegedly thrust the gun into another student's 
stomach and threatened to hurt him and two other teen-agers last week, said 
Supt.Richard A. Hermann. He said the four students were at a district bus stop 
on Walnut Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth pulled the trigger on the pellet gun, school board member Morrison 
M. Clements said. "There was no pellet but he did fire the" weapon, which 
resembled a .45-caliber gun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt, but Clements said the three students who were threatened were 
so frightened they reported the boy to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A police captain compared the pellet gun to a .45-caliber gun and said that 
the pellet gun could easily be mistaken for "the real thing," Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes the expulsion, the first of its kind in the past two years, 
will teach other students in the district a lesson: "Don't bring a gun to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members recently passed a policy prohibiting students from bringing any 
kind of weapon or replicas to school. Since school began this year, two 
students have been expelled for carrying knives to school.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; POLICE SUBSTATION OPENS IN SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has opened its first satellite station to help fight 
crime in the Irvine Spectrum, a sprawling business district where rows of 
office towers stand next to rows of tomato and pepper crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The station is in the Irvine Transportation Center and consists of a room with 
telephones, computers and other office equipment. Officers who patrol the 
Spectrum will use the station to make calls, file police reports and interview 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the station is not designed as a drop-in center for the public, 
officials said it will bring a needed law enforcement presence to a far-flung 
neighborhood that is more than five miles from the police headquarters on 
Harvard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geographically, the way the city is laid out, the main police station is at 
one end of the city," said Police Chief Charles S. Brobeck. "This gives 
(officers) a place to do their work without driving all the way back to the 
station and using all that time." 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping more officers in the area, Brobeck said, he hopes to increase their 
visibility and make it more convenient for the public to deal with the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrolling the Spectrum area is a beat like no other in the city, officials 
said. The area has practically no residential areas. Rather, the Spectrum's 
landscape is dotted with dozens of office buildings, research centers and 
business parks that are home to a variety of high-tech and biomedical 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The district -- near the intersection of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways 
-- is still growing. An amusement park and movie complex are planned in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the daytime, you have a very transient population of 100,000 people," 
said Lt. Bob Lennert, who is in charge of the satellite station. "But after 6 
p.m., you may have just a few hundred people. It's deserted, and that's a great 
opportunity for the criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in the area has remained steady over the last few years. Office 
burglaries are one common problem, but the Spectrum has also seen its share of 
more sophisticated white-collar crimes including embezzlement, said Lennert. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a residential burglary, you might lose $30,000 to $40,000 in property," he 
said. "At the Spectrum, (a thief) can pick up $100,000 in one sweep." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Spectrum workers are unfamiliar with the area and are sometimes unaware 
of suspicious activities, officials said. "They don't know their way around the 
area except to get in and out," Lennert said. "So you don't have the eyes and 
ears that know who belongs in there and who doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 One to four officers are assigned to the Spectrum, depending on the day and 
time. The substation will allow them to stay in the area for greater parts of 
their shifts and respond more quickly to calls, Brobeck and Lennert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will also give police a nearby office to conduct private 
interviews with witnesses or crime victims. Sometimes, workers or employers 
don't report illegal activities because they don't want uniformed police to 
come to their workplaces where other employees and clients might see the 
officers, Lennert said.SHELBY GRAD

</P>
<P>
 Baseball players ages 5 to 18 will play on four new diamonds at Woodfield Park

followed by the first pitch of the opening day game at 1:15 p.m.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER ALLOWING FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of the five City Council members said this week they favor legalizing 
fireworks and called for a public hearing on April 12 at which they may vote to 
allow the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department, which provides fire protection in Stanton, 
opposed legalizing fireworks when the council considered the subject a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William C. Estrada, who denounced fireworks a year ago, said at 
Tuesday's council meeting that he is ready to legalize them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has learned that most fires are caused by illegal fireworks, not 
the "safe and sane" type that the city might legalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safe and sane" is a designation given by the state to fireworks that have a 
limited amount of powder in them. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire department officials have said "safe and sane" fireworks still have 
the ability to wound people and start fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Harry Dotson said he wants to legalize fireworks so that nonprofit 
organizations can sell them to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said he would support a one-year trial legalization. Mayor Sal Sapien 
said he also favors lifting the ban on fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Don Martinez said he cannot vote to legalize fireworks. "We've 
seen the damage caused by fire -- it's tremendous," Martinez said. "I'm not 
going to be able to answer someone who has a child hurt, or has a home lost to 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd really like to hear from the public," said Linda J. Pappas Diaz, the 
newest member of the council. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CONSULTANT SOUGHT FOR STUDY ON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have begun looking for a consultant to study how much residents 
will need public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Tuesday directed City Manager Bruce Channing to find a 
consultant to study whether existing and proposed library facilities in 
neighboring communities will adequately serve Laguna Hills residents in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Channing estimated the study can be done for between $5,000 and $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has no county branch library within its boundaries and the county has 
no plans to build one. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents primarily use an overcrowded branch library on Chrisanta Drive in 
Mission Viejo. The county plans to build a 15,000-square-foot branch in Aliso 
Viejo by 1997 that is intended for Laguna Hills residents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials are concerned the Aliso Viejo branch may eventually prove 
inadequate as the community grows. And with Mission Viejo now considering 
whether to secede from the county system and build its own library, and county 
officials proposing a November ballot measure to create a new taxing district 
to pay for library services, Laguna Hills is faced with several variables that 
could affect its level of service, Channing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman L. Allan Songstad Jr. asked Channing if the city should hold off on 
the library study until after some of those questions are answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Channing said the city could respond faster if the city has a study detailing 
residents' library needs once Mission Viejo's and the county's directions are 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 When Laguna Hills incorporated in 1991, it signed a resolution agreeing to 
have the county provide it with library services. Whether the city could 
secede, in light of that agreement, is being studied by City Atty. Lois E. 
Jeffrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners in the city now pay a total of $538,000 a year in property 
taxes for library services. If the proposed taxing district is put on the 
November ballot and approved, it would require homeowners to pay $18 a year 
more, raising the annual amount to over $675,000, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about spending $500,000 a year for services we don't get," said 
Councilwoman Melody Carruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mayor R. Craig Scott: "Our community is woefully lacking in library 
service, and I don't think the county has kept its promise under the 
(incorporation) resolution." RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO VOTE ON COVER FOR EXPLICIT 
MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will vote Monday on whether to adopt an ordinance that 
requires blinder racks on sexually explicit materials sold within the city at 
grocery stores, drugstores and other retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance says that various magazines such as Playboy or 
Penthouse cannot be displayed publicly without a plastic coat or blinder rack 
that blots out the bottom two-thirds of the cover.City officials say there has 
been a proliferation of adult material in the city that must be shielded from 
minors, according to a report written by City Atty. Robert Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Clarence J. Turner said the city was "going about as far as we can 
possibly go without limiting people's right to . . . freedom of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 There is already a similar blinder ordinance on the books that applies to 
sidewalk newspaper boxes that contain information about escort agencies and 
usually have a provocative photo on the cover, said Robin Flory, assistant city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the ordinance would be a misdemeanor. The City Council will set 
the penalties if it approves the ordinance, police said.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; FORUM SCHEDULED ON PUBLIC SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seven-member Community Safety Advisory Committee, charged with improving 
safety for residents and local businesses, will host a meeting today to hear 
ideas from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be from 9 a.m. to noon at the Civic Center, 7800 Katella Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Harrison Hamada said the group, created in December by the 
City Council, has its final meeting on March 29 and will then make 
recommendations to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamada said the group has met with gang experts, community organizers and 
others from the county and state to develop a plan for a safer community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department, which provides police services to 
Stanton, has also been involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamada said some goals are to ask the council to increase code enforcement, so 
that neighborhoods are maintained in a clean and safe manner. 
</P>
<P>
 He said needs include more outreach to ethnic communities, safety programs for 
seniors, and better disaster preparedness. WILLSON CUMMER

NEW TRIAL SOUGHT BY 2 POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the three Huntington Beach police officers who in January lost a 
$105,000 judgment in a civil suit alleging they assaulted two brothers are 
asking an Orange County Superior Court judge to grant them a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the officers say Judge Logan Moore acted inappropriately when he 
issued a directed verdict in the case, a rarely used procedure that in effect 
took away the jury's power to decide the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides met Friday with Moore to discuss the officers' 
argument that they deserve a new trial, but no decision was made. Also at issue 
was the propriety of the law firm Moore & Rutter continuing to represent the 
officers despite the officers' claim that the firm may have botched their 
defense in the original case. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury awarded two brothers a total of $105,000 in January for a 1988 incident 
in which officers Steven E. Overcast, Thomas A. Tremblay and Raymond Villescas 
were accused of assaulting, cuffing and pointing pistols at the men, who were 
not charged with a crime. Overcast and Tremblay are asking for the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial came to an abrupt halt when Moore issued a directed verdict. 
The judge said he made the decision because, according to testimony from both 
sides, there was clearly a "constitutional violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore on Friday postponed the matter until the officers themselves come before 
the court to sort out the matter. He curtly told attorneys for the officers 
that they should review their roles in the case to ensure that no conflict of 
interest is present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should this turn up inappropriate behavior, I should remind you that the 
court has an obligation to forward these transcripts on to the Bar Assn.," 
Moore told attorneys Neal Moore, no relation to the judge, and Michael J. 
Emling, who represent the city of Huntington Beach and spoke on behalf of the 
officers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcast and Tremblay have filed statements saying they were unaware they were 
even being sued until just before the case came to trial. Overcast claimed he 
did not know he was a defendant until he arrived at the courtroom for the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers also said they were not consulted before the case began, nor 
did they consent to be represented by Emling, who argued their case. Overcast 
and Tremblay said those factors should earn them a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry L. Steering, attorney for the two plaintiffs, Miguel and Roberto Garcia, 
said he was stunned when he read the motion for retrial. He categorized the 
effort as a desperation maneuver, and questioned how lawyers would be able to 
argue a case after their earlier performance was criticized by the clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how these attorneys can stand before the court and zealously 
advocate that position," he told the judge. "Obviously, they can't. It's 
ridiculous."

REPORT URGES HIKE IN GARBAGE COLLECTION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The agency that manages Orange County's landfills faces a bleak future unless 
residents pay $1 more each month for garbage collection by the end of the year, 
and $4 more each month by 1998, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the increases, the Orange County Integrated Waste Management 
Department would lose money each of the next four years, with losses hitting 
about $87,000 by 1998, the independent report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you can't run a department like that," said Robert Hilton, whose 
Newport Beach consulting company spent 15 months preparing the report for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Should county officials decide to raise landfill fees, the cost would be 
passed on to residents through utility bills and charges from the various 
companies that haul trash in the county. Residents typically pay about $9 to 
$15 each month for trash pickup service, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of meeting increasingly stringent environmental regulations, the 
success of recycling efforts and a sluggish economy have combined to cut into 
the agency's cash reserves and the volume of waste going into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep pace, the agency must charge more to handle the refuse coming its way, 
according to the report by Hilton, Farnkopf & Hobson.  
</P>
<P>
 Murry Cable, the county's waste management director, said he will support the 
report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can't continue to do what we're doing without raising the fee," 
Cable said. "I think (the report) shows clearly what the situation is. The 
facts are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Waste Management Commission reviewed the report Thursday, but 
no action was taken. The commission will consider any fee changes at its March 
24 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the commission approve a fee hike, the matter would go to the Board of 
Supervisors in April for a final decision. A vote by the board to increase the 
charge would mean the rate could go into effect this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends the agency this year raise its gate fee, the charge that 
trash haulers pay for landfill admission, from $22.75 per ton to $27.66. 
</P>
<P>
 The report goes on to suggest an annual $5 hike in the rate each of the next 
three years, a proposal that would be considered by the commission on a 
year-by-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton said the Orange County waste management agency is feeling the same 
pressures that have caused counterparts statewide to charge trash haulers more. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of waste entering Orange County landfills has dropped 23% since 
1989, partly because of successful curb-side recycling campaigns and the slump 
in the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, an official of Orange County's Integrated Waste Management Commission 
proposed that it invite a limited number of Los Angeles haulers to dump about 
2,500 tons of garbage each day in county landfills. Last year, the commission 
voted to solicit bids from Los Angeles and San Diego to use Orange County 
landfills as a way of offsetting the cost of operating the landfills. But no 
significant bids were received. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasingly dense thicket of state and federal regulations also pose 
problems for the agency. Cable said regulations requiring new landfill lining, 
more monitoring systems and other improvements will cost the agency $38 million 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone agrees that there are too many new regulations," said Cable, 
who added that even the most environmentally minded members of his staff are 
against the barrage of rules. "The federal government has gone overboard." 
</P>
<P>
 At $22.75, Orange County's current gate fees are lower than nearby counties, 
such as Riverside ($34.50), San Bernardino ($34.50) and San Diego ($43). 
Sanitation districts in Los Angeles County, which operates larger landfills 
with multiple sources of income that other counties do not have, have the 
lowest fees, ranging from $15.94 to $23.22.

SLAYING SUSPECT, 14, MAKES COURT APPEARANCE; CRIME: HE DISPLAYS NO EMOTION 
DURING A HEARING ON THE FATAL STABBING OF AN 18-YEAR-OLD RANCHO ALAMITOS HIGH 
SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gregory Allen Callison, the 14-year-old boy accused of stabbing a Rancho 
Alamitos High School football star to death, made a brief first appearance at a 
juvenile court hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison, his long blond hair tousled, sat expressionless during the brief 
session, which was continued by Orange County Juvenile Court Commissioner 
Robert H. Keefe until Tuesday at the request of the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison will remain in Orange County Juvenile Hall until next week's hearing. 
He is expected to enter a plea then to a single charge of murder. At the same 
hearing, Keefe will also determine whether the teen-ager will be ordered to 
remain in custody until his trial or be released to his family, court officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Frank Ospino asked for the delay Friday, saying he had not 
had enough time to review the case. The public defender's office also has not 
decided who will represent the teen-ager, Ospino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 10-minute hearing, Callison never turned to look at his family 
members, who were seated in the second row of the courtroom. They left quickly 
and declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Moukda Chounlamany, 18, died after he was stabbed once in the chest Tuesday 
night in the 12700 block of Louise Street in Garden Grove. The stabbing came 
after a street confrontation over a dune buggy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany will be buried today at a funeral service in Costa Mesa. His 
father, Hansa Chounlamany, 56, said Friday that the family had not yet decided 
whether to follow the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the judge decides, we'll have to accept," he said. "This all feels 
very bad. My son was a nice boy. We don't know this boy they arrested. But we 
feel bad that he did something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Callison is a high school dropout from Riverside who had been living with his 
grandfather in Garden Grove, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age, Callison will be tried as a juvenile. If convicted, he 
could be sentenced to the California Youth Authority, where state law would 
require that he be released by the age of 25, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, prosecutors can only seek to try defendants aged 16 and older 
as adults, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill by Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-San Jose) would make juveniles 
as young as 14 who are accused of murder eligible for adult court.

JOHN WAYNE-BOUND JET MAKES EMERGENCY LAX LANDING 
</P>

<P>
 A Northwest Airlines flight headed for John Wayne Airport from Minneapolis was 
forced to make an emergency landing Friday at Los Angeles International Airport 
when it experienced a problem with the landing gear, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries among the 102 passengers and five crew members aboard 
Flight 111, said Northwest Airlines spokesman Doug Killian. The Airbus A320 
landed at 10:50 a.m. without incident after the pilot noticed a problem with 
one of the plane's hydraulics systems. It had been scheduled to arrive at John 
Wayne at 11:08 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers were then shuttled by bus to John Wayne, arriving about 12:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so scary that even the stewardesses were crying," said passenger Mary 
Alison Berry, 29, recalling the plane's shaking and the pilot's reassurances 
that just because emergency fire crews were sitting on the runway did not mean 
that the plane would crash. 
</P>
<P>
 As she waited for her parents to arrive at John Wayne, Berry said she heard a 
woman sitting behind her tearfully call her sister from a cellular phone, 
asking her to take care of her son if the plane did crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was all over. I fly a lot, so I don't usually get freaked out by 
much," said Berry, who works for a travel agency and is moving to Orange County 
from Boston. "But this time, I just grabbed the pillow and held it. I was 
thinking, 'Oh, God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Berry said the passengers were relieved when the plane landed but were 
disoriented when they stepped off the plane into the bright lights of 
television news crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry and other passengers said the shuttling of the passengers to John Wayne 
was somewhat chaotic and disorganized. In the confusion, the passengers were 
not given clear directions on where to go and were afraid they might miss the 
shuttle buses. 
</P>
<P>
 One shuttle bus with five passengers on board almost had to turn back to LAX 
when the driver realized the airline had forgotten to give him the vouchers for 
their trip. The passengers told the driver they would pay for it themselves 
rather than add another half-hour to their already long, harrowing day, Berry 
said. Northwest reimbursed them the $12 fee when they arrived at John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Killian said the plane's indication light for a problem with the landing 
gear's hydraulics system went on late in the flight. Although the plane had two 
backup systems, the pilot still conducted an emergency landing at LAX, which 
has longer runways than John Wayne Airport, he said.

SANTA ANA ASKS FOR CAMPING LAW REVIEW; PETITION: STATE SUPREME COURT MAY 
EXAMINE ORDINANCE DRAFTED TO CLEAR HOMELESS OFF CITY PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City of Santa Ana on Friday asked the state Supreme Court to review a 
controversial anti-camping ordinance criticized in a state appellate court 
decision as "a blatant and unconstitutional infringement on the right to 
travel." 
</P>
<P>
 The city drafted the 1992 ordinance to clear homeless people off city 
property, particularly the Civic Center plaza, which at that time was filled 
with makeshift dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 In its petition, the city says the 4th District Court of Appeal's decision 
last month "completely emasculates (the city's) constitutional police power to 
regulate and maintain public property for the benefit of the public at large." 
</P>
<P>
 The court has 90 days to decide whether to hear the case, said Assistant City 
Atty. Robert Wheeler, who filed the petition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a Washington-based 
group that is an advocate for the rights of cities, also filed a letter Friday 
with the state Supreme Court urging it to hear the Santa Ana case, said Mike 
Schroeder, the group's attorney in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argue that you can't take a look at the issue of the rights of the 
homeless in isolation," Schroeder said. "If you take away the parks and the 
public areas, you are disenfranchising and taking away the rights of another 
group. We argue that those rights should be considered." 
</P>
<P>
 William Wise, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society, which challenged the 
ordinance, said he thinks the case is specific to Santa Ana and that it 
therefore would not be appropriate for the higher court to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice (Thomas F.) Crosby (Jr.) made his decision specific to the way Santa 
Ana has treated its homeless," Wise said of the appellate ruling. "He spends a 
lot of time talking about the history of Santa Ana, beginning with homeless 
sweeps in 1988, and the taking of possessions from the homeless. There are a 
series of actions that predate this ordinance and indicate the city's hostility 
toward the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby's decision also said the ordinance would "turn the county jail into a 
poorhouse and thus . . . destroy liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 While the 4th District Court of Appeal was considering the matter in December, 
the city drafted another anti-camping ordinance that was narrower in scope, 
dealing specifically with the Civic Center area. The Legal Aid Society has 
challenged that ordinance as well and the matter will be heard in Orange County 
Superior Court in August, Wise said.

ACTIVIST PROTESTING FOOTHILL TOLLWAY HELD 
</P>

 An Earth First! activist who chained himself to a crane was arrested Friday at 
the construction site of the Foothill Transportation Corridor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Walter Beneville, 27, of Santa Ana was perched atop the 200-foot crane 
alone when deputies arrested him at 6 a.m. He had been there since 5 a.m. 
Thursday with enough food for several days, he told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers maneuvered the crane so that it was next to a bridge. Then they 
lowered him into the waiting arms of two sheriff's deputies, spokesman Lt. Dan 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental group claims the tollway, to run through eastern Orange 
County between the Riverside Freeway and Interstate 5, will destroy the habitat 
of several threatened species.  
</P>
<P>
 Beneville is being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail on 
charges of trespassing, tampering with a vehicle and obstructing an arrest, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Earth First! spokesperson said Beneville's action was "raising (our) fight 
against these roads to another level."

FEMALE UC FACULTY'S STATUS ASSAILED; ACADEMIA: UCI PANELISTS DESCRIBE WHAT THEY 
CALL CLOSED HIRING PRACTICES. ONE SUGGESTS THAT 50% OF FUTURE HIRES IN THE 
SYSTEM BE WOMEN OR MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A panel of 15 speakers at UC Irvine on Friday called the status of women 
faculty in the University of California system "outrageous" and said the 
situation is not improving. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel discussion was sponsored by several women's groups, including We 
Advocate Gender Equity, a group formed at UCI last year in response to UCI 
Medical Center's poor record of hiring and retaining women. The panel included 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) 
and three women who have sued UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 people listened as the panelists discussed what they say is an 
ongoing closed-hiring practice by an "old boys network," of stonewalling by 
administrators and of the millions of dollars spent on lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation of women in academia is "worse than 50 years ago, 
proportionately, and it's not getting better," said Susan Butler, co-chairwoman 
of WAGE. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha West, professor of law at UC Davis, presented statistics from her 
research showing that while 44% of the Ph.D.s issued nationwide in 1992 went to 
women, women comprised only 18% of the faculty in the UC system, compared to 
30% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the current rate of change among full professors, it will take another 83 
years for women to reach 50%," she said. "We are here today to speed up these 
rates of change." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that in the UC system, 50% of all future hires be women or 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Mosier, formerly a professor of ophthalmology at UCI, Leigh Segel, a 
professor at UC Davis Medical School, and Christine McGill, a professor of 
psychiatry at UC San Francisco, discussed their lawsuits that alleged 
discriminatory actions of hiring and tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe what faculty chairs and university administrators are doing is 
illegal and immoral," said Segel, a WAGE co-chairwoman whose seven-year lawsuit 
against two male supervisors was settled in 1993. She said the university 
system is still promoting less-qualified white men to tenure track positions. 
</P>
<P>
 UC officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres called the situation of women faculty in the UC system "outrageous," 
and said he would take copies of the testimonies to the state Legislature 
before the next budget hearing.

PRIMARY CANDIDATES HURRY TO BEAT DEADLINE; POLITICS: MUCH OF THE TALK FOCUSES 
ON WHO ISN'T RUNNING AS FILING PERIOD ENDS. SEVERAL REPUBLICANS DROP OUT FOR 
SAKE OF PARTY UNITY, WHILE 1994 OFFERS DEMOCRATS 'HOPE FOR UPSETS,' OFFICIAL 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Candidates seeking to run in the June 7 primary rushed to beat Friday's filing 
deadline, but the talk among political watchers centered more on those who 
decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the outbreak of intraparty squabbles in two Assembly races, several 
Republican candidates withdrew Friday, the filing deadline for candidates 
seeking local, state and congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas Fuentes lauded the candidates for setting 
aside their own political ambitions for the sake of "party unity." 
</P>
<P>
 For county Democrats, 1994 offers the "hope for upsets," Orange County 
Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia predicted. "We have a wonderful set 
of candidates this year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' quest to expand their political base is most evident in the 
46th Congressional District in central Orange County, where six Democrats have 
lined up to take on the incumbent, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan was one of three of the county's Republican congressmen who will 
not face any opposition in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two are Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who drew only 
one Democratic opponent, and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), who will face a 
Democrat and a Libertarian in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent Republican drawing the most opponents in the June 7 primary was 
freshman Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), who is under federal investigation 
for alleged campaign finance irregularities during his first election in 1992. 
Four Republican challengers signed up for the primary. The Democratic primary 
drew one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the attention was focused on the 70th Assembly District seat being 
vacated by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Republican power brokers met with some of the candidates in recent days to 
whittle down their number in an attempt to diminish the risk of losing the 
nomination to a moderate Republican. Their efforts proved successful when three 
previously announced candidates -- attorney Phillip B. Greer, business owner 
Scott McDougle, and attorney Bruce Peotter -- abandoned the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Republicans remaining in the hunt include Marilyn C. Brewer, a 
businesswoman who also serves as an aide for Supervisor Thomas F. Riley; Irvine 
Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who picked up additional political endorsements as 
Greer left the race; and Newport Beach attorney Thomas G. Reinecke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important there be a unified and joint effort for the sake of the 
nomination of conservative candidates," Fuentes said. "I think there will be a 
very clear choice of liberal versus conservative candidates" in the Republican 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), who was among those trying to talk 
candidates out of running, said: "There was a consensus that some of the people 
were spinning their wheels and it didn't make a lot of sense for them to be in 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Greer's short-lived candidacy had drawn significant financial and political 
backing but became a lightening rod of controversy among conservatives. He said 
in a prepared statement that he withdrew out of concern the conservatives would 
split the vote and allow "a moderate or even liberal Republican to win the 
nomination. I could not allow that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Peotter echoed the sentiment. "I don't feel that the conservative vote should 
get split and allow someone who's not conservative to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative Republicans' target is Brewer, who describes herself as the 
"only conservative mainstream Republican" in the race. She was the founding 
president of a bipartisan political group designed to help female candidates in 
local and state races. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District in central Orange County, a heavily minority 
area where the Republican Party hopes to take away the only legislative seat 
now held by an Orange County Democrat, Santa Ana school board member Rosemarie 
Avila did not return her nomination papers. She had been the only Latina 
seeking the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday would have been the filing deadline for three seats up for election on 
the Board of Supervisors. But with two incumbents choosing not to seek 
reelection, the deadline for those two seats was extended until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three supervisorial races, the most competitive contest is the 2nd 
District seat being vacated by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. Businesswoman 
Haydee Tillotson and Huntington Beach City Council members Linda 
Moulton-Patterson and Jim Silva are widely considered the main contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, the first woman to serve on the Board of Supervisors, is retiring in 
January after 16 years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 5th Supervisorial District, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) was the first to announce her candidacy to succeed Riley, who is 
retiring. Bergeson so far is the only candidate seeking the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisor William G. Steiner drew a challenger in Anaheim community college 
professor Phil Knypstra, a critic of government waste and inefficiency who 
regularly appears before the Anaheim City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County Marshal Michael S. Carona said that he will not run against 
Sheriff Brad Gates but will instead return more than $20,000 to supporters who 
had contributed to his early candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Carona said his campaign hinged on Gates' intention to seek the office of 
lieutenant governor. When Gates decided to remain in Orange County, Carona said 
his own candidacy became "a different story. . . . I guess it's just not in the 
cards this time." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dennis Patrick O'Connell, an Anaheim attorney, announced that he will run 
against Claude E. Whitney, a Municipal Court judge in Santa Ana who is now 
under investigation by the state Judicial Performance Commission. The watchdog 
agency, which monitors the state judiciary, is looking into whether Whitney 
denied basic constitutional rights to hundreds, if not thousands, of defendants 
who appeared before him between June and December of 1992. Whitney has denied 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The only city holding a council election in June is Dana Point. It promises to 
be a wide-open affair, chiefly because two of the three incumbents have opted 
not to run for reelection. Council members Eileen Krause and Mike Eggers, both 
members of the young city's charter council, announced in recent weeks they 
would not seek new terms. 
</P>

report. June 7 Primary Candidates

DUCKS END GOAL DROUGHT, LOSE GAME TO BLACKHAWKS; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM FINALLY BREAKS 
THROUGH AFTER MORE THAN THREE GAMES WITHOUT A SCORE, BUT CHICAGO WINS, 3-2. 
</P>

<P>
 The goal of the game, after all, is to score goals.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks finally accomplished that task Friday night -- after a 
scoreless streak of 200 minutes 26 seconds over five games, three of them 
shutout losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other goal of the game -- scoring more goals than the other team -- 
continued to elude them in a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in front of 
17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get shut out, 3-0, or lose, 3-2, we still lost the game," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "But the bottom line is we took a step this time by scoring a 
couple of goals." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bigger step than it should be at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks -- blanked by San Jose, Chicago and Buffalo this week -- were the 
first team to be shut out three consecutive games since the 1988 Minnesota 
North Stars. And though the NHL record is eight, league statisticians were 
having difficulty determining when a team last was shut out four consecutive 
games. The Ducks managed to avoid making it obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 They were behind, 1-0, with Chicago on a power play when Bob Corkum stepped in 
and picked off Jeremy Roenick's cross-ice pass from near the left point. Corkum 
was off on a breakaway. To end up without a goal again would have been 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corkum faked Belfour with his head and shoulders, stickhandled, pulled up 
and tucked the puck inside the right post at 12:03 of the first period, finally 
ending the scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a sigh of relief," said Corkum, who scored both goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal ended Chicago goalie Ed Belfour's shutout streak at 143 minutes 25 
seconds. He blanked the Ducks at Phoenix on Tuesday and did the same to the 
Kings at the Forum on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Corkum's (hard) shot, Ed Belfour probably didn't expect that," Wilson 
said. "The move he made I've only seen a couple of guys do. He stopped, faked 
and went to his forehand. That requires a lot of skill." 
</P>
<P>
 From the crowd's reaction, you'd have thought the Ducks had never scored a 
goal. The celebration went on for minutes -- and frankly, it wasn't that 
different from the one on opening night Oct. 8 when Sean Hill scored the first 
goal in franchise history.  
</P>
<P>
 That isn't what the Ducks have been working for, though. Only last Sunday, 
they had an opportunity to cut San Jose's lead in the race for the last Western 
Conference playoff spot to one point. The Ducks' 6-0 loss started the shutout 
spiral, and after four consecutive losses they are eight points behind with 14 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistically, it probably is slipping away, but we haven't been thinking 
about it too much," Corkum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right after Corkum scored short-handed, the Ducks got another golden 
opportunity with Joe Sacco out on another short-handed breakaway, but his shot 
went wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe Sacco may have missed on what would have been the turning point," Wilson 
said. "Joe made a great move and the puck bounced over his stick. He had Ed 
Belfour dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Roenick won the game for Chicago, breaking a 2-2 tie at 16:43 of the second 
when he beat Guy Hebert from the top of the right circle for his 36th goal of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the guys I would get one back for them," Roenick said, referring to 
the bad pass that created Corkum's breakaway. "It was my fault, I read the play 
bad, and I needed to get one for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Goulet gave the Blackhawks the lead at 5:28 of the first, and Patrick 
Poulin made it 2-1 when he deflected Chris Chelios' shot at 17:16 of the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corkum, having broken the ice, scored again from low in the right circle 
off a pass from Peter Douris, tying the score, 2-2, at 7:55 with his 
team-leading 22nd goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum had a few chances for a hat trick, missing a rebound opportunity, and 
later missing on a backhanded shot from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks came up empty -- just not empty enough to set any records. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</P>
<P>
 With their problems scoring the last week, the Ducks really could have used 
Paul Kariya. C8

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD; THIS IS THE WEEK DISNEY'S TEAM NEEDED 
KARIYA'S HELP ON OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the final chapter of the Mighty Ducks' first season is finally written, 
what will stand out most of all? 
</P>
<P>
 That they were playoff contenders in March? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that Disney paid Nancy Kerrigan, who might never skate competitively again, 
$2 million for her life story plus other endorsements and considerations, but 
couldn't come to terms with Paul Kariya? 
</P>
<P>
 This was the week they could have used Kariya, losing four games and falling 
out of contention for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the week they simply couldn't shoot straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was fatigue, bad offense, bad luck or great goaltending by Arturs 
Irbe of San Jose Sunday, Ed Belfour of Chicago Tuesday and Friday and Dominik 
Hasek of Buffalo Wednesday, the bottom line was the Ducks needed offensive help 
and didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen too much of (Kariya), but he's an offensive talent," forward 
Tim Sweeney said after the Ducks' 3-2 loss to Chicago Friday night. "He could 
help every team in the NHL. He would give us a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early in the year, if it wasn't one line scoring it was another. It just so 
happened nobody was getting the bounces around the net (this week)." 
</P>
<P>
 Where would a guy who was compared to Wayne Gretzky during the Olympics fit 
into the mix? 
</P>
<P>
 Try anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways the Ducks are victims of their own success. With a victory over 
San Jose on Sunday, they could have been within one point of the Sharks, 
holders of the coveted eighth playoff spot. After a winless week, they're eight 
points back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we've played above expectations," Sweeney said. "When we play well 
people expect us to do more." It seemed all the more reason to get Kariya 
signed and in uniform before it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL season, 84 games and countless airline miles long, is a grind. 
Thursday, Coach Ron Wilson gave the Ducks a day off, hoping the rest would 
allow them to snap out of their offensive funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the guys took the day away from the rink and went golfing," said Bob 
Corkum, who snapped the Ducks' 200-minute 26-second scoreless streak when he 
beat Belfour on a breakaway 12:03 into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Kariya, rest seemed to be the best antidote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say the scoreless streak was his fault, but when Corkum beat 
out Terry Yake in the battle to become the first Duck to score 20 goals, he 
seemed to hit the wall offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Corkum hadn't scored since recording his 20th goal in a 6-3 
victory over Philadelphia on Feb. 16 at Anaheim Arena, a span of 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake's own drought was extended to eight games, dating to his 20th goal in a 
4-2 loss at Buffalo Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum and Yake lead with team with 48 and 45 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' powerless power play, ranked 25th of 26 NHL teams at 14.5%, was 
even worse against the Blackhawks this season. They clicked at a 10% rate (two 
for 20) in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago wasn't much better against the Ducks, however, scoring twice in 16 
opportunities (12.5%). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Jeremy Roenick couldn't miss Friday, connecting on one goal and 
three thunderous checks. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the best hit of the night was a blue-line collision with Troy Loney, 
sending each player flying. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the hardest check at Anaheim Arena this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, by the way, Roenick's goal was his team-leading 36th and proved to be the 
game-winner.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; WILL SUCCESS SPOIL MOE, STREET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ski beat is so fickle. Less than a month after declarations of impending 
Olympic doom for U.S. skiers, we now consider whether success will spoil them. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Bill Johnson, the 1984 Olympic downhill champion who called his shot 
at Sarajevo, became a hero, was party to a painful made-for-TV movie, then 
skied off into the sunset? 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to track the two U.S. Alpine stars to emerge from the 
Lillehammer Games: Tommy Moe and Picabo Street. We exempt from concern veteran 
Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, the women's super-G gold medalist, who plans to retire 
after this month's World Cup finals at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, 24, kick-started America's four-medal Olympic effort with his dramatic 
opening-day victory in the men's downhill. He followed with the silver in the 
men's super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, 22, threw a bear hug around fame after taking the silver in the 
women's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the tough part. When we last left Moe, he was trying to reschedule 
an appearance on "The Late Show With David Letterman" as he sorted through his 
endorsement possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The whirlwind has already affected Moe's performance. Last weekend, at Aspen, 
Colo., he finished 55th and 19th in his first two World Cup downhills after his 
Olympic victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe acknowledged that he was dragging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have the edge right now," he said after the Aspen races. "I'm 
kind of out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe lacks Street's marketable personality and catchy name, but he left Norway 
as the first U.S. male skier to have won two medals in the same Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's silver might not carry as much weight on Madison Avenue, but it 
ensures that she will not be denied her 15 minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern: Moe and Street are impressionable. Both were successful 
rehabilitation projects. Moe overcame earlier problems with marijuana and 
untamed adolescence. Street is, by nature, a spitfire who was suspended by the 
U.S. ski team three years ago because she lacked a work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have a lot more to offer. Coaches think Moe can develop into a four-event 
skier to rival Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 This hope is based on two solid slalom runs Moe made in placing fifth in the 
Alpine combined. He has a long way to go in slalom, and playing catch-up won't 
be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to get that last second to the top," said Aamodt, who is not 
shaking in his boots just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, passed over as an Olympic starter in the super-G, should be scoring 
much better in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the racer most affected by the cancellation of the make-up super-G 
Friday at Mammoth Lakes. After finishing 12th in Wednesday's super-G, she 
needed another solid finish to qualify for next week's super-G in the World Cup 
finals at Vail. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the top 20 in each discipline are guaranteed starts in the finals. Street 
does not rank among the top 20 in super-G, but with a strong finish Friday she 
could have qualified as an at-large seeded skier based on overall World Cup 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Street will compete only in next week's downhill, the event in which she 
won the silver at Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 If success doesn't destroy or distract them, Moe and Street could be bigger 
stars at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Alpine Director Paul Major said the team will take its cues from Moe, the 
Pied Piper of Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true test of a champion is, are they going to come bouncing back?" he 
said. "The thing we want to do with Tommy is avoid those mistakes. Tommy's got 
such a good head on his shoulders -- he realizes there's going to be lot of 
pressure on him. There's a lot of potential to commercialize him. That's fine, 
given that he can still ski and train properly. But he's got his feet on the 
ground."

PREP BASKETBALL REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; MATER DEI, CRENSHAW TAKE CENTER 
STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school basketball in Southern California tries to take a step up in 
national prominence tonight when Crenshaw and Mater Dei meet in the Division I 
Regional final at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Area teams and players have lacked the respect given their counterparts in the 
Midwest and on the East Coast over the years, but they have been gaining 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei enters tonight's game with a 33-0 record and No. 2 national ranking 
by USA Today. Crenshaw, the defending State champion, is 27-2 and ranked No. 5 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the pressure is an expected sellout of 17,100 and a live television 
audience. Anyone getting turned away at the door can watch Channel 9, which 
begins its broadcast at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout would set a record for the largest crowd to watch a high school 
basketball game in California. The live telecast is also a firstfor the 
Southern Regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other states go crazy for high school basketball, and our staff felt Southern 
California also has a lot of interest," said Susan Stratton, who will direct 
tonight's telecast for Channel 9. "We think there is a big audience for this. 
There certainly is enough talent out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei breezed through the regular season unchallenged, its only close game 
a 65-59 victory over Edison in the Southern Section Division I final last 
Saturday. Coach Gary McKnight chewed his team out after the game for a 
lackluster performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw started the season impressively, winning a tough national tournament 
in Florida in December. It spent one week in the No. 1 spot in USA Today before 
dropping two games during a holiday tournament in South Carolina the following 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars come into tonight's game having won 17 in a row.

PREP NOTES; LYNCH IS LEAVING COSTA MESA TO COACH CAPISTRANO VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa water polo Coach Jason Lynch has resigned to take over the 
Capistrano Valley program, Lynch said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In five seasons at Costa Mesa, Lynch led the Mustangs to five Pacific Coast 
League titles and three appearances in a Southern Section final.Costa Mesa won 
the Division III title in 1992 and lost to Pasadena Poly, 12-11, in overtime in 
the 1993 final. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch takes over at Capistrano Valley for Don Cholodenko, who resigned after 
the season to spend more time with his family and concentrate on coaching the 
school's swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who lives in Mission Viejo, said the proximity to work was one reason 
he accepted the new job. He also said he wanted to coach at the Division I 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it was an emotional decision for me to make," Lynch said. "But 
someone told me that I've done everything at Costa Mesa that I can do, so it's 
time for a new challenge. I agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who will also teach biology and life science at Capistrano Valley, 
expects to start next month. MARTIN BECK

RAMS MAKING THEIR PITCH FOR OILERS' TACKLE DONNALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Rams met Friday with Houston offensive tackle Kevin Donnalley, a 
restricted free agent, and will open discussions Monday with his agent 
regarding an offer sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams tender such an offer and Houston chooses not to match it, the Rams 
will have to surrender their third-round pick in next month's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a social gathering and I was wined and dined," Donnalley said after 
visiting with Coach Chuck Knox. "No offer has been made, but they said they 
would give my agent an offer Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley, 6-5 and 305 pounds, started the first six games for the Oilers last 
season and earned $275,000. The Rams say Donnalley, 25, who has eight starts in 
his three years in the league, has the ability to become their starting left 
offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Kevin we would talk to his agent Monday," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior 
vice president. "I have no idea what they're looking for in a contract. If the 
numbers make sense then we would probably be inclined to do something. I assume 
they have an interest in coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley might be in favor of playing here, but the Oilers have indicated 
they will match an offer for Donnalley unless such an offer includes a large 
base salary for 1994, which would then hurt them in their attempt to stay below 
the NFL salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Donnalley, the Rams have an interest in Houston wide receiver 
Haywood Jeffires. Jeffires, who has 386 receptions for 4,652 yards with 33 
touchdowns, is expected to visit Rams Park on Monday.

VENTURA TAKES IT TO LIMIT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PIRATES RALLY FROM NINE-POINT 
DEFICIT TO DEFEAT RIVERSIDE, 87-83, AND ADVANCE TO STATE FINALS FOR THE SECOND 
YEAR IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They toyed with disaster but in the end, the Ventura College Pirates proved 
why they are the state's top-ranked basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates had to stage a late rally to beat Riverside, 87-83, in the 
semifinals of the state championships Friday at the UC Irvine Bren Events 
Center and advanced to the title game for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates lost to Columbia, 97-88, in the championship game last year at the 
University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell of a comeback for our guys," Ventura Coach Philip Mathews said. "Our 
defense again was excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (36-2), seeded No. 1, will meet Long Beach City (31-6) in the final 
tonight at 7:30. The Vikings reached the title game with a 97-77 pounding of 
Chaffey. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second title-game appearance for Long Beach in the last four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates defeated Long Beach, 71-68, in a nonconference game at Ventura on 
Dec. 22. It was the only game of the season between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura couldn't gain control of the game until the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:51 to play, point guard Joey Ramirez hit a three-point shot to give 
Ventura an 82-79 edge and the Pirates hung on until the end.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a sophomore from Santa Paula High, scored the last point of the night 
on a free throw with 10 seconds remaining after center Michael Tate had iced 
the game moments earlier with a pair of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 As he has throughout the season, sophomore forward Brandon Jessie led the 
Ventura charge with a game-high 26 points. For Jessie, who scored 28 points in 
a first-round win over Cosumnes River on Thursday, it has been quite a return 
to his old stomping grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win out here (tonight), it will be extra special," said Jessie, who 
attended Huntington Beach Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the first half was a seesaw battle in which the lead changed hands 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura didn't lead by more than two points in the half and in one stretch 
trailed by nine, 35-26, with 5:29 remaining until intermission when Riverside 
guard Raimonds Miglinieks hit a three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, a 6-foot-3 sophomore from Latvia who was the most valuable player 
in the Orange Empire Conference this season, riddled the nets with 13 points in 
the first half. Teammate Darryle Flicking also had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But tough coverage by Tracy Lundy and D'Mitri Rideout in the second half 
limited Flicking, who finished as California's career scoring leader with 1,991 
points, to 10 post-intermission points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we could hold him under 25 (points), we could win the game," 
Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates bounced back, cutting the Riverside advantage to 42-41 at the half 
as Jessie scored nine of the last 13 points by Ventura. Miglinieks finished 
with 23 points and Tate had 19 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the seventh consecutive for Ventura over Riverside, dating to 
the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura shot 47.8% (32 of 67) from the field and 70.8% (17 of 24) from the 
free-throw line. Riverside shot 48.6% (34 of 70) and 58.8% (10 of 17).

ALEMANY KEEPING ITS FOCUS; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: DESPITE SLEW OF DISTRACTIONS, 
INDIANS (30-0) CAN PLAY FOR STATE TITLE -- IF THEY BEAT WOODBRIDGE (31-0). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Highlights from Alemany High's season on the brink: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The coach gave birth to her first child early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Earthquake damage forced closure of the school and its gym. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A knee injury ended the senior season of key guard Kathy Brown more than a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the eve of the team's biggest game, the coach had to scramble to find a 
practice site. She forgot to secure a gym because she had been so focused on 
the previous night's playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Distractions? Team Tumult has boxed them out. The Indians have won all 30 of 
their games, the Southern Section Division II-A championship and are one game 
away from the state final. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's it all worth? 
</P>
<P>
 Depends when you asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose one game between here and the state final, it's like we've fallen 
short," Coach Melissa Hearlihy said a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Great expectations. Now, only one game -- the Division II Southern Regional 
State final against Irvine Woodbridge at 1:30 today at Anaheim Arena separates 
the Indians from their stated goal of playing in Friday's state championship 
game at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hearlihy amended Friday, the Woodbridge game will not make or break the 
season. She was not selling short her team's goal but appreciating a season 
defined as much by its difficulties as its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through a baby, we've gone through an earthquake," she said. "To 
make it to the final four in the state. . . . There's a lot . . . we're going 
to be able to list as positive things that happened over the course of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this point on, we just want to play well. We want to finish the season 
peaking, and play like we did Thursday night (in a 68-51 victory over Mission 
Bay). That was probably our best game of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 In that game, Alemany center Carly Funicello illustrated how dominating she 
can be, scoring a personal-best 30 points and grabbing 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her teammates, senior forward Zevette Mitchell (average of 10 points a game) 
and junior guard Kelly McKay (12 points) are unsung but key players. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Alemany revolves around Samantha Rigley (17-point average), a junior 
forward who sometimes plays like a point guard. She is the team's emotional 
fulcrum. Her attitude and refusal to lose are as important as her passing and 
three-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in her bad games, she leads us in other areas besides shooting," 
Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley and Co. face their toughest opponent of the season in Woodbridge 
(31-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty much a mirror image of us," Hearlihy said. "They've got two 
post players who can score and a wing player who's quick and can shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Alemany, Woodbridge is a balanced team. Four Warrior starters average 
more than 10 points, led by guard Jamie Oenning 13.3. The others are: center 
Angela Burgess (12.7), forward Melanie Pearson (11.4) and guard Erin Stovall 
(11.1). 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had only one day to prepare for each other, and for Alemany, it 
didn't go quite as planned. Hearlihy had to call several schools to secure a 
gym for a Friday evening practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so worried about (Thursday's game), I forgot to get a gym," she said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians settled on Bell-Jeff. Their thoughts, however, were on Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to (Anaheim) is all everyone can talk about today," Hearlihy said. "I 
just hope it doesn't cloud our focus of what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She shouldn't be too worried. If a 6.8 earthquake can't do it, a trip to the 
newest Disney creation doesn't have much chance.

COOK HEATS UP IN NORTHRIDGE WIN; COLLEGE BASEBALL: SECOND BASEMAN BELTS HOMER 
AND DOUBLE TO LIFT CSUN PAST HAWAII, 10-8. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It had been so long since he'd said so long , Keyaan Cook needed a refresher 
course in the lost art of the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge second baseman hit seven homers last year, but hadn't 
muscled one out in the first 19 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour before his mates showed for their Western Athletic Conference opener 
against Hawaii, Cook took extra batting practice in an attempt to regain his 
power stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get the feel of hitting one out," he said. "I haven't hit the 
ball completely good." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook crushed two balls for extra bases Friday, including his first homer, as 
Northridge downed 24th-ranked Hawaii, 10-8, at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wind blowing out, it was like old times for the Matadors, who racked 
up eight extra-base hits, including a season-high four homers. The Matadors 
(10-10) managed 10 homers over their first 19 games, 17 of which were played on 
the road. "It was nice not being on a bus for a couple of hours," said Cook, 
who also doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 A bus token would have come in handy for the outfielders tracking the blasts 
hit off Hawaii right-hander Bobby Moore. Josh Smaler, Eric Gillespie and Tyler 
Nelson also homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's leadoff homer in the fourth tied the score, 3-3, but the inning was far 
from over. Gillespie, a freshman who recently was elevated to the leadoff spot, 
followed with a two-run homer. His run-scoring double in the eighth extended 
the Matador lead to 8-6 and chased Moore (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, who leads the team with four homers and 27 runs batted in, raised 
his average to .376. So much for the transition from high school. "I'm hoping 
this is it," Gillespie cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters after Gillespie's double, first baseman Jason Shanahan doubled on 
reliever Mark Johnson's first pitch to drive home two runs for a seemingly 
comfy 10-6 lead. It turned out, however, the Matadors needed the runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Contreras (3-3) threw his sixth complete game in as many starts, but it 
was no slam dunk. Last year, he beat Hawaii, 6-0. This time, his shutout was 
history before an out was recorded. Hawaii scored three times in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't panic," Coach Bill Kernen said. "Probably because we're so used to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras gave up a two-run homer to Dean Hashimoto in the ninth to bring 
Hawaii within 10-8, and two out later, Trey Garman doubled to bring the tying 
run to the plate. Yet Contreras struck out Chad Drown -- on his 163rd pitch -- 
and slammed his glove to the ground as he stared down the Hawaii dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the game, the Rainbows sang and clapped in unison after 
Contreras allowed a hit. And he allowed 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just fired me up," Contreras said. "Go play softball if they want to do 
that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, like his four teammates, play long ball.

WHITLOCK, JEFFERSON NAMED ALL-STARS, TO PLAY FOR TARKANIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback's Tes Whitlock and Antoine Jefferson will get a chance to play for 
coaching great Jerry Tarkanian in a community college all-star game at 5 
tonight at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian is coaching the South team and Larry Cummins, the former Monterey 
Peninsula coach, is in charge of the North team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian's teams dominated the state community college ranks in the 
mid-1960s. Tarkanian led Riverside to State titles in 1964, 1965 and 1966. He 
then moved on to Pasadena and led the Lancers to the State title in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 No coach won consecutive State titles again until Rancho Santiago's Dana 
Pagett did in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian went on to more fame as coach at Nevada Las Vegas. His Rebels won 
the national championship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-star game will match some of the best players in the state, including 
Whitlock and Jefferson. Whitlock, a sophomore guard from Loara High School and 
Arizona State, averaged 21 points for the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson, a sophomore forward from Philadelphia, averaged 16 points and 10 
rebounds. Both were all-Orange Empire Conference selections. 
</P>
<P>
 The State championship game between Ventura and Long Beach will follow at 7:30

BOYS' TRACK AND FIELD / SEASON PREVIEW; CROSS-COUNTRY CROSSOVER EFFECT PUTS 
HART A LEG UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thought in previous years of Hart High finishing higher in a Southern 
Section track and field championship than in a cross-country final would have 
been easily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since at least the 1983-84 school year, the track team is 
expected to finish higher in the section Division I championships than fifth -- 
which is where the cross-country squad finished last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And who does the track team have to thank for this reversal of fortune? The 
cross-country team, which won three consecutive state Division I titles from 
1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of the cross-country team has definitely helped the track 
program," said first-year Coach Larry David, a Hart assistant the last three 
years before replacing Dan Houghton, now David's assistant. "When the 
cross-country team started winning (Southern Section) and state titles, the 
number of kids coming out for track increased. That's been a big reason for our 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart finished second behind Muir, 51-42, in last year's Division I track 
championships and with senior hurdler Jason Medearis and junior distance runner 
Brett Strahan returning, a similar finish appears possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis has personal bests of 14.49 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles and 
38.02 in the 300 intermediates, and he finished third and second in those 
events in the Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan placed third in the 1,600 meters and fourth in the 3,200 in the 
section meet, and has run 4 minutes 13.90 seconds in the 1,600 and 9:24.5 in 
the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jason and Brett can score 30 points or so by themselves if they're 
healthy," David said. "And we have some other athletes who are capable of 
picking up some points." 
</P>
<P>
 Gavin Klinger is the leader of Hart's supporting cast. Klinger finished fourth 
in the 1,600 and ninth in the 3,200 in last year's section championships and 
has personal bests of 4:16.7 and 9:25.4. 
</P>
<P>
 John McLaughlin (personal best of 11.1 in the 100 and 22.9 in the 200) gives 
the Indians a solid performer in the sprints, and Medearis will see plenty of 
action in the 200 and 400 in dual meets before focusing on the hurdles in the 
championship competitions at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac Skinner (12 feet 6 inches in the pole vault) and Cameron Perry (20-6 in 
the long jump and 41-1 1/2 in the triple jump) are Hart's top performers in the 
jumping events. Paul Walters has thrown the discus 138-1 and David Patrick has 
a 133-6 personal best. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a great dual-meet team," Canyon Coach Dave DeLong said of Hart. "I 
think they might be better this year than they were last year. They're very 
solid in every event. I bet they and Muir might have the two best dual-meet 
teams in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 David is less effusive, but admits that the Indians should expect to win their 
sixth consecutive Foothill League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all of the kids we've got coming back, I think we should definitely be 
favored to win league," David said.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The Southern Section meet) is harder to predict, but I think the sprint 
talent is spread around enough that it will prevent any one team from getting a 
lot of points in those events. That should help us." Other Teams to Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks -- Jeff Fischer, Brandon Del Campo and Kevin Marsden, the 
third-, fourth- and fifth-place finishers in last year's state Division I 
cross-country championships, will give the Lancers unparalleled depth in the 
distance events. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer and Del Campo lowered their personal bests in the 3,200 to 9:27.06 and 
9:24.59 in the Spartan Relays at Rio Mesa High last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Marsden has personal bests of 1:59.68 in the 800, 4:22.53 in the 1,600 and 
9:45.63 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Chadd Aldrich (4:26.8 and 9:33.45) and Keith O'Doherty (9:50.27) to the 
mix and the distance corps figures to post ample 1-2-3 finishes in dual meets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sprints, Rob Scherrei has run 22.5 in the 200 and 52.5 in the 400, and 
Greg Johnson has timed 52.4 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Marwin (16.14 in the 110 highs, 41.9 in the 300 intermediates last year) 
leads a solid group of hurdlers, and James Pashley (21-0 in the long jump) and 
Calvin Lin (41-1 1/4 in the triple jump) will lead the horizontal jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be in the hunt (for the Marmonte League title)," first-year 
Coach Dan Murphy said. "I think we'll be a contender, but I don't think we'll 
be a runaway winner by any stretch of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- The Chargers are the two-time defending Marmonte League champions, 
but Coach Bill Duley concedes that they will be hard-pressed to win a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be the type of team that we were the last two years," he said. 
"We've got some good guys, but we're weak in some events." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Blechen could be Agoura's most valuable performer. Blechen is the 
defending league champion in the shotput and discus and has personal bests of 
51-3 1/2 and 148-3 in those events. 
</P>
<P>
 John Greene is the defending league champion in the 3,200 meters and won the 
Southern Sction Division II cross-country title in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Multitalented Dave Schaeffer has personal bests of 12-6 in the pole vault and 
146-0 in the discus. Mike Krouse ran a personal best of 50.20 to place second 
in the 400 in last year's league championships and will add the 800 to his 
repertoire this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo -- Jeremy Fischer, the runner-up in the high jump in last year's 
state championships, cleared a Ventura County record 7-3 in a season-opening 
meet and has spanned 22-1 in the long jump. However, the Scorpions have another 
standout in distance runner Eleazar Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a junior, finished third in the state Division II cross-country 
championships last fall and ran a personal best of 9:15.03 to win the 3,200 in 
the Spartan Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads a distance corps that includes Jeremy Park (9:43.33 in the 3,200), 
Ben Hill (9:52.08) and Ronnie Franco (1:59.28 in the 800). 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Sadowsky (22.6 in the 200), Jon Throckmorton (139-2 in the discus) and 
Mike Wygant (16.02 in the 110 highs, 42-5 1/4 in the triple jump) give the 
Scorpions solid performers in several other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham -- The Braves placed second, first and second in the last three 
City Section championships and are capable of another top-two finish with 
multifaceted James Lincoln leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln placed fifth in the high jump in last year's state championships and 
raised his personal best to 6-10 to win the high school portion of last month's 
Sunkist Invitational. He also has bests of 15.2 in the 110 high hurdles, 21-8 
1/4 in the long jump and 44-10 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think James alone could score about 30 points in the City meet," Coach 
Scott King said. "If we can get 20 to 25 points from our other kids, we could 
be right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Castellanos, Keyote Gilmore and Adam Oliver are some of those "other 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Castellanos ran 1:58.7 in the 800 last year, but King says he could break 4:20 
in the 1,600 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore has spanned 21-11 in the long jump and King figures Oliver is capable 
of raising his best from 12-3 in the pole vault to close to 14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura -- Ramsey Jay and Noah Walsh are the leaders of a Cougar squad that is 
shooting for its second consecutive Channel League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay, a junior, has personal bests of 10.9 in the 100, 22.21 in the 200 and 
48.98 in the 400. He placed fifth in the 400 and seventh in the 200 in last 
year's Southern Section Division II championships. He also has leaped 21-4 in 
the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh has bests of 15.37 in the 110 high hurdles, 39.7 in the 300 
intermediates and 6-4 in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Burdick has thrown the discus 136-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft -- The Toreadors rode triple sprint champion Andre DeSaussure to a tie 
for third in last year's City championships and they appear to have a better 
supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, the runner-up in the 400 in the state meet, is favored to become 
the first athlete to win back-to-back titles in the 100, 200 and 400 in the 
City finals, but he will be sidelined for another week or two while he recovers 
from a strained hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returns, he will join a 400 relay team that timed 42.68 last season 
and appears capable of running about 41.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Peiny, a City finalist in the 300 intermediates, will lead off the 400 
relay team and appears capable of scoring points in both hurdle events in the 
City meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwyer McKeith is capable of bounding 45 feet in the triple jump, according to 
Coach Mel Hein, and Jerry Brown (100 and 200) and Moses Backus (400) give Taft 
added depth behind DeSaussure. Individuals to Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaal Chase (Quartz Hill) -- A finalist in the long jump and triple jump in 
last year's state championships, Chase won those events in the Sunkist 
Invitational with personal bests of 23-9 and 49-3. 
</P>
<P>
 His hopes to become a member of the exclusive 25-50 club (25 feet in the long 
jump, 50 feet in the triple jump). 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, Chase has cleared 6-4 in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Romero (L.A. Baptist) -- The Arizona-bound senior placed sixth in the high 
jump in last year's state championships but is also an accomplished long jumper 
and a decent sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the high jump and the long jump in last year's Southern Section 
Division IV championships and placed sixth in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
 He has personal bests of 6-10 3/4 in the high jump, 22-9 3/4 in the long jump 
and 11.0 in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Esa Sallinen (Burroughs) -- The Finnish exchange student has a personal best 
of 15-5 in the pole vault, and Burroughs assistant Mike McHorney figures he 
could greatly improve by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of different coaches at (the Sunkist Invitational) who 
watched him jump and they all said that with his speed, he could be a 17-foot 
vaulter," McHorney said. "Right now, he's jumping high off his speed. He's not 
using the pole at all. If he learns to do that, he could jump a lot higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Haag (Granada Hills) -- The Highlander senior placed second in the 110 
highs, fourth in the 300 intermediates and sixth in the long jump in last 
year's City championships. 
</P>
<P>
 With personal bests of 14.8 in the highs, 39.61 in the intermediates, 21-2 3/4 
in the long jump and 6-3 in the high jump, Haag could single-handedly lead 
Granada Hills to a top-five finish in the City meet.

DIETRICH PROVES LOOKS ARE DECEIVING; COLLEGE BASEBALL: MATER DEI GRADUATE COMES 
BACK AFTER MAJOR ARM SURGERY TO BE ONE OF PEPPERDINE'S TOP STARTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The verbal abuse from the opposing dugout seems to start the minute Jason 
Dietrich takes the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Get this nerd off the mound!  
</P>
<P>
 Hey Poindexter, the library's over there!  
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich doesn't cut an imposing figure on the mound. At 5 feet 11, 190 
pounds, he's not very big. With his cherubic face, glasses and curly hair 
flowing from the back of his hat, he has a boyish look that hardly strikes fear 
into the hearts of batters. 
</P>
<P>
 But from Mater Dei High School to Rancho Santiago College and now to 
Pepperdine, Dietrich has made a career out of proving that first impressions 
are not necessarily the best impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my looks are deceiving," said Dietrich, a right-hander who has a 1-1 
record and 3.63 earned-run average this season at Pepperdine. "Some people say, 
'What's this guy doing out there?' But as soon as I start throwing I try to 
show them what I'm capable of, and usually that quiets them down a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, an 85- to 90-m.p.h. fastball can humble you, as Rancho Santiago Coach Don 
Sneddon discovered four years ago. Sneddon went to scout a Mater Dei playoff 
game in 1990, back when Dietrich's hair was much longer than it is today, and 
he succumbed to the same assumptions others had about Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost comical, this kid with glasses and long, black, curly hair down 
to his shoulders," Sneddon said. "It looked like Mater Dei was conceding defeat 
by pitching him. Boy, was I wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy had some arm strength and velocity. Sometimes your eyes deceive you, 
because you see so many games, but this guy was throwing pretty hard, and there 
was a definite chance for him." 
</P>
<P>
 A few innings later, Sneddon wasn't so sure. Dietrich, who went 6-1 for the 
Monarchs in 1990, was pitching a solid game against Lakewood when he felt his 
arm pop while delivering a pitch in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went about 40 feet," Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes recalled of the pitch. "The 
umpire let him throw another one, and it went about 40 feet, too. That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich left the game wondering if he would ever pitch again. He had arm 
problems throughout high school and never seemed to pitch at full strength, and 
that scared college coaches away. Pro scouts wouldn't touch him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was determined to pursue a baseball career, though. Dietrich enrolled at 
Rancho Santiago in the fall of 1990, but therapy hadn't eased the pain in his 
arm. No wonder. Dietrich went to the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedics Clinic in 
Inglewood, where doctors discovered bone chips in the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich was given a choice: Have what is known as "Tommy John surgery," in 
which a tendon from the forearm is removed and inserted in the elbow, giving 
patients about a 60% chance of full recovery, or continue to throw with pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich opted for surgery and underwent the procedure in January, 1991. He 
redshirted the '91 season at Rancho Santiago and didn't throw for seven or 
eight months after the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the following winter, before the 1992 season, that Dietrich 
felt confident enough to cut loose on his fastball and curve. But he injured 
his shoulder early in the season and pitched only five or six innings toward 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sneddon never gave up on me," Dietrich said. "He was always there making sure 
I did what I was supposed to do, and he didn't rush me through that year. He 
made sure I was OK and wanted me to be ready for the next year. I kept 
rehabilitating, doing elbow strengthening exercises and shoulder work. Finally 
last year came and I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich, healthy for the first time in years, had an outstanding sophomore 
season at Rancho Santiago, going 6-1 with a 2.69 earned-run average and 99 
strikeouts in 103 innings. He went 8 1/3 innings and was the winner in the 
Dons' 5-3 victory over Sacramento City College in the 1993 State championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He basically dedicated himself -- that's the only reason he was able to come 
back," Sneddon said. "His work ethic made him one of the finest community 
college pitchers in California last year." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't let that innocent face fool you. Dietrich is a bulldog on the mound. 
He pitched that entire championship game with a blister on the middle finger of 
his pitching hand. It was bleeding in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to take a rope out there and take him out of the game," Sneddon said. 
"He wanted to finish, but luckily it worked out for the both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dietrich: "I didn't pay attention to it. I just wanted to go out there 
and win Rancho a State championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrich earned a scholarship to Pepperdine and is now one of the Waves' top 
three starters. He has an above-average fastball with movement and his curve, 
though inconsistent at times, is getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez said Dietrich already has attracted the attention 
of pro scouts, and Sneddon believes Dietrich could pitch on the professional 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quiet, unassuming guy -- you don't look at him and think he's a real 
competitive kid," Lopez said. "He's not foaming at the mouth, and he doesn't 
have a four-day growth. He just looks like a real solid human being who gets 
hitters out."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK; NORTHRIDGE UNFAZED BY POWER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge softball team hit an NCAA-record 40 home runs last 
season, but Northridge is well off that pace in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 One-quarter of the way through their regular-season schedule, the Matadors 
have three homers -- two by Shannon Jones and the other by Terri Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Coach Gary Torgeson said the power shortage does not worry him. The 
Matadors are 12-2 and ranked sixth in the latest NCAA poll heading into today's 
home opener against No. 20 Missouri, and Torgeson expects Northridge to get 
well again once the team resumes playing within the cozy confines of Matador 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is concerned that slugger Beth Calcante, the school's career 
leader in homers, has tied herself into a funk while trying to go deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, whose 25 homers place her nine back of the Division I career record, 
is batting a paltry .204. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get (home runs) out of her head," Torgeson said. "Home runs 
just come. Usually, you don't have to try to hit them." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, an All-American outfielder, last season blasted a school-record 12 
homers. CS NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Thing 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge right-hander John Najar says he always wanted to top a 
statistical chart. This probably isn't what he had in mind.

 Najar (3-2) raised a few eyebrows when he unloaded four wild pitches in each 
of his first two starts, and while he has slowed the pace recently, he has 
rolled up 13 in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of perspective, Philadelphia Phillies' starter Tommy Greene led 
the National League with 15 wild pitches in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the wild pitch," Najar cracked. "That's my curveball. I guess I'll 
make the record book one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge does not keep individual single-season records for wild pitches, 
but Najar might make it as part of a team mark. The staff single-season 
standard for wild pitches is 50, set in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge pitchers have 28 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Najar could skip the first inning, he'd be a world-beater. 
</P>
<P>
 In five starts, Najar has been scored on four times in the opening frame, 
allowing a total of nine runs, all earned. Saturday, the junior right-hander 
gave up three runs to UC Santa Barbara, a first-inning season-high for a 
Matador pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't get comfortable," Najar said. "I felt, I don't know, weird 
out there for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Najar is trying his best to work out the early kinks. After teammate Marco 
Contreras completed his start against Santa Barbara on Saturday, Najar walked 
onto the field and started practicing his pitching motion, familiarizing 
himself with the strange mound. Didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the Northridge staff has given up a total of six first-inning 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Smaler, pressed into duty at catcher because of persistent soreness in 
the throwing arm of Eric Gillespie, has hit safely in seven consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The batting average of Smaler, a back-up catcher last season at Pierce 
College, previously had hovered around the .170 mark, which was hardly 
surprising, Coach Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody catches every day, it does affect your hitting," Kernen said. 
"You're worried about calling the pitches, setting the defense, all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the physical toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the coaching staff tore down Smaler's swing. It was a major 
overhaul: Kernen said adjustments were made in Smaler's stance, stride and hand 
positioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever he was doing wasn't working," said Kernen, with characteristic 
bluntness. "There's not a lot of risk (in making changes) when a guy's hitting 
.150." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler has raised his average to .239. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Aaron D'Aoust, a junior transfer from Long Beach City College, 
has excelled in a relief role for Northridge, and for good reason: 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't know any better. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas most college pitchers were starters in high school or junior college, 
D'Aoust has always been a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows. D'Aoust hasn't given up a run over the last 11 1/3 innings and has 
the team's lowest earned-run average at 1.72. As he has for the past few 
seasons, D'Aoust simply shows for each game ready to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I approach it the same way every day," D'Aoust said. "Kick everybody's . . ." 
THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 Masterful 
</P>
<P>
 What do we have to do to catch these guys?  
</P>
<P>
 That thought, or something similar to it, must have been going through the 
minds of Biola's players during the second half of Monday's championship game 
of the NAIA Far West Independents tournament against The Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles made 10 of their first 12 shots in the second half, yet managed to 
trim only one point from a 10-point halftime deficit in a 93-80 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's maintained most of its lead by making nine of 17 shots -- including 
three three-point baskets -- and forcing five turnovers during that 10-minute 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By defeating Biola, Master's earned a trip to the 32-team NAIA Division I 
tournament at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla. The tournament runs from 
Tuesday to March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's (28-4) will play Georgia Southwestern (23-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament notes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nineteen states are represented in the tournament, topped by Oklahoma with 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master's, seeded 10th, is the top-ranked team from California. Azusa Pacific 
(28-4) is seeded 11th and Westmont (18-12) 30th. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty-five of the 32 teams in the tournament qualified by winning their 
respective conference or region tournaments. Seven others were awarded at-large 
berths. On Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Kernen needs three victories to reach 200 in his tenure with the Matadors. 
In five-plus seasons, Kernen's baseball teams are 197-105-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shannon Jones leads the Northridge softball team with a .429 batting 
average, 15 hits, nine runs batted in, two home runs and a slugging percentage 
of .629.  
</P>
<P>
 * Kathy Blake became the fifth Northridge pitcher to win 50 games when she 
shut out California two weeks ago. Blake, a junior, has a career record of 
51-11. She can tie Heather Lindstrom for fourth place on the school's career 
win list by defeating Missouri today.

OFF TO A SOLID START; IT TOOK AROUND NINE HOURS AND COST $168.94. THERE'S MORE 
TO BE DONE. BUT A HANDY HOMEOWNER FINDS THAT WITH PLANNING, HE CAN IN ONE 
WEEKEND CLEAR SEVERAL HURDLES TOWARD EARTHQUAKE SAFETY. 
</P>

By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, my wife was right. I didn't get it all accomplished in one weekend: 
It is my list of earthquake safety chores. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided several weeks ago to bow to the inevitability of another major quake 
and set about making our house as earthquake safe as my talents and budget 
would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reduce the likelihood of valuable possessions being damaged in 
a quake and to reduce as much as possible the chances that anyone in the house 
would be injured. 
</P>
<P>
 When I wrote here of my plans two weeks ago, I'd talked with a home safety 
inspection specialist to get ideas on what to look for and had made a tour of 
my home to determine what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 With that list in hand -- chores ranged from fastening the tall cabinet in the 
living room to bracing boxes in the garage -- I spent several evenings at the 
local home improvement center, wandering the aisles and getting ideas for 
materials I'd need. 
</P>
<P>
 After listing each chore and what was needed to accomplish it, I went back and 
bought the stuff. In all, I figure that saved about four hours of weekend time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what I was able to accomplish last weekend, what it cost and how the 
jobs turned out: 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Secure Knickknacks 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: Applying a small blob of sticky white wax to the bottom of each 
figurine and then firmly pressing each item back into place on the shelving. 
</P>
<P>
 Material used: Wax adhesive 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $2 for two ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: Antique and collectible stores, some hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools needed: A wooden stick to spread wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 90 minutes (included is the time it took to dust and polish the glass 
shelves and mirrored walls of the curio cabinets.  
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Collectibles are firmly anchored to the glass shelves and won't 
tumble off or bang into each other in a quake. They also don't shake or rattle 
when someone runs through the living room. And unless you lie on your back and 
look up under the shelves, the wax is invisible, so it doesn't detract from the 
things on display. And the wax goes a long way. The two-ounce container I 
bought will probably do 200 figurines (or the same 50 four times each). 
</P>
<P>
 Minuses: Makes it harder to dust -- you either have to clean around each 
piece, or pry them all up, wipe off the wax (at least it comes off pretty 
easily with warm water), dust, then reapply wax to each piece and stick it back 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: Short of a liberal dose of epoxy cement, nothing is going to prevent 
things from moving in a really big quake -- even if the objects stay put, the 
shelves they're fixed to might fall. So don't knock yourself out sticking down 
everything in sight. Just fasten down the things you'd most hate to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Add Latches to Cabinets 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: This was tedious but easy. I simply attached plastic 
child-safety latches to the insides of each of our 19 kitchen cabinet and four 
bathroom cabinet doors.  
</P>
<P>
 Material: Child-proof latches. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $1.78 for a package of three -- $15.34, including tax, for 24 latches. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: At most hardware and home improvement stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: Drill and bit for pilot holes; screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 2.5 hours 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Invisible, inexpensive and will keep cabinet doors from opening and 
cabinet contents from spilling out during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawbacks: Until your memory banks take over and the routine becomes 
automatic, you have to remember each time your open a cabinet to reach in and 
depress the safety latch. It gets frustrating to pull open the doors only to 
have them abruptly stop moving after the first inch or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Secure Boxes on Shelves 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: It took some thinking -- and some rethinking. I didn't want to 
rebuild the shelving or hang full doors -- the cost and weight both were 
prohibitive.  
</P>
<P>
 My first plan called for installing rigid 2-by-4 bars across the front of the 
shelves to hold back the storage boxes, but the logistics for attaching the 
bars so they would stay put in a quake but be easily removable to enable me to 
get to things were too daunting. Then, while pacing the aisles of my local 
lumber store, I saw the light -- actually I saw the wire cables that they used 
to keep tall pieces of molding from falling down on customers. 
</P>
<P>
 So that's what I adapted, and now the shelves at the back of my garage sport a 
system of blue, vinyl-clad wire cables stretched horizontally across the 
shelving to keep boxes from falling down. The cables -- two per shelf, one a 
few inches from the bottom and the other just above the mid-way mark -- are 
secured at one end to a thick eyebolt screwed into the upright brace; at the 
other end they terminate in steel latches that clip onto another set of 
eyebolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Material: To secure four shelves, each four feet long, I bought 40 feet of 
3/16-inch diameter vinyl clad wire cable; 16 cable clamps, used to permanently 
fasten the cable-ends because they can't be tied like rope; 16 eyebolts with 1 
1/2-inch openings, and eight swivel snap latches. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs: $14 for the cable, at 35 cents a foot; $5.85 for the clamps; $4.48 for 
the eyebolts, and $9.76 for the latches. Total, with tax, was $36.76. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: Power drill and bits for pilot holes; adjustable wrench to tighten 
cable clamps; wire cutter to cut cable; tape measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: Three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit: Lightweight, easy to install, easy to get to the storage boxes. 
Presuming the cable is strong enough and anchored properly, stretching it 
across the open fronts of the shelving will stop boxes and other large items 
from falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawbacks: Don't know of any yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Fasten Cabinet to Wall 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: Using two four-inch L-shaped steel brackets to fasten a 6 
1/2-foot cabinet to the living room wall. I used a stud-finder to locate two 
studs behind the cabinet (studs are 16 inches apart if the house is built to 
code), marked the plaster wall over the studs to correspond to the holes in the 
brackets, drilled pilot holes and then used 1/4-by-three-inch lag bolts to 
secure the brackets to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because our cabinet is three inches out from the wall, I was able to install 
the brackets so the leg on the wall runs down behind the cabinet and cannot be 
seen. If yours is flush, you can either move it out, install brackets with the 
wall leg pointing up -- and probably visible -- or install a lag bolt through 
the cabinet back and directly into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to drill holes in the wall with only a few inches of space to work 
in, I first bored one-inch openings through the back of the cabinet where each 
screw would go. That allowed me to use a power drill with a long bit to drill 
straight into the wall behind the cabinet and, later, to use a socket wrench to 
tighten the lag bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of screwing the second leg of each bracket to the top edge of the 
cabinet back, which is only 3/4-inch thick and would probably not hold the 
screws in a big quake, I took advantage of the raised back of the cabinet to 
make a more secure hold-down system. I used brackets that extended an inch over 
the lip of the back edge and attached a 20-inch length of oak between the two 
brackets. The oak (hardwood holds screws better than soft pine) forms a long 
lip that holds the cabinet in place, greatly increases the load that the 
hold-down system can handle and can easily be removed when we need to move the 
cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials: Pair of four-inch L brackets; four 1/4-by-three-inch lag bolts; two 
No. 8 1 1/2-inch wood screws, a one-by-10-inch oak strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Brackets, $1.86; lag bolts, 88 cents; wood screws, 35 cents; oak strip, 
about $3 (I salvaged mine from scrap stock in my workshop); total, with tax, 
$6.52. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: Any hardware or home improvement store; lumber yard or home 
improvement center for wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: Power drill, one-inch wood bit; 1/8-inch bit for pilot holes; stud 
finder; tape measure, pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: One hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Inexpensive, invisible and should hold entertainment center in place 
during a quake, keeping it from pitching forward and hitting someone or dumping 
TV and stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawbacks: It's necessary to unfasten the hold in order to move the 
entertainment center to clean behind it; will leave small holes in the wall 
that must be patched when moving out or rearranging the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip: If you bolt directly through the back of a cabinet and into the wall, use 
at least two bolts and put a strip of metal or wood between them and the back 
surface to spread the load and keep the bolt heads from pulling through. 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Secure Refrigerator 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: I have a wooden floor in the kitchen, so this was easy. I 
removed the bottom vent panel from the front of the refrigerator and screwed a 
pair of small L brackets into the floor in front of the wheels. The 
refrigerator is in an alcove with a cabinet overhead that will block it from 
pitching forward, and the brackets will stop the wheels from rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't able to figure out a satisfactory and invisible method of latching 
the refrigerator doors to prevent them from flying open, but I figure you can't 
have everything. 
</P>
<P>
 This job provided me the opportunity (that's what my wife called it) to vacuum 
the dust that had accumulated on the cooling coils under the refrigerator -- a 
chore that should be done every few months or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials: Pair of 3/4-inch L brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: 65 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: Hardware, lumber stores and home improvement centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: Screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit: Barely visible, stops heavy refrigerator from rolling into middle of 
kitchen where it could fall over. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawback: Brackets have to be unfastened anytime the refrigerator has to be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: Most people don't have wooden flooring in their kitchens. If you have a 
cement slab or tile floor, you'll either have to get a masonry drill and 
special masonry anchors for the screws or use a heavy-duty adhesive, such as 
Goop, to glue the brackets down. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is to make wood or rubber wedges and drive them under the front 
wheels, but make sure you leave enough sticking out to provide a place to grip 
when you need to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Protect the China 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: Washing a whole lot of dishes (my wife insisted they get washed 
before being wrapped) and then inserting the various plates, bowls, saucers and 
serving pieces into quilted containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Material: A set of quilted, padded, zipper-sealed cloth china keepers for a 
service for 12. The set includes foam sheets to place between the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $99.13, including tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: We got ours at a store at MainPlace mall in Santa Ana that 
specializes in storage containers; we've also seen them in catalogues, often 
for quite a bit less, but we didn't seem to have the right catalogue. A week 
after we bought ours, one of my co-workers started unwrapping a mail-order 
package at her desk and pulled out a set of vinyl china keepers. She said they 
cost $12 plus shipping. I groaned and can only hope that the cloth ones last a 
whole lot longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: None. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 15 minutes (plus 30 minutes washing and drying the dishes). 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit: Turns shaky stacks of fragile china into solid, padded blocks that 
stand a much better chance of surviving an earthquake -- and other jiggling and 
jolting -- intact. Also keeps dust off your china between uses so you don't 
have to wash it before you set the table for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawbacks: None, if you don't count the cost (and at $12 or $99, its a lot 
less than a new set of china). 
</P>
<P>
 Job: Stabilize Home Computer 
</P>
<P>
 What it took: Affixing Velcro hook-and-loop fasteners to the home computer to 
secure the monitor against a quake violent enough to jolt it off the processing 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials: Two packages of self-adhesive Velcro strips and one package of 
self-stick Velcro squares. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $8.54, with tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability: Hardware, fabric, home improvement and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Tools: Scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefit: Our monitor sits atop a swivel stand that is on top of a power 
switching and spike protection device that is on top of the central processing 
unit on the desk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not terribly wobbly, but why take chances? I simply affixed strips of 
Velcro to the CPU and then ran a long strip from one side of the CPU up and 
over the top of the monitor and then down to the other side of the processing 
unit. It seems strong enough to hold the monitor down. If it works, we won't 
have to clean up a lot of broken glass from the picture tube, and we won't have 
to pay to replace the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawbacks: It isn't very pretty, and it has to be removed in order to swivel 
the monitor more than a few inches. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 That was it for last weekend. Total time, eight hours, 45 minutes; total 
expenses, $168.94. The rain, my native inertia and a few family matters kept me 
from finishing my list of chores. I'll be doing them while you're reading this 
installment.  
</P>
<P>
 In my next report, I'll fill you in on how rest of the chores go and share a 
new batch of earthquake safety tips I've picked up while researching these 
articles.

GARDENING; HERALDING A NEW INTEREST IN ANGEL'S TRUMPET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some folks think they're heavenly. Others regard them as hellish. The 
fragrance can entrance you, but the plant can kill you if you're foolish enough 
to consume its seeds or leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shortcomings, brugmansia, popularly known as angel's trumpet, and 
its close relative, datura, are undergoing a popularity revival because the 
fragrance is so alluring and the flower divine looking. 
</P>
<P>
 These fast-growing shrubs in the nightshade family produce very large, 
pendulous single or double flowers in hues of white, yellow, orange or 
variations thereof, that produce hypnotic fragrances at night. The plants also 
contain hallucinogenic properties, deadly poisonous seeds and deservedly have 
the reputation of being killers, like their other relatives in the Solanum 
family (such as jimson weed). 
</P>
<P>
 The names brugmansia and datura have been used interchangeably, but recently 
botanists reclassified them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most purposes, if the flowers hang down, the plant is a brugmansia. If 
the flower is upright, it's a datura," explained John Lenanton, professor of 
botany at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the confusion over name and toxicity, gardeners are increasingly 
adding them to their landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a little afraid of the plants because they are so poisonous, but 
we've doubled our sales in just the past two years," said Evelyn Weidner, owner 
of Weidner's Gardens in Encinitas. Weidner's is both a retail facility and a 
wholesale grower, supplying plants to many nurseries throughout Orange County. 
When she planted several brugmansias in her display garden, the sales of this 
exotic plant rocketed as people were captivated by both the large flowers and 
heady fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always caution people to think very carefully about planting brugmansias if 
they have small children or pets, but I also find the plants don't easily shed 
their seeds," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner offers four varieties, with flowers of either white, pink, frosty pink 
or a tricolor with flowers that change hues from white to soft yellow to 
apricot pink. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidner is also growing a variety of datura that hasn't been available to the 
public. Datura metallica is gaining a lot of attention with its showy purple 
flowers with white interior. Although not fragrant, the purple datura is a 
striking plant that flowers heavily from summer through winter. The plant is 
more contained than brugmansia, with pronounced upright growth instead of 
sprawling. 
</P>
<P>
 Once established, brugmansia is almost indestructible and is a rampant grower 
that can reach up to 20 feet with a spread of eight to 10 inches. It can be 
kept smaller by constant pruning, although experts advise pruning when all 
danger of frost is over so the wood isn't exposed to cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, bold plant, but not a pretty one and is best when placed at the 
back of the garden," advised Dale Kolaczkowski, manager of Stallings Exotic 
Nursery in Encinitas. Stallings specializes in tropical and rare plants and 
offers 10 different brugmansia varieties, all grown from cuttings at the 
nursery. The nursery also sells by mail-order. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wade Roberts, director of Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar, which has a 
display of five different varieties, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a gorgeous sight to see the plant loaded with flowers," he said. 
"They flower almost nonstop in our coastal climate. And as many years as I've 
walked past them, I still am overwhelmed each time I smell the fragrance. They 
still bowl me over." 
</P>
<P>
 But the plants don't automatically flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they're established, both brugmansias and daturas are temperamental 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They remind me of Republicans; they don't like change," said Kolaczkowski 
wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the plants are prone to dropping their leaves and flowers 
with temperature fluctuations such as cold snaps or Santa Ana conditions. 
Despite a straggly, sickly appearance, the plant usually survives and 
re-blooms. They also drop their leaves each winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're native to the Andes, and they prefer the cool climate at their native 
altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet," Kolaczkowski explained. 
</P>
<P>
 When they're planted in conditions they like, they thrive in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast, they can be planted in full sun and are almost 
indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
 Inland, they should be planted where they receive afternoon shade so they can 
cool down as they would in their native Andes mountains. Inland, they 
appreciate a daily misting in late afternoon. The plants are also susceptible 
to frost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Insects find the plants very attractive -- they love to feast on the narcotic 
leaves and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is another reason Kolaczkowski recommends placing them in the background, 
so the insect damage isn't as noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 "After five years or so, the plants build up enough toxicity that the insects 
die and the plants are then defended from further attacks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners can spray against the insect invasion with chemicals or blasts of 
water or choose to ignore them, because insects won't kill the plants. 
Kolaczkowski recommends the latter approach, although Weidner reports good 
results using fertilizers containing systemic insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Brugmansias also like moist soil conditions, but overwatering can make them 
susceptible to attacks by soil fungi. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardeners can choose to fertilize them or not, depending on time and effort 
they want to spend. Kolaczkowski says that since they grow so rapidly, they 
don't need fertilizer, but Weidner reports good results with occasional feeding 
to encourage deep green leaf color. 
</P>
<P>
 Many nurseries are now stocked with Brugmansias. Look for the daturas closer 
to summer, when they bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants can also be ordered if not in stock. Resources

DO-IT-YOURSELF; TWO WAYS TO PATCH DRYWALL HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The material most widely used on interior house walls is gypsum wallboard, 
also known as plasterboard or drywall. Although it serves its purpose well, it 
is relatively brittle and can puncture when struck by a sharp blow. 
</P>
<P>
 But patching a hole is not difficult, and you'll obtain a neat, sound repair 
by using one of two basic methods. Both make use of ready-mixed joint compound, 
which is available in hardware stores and lumberyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Holes up to four inches in diameter are patched with the wire mesh backup 
procedure. Begin by cutting a piece of ordinary wire screening slightly larger 
than the hole to be repaired. Thread a length of string through the center of 
the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, moisten the edge of the hole and the perimeter of the back side of the 
opening. While holding onto the string, curl the screen and fit it through the 
hole in the wall. Then pull on the string to draw the screen up against the 
back of the wallboard. Tie the string around a pencil or a length of dowel that 
spans the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply a layer of compound to the screen but not flush with the surface of the 
wall. When the whole screen has been coated, twist the pencil slightly to 
increase the tension on the screen. Allow this first layer to set, then cut the 
string to remove the pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply a second layer of compound so the patch will be flush with the surface 
of the wall. When this flush coat has set, apply a final thin coating of 
compound over the patch and slightly onto the surrounding wallboard. When dry, 
sand the patch with 220-grit abrasive paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Holes larger than four or five inches are best repaired with a plug cut from a 
scrap of wallboard. First, trim the hole square, then cut a piece of board 
about two inches longer on each side than the hole size. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark off a centered area on the back of the patch, three-quarters of an inch 
smaller on each side than the hole in the wall. Cut through the paper surface 
and slightly into the core. 
</P>
<P>
 Snap the board on each score line and carefully peel away the core material so 
that the center wallboard section remains in the center along with the 
overhanging front facing paper, which acts as a flap. 
</P>
<P>
 Use 120-grit paper to sand the edges of the flap until they taper to a point. 
Dampen all surfaces that will be bonded. Then apply joint compound to the back 
of the patch flap, the edges and the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Press the plug patch into place in the hole, and use a wide-blade knife to 
work the paper flap flush to the wall and squeeze out excess compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow to dry and then apply a thin coat of compound, extending about one or 
two inches beyond the patch area. When this is dry, sand smooth.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: FABRIC BLINDS BEST CLEANED WITH BRUSH, VACUUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: The house we just bought has fabric vertical blinds that need a good 
cleaning. Is it OK for them to just be thrown in the wash or will that damage 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 E.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "In most cases, you just need to vacuum fabric blinds," says Gidon 
Adlan of Bob's Shades & Linoleum in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with washing your blinds is that there's a good chance they'll 
shrink. There are lots of different fabrics available; you may want to take one 
of the slats to a blind shop so they can give you an idea of what it's made of 
and what you can use on it to remove spots. Generally, though, you'll just need 
to brush the blind and use a small vacuum to dust and clean it." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We recently bought an old house, and our first project will be a remodeling 
of the bathrooms. The old stainless steel towel racks are connected with tiny 
allen screws that have become rusted. Is there a trick to removing them? 
</P>
<P>
 S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The best way to do it is with your drill," says Steve Johnson of Familian 
Pipe & Supply in Costa Mesa. "Use a tiny bit that will fit in the middle of the 
screw and pull the trigger. If the screw is old and rusty, it should fall 
apart. If you're trying to keep the screw and hardware intact, you'll have a 
harder job. Use some spray lubrication to help break down the rust, then very 
slowly, with a variable speed drill, try to draw the screw out with the bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have central air conditioning, and neighbors say they will run their 
unit for a few minutes each month, even in winter, to keep it running properly. 
Does this really make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
 H.K. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's not a bad habit to get into," says Rod Albright of Albright Plumbing 
& Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. "Running your air conditioner about 10 
minutes per month will help keep the seals lubricated. You'll want to let it 
run as you feel the cool air coming through the vents, which means the coolant 
is running freely through the system, doing its job." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The stucco on my home is avocado green, and I'd like to paint it white this 
summer. What kind of paint can I use that will cover this darker paint in one 
coat? 
</P>
<P>
 M.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 A: "For that kind of job, you probably shouldn't expect that you'll get that 
kind of coverage in one coat," says Harold Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating 
in Fullerton. "Even if you found a paint that provided adequate coverage with 
one coat, you'll still find shadows in various areas that will have to be 
painted over. When using white paint, you always have to figure that it will 
take two coats over a darker color. If the condition of your stucco is good and 
you won't need a primer, you should figure on using two coats of white to cover 
the avocado." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A large glass cabinet in our living room fell recently, and we had a hard 
time getting the broken glass up from our 5-year-old pile carpeting. We were 
told that it's virtually impossible to remove all the little shards of glass 
from carpet. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A: "If you do it right, you can probably get most all of the glass up," says 
Steve Hix of Aarron Anthony's Floor Coverings in Anaheim. "Many carpet stores 
sell special rakes you can use to raise a matted area of carpeting. Rake the 
area well, then go over it with a good vacuum. Keep repeating this process 
until you just don't see any more shards of glass."

CRAFTS; DO-IT-YOURSELF GUIDES CAN ALSO HELP BUILD PRIDE AND SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's weekend craftsmen are lured by the idea of saving money as well as 
personalizing their homes, and they take pride in the notion that the project 
looks professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter a number of new do-it-yourself magazines aimed at the high-end market: 
Handcraft Illustrated, published by a small company in Brookline Village, 
Mass.; Sewing Decor, by PJS Publications, Peoria, Ill.; Weekend Decorator, New 
York Times Magazine Group, and Weekend Decorating Projects, Hachette Filipacchi 
Magazines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise behind Handcraft Illustrated and Sewing Decor, bimonthlies 
chock-full of decorating crafts projects, is that a professional look can be 
turned out by novices -- with the proper instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can learn anything if it's communicated to them well enough," says 
Carol Sterbenz, editor of Handcraft Illustrated. "We simplify the methods and 
develop shortcuts with step-by-step directions and visuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Sewing Decor aims for the same end result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want it to look homemade. That's the whole point," says Linda 
Griepentrog, creator of Sewing Decor and editor of Sewing News, also published 
by PJS. 
</P>
<P>
 Other publishers are also promoting fast and easy decorating projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend Decorator, launched two years ago as a twice-yearly publication, is 
now a quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers a sophisticated approach to home decorating crafts that readers can 
do themselves or hire someone to do for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s, you hired a designer," editor Kathryn George says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today there is more pride associated with saying, 'I did some of the work 
myself,' and they are not doing it just to save money, although that is a 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend Decorating Projects was launched in August by Woman's Day. The 
magazine plans two issues this year, according to Maureen Klein, editor. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is upscale projects that can be finished in a weekend or so. They 
range from sewing to painting and simple woodworking. One scheduled project is 
how to build a beach cabana with fabric and PVC pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the rise in do-it-yourself magazines? A growing audience and -- except for 
Handcraft Illustrated, which takes no advertising -- a group of manufacturers 
who want to spread the word about upscale products for do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 survey by the Hobby Industry Assn. in Elmwood Park, N.J., found that 
82% of American households have at least one person engaged in a craft or 
hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with 64% in 1988 and 77% in 1990. The most popular craft, 
according to the biennial survey, is needle craft, fancy sewing such as 
needlepoint or cross-stitching. Machine sewing and floral craft (arranging 
artificial flowers) are also popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of crafts, including materials, books and finished items, reached $9.21 
billion in 1993, up 30% from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Upscale consumers are attracting high-end manufacturers such as Laura Ashley, 
Waverly and Hunter Douglas to the do-it-yourself market, Kathryn George says. 
It is also leading retailers to expand their inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a third of the fabric sold at retail is for the home, according to 
Griepentrog. Thus, fabric stores nationwide are beefing up their decorator 
corners, and some will even order fabric from swatches and sample books. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, upscale drapery hardware and fusing, or bonding, materials give 
professional touches to fabric projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glues used with (fusible materials) have been perfected to the point where 
you can get excellent results with a home iron," Klein says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to a few years ago, you needed an expensive commercial press."

ENVIRONMENT; CLEAR THE AIR AT HOME OF ITS 'TOXIC CLOUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air pollution begins at home -- which means you can help safeguard against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency has found that the most dangerous exposure 
to air pollution occurs indoors, and this is true even in the country's big 
manufacturing areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is we're in the middle of a toxic cloud of our own making," said 
Lance Wallace, an EPA scientist who conducted a 12-year series of studies on 
"personal air." 
</P>
<P>
 Air pollution can cause health problems ranging from coughing and shortness of 
breath to increased susceptibility to respiratory infection and lung disease 
and lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repeated, long-term exposure to any air pollutant is worrisome enough," said 
Dr. Julius Hicks, chairman of the Environmental Committee of the American 
Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery in Alexandria, Va. "But their 
combined, progressive effect may create a danger that is greater than the sum 
of their individual effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have learned that some pollutants previously passed off as merely 
annoying can be real health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particulate matter -- which includes dust, haze and smoke as well as soot -- 
had always been passed off as a nuisance," said Dr. Alfred Munzer, president of 
the American Lung Assn. "Now we know that increased exposure to it can mean a 
life-or-death difference for 50,000 to 60,000 Americans a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, some 65% of it at home. One 
area where you can cut down on pollution at home involves heating appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 If you must use a kerosene heater, burn a low-sulfur (1-K) fuel, fill the 
heater outside, keep it clean and properly adjusted. Never use it overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow guidelines for safe wood-burning stoves. Use wood that has been split 
and dried for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid smoldering, low-temperature fires. Allow plenty of air to circulate in 
the firebox. Watch for visible smoke inside the chimney or "lazy flames" that 
signal a need for more air. Thoroughly extinguish embers before bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Invisible, odorless and deadly carbon monoxide can escape when home combustion 
appliances such as the furnace, stove or water heater burn fuel incompletely, 
so consider a carbon monoxide detector. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking appliances are another category of possible pollutants. Fit your gas 
range with a good fan that exhausts outside, or use a window exhaust fan while 
cooking. Don't use your gas oven to heat the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure that all gas appliances are in good working order. Consider newer 
models that use spark ignition rather than pilot lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpeting can harbor pollutants. Vacuum at least twice weekly, using a vacuum 
cleaner with revolving brushes and strong suction. 
</P>
<P>
 Shake out throw rugs outdoors instead of vacuuming them. Use doormats at 
entrances to prevent tracking in lead from outdoor soil. Better yet, remove 
shoes before entering the house. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying carpet, look for the Carpet and Rug Institute-Indoor Air Quality 
label, indicating the product passed tests for minimal emission levels of 
chemical pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be ample ventilation during installation and for about 72 hours 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry cleaning also poses risks. Hang clothing just back from the dry cleaner 
outdoors or near an open window with a fan blowing out for three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban cigarettes, cigars and pipes from your home to eliminate exposure to 
secondhand smoke that can more than double a person's indoor exposure to 
particles and gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts call this the single most important step in remedying home air 
pollution.

 Be adventurous, prepared, persistent. It works for Scouts, and it should work 
for shoppers who want to stretch their furniture budget in the wilds of estate 
sales and consignment shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, you can find great construction in a sofa. If the fabric isn't right, 
you can have slipcovers made," said Judy Haines-Ricciardi, a decorator who 
likes to scrounge-shop. "Even figuring in the cost of fabric and labor, it's 
possible to save well over 50% and to get a sofa that will last for many 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Haines-Ricciardi recently spent $1,400 at an estate sale for a dining table 
and eight chairs by a top North Carolina maker. The set went to her sister. At 
another estate sale, she found a down-filled sofa for $450 for a client. An 
additional $575 for slipcover fabric and labor produced a piece that looks like 
the $4,000 sofa it would be if purchased new. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting bulky items home can be a hassle, but in her area a lot of sales are 
organized by professionals who will arrange delivery or at least provide the 
name and phone number of a person with a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A brand name helps establish value, but Haines-Ricciardi said it doesn't take 
a lot of expertise to pick out quality furniture. To judge a sofa, for example, 
lift the piece at one corner to test its weight. Better frames are heavier 
frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Haines-Ricciardi keeps abreast of estate sales by reading late-week classified 
ads in her local newspaper. In addition to secondhand shopping, she suggests 
checking local department stores and better furniture stores for clearance 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many higher-end retail furniture stores offer markdowns and special purchases 
such as manufacturers' close-outs in regular departments. But the best buys are 
sometimes in their outlet stores, where prices may be marked down 40% to 90% 
for one-of-a-kind items that may be slightly damaged or distressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret to successful shopping in a clearance mode is to know what you are 
looking for and to have the patience to wait for it," said Jim Gabbert, 
president of Gabbert's Furniture & Design Studio, which has outlets at its 
stores in Minneapolis, Dallas and Fort Worth. "It's critical to go into outlet 
shops frequently and see what's on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 When shopping outlets, don't expect amenities. Typically, there are no 
returns, delivery is extra, and merchandise is sold as-is. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for a sale is to get customers into the store. Home 
furnishings sales are generally in late winter and late summer, traditionally 
low-traffic times. Some stores also have floor sample sales just before new 
merchandise arrives. That can be almost any time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Nightingale, president of the Home Furnishings Council, an industry trade 
association, said the best bargains are probably found when a store is going 
out of business. Otherwise, he said, if an item sells well, it may never be on 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Nightingale suggested browsing and asking questions before buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores, including Gabbert's, have frequent seminars on topics ranging 
from how to accessorize to how to recognize quality. Not all companies are so 
forthcoming, however, because there's an industry tradition against educating 
customers who then might go elsewhere to buy. A number of retailers, however, 
train salespeople to offer information to those who ask. 
</P>
<P>
 One source of basic information is a decorating guide from the Home 
Furnishings Council. The guide, called "Haven," is free from 3,500 retailers 
nationwide.

HOUSEWARES; MINTON CHINA HAS LOYAL ROYAL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Minton set out a century ago to design fine china for the public and 
wound up founding a firm that found royal favor -- which it retains to this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Minton china today still offers the gloriously gilded, exquisitely painted 
pieces that enchanted both Queen Victoria, who called it "the most beautiful in 
the world," and her descendant, Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to understand why Victoria found Minton so appealing. By the middle 
of the 19th Century, it was finely crafted and lavishly decorated in a mix of 
many periods -- neoclassic, Renaissance, Gothic revival and contemporary French 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seascapes and landscapes, flowers and birds, reclining figures and Oriental 
motifs had all found their way into thousands of patterns in numerous shapes 
and styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once an international aristocracy had given its stamp of approval, what had 
already been an impressive array of pieces became more so, with commissions 
coming from as far away as India, Australia and America. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Minton started out in 1793, encouraged to begin making his own pottery 
while still apprenticing at a Staffordshire porcelain factory. 
</P>
<P>
 His aim was to please the middle class, to place fine tableware within the 
reach of all. When working people bought a Minton piece, particularly one of 
the luxury items that were soon on the market, they felt themselves equal to 
their more prosperous countrymen. Owning a beautifully made, though often 
impractical, figurine or ornamental object -- an artichoke cup or toothbrush 
tray, glass cooler or honey pot -- gave them a sense of cachet.

<P>
 Minton's business thrived, but it did not begin to establish its fabled 
reputation until 1836, when Minton's youngest son, Herbert, took over. 
Herbert's keen business sense and flair for technology culminated in a magic 
touch that few other potters could match. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine artists and sculptors were starting to flock to the firm, and by the 
1850s Minton was widely hailed for fine hand-painting and elaborate gilding -- 
artistic excellence that persists to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minton royal relationship began in 1840 and was sealed with a warrant in 
1856. It continues today. Prince Albert was a regular customer for more than 40 
years, even designing a pattern himself for use at his beloved Balmoral Castle 
in the north of Scotland. Albert died before the project was completed, but the 
china was produced anyway and made its debut at the palace in 1893. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Queen Victoria's favorites was the "Strawberry Embossed" pattern, no 
longer in production, which was ordered for Balmoral in 1910 and is still 
prized by some of today's royals. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Mary continued the royal enthusiasm for Minton, visiting the factory in 
1913 and later commissioning a miniature dinner service, a tiny blue-rimmed set 
made in 1929 for her dollhouse and still to be found at Windsor Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mary's granddaughter was crowned Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, Minton 
created a commemorative vase with an intricate design. The young monarch called 
it the most complicated piece of bone china ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Minton, which became part of Royal Doulton in 1968, celebrated its 200th 
birthday last year. Hundreds of Minton patterns are on display at the Minton 
Museum near the company headquarters in Stoke-on-Trent, England, which offers a 
comprehensive history of English china.

MAN TESTIFIES HE USED WRENCH TO BEAT WIFE TO DEATH; COURT: MOOSA HANOUKAI SAYS 
HE KILLED MANIJEH HANOUKAI AFTER SHE CURSED HIM AND THEIR DAUGHTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Fighting to maintain his composure, an Iranian immigrant told a jury Friday 
how he used a wrench to fatally bludgeon his wife after the woman said she 
wished the couple's daughter was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I wasn't feeling anything, I wasn't understanding anything," 
Moosa Hanoukai testified, sobbing uncontrollably as he discussed the slaying. 
"It was like a blackout." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai, on trial in Van Nuys Superior Court and charged with murdering his 
wife, Manijeh, nearly one year ago, said he grabbed a wrench from his kitchen 
and went upstairs in the couple's Woodland Hills home, where he killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran after her and pounded -- pounding and pounding," Hanoukai said through 
a Farsi interpreter. The beating stopped when he got tired, according to his 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai, a 55-year-old Iranian Jew, said the killing occurred Friday, March 
29, 1992, the Sabbath and Persian New Year's Eve, two celebrations where 
special meals are generally prepared. But, Manijeh Hanoukai did not prepare a 
feast that night, Hanoukai said, explaining that he killed his wife after 
eating a bologna sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James E. Blatt is presenting a "cultural defense," arguing 
that Hanoukai, driven by his male-dominated background, reacted after a quarter 
century of psychological abuse from his 45-year-old wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people, including the defendant, have testified that Manijeh Hanoukai 
often called her husband "stupid" and forced him to sleep on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanoukai indicated that the final straw were curses directed at him and 
the couple's only child, Delaram, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you're dying, and I'm going to get rid of you, hopefully," Manijeh 
Hanoukai said to her husband, according to his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the daughter, Manijeh Hanoukai said, "I hope you lose your head 
and your life," Hanoukai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai testified that he cleaned up the blood after the slaying, realizing 
what he had done. After taking bloody clothes off the corpse, he put a dress on 
the body. "It was very difficult to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai testified he placed the body in the garage after wrapping it in a 
plastic garbage bag and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of Friday's proceedings, Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz refused to 
reconsider a decision handed down earlier this week to dismiss first-degree 
murder charges against Hanoukai. 
</P>
<P>
 When the case concludes next week, the jury will have the option of convicting 
Hanoukai of second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory penalty of 15 years 
to life in state prison, or voluntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum 
sentence of 11 years.

CITY HALL JARGON OF GIBBERISH GROWING; LANGUAGE: LEXICON OF ACRONYMS AND 
IMAGINATIVE TERMS THAT MAKE UP THE PARLANCE IS WELL-KNOWN TO INSIDERS. BUT IT'S 
GREEK TO OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate over who should manage a quake-debris cleanup program was heating up 
in Los Angeles City Hall recently when Councilman Mike Hernandez stood and 
asked city staff about the participation of "WeeBees" and "MeeBees." 
</P>
<P>
 To City Hall newcomers, it may have sounded as if Hernandez had cracked under 
pressure and begun to speak gibberish. But in fact he was simply using City 
Hall jargon to refer to the Women Business Enterprise and Minority Enterprise 
contractors, who would get work though the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The expressions are part of a growing lexicon of acronyms and imaginative 
terms that make up the parlance of City Hall, a language spoken fluently by 
political insiders that is Greek to just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, everyday conversation in City Hall has become so polluted with 
bureaucratic gibberish that a council aide has drafted a 20-page dictionary of 
City Hall acronyms to help council newcomers become literate in the lingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Oschin, an aide to San Fernando Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, said 
the idea for the dictionary was born three years ago after she attended a 
meeting of SCAG (the Southern California Assn. of Governments) to discuss ISTEA 
(the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like listening to alphabet soup," she said. "You spent so much time 
trying to figure out what was said in the past two sentences that you lost what 
was being said." 
</P>
<P>
 And new acronyms are coined every day. For example, the engineers who were 
assigned to oversee the quake-debris cleanup program have dubbed themselves the 
Northridge Earthquake Recovery Department, or NERD. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as some languages have regional dialects, just about each city department 
has its own expressions and acronyms. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, planning officials often toss around terms such as "NegDec" to 
refer to a negative declaration -- a decision that a development project will 
have no significant environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
 And they say that before the city approves a controversial project, it must be 
considered by PLUM, the council's committee on Planning and Land Use 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Many community activists see the increasing use of government jargon as part 
of the reason why the public is sometimes reluctant to participate in the 
democratic process of local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jargon is intimidating," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn. "The uninitiated goes to a public hearing and they don't 
know what is going on, but a lawmaker or a lobbyist knows what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Close, who has been active in civic affairs for nearly 20 years 
and has become well-versed in the jargon, said the language can be learned 
relatively quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeowner representatives simply shrug at the use of bureaucratic 
jargon, accepting it as an inherent part of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to be active in civic affairs, you have to deal with it," 
said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., which represents home and property owners on both sides of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 One Valley homeowner protested to a City Council planning committee in January 
about the use of confusing "legalese" in newspaper notifications issued by the 
city to tell residents of neighborhood land-use issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall insiders say they try to be conscious about cutting down on 
jargon. "When you start sounding like a bureaucrat, you lose that connection" 
with the public, said Greg Nelson, an aide to Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bureau of Sanitation, trash collectors use the term "junkin," to refer 
to the act of removing and keeping items discarded with garbage, as in: "He 
found that chair while he was 'junkin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And most trash collectors cringe when they are called out to a DAC, or a Dead 
Animal Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Street Maintenance Department, a "skin patch" is a thin layer of 
asphalt used to repair a pothole and a "dog wagon" is a trailer used to carry 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some zoning officials use the acronym BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing 
Anywhere Near Anything) to poke fun at homeowners who oppose development. On 
the other hand, a project opposed by neighbors can be called a LULU (Locally 
Unwanted Land Use). 
</P>
<P>
 Within the council chambers, the city's lawmakers bat around many 
official-sounding terms and expressions that actually have simple, 
down-to-earth definitions. For example, to "receive and file" a report simply 
means to put it away. When a council members say "I move the previous 
question," it means, "Let's stop talking and vote." 
</P>
<P>
 After an ordinance is adopted, the council president sometimes says, 
"Forthwith on that," which simply tells the city clerk to hurry the item to the 
mayor for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's lower-level managers use the term "Emerald City" to refer 
to the second and third floors of City Hall, where offices for the mayor and 
council members are located. And when they are called to testify before the 
council, they say they are being called to the "horseshoe," because the council 
members' desks are arranged in a horseshoe shape around the speaker. 
Translating City Hall Here are some commonly used acronyms and expressions at 
Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * BANANA: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: In private by planning officials and council members when they 
run across residents who oppose even the most innocuous project. "How could 
they oppose that project? They must be BANANAs." 
</P>
<P>
 * CUP: Conditional-Use Permit, usually required of controversial projects. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: Planning, zoning and council members use this acronym routinely 
at public hearings. "Without a CUP, that project is dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 * Emerald City: Second and third floors of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: This is a pejorative term used among lower-level managers to 
poke fun at the council members and mayor who work on those two floors. "Get a 
load of him. He's wearing his best suit for a meeting in Emerald City." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Horseshoe: The U-shaped configuration of desks where council members sit 
during meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: By regulars at council meetings. "Have you heard the latest 
rumors around the horseshoe?" 
</P>
<P>
 * LULU: Locally Unwanted Land Use.  
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: By planning officials and others to describe a project opposed 
by nearby residents. "Is that project going to be approved, or is it a LULU?" 
</P>
<P>
 * NIMBY: Not In My Back Yard 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: To describe people opposed to a project because it is nearby. 
"You can expect opposition from that group. They're NIMBYs." 
</P>
<P>
 * REAP: Rent Escrow Account Program. The city puts rents from dilapidated 
apartment buildings into an account until the owner makes repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: Often by zoning administrators. "Let's put that building into 
REAP and hope the landlord shapes up."

ROBERTI ANNOUNCES BID FOR STATE TREASURER; POLITICS: HE PORTRAYS HIMSELF AS A 
FEISTY UNDERDOG WHO REFUSES TO GIVE RECALL FOES THE SATISFACTION OF SEEING HIM 
PASS UP A RUN FOR OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he won't be intimidated by a local recall election, state Sen. David A. 
Roberti formally announced his bid for state treasurer Friday and pledged to 
turn the fiscal office into a crime-fighting unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In press conferences in Van Nuys and Sacramento, Roberti reiterated the 
gun-control themes of the bruising San Fernando Valley recall campaign that has 
all but overshadowed Roberti's plans for his political future. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime legislator, who has served in the Assembly and Senate for 27 
years, portrayed himself as a feisty underdog who refuses to give his recall 
opponents the satisfaction of seeing him pass up a run for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall backers trying to get Roberti booted from his 20th District seat claim 
he is a soft-on-crime liberal, a carpetbagger who lives outside the district 
and that he failed to put a halt to Capitol corruption during his 13-year reign 
as Senate president pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 But because gun-rights advocates are among the recall's backers, the campaign 
to oust Roberti has also become a referendum on the 1989 assault weapon ban he 
authored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say this to assault weapon extremists -- you will not stop me from 
becoming treasurer of California," an impassioned Roberti declared Friday. 
"Because the people of California want a treasurer committed to finding and 
deploying all the fiscal resources possible in the fight against violent 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said he would attempt to redefine the office of state treasurer as a 
vehicle to help curb the growing violence that plagues California's streets and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He would do this, he said, by prudently selling bonds, investing retirement 
funds and providing fiscal advice to cities and counties so they can afford to 
put more police on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Roberti said he would shoulder the responsibility to ensure California 
has enough funds to build the estimated $6.6 billion worth of prisons needed as 
a result of the tough new "three strikes" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, forced by term limits to find a new job in December anyway, 
acknowledged that the recall effort had unexpectedly diverted his attention 
from his plans to run for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he even considered a safer run for the lower-profile Board of 
Equalization so he could focus almost exclusively on battling the April 12 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Roberti said, "I'm a fighter and I'm just not about to have these 
extremists push me out of office. So I'm going to go for what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer, Roberti faces a 
formidable challenger in Sacramento developer Phil Angelides. Angelides, the 
former state Democratic Party chairman, has raised about $2 million for his 
campaign, while Roberti has been forced to shift much of his general campaign 
money to the recall battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides said Friday he has endorsements from both of California's senators, 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as former Los Angeles Assemblyman 
Mike Roos, who co-authored the assault weapon ban that now haunts Roberti in 
the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am running for state treasurer to create 100,000 jobs by investing in 
California," Angelides said in a statement. "It is time for new leaders who can 
rebuild California." 
</P>
<P>
 The lone GOP candidate for state treasurer is Board of Equalization member 
Matt Fong of Los Angeles, who contended earlier that Roberti is a career 
politician who is past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 In other statewide races, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith withdrew Friday 
from the contest for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who narrowly lost to Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren in 1990 and had 
resumed campaigning in recent weeks, said he was concerned neither he nor 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), another Democratic candidate for 
attorney general, could unseat Lungren after an expensive primary battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negatives and the high cost incurred in a primary skirmish would only aid 
a sitting attorney general," Smith said, adding that he will now throw his 
support to Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the governor's race, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson filed his 
declaration of candidacy for reelection as expected before Friday's 5 p.m. 
deadline. The three Democrats opposing him, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) also filed their papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Controller Gray Davis filed the necessary papers to run for 
lieutenant governor to replace Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is retiring. 
Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), who wants to split California into three 
states, and Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) will oppose each other for the 
GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat, filed to replace his old 
boss, March Fong Eu, who resigned after being nominated to a U.S. 
ambassadorship. Other Democrats in the same race are former Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles. Former 
Assembly Republican leader Bill Jones of Fresno is seeking the nomination on 
the GOP side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state controller's race, Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) will 
face Democrats Kathleen Connell, a Westside financial consultant and former Los 
Angeles housing director, and Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata. Former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks is running for the GOP nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, 
and Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Health 
Committee, filed the necessary papers to run for state insurance commissioner. 
So did Republican Assemblyman Chuck Quackenbush of Cupertino; Republican Jim 
Conran of Orinda, former director of the Department of Consumer Affairs, and 
Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach, an insurance agency owner who was the 1990 
GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) and Maureen DiMarco, the governor's 
cabinet-level adviser for child development and education, filed for the 
nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction.

 After more than three decades in the same North Hollywood location, barbers 
Tom Wilson, 76, and Jim Carcioppolo, 79, are about to find out what it is like 
to lose their home. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they say, it's all because some of their clients have no homes of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our landlord stood outside the doorway here and said if we don't get rid of 
these homeless guys, he's going to throw us out," said Wilson, who received a 
notice to be out of Jim & Tom's Barber Shop, which they rent for about $600 a 
month, by March 27. The notice does not state the reason for the eviction and a 
lawyer for the landlord declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel too good because we never did anything bad," said Carcioppolo, 
who sometimes provides free haircuts to the homeless with Wilson. "In fact, we 
kinda helped people. And now we are in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The barbers say ridding their barbershop of the homeless would be like kicking 
a relative out of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Carcioppolo has spent the last 37 years making the tiny, four-chair shop a few 
feet from the corner of Magnolia and Laurel Canyon boulevards into a home for 
anyone who walked in. The cost of a haircut or a shave has remained the same 
for years -- $6 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Carcioppolo, who have been partners for 31 years, have created an 
old-time barbershop atmosphere, complete with four chrome barber chairs, 
hand-sharpened razors and even candy for children beside the antique cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the clients are working-class men from the neighborhood and 
professionals: veterinarians, lawyers and even an actor who played Superman in 
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 About four years ago, Russ Turner walked in. A piano player who lost his home 
to drugs and alcohol, Turner was attracted to the shop by the antique Stoddard 
upright he saw through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat down and played for them," said Turner, 43, who claims to have played 
for Frank Sinatra. Carcioppolo picked up his guitar and the two began playing 
together. "We just became like family." 
</P>
<P>
 In return for his music, the barbers gave Turner a free haircut. Soon, more 
homeless men wandered into the shop, doing small favors or running errands in 
exchange for an occasional haircut and some company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The piano player was the beginning of it," Wilson said. "He played such 
beautiful music. Now we have two or three homeless people hanging out here 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has not become a homeless shelter. There are rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, man, if you stink to high heaven, they're going to be honest," Turner 
said. "You're always welcome here as long as it's not been days since you took 
a bath. If Tom says, 'Look, get clean clothes on,' I respect and love them 
enough to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the homeless men a repellent to other paying customers. Turner's tunes 
-- like "Take Five" by Paul Desmond -- became more than just a friendly 
bartering agreement. The music became an attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have customers who come in and ask for Russ," Carcioppolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the eviction notice, however, the music appears to be fading into the 
background. The landlord's Beverly Hills attorney, Justin Lansberg, said 
neither he nor his client would comment on the eviction or the reasons for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both barbers said the eviction spells the end of the barbershop. Carcioppolo 
has been trimming locks for 65 years, since he was a little boy in Sicily. 
Wilson has been wielding the scissors since 1946, when he left the American 
Barber College in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to hang it up," Wilson said. "I just need a little time off 
to get my teeth fixed, my eyes fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who know the barbers think they are masking their sadness with the 
barbershop humor that made them popular. Some customers think the eviction 
smells worse than cheap after-shave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me if they let homeless people in here, it's their right," said 
customer Roger Howard, 67, of North Hollywood. "I don't know why it would make 
any difference to the landlord if they are paying rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the homeless are less concerned about where they will go than they are 
about the fate of their barber friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom and Jim have never turned their back on me or anybody that has walked 
in," Turner said. "It's not going to do as much to me as it's going to do to 
two friends I know." 
</P>
<P>
 After the barbers' 31-year relationship, Turner added, "it's almost like being 
married."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 56 SHOW UP FOR REAL STONE-AGE CASTING CALL

<P>
 Some of these guys were not having a Yabba Dabba Do time. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-stubbled faces of wanna-be Freds twisted in concentration. A man trying 
out for Walter Concrete wiped cold sweat onto his sleeve. Sure, a couple of 
Barneys yucked it up, but that pesky little fellow never did take anything 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 But serious it was, this cattle call for "The Flintstones Show" at Universal 
Studios Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six actors filed into the Debbie Reynolds Studio in North Hollywood on 
Friday to vie for roles as Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble, Walter Concrete and 
Ed McRock in what director Barbara Epstein described as a "20-minute Broadway 
musical" to be played over and over at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 40 survived the singing audition to line up behind choreographer Patti 
Colombo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right, left, push . Left, right, push ," she commanded. "You can interpret 
that. Barney and Fred shouldn't be dancers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, really, you'd never tell," puffed Andrew Craig, a distinctly 
Flintstone-looking mammoth, who in sneakers and faded jeans towered over others 
auditioning in flared dancer's pants and ballet flats. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein surveyed the flailing arms and exaggerated moves from a long table. 
Asked if some of the men were auditioning on their lunch hour, she responded, 
"No. Most of these people have Broadway credits." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Crofoot, a 120-pound blond, has acted on Broadway with Glenn Close and 
Ben Vereen. He's been on the London stage and on "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't play Barney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they don't want the real dancers, people who can move," Crofoot, 45, 
said to another who'd been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "My look is Barney. I would have thought," he said, trailing off. "I gave a 
good audition. Yeah, I'm a little disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the audition room, Craig waited in a small folding chair for his 
chance at the line in front of the director's table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate this," he said, a sweaty towel wrapped around his neck. "They're 
torturing me." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig, who had a small role in the film "Naked Gun 33 1/3" and plays Claude 
Hopper in Universal Studio's Western stunt show, said he's not really a dancer. 
He was last to audition. 
</P>
<P>
 As Craig finished his steps, his face contorted into an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Andrew. Thank you for coming out today," said Epstein, meaning, in 
the lexicon of the cattle call, "Goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens," Craig shrugged. "That's what this business is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Bart Sumner hungrily puffed on a cigarette. Fred Flintstone doesn't 
smoke, someone pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one does," said the 30-year-old improvisational veteran and screenplay 
writer who made the Sunday call-back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than a day job," he said, explaining why an actor would want to 
play Fred Flintstone for tourists. "That and I've always wanted to date Betty 
Rubble." REBECCA BRYANT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY NAMES 8-ACRE PARK AFTER EXPLORER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has named the city's planned showcase park after 
Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza and approved plans for a nature center 
there with stunning views of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old city's first major public works project is expected to open as 
early as 1995, with a 2,400-square-foot recreation and nature center and trails 
leading into the Santa Monicas. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting Wednesday night, the council unanimously chose for the 
eight-acre park the name of the Spanish explorer who stopped in the Calabasas 
area with 240 settlers in 1776, on his way to found what would become San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be able to build and contribute to the lore of the area, a lot 
of which has been forgotten," said Councilman Dennis Washburn, who proposed the 
name. "There's a real sense of history here, and I think people will get into 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved plans for a recreation center at the foot of the 
mountains, with floor-to-ceiling windows exposing the picturesque Malibu Creek 
state park. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story center, said Community Services Director Greg Johnson, will 
include a multipurpose room, a meeting room with a stone fireplace for use by 
public and community groups, breezeways leading to trails and a playground, and 
a terrace for wedding receptions and other ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Space will be reserved for displays about the natural character and history of 
the area, which was once populated by Chumash Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be beautiful," Johnson said, "and something the whole community 
can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the $1.2-million project have been set aside from Los Angeles County 
bond money and developer fees. KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HONORS FOR ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To recognize the heritage and culture of Asian Pacific Americans, the Los 
Angeles Asian Pacific American Heritage Committee is announcing a poster and 
essay contest as well as an awards program for outstanding Asian American 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorees will be awarded certificates of recognition, gift certificates and 
savings bonds.Last year's winners received $500 worth of savings bonds, dinner 
and pizza certificates, T-shirts and more. Three 1993 awardees hailed from San 
Fernando Valley high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the essay and poster contest, students of every ethnicity are invited to 
write a maximum 500-word essay and/or make a poster -- minimum 11 by 14 inches, 
maximum 24 by 35 -- related to this year's theme: "Celebrating the Family: 
Foundation of Our Future." The deadline for the contest, which is open to 
students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12, is April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Davino said the theme was inspired by the United Nations' declaration of 1994 
as the Year of the Family. May is national Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to have an Asian theme," Davino said, "although if it is, 
that's all the better because it's about Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month."  
</P>
<P>
 Prizes for the contest will be scholarships worth $50 to $300. Contest winners 
and the 10 outstanding Asian American students will be feted at receptions May 
11 at the Board of Education patio. The deadline for teachers and principals to 
nominate students for the academic award is Tuesday. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 3 ALLEGED UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS JAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were charged with of working as unlicensed contractors on Friday, 
after they were arrested during a sting operation at a North Hills home damaged 
during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigator with the state Contractor's Licensing Board posed as a 
homeowner March 2 and summoned the three men to the home to make repairs, 
Deputy City Atty.Don Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were charged with contracting without a license after preparing 
estimates during the sting, Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moshe Herscovitz, a 46-year-old Sherman Oaks man, allegedly used license 
numbers that belonged to other contractors. He advertised in the Yellow Pages, 
Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 James William Kiser, 38, of North Hills, was charged with demanding a down 
payment in excess of the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocek said contractors can only charge 10% of the total estimate -- with a 
$1,000 cap -- before work is started. Kiser allegedly asked the investigator 
for a $2,000 down payment to replace a wall in a job estimated to cost a total 
of $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Cisneros, a 23-year-old South-Central Los Angeles resident, was also 
charged with demanding too large a down payment, in his case half of an $8,900 
estimate to replace a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are scheduled to be arraigned in Van Nuys Municipal Court April 18.

<P>
 The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation is asking all city residents who use yard 
trimming collection services to only put grass, leaves and tree trimmings in 
their green garbage containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate yard-trimming collection allows the material to be turned into 
compost instead of ending up in landfills. The compost is sold in Fedco stores 
as TOPGRO, "L.A.'s Own Compost." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents with earthquake debris can call (213) 847-8811 for collection.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CONSTRUCTION UNDER WAY ON SUBWAY BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subway is under way in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people gathered Friday morning at the site of an old Red Car station 
to mark the beginning of construction of the North Hollywood branch of the new 
Metro Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.3-mile branch, which will be operated by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, will extend from the famous Hollywood and Vine intersection in 
Hollywood to Lankershim and Chandler in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley branch is part of Red Line's Segment 3, which will serve the 
communities of Hollywood, North Hollywood, Mid-City and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost $2.46 billion and is funded by federal, state and local dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 The groundbreaking ceremony was held just south of the future site of the 
North Hollywood Metro Red Line station, in front of the old Southern Pacific 
and Pacific Electric Depot on Chandler Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, which used a giant crane for the actual groundbreaking, was 
attended by Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA Vice Chairman Edmund D. 
Edelman, Mayor Richard Riordan and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, 1952, the last Red Car pulled out of a station at this site. The 
Red Cars were a huge passenger-rail network that stretched more than 1,000 
miles throughout Los Angeles County, including one mile of subway near downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood Red Line route, which will not be completed until the year 
2000, will feature tunnels running mostly under Lankershim Boulevard between 
Weddington Street in North Hollywood and Bluffside Drive in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation is expected to begin in April, with tunnel-digging machines brought 
in later this summer that are capable of digging at least 70 feet a day. The 
tunnels will be dug from north to south. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lanes north and one lane south on Lankershim Boulevard between Weddington 
and Chandler will remain open for local traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 4.4-mile segment of the Red Line has been operating since January, 
1993, near downtown Los Angeles and is carrying an average of 18,000 passengers 
per weekday. Segment 2 is under construction and will span from MacArthur Park 
to Wilshire and Western boulevards and Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the Red Line to be extended over 25 miles with 25 stations when 
completed. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; LOW-FLUSH TOILETS TO BE GIVEN AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank residents will be able to pick up free low-flush toilets today as part 
of a campaign to raise up to $12,000 for the city's two public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get students to go out and sign people up," said Donald Mauritz, a senior 
conservation adviser for the city of Burbank, which is offering the free 
commodes in cooperation with the Metropolitan Water District."They do the 
legwork." 
</P>
<P>
 For each low-flow toilet given away, the water district and the city will pay 
the schools $15. 
</P>
<P>
 From 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. today, residents will be able to pick up toilets at John 
Burroughs and Burbank high schools. The toilets use 1.5 gallons of water per 
flush instead of the typical 3.5 to 7 gallons.  
</P>
<P>
 Participants are asked to bring their old toilets back to Burbank High on 
March 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The old toilets are crushed and recycled for roadbed filler, Mauritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-flush toilets can save residents 35 gallons of water a day or $35 a year.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; EXPERT TO OVERSEE SCHOOL RENOVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank Unified School District board has signed a two-year contract with 
a planning and development expert to oversee the rebuilding of Burbank's aging 
public school system, the district's superintendent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali A. Kiafar will take over the newly created job of assistant superintendent 
for planning development and facilities on April 18, six days after a 
$100-million bond referendum to rebuild the schools goes before voters.A major 
part of the project includes the reconstruction of Burbank High School and a 
major renovation of John Burroughs High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools date back to the 1920s, and the entire district has not had a 
major renovation project since the 1950s. Under a $138-million plan, which 
would use bond money in addition to state and city funding, every school in the 
district would be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiafar's new position does not depend on whether the bond referendum passes, 
Supt. Arthur Pierce said this week. Were voters to reject the district's plan, 
Kiafar would amend it so that it could be resubmitted to the voters in six 
months, "because there is a need (to rebuild) and the need does not go away," 
Pierce said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kiafar, who will earn $83,000 per year, will also oversee maintenance and 
operations at the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The new position of assistant superintendent of planning development and 
facilities replaces that of assistant superintendent for business services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiafar is coming to the Burbank Unified School District from a job as director 
of planning and facilities at the Conejo Valley Unified School District. ED

 With the federal disaster assistance center now closed at Stonehurst Park, 
recreation officials there are gearing up to return to regular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can get back to normal," said Randy Kelly, recreation director at the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster center, set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Jan. 
20, closed Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was open, indoor recreational programs for about 300 people had to be 
relocated. A youth basketball league and a model-airplane flying club -- both 
accustomed to using the indoor gym at the center -- were moved outside. Other 
activities were held elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, regular athletic and educational programs were returned to 
the park's recreation center. In two weeks, the center will hold registration 
for spring activities. One program of particular concern for Kelly was the 
youth basketball league, which had to play outside. Fortunately, none of the 
games were rained out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never rained during a Saturday," Kelly said. "We were lucky." ED BOND

 The Mission Hills Community Mental Health Center is moving to a larger office 
several blocks from its current location. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which serves about 1,100 clients, will move from 11479 San 
Fernando Road in Pacoima to 15535 San Fernando Mission Road in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved the 
relocation, said Joel Bellman, spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 The current 6,100-square-foot site is too small, said Herminia Casillas, the 
center's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were unable to provide all services all the time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of parking and privacy for workers to interview clients are also problems 
at the current site. The new site, a former medical center, is about twice as 
large as the current building. Los Angeles County Mental Health officials 
expect the center to make the move in 60 to 90 days. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 A state commission will decide within two months whether to spend $6.8 million 
to repair Foothill Boulevard from Wheatland Avenue in Lake View Terrace to 
Lowell Avenue in Tujunga, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is trying to relinquish the roadway, once a part of the state 
highway system, to the city, but Los Angeles does not want to take ownership 
until the road, which residents have long complained is in need of repair, is 
upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.8-million figure has been agreed to by the state Department of 
Transportation and Los Angeles city engineers as the amount needed for repairs, 
but the project still has to be approved by the California Transportation 
Commission as part of the annual work list. The decision on which projects are 
included on the list will be made within two months, said Debbie Mah, a senior 
transportation engineer with Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 With construction of the modern freeway system, former highways no longer 
serve the function of serving regional transportation needs, and the state has 
been handing over parts of them to municipalities, Caltrans spokesman John Shaw 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on Foothill Boulevard could begin in 1995 or 1996, including 
repair of the pavement, gutters and curbs, if the commission gives its 
approval, Mah said. 
</P>
<P>
 The roadway would be accepted by the city of Los Angeles only after the repair 
work is completed, inspected and the transfer is approved by the City Council, 
said Robert Paul, a senior management analyst with the city's Bureau of 
Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state relinquished another section of Foothill Boulevard, 
between Paxton Avenue and Wheatland, but without completing repairs to the 
road. However, Caltrans has agreed to finish about $300,000 in repairs on that 
segment, Paul said. ED BOND

SECOND MAN IS ARRESTED IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives on Friday arrested a man suspected of 
being involved with a former sheriff's deputy in buying more than two pounds of 
cocaine from an undercover detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Kirk Williams, 30, of Los Angeles was arrested shortly after 7 a.m. at 
a house in the 8100 block of Zamora Avenue in Walnut Park, said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Larry Lincoln, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not say what they believed was the connection between 
Williams and former Deputy William Barr, who left the Sheriff's Department on 
March 3. He was arrested the previous day for allegedly buying 2.2 pounds of 
cocaine in a sting operation, Lincoln said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a connection," Lincoln said. "We are just not releasing what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were arrested by detectives from the Sheriff's Department's Internal 
Criminal Investigations Bureau, which investigates crimes committed by 
department members. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Williams was taken to the Carson Sheriff's Station and later 
booked for possession of cocaine for sale, transportation of cocaine to sell 
and criminal conspiracy, Lincoln said. He was being held on $50,000 bail and 
was expected to be arraigned Monday in the downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr, with four years' service as a deputy, had been assigned to the North 
County Correctional Facility near Castaic at the time of his arrest. The 
facility is part of the sprawling Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho jail complex, 
which holds as many as half of the inmates in the Los Angeles County jail 
system at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say an informant told them that Barr had been seeking to buy 
cocaine, which prompted a monthlong investigation and the sting operation. He 
was arrested after taking possession of the kilogram of cocaine on a downtown 
street and giving money to the undercover detective, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Barr's bail hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said the deputy 
planned to take the drugs to Tennessee and become a drug dealer. Barr, 25, of 
Bellflower has pleaded not guilty to felony drug charges stemming from the 
undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln said the arrest of Williams has ended the investigation. "We have no 
other suspects in this case," he said.

HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO BE DISCUSSED; TRANSPORTATION: CALTRANS IS STUDYING THE 
FEASIBILITY OF LINKING LOS ANGELES AND BAKERSFIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans will hold two workshops next week on proposed high-speed rail service 
between Los Angeles and Bakersfield, the last in a series of four public 
meetings on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is in the middle of a one-year feasibility study to "examine 
alternative routes, train technologies, costs and environmental issues" to link 
Bakersfield and Los Angeles via high-speed rail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The study will not make recommendations as to proposed routes, stations or 
technologies," according to the California Department of Transportation. 
"However, it will evaluate the financial, engineering and environmental issues 
related to each of the possible alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and Bakersfield has 
been discussed for years, and will be reviewed again at the two upcoming 
workshops in Burbank and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Archuleta, a Caltrans senior transportation engineer, said this study -- 
called the Los Angeles-Bakersfield High Speed Ground Transportation Feasibility 
Study -- will cost between $4 million and $4.5 million and includes preliminary 
engineering and mapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is limited to the Bakersfield-Los Angeles segment, the study is 
really part of a much larger evaluation of a high-speed rail system that would 
link Northern and Southern California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After its October completion, the study will be given to the California 
Intercity High Speed Ground Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll use the results of our study to incorporate into the overall study," 
Archuleta said. "They will be looking at statewide systems, ridership, market 
demand, economic impacts (and) financing options." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state commission will determine the route for the Bakersfield-Los 
Angeles segment, Antelope Valley officials are pushing their region as the most 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Antelope Valley's opportunity to send a strong message of support 
for an Antelope Valley (high-speed rail) alignment," wrote Palmdale Mayor Jim 
Ledford in a three-page letter to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major alignments have been identified for the Los Angeles-Bakersfield 
segment, said Archuleta. Both routes would follow the same initial path from 
Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to the Saugus area of the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible route would continue along the Interstate 5 corridor through the 
Grapevine and along California 99 to Bakersfield. The other alignment would run 
through the Antelope Valley, generally following the Antelope Valley Freeway 
and then the California Aqueduct through the Tehachapi Mountains to 
Bakersfield. A number of variations of those two routes are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Antelope Valley is the center of growth between Bakersfield and Los 
Angeles," Ledford wrote. "Because of its location, growth and future role in 
California's economic prosperity, the Antelope Valley is the natural link for 
(high-speed rail) between Bakersfield and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be some time before it is known if the lobbying pays off. The state 
commission is not expected to complete its study until late 1995, Archuleta 
said. Construction of a high-speed rail system is not expected to begin until 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The first workshop is scheduled in Burbank for 4 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the 
Burbank Library, 110 N. Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley workshop will be held from 5 to 9 p.m. Wednesday at the 
Palmdale Cultural Center, 704 E. Palmdale Blvd.

EVENT HELD FOR NEW TRUCK OFFERING FREE HIV TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most doctors won't make house calls, but Neva Chauppette is an exception. She 
not only comes to patients, she carts her entire office with her -- in a 
40-foot-long truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The specially equipped truck is one of five that offer free HIV tests and 
counseling at drug and alcohol abuse centers throughout Los Angeles County 
under a $1.1-million federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The $138,000 truck rolled off the assembly line in time for Friday's 
ribbon-cutting ceremony in North Hollywood. But even before it arrived, 
Chauppette and her staff of four counselors had already tested about 1,290 
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. Seven of the tests were positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The gleaming white truck with teal and peach racing stripes will make it even 
easier to perform the blood tests because it is so well-equipped, Chauppette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is a significant step forward in the fight against AIDS," said 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman as he cut the ribbon.  
</P>
<P>
 The truck contains all the accouterments of a stationary testing clinic -- a 
tiny waiting room, examination area, fax machine and cellular phone. But it 
differs in one important respect: Test results will be ready in three days 
instead of the usual two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical with this population so they don't relapse and start using 
again out of anxiety over whether they have AIDS," Chauppette said.  
</P>
<P>
 Drug users and alcoholics are considered at greater risk for AIDS than the 
general population not only because some of them have used contaminated 
needles, but because they frequently engage in unsafe sex, either to obtain 
drugs or because their inhibitions are lower when they are under the influence, 
Chauppette said. The need for tests is so high that a second, smaller mobile 
clinic has been ordered solely to serve the far-flung Antelope Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The current grant targets only those enrolled in treatment programs and their 
primary sex partners, partly because they are easier to reach than active 
substance abusers, Chauppette said.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who administer the federal grant, hope to get permission 
this summer from the federal government to expand the program to include visits 
to public parks and street corners where active drug users congregate. About 
10% of active substance abusers are infected with the HIV virus compared to 
about 5% of those in treatment, said John Schunhoff, director of the county's 
AIDS programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the mobile van staff are recovering from drug addictions and 
alcohol dependency themselves, including Leonard Dootson of Van Nuys. Sober for 
five years, Dootson said he can identify with clients.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's one addict working with another," Dootson said. "I really have my heart 
in this -- it's so needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The service has been well-received in the chemical dependency community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clients are in denial about AIDS, and this makes it so much easier to get 
them tested," said Millicent Nicholas, program director for the Center for 
Counseling and Education, a Tarzana private nonprofit facility that provides 
court-ordered treatment programs for convicted drunk drivers. "The staff is 
professional, very matter-of-fact and kind and sympathetic at the same time."  
</P>
<P>
 The mobile clinic's only fault may be its size, which makes it difficult to 
maneuver and park, Chauppette said. At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, she 
presented a plaque to the company that generously donated a parking space for 
the over-sized van. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an L.A. moment," said Tom Clay, chief of AIDS programs for the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health Services. "Only in L.A. would a parking 
space be honored."

PUPILS' EXPOSURE TO HIGH ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ENRAGES PARENTS; HEALTH: 
TRANSFORMER MAY HAVE SUBJECTED A TEACHER AND 33 KINDERGARTNERS TO POTENTIAL 
HAZARD, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Parents of kindergarten students at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School 
reacted with rage and tears Friday to a report that a school transformer had 
exposed their children to strong electromagnetic fields -- the subject of a 
scientific debate as a cause of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 30 parents were told that an electrical transformer outside a 
bungalow classroom may have exposed 33 kindergartners and their teacher to the 
electromagnetic field, often shortened to EMF. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the group complained that it had taken the Los Angeles Unified School 
District more than three months to inform parents and teachers of the potential 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 EMFs are present wherever an electric current passes through a wire. Several 
scientific studies have found a small increase in cancer rates among children 
living near high-current power lines and among workers in occupations involving 
electricity, such as utility line workers and film projectionists. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller number of studies have found no connection, and scientists generally 
say a causal link between EMF and cancer has not been proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering in the Dixie Canyon school's library, the parents heard a 
presentation by Winifred Yancy, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
electrical engineer who described results of a December study of the 
transformer's electromagnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
 The study reported that the highest EMF reading -- taken at the teacher's 
chair -- was 107 milligauss. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no agreement on what magnetic field exposure level -- if any -- 
poses a health risk, some experts have said the safe level is as low as 1 
milligauss, the level that would be detected about a foot from an electric 
toaster in use. EMF strengths fall off sharply with distance from the 
electrical source. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the school district nor the DWP have guidelines for acceptable levels 
of EMFs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed," said kindergarten teacher Chris Chan, fighting back tears. 
"Why didn't they let us know? I've been sitting in that chair. I don't want to 
be a statistic. I want to see my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Yancy used an analogy to illustrate the difficulty in proving a causal link 
between EMFs and health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rooster crows and the temperature rises," she said. "We know that the 
sunrise causes both events. But a crowing rooster does not cause the sun to 
rise." 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents were not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm livid," said Jeff Fried of Sherman Oaks, who has a daughter in the class. 
"There are no studies that say chocolate milk causes cancer. But a number of 
studies say there is a relationship between electromagnetic fields and cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was raised in late September when Fried approached the school with a 
concern about the proximity of several transformers -- which convert electrical 
voltage from 480-volt high power transmission lines to the 120-volt domestic 
standard -- to the wall of the kindergarten room. School administrators 
informed the district and DWP took the readings Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said a number of factors, including winter vacation and the 
Northridge earthquake, prevented them from getting the results of the survey to 
the school before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," said James Matte, who works for the district's 
office of environmental health and safety. "It was a breakdown in 
communication. That's the best way to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Doi, director of the district's environmental health and safety 
department, which assigns EMF studies, said one other school, Mayall Street 
Elementary in North Hills, had high EMF levels detected last year, but the 
problem was corrected with fencing around the transformers to keep children at 
a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, it was just one other school," Doi said. "It was an 
isolated case." But Mike Loveridge, a facilities director for the district, 
said there are many transformers located next to classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the configuration of the building -- it's not uncommon," said 
Loveridge. "We've got them everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Doi said representatives from her department will meet with maintenance 
officials to formulate a districtwide plan to look into EMF levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, district officials plan to move a portable classroom to the 
Dixie Canyon campus by Monday and transfer kindergarten students to a temporary 
classroom until the new one is ready.

PIPE BOMB RIPS HOLE IN STORE ROOF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pipe bomb discovered at a grocery store blew up Friday as police attempted 
to remove it, injuring no one but blasting a hole in the roof, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb was discovered on the roof after a man telephoned the store and said 
the business was about to be blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your store is going to blow up at any minute," the caller told the shop owner 
about 9 a.m., Sgt. Ken Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops within two to three blocks of the market in the 7100 block of Foothill 
Boulevard were evacuated and traffic was diverted before the device exploded at 
3:30 p.m., more than three hours after it was discovered, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homemade bomb was more than a foot long, police said. The explosion 
created a hole in the roof the size of an air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller made no demands. Police have no suspects. CHAU LAM

WITNESS LINKS 2 GUNMEN TO FATAL SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: GANG MEMBER CLARIFIES 
EARLIER TESTIMONY ABOUT THE ATTACK IN PANORAMA CITY THAT KILLED A TEEN-AGER AND 
FETUS OF ANOTHER GIRL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clarifying his earlier testimony, an admitted gang member testified Friday 
that two gunmen were involved in a drive-by shooting in Panorama City that led 
to the death of a teen-age girl and a 3-month-old fetus being carried by 
another girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in a shooting last May 15 were Nikki Foley, 16, and a fetus being 
carried by Mona Moore, who was 15. Two other teen-age girls struck by gunfire 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying for the prosecution, 18-year-old Kenyon Brown said he was in one of 
three cars that participated in a late-night raid against a rival gang. Brown 
said that after the cars pulled up near an apartment building on Sylmar Avenue, 
defendant Robert Harvey stepped out of his car, and an unidentified man stepped 
out of another car and both fired shots into a group of people attending a 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, 20, of North Hollywood, Brandon Reed, 22, of Sun Valley and Ronald 
Ausborne, 20, also of North Hollywood, are each charged with two counts of 
murder in the case, which could lead to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is unique because prosecutors have charged the men with murder in the 
death of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court is deciding the issue of whether a fetus must be 
viable -- which is generally considered to be at least 5 1/2 months -- or if it 
is murder simply because the mother did not have a choice in terminating her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Harvey is in custody, the second shooter -- who was identified by Brown 
only by his gang moniker -- remains at large. Brown testified that Reed and 
Ausborne were among those who drove to the party but did not fire any shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the shooting occurred when one of his friends announced that "there 
was a party over there and we was going to take care of some business." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by Deputy Dist. Atty. Franco A. Baratta what he meant, Brown 
responded, "I thought we was going to go over there and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, when the cars stopped on Sylmar Avenue, Harvey and the second shooter 
got out and began firing, according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown faces murder charges in Juvenile Court because he was only 17 when the 
killings took place, but he struck a leniency deal with prosecutors that led to 
his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, if Brown testified truthfully, murder charges will be dropped 
and he will be allowed to plead guilty only to being an accessory to the crime. 
Prosecutors have told him they will not object to any sentence he received in 
Juvenile Court.

27 CHALLENGERS WILL RUN FOR THE VALLEY'S 5 CONGRESSIONAL SEATS; POLITICS: 
FRIDAY WAS THE DEADLINE FOR CANDIDATES TO SUBMIT NOMINATION PAPERS. THE POSTS 
HELD BY BEILENSON AND BERMAN ARE THE MOST COVETED.

 Twenty-seven challengers -- including a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, a 
librarian and an investigative reporter -- had filed papers as of Friday to run 
for the seats held by five congressmen who represent the San Fernando Valley, 
with those of Reps. Anthony Beilenson and Howard Berman the most coveted by the 
political wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was the deadline for candidates to submit their nomination papers to 
run for these federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven challengers filed for the 24th District seat held by Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), but the nine-term incumbent will face only one challenger 
in the Democratic primary -- Scott Gaulkey, whose occupation was not reported 
to county clerk's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The district covers the southwestern Valley -- including Encino, Tarzana, 
Woodland Hills, Reseda, Winnetka, Canoga Park and West Hills -- and Calabasas, 
Agoura, Malibu and the Conejo Valley in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the 24th District Republican primary that is crowded with aspirants who 
believe Beilenson, second-highest ranking Democrat on the powerful House Rules 
Committee, is vulnerable because the 1990 reapportionment thrust the 
Westside-based liberal into a Valley-based Republican-leaning district. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Beilenson was able to win in 1992 with 55% of the vote against a 
well-funded conservative Republican challenger, former Assemblyman Tom 
McClintock. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24th District GOP primary will feature Richard Sybert, a former 
cabinet-level officer in the Wilson Administration who has loaned his campaign 
more than $400,000; Robert Hammer, a self-employed banking consultant; Mark 
Boos Benhard, the owner of a media relations firm who was an aide to former 
Congressman William Dannemeyer; Sang Korman, a businessman who has spent more 
than three-quarters of a million dollars of his own money on three previous 
unsuccessful congressional races, and Emery Shane, a commercial real estate 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as a Libertarian in the 24th District is John Koehler. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attracting a large field of candidates is the ethnically diverse 26th 
District seat held since 1982 by Berman (D-Panorama City). Berman's working 
class district includes most of the eastern Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Democrats -- Jose Galvan, a librarian, community activist and 
frequent political candidate, and G.C. (Brodie) Broderson, a businessman -- 
will be vying with the incumbent for their party's nomination in the June 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Republicans are running in the 26th District GOP primary. They are: Gary 
Forsch, a hardware store manager who scored 30% of the vote against Berman as 
the Republican standard-bearer in the 1992 general election; Bill Glass, a CPA 
from Sherman Oaks, and John Furutani, a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing as minor party candidates were Libertarian Erich D. Miller, a Reseda 
businessman, and Peace and Freedom Party member Mark Farr, a student from 
Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25th District, Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) will face 
Sandra Tulley of Lancaster, who did not report her occupation to election 
officials, in the GOP primary. McKeon, the owner of a chain of western clothing 
stores who has become a leader of freshman House Republicans, will be seeking 
his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th District includes the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys as well as 
the Los Angeles city communities of Northridge, Chatsworth, Porter Ranch, North 
Hills and Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 James H. Gilmartin of Saugus, who got 30% of the vote running against McKeon 
in 1992, and William Horning of Lancaster, a custody records clerk, will 
compete in the 25th District Democratic primary. Running as a Libertarian in 
the 25th District is Devin Cutler, a financial director from Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale), the dean of California's GOP congressional 
delegation who is seeking his 12th term, will be opposed in the 27th District 
Republican primary by Elizabeth Michael, a businesswoman. The Democratic 
primary will pit Doug Kahn, an Altadena businessman, against Roger Kulpa, owner 
of an accounting firm. American Independent Party member Bill Gibbs of Glendale 
and Libertarian Dennis Decherd, a computer systems analyst from Pasadena, also 
have their hats in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27th District includes Glendale, Burbank and the Sunland-Tujunga 
communities in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 29th Congressional District, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), the 
House's most influential member on health-care issues, will be opposed in the 
Democratic primary by investigative reporter Jon Rappaport. Running unopposed 
in the GOP primary is Paul Stepanek, a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as a Libertarian is Michael J. Binkley, a software engineer, and Peace 
and Freedom Party representative Nancy Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29th District includes Studio City and parts of Sherman Oaks but is mostly 
located south of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary election is June 7, the general election Nov. 8.

JAMES CAAN ARRESTED, RELEASED AFTER ALLEGED GUN INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor James Caan, famous for his role as a hotheaded gangster in "The 
Godfather," was released on his own recognizance Friday after being arrested 
because a rap musician accused him of pulling a gun during an argument, police 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan was arrested at 10 p.m. Thursday and booked for investigation in 
connection with an accusation of brandishing a weapon, a misdemeanor, Los 
Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor said he was going to his brother's North Hollywood apartment when he 
got into an argument with another man, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caan, according to Dunkin, "is there to visit his brother, he's with a friend, 
they get out of the car and get into a confrontation with someone, possibly 
over vandalism. He goes back and gets a gun and brandishes it in a threatening 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Police continued to interview witnesses Friday, and the city attorney's office 
will decide sometime next week whether to file charges against Caan, Dunkin 
said. He said the actor apparently had a permit to carry a concealed weapon. If 
convicted, Caan could face a six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Caan was questioned by police after an acquaintance fell to his 
death while trying to reach a high-rise apartment where Caan was staying. 
Authorities determined the death to be an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caan incident occurred only a few hours after announcement of a settlement 
in a case involving another movie star, Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Blank of Hollywood, who sued Nicholson for allegedly smashing the 
windshield of Blank's Mercedes-Benz in a Studio City traffic dispute, settled 
the suit, according to Blank's attorney, Charles E. Ruben. Ruben said he could 
not reveal the details of the settlement.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; THE 'BIBLICALLY ILLITERATE GENERATION'; POLL: FINDINGS 
SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH 85% OF AMERICANS CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS, MOST ADULTS 
CAN'T DEFINE 'THE GOSPEL' OR 'EVANGELICAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Zealous believers strategically seated at sports events have held up signs 
reading "John 3:16" when television cameras pointed their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers may have recognized that as a Bible verse and not, for instance, 
a plea to bring in a reliever named John with an earned run average of 3.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the message was probably a mystery to most viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey found that 65% of Americans did not know what "John 3:16" 
signifies -- prompting one San Fernando Valley clergyman to comment that many 
modern Christians belong to a "biblically illiterate generation." 
</P>
<P>
 In that survey, Glendale-based pollster George Barna found that most adults 
also cannot define "the Gospel," "evangelical" or "the Great Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Barna's findings, in a survey of 605 representative American adults in 
January, are consistent with the experiences of many clergy members who say 
that most people today are not conversant with church language, although polls 
show nearly 85% of Americans identify themselves as Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 What may be surprising is that three of the terms also stumped at least half 
of the 36% of respondents defined by Barna as "born-again" Christians -- people 
expected to be knowledgeable in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gospel" -- the tenet that sins are forgiven by Jesus Christ's atoning 
death and resurrection and by believing in him as the savior -- was described 
adequately by 37% of the adults surveyed, according to Barna. Only 16% of the 
born-again Christians did not offer an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, half of the born-again Christians could not describe John 3:16, a 
passage in the Gospel of John which reads, "For God so loved the world that he 
gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may 
have eternal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the word evangelical is defined variously even by conservative 
Christians, 57% of the born-again adults in the survey offered no guess as to 
its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obscure term was the Great Commission, a favorite term with earlier 
generations of preachers, which refers to Matthew 28:19 in which the 
resurrected Jesus commands his followers "to make disciples of all nations." 
About 86% of all adults did not hazard a guess on its meaning; nor did three 
out of four of the born-again Christians, Barna said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Christian) leaders who rely upon a shorthand language which is 
comprehensible to a relative handful of insiders are severely limiting their 
ability to instruct, influence and motivate people to respond to the teachings 
and goals of the Christian faith," said Barna, president of the Barna Research 
Group and author of several books aimed at conservative Christian readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that many born-again Christians "had no clue what these foundational 
expressions mean says a lot about the depth of insight that people have into 
their faith," Barna said. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Gallup Organization 12 years ago found that 46% could name all 
four Gospels in the New Testament while another 46% could name none or said 
they didn't know. Asked in the same poll who gave the Sermon on the Mount, 42% 
correctly named Jesus, 24% cited a wrong person and 34% said they didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Some San Fernando Valley pastors said in interviews that the low level of 
biblical knowledge among churchgoers was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a biblically illiterate generation," said the Rev. David Miller, 
pastor of the nondenominational Church at Rocky Peak in Chatsworth. "I tell my 
staff: 'Be careful about using Christianese.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he avoids using the words grace, love and saints without giving 
full explanation of their meaning in the Christian context. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use the word saved because of all the spiritual baggage attached to 
it," he said. "And I never use the words evangelical and fundamentalist because 
they mean so many things to different people." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Rotz, newly installed pastor of Northridge Community Church of the 
Nazarene, said, "We are very much a secular nation, and people get a constant 
diet of news and media that leave out almost all references to God, church and 
the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 To appeal to society at large, "we've got to use terms that are familiar," 
Rotz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Anne Tiemeyer, pastor of Christ the King Lutheran Church in Van Nuys, 
said she was reminded during her seminary training to avoid shorthand terms by 
a teacher who asked students what they meant by "salvation" or "grace" whenever 
they used those words. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should make people aware of traditional (church) language, but we should 
also make it relevant to their lives," she said.

CONFERENCE CALMLY PREPARES FOR THE END OF WORLD -- BY 1996; DOOMSDAY: MEMBERS 
OF INSTITUTE OF DIVINE METAPHYSICAL RESEARCH EXPECT THE EARTH TO 'REST.' BUT 
THEY FEEL RELIEF RATHER THAN FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Connie Roberson and her husband, Jimmy, don't save for retirement or their 
children's college educations. Victor Jackson, a senior at Cleveland State 
University, doesn't worry about the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because they know something you probably don't. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1996, the world is going to end in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the Robersons were among about 1,000 people who attended the 
Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research's conference, which ended here 
Sunday. The institute is based in Los Angeles and claims a nationwide 
membership of 5,600, mainly African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the group's three-day event came from different parts of the 
country but hold in common the belief that the world will end within two years, 
when the earth will turn 7 days old -- in God's reckoning -- and be ready for a 
rest.  
</P>
<P>
 How it will end, they don't know. But end it will. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe the Creator's plans began to unfold in 1931, when Henry Clifford 
Kinley, the founder of the institute, received a divine message. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of that looming on the horizon, one might think this crowd would be 
depressed, or at least a bit jittery. But just the opposite is true: Believers 
said that knowing their days are numbered gives them a profound sense of 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts me into a more relaxed state of mind," said Connie Roberson of 
Norfolk. "I don't have as much pressure as the world would have, thinking they 
have to achieve so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said: "I can't look to long-range plans or anything like that. I just 
have to take it day by day, knowing the creation won't be here in four or five 
years, knowing that there will be no world by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to know you won't have to deal with daily life anymore, to not have to 
be bothered by the cares of this world, is a relief. I'm definitely not sad 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 End of the world religious scenarios are nothing new. With a new millennium 
just around the corner, doomsday prognostications are increasing so quickly 
that an academic newsletter attempts to keep track of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research doesn't consider itself a 
religion. It's a school for people investigating the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leaders, who are called teachers and deans, say the institute encourages 
questioning. Mormons, Pentecostal Christians and leaders from any other 
religious group are challenged to attend meetings and present their views. Some 
have accepted. Hot debates ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 At any time, institute members know they may become the main event. The school 
believes that when believers are called upon to give a message, the Holy Spirit 
will deliver it through them. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday, Karen Morse's name was called. Morse, of Richmond, Va., 
took the stage, clipped a microphone to herself and told hundreds of fellow 
believers that she was nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, however, she paced the stage while speaking with the 
authoritative cadence of a Jesse Jackson. For emphasis, she tapped one of eight 
giant murals behind her with a pointer. With almost cartoon-like drawings, the 
murals illustrated founder Kinley's visions and teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse's main point was that Yahweh, or God, communicates to humanity through 
visions to prophets. Throughout her 45 minutes on stage, she quoted Scripture 
and occasionally criticized the beliefs of major religions, such as 
Christianity, while fellow believers took notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many institute members used to be Christians, as was Kinley, a Church of God 
in Christ minister who renounced his beliefs after saying he met Yahweh in a 
vision in 1931. But the crowd also included former Muslims and Jehovah's 
Witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonza Joyner, a former Baptist and the institute's Virginia dean, said, "We 
happen to be privileged to be living at that time when creation is coming to a 
close." He said the institute's main attraction is to "escape the impending 
doom." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a cult," said Robert Harris, the organization's international dean, 
who studied under Kinley. "We don't have people selling all they have and doing 
stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around. You can see how it is. They're dressed well. They're working 
people. No one is down in the dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're as happy as can be."

FEE FOR SAN PEDRO IMPROVEMENTS GAINS STEAM; BUSINESS: SOME MERCHANTS DROP 
OPPOSITION TO FEE OF $100 TO $300 A YEAR. COUNCIL SETS FINAL HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A change of heart among some merchants has kept alive a proposal to pay for 
public improvements in downtown San Pedro with an annual assessment fee. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 business owners withdrew their objections to the idea, allowing the 
Los Angeles City Council to begin steps to institute the fee, which would be 
$100 to $300 a year. A public hearing and final council vote are scheduled for 
April 5, when city officials say they will have a count of how many of the 419 
affected businesses still oppose the assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that the fees would generate about $96,000 a year for 
such projects as new street lighting in an area generally bounded by Harbor 
Boulevard, Pacific Avenue and 3rd and 10th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the assessments appeared to have been defeated because opponents 
submitted more than 200 letters of protest from merchants and property owners 
affected. Since the opponents made up more than half the merchants involved, 
the office of Harbor-area Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. declared the proposal 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the proposed fee, calling it vital to the economic revival 
of downtown San Pedro, persuaded some merchants to reconsider their position, 
leaving opponents with less than the 50% needed to block the assessments. At 
last count, 49.3% of the businesses were listed as opposing the plan, according 
to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, both sides have until April 5 to marshal their forces in the dispute. And 
a spirited public hearing this week made it clear that the battle is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of our district are solidly against this proposal," said John 
Papadakis, who with his brother, Nick, helped lead an opposition letter-writing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program was poorly conceived (and) unfairly presented," Papadakis added, 
maintaining that proponents tried to ramrod the proposal through the city.  
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the assessments called the plan the only hope for 
reinvigorating a downtown business district pummeled by the recession, 
competition from nearby cities and years of neglect by Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a 5% to 7% loss of business downtown in the last year," said Gary 
Larson, a past president of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce. "It's a huge 
loss. We can't handle any more. We are dying down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich, who has supported the assessments, said the fees would be locally 
controlled and vital to improving downtown San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, I do recognize there are some concerns by businesses within the 
district. And our office and those who are proponents of the (assessments) will 
do everything we can to mitigate those concerns," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even those who agree with his position, however, say the task remains 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been very difficult (to win supporters) because there's such a gut 
level (opposition)" to new fees or taxes, said Janet Gunter, a vice president 
of San Pedro Revitalization Corp., a nonprofit group of local merchants.

2 CITIES ROLL BACK BASIC RATE CHARGED BY CENTURY CABLE; REGULATION: WEST 
HOLLYWOOD AND BEVERLY HILLS ARE AMONG FIRST NATIONALLY TO IMPLEMENT A FEDERAL 
LAW GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO OVERSEE CABLE SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 West Hollywood and Beverly Hills this week ordered Century Cable to cut the 
price of basic cable television, becoming pioneers in the uncharted realm of 
local cable regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood residents who protested recent cable hikes applauded March 7 
when the City Council unanimously approved a rate cut of nearly $4 from the 
$24.08-a-month cost of basic cable. Beverly Hills followed suit the next day, 
directing Century to chop the price of the same package by $1.68. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities also directed Century to pay refunds going back to Sept. 1, when 
regulation of cable service began. 
</P>
<P>
 The two communities are among the first in the nation to make use of a new 
federal law granting municipalities the right to regulate the cost of the most 
basic cable service. The 1992 law ended a six-year period of deregulation that 
saw rapidly rising cable prices. Other Westside communities are studying their 
cable rates as a possible first step toward regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom has a vote looked like such sweet revenge as in West Hollywood, where 
hundreds of residents complained last year when Century repackaged its channels 
in such a way that subscribers had to pay about $8 more to keep the same 
programming. Several angry customers brought their bills to the March 7 
session, and council members seized the chance to take swipes at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting ripped off by Century Cable," said Councilman Paul Koretz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood's 11,000 cable subscribers might not see immediate savings, 
though. Century has one month to appeal the rollback orders to the Federal 
Communications Commission, but it is unclear if it will do that, said Maggie 
Bellville, a company vice president based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellville said company officials, who did not attend the West Hollywood 
session, hoped to "come to an understanding" with the cities over cable rates. 
"I can't tell you what's going to happen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Century lawyers sought to delay the West Hollywood action, saying the company 
was given too little time to answer the planned rollback order. But city 
officials characterized the move as foot-dragging, saying company executives 
were aware of the city's plans weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rollbacks were calculated using figures supplied by Century and matching 
them against rate ceilings allowed by the new federal law. A consultant hired 
by West Hollywood determined that the company was overcharging customers by 
$3.72 a month for its 42-channel basic cable package, and 40 cents a month on 
equipment used in many houses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, Century Cable officials had skipped a March 1 public hearing 
on cable rates, saying company officials were out of the country. The city 
agreed to postpone its decision until this week to give officials from the 
company's New Canaan, Conn., headquarters an opportunity to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 However, despite the vocal objections of Century representatives, the council 
rolled back rates for the city's 9,200 subscribers from $24.08 to $22.40. In 
addition, subscribers can expect a refund of nearly $15 for the amount overpaid 
to Century Cable since September in service and equipment fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Schneider, Century Cable's senior vice president, said Tuesday that "it 
is likely that the company will appeal" Beverly Hills' cable rate decision 
within the next 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the company believes the city has exceeded its jurisdiction in 
setting the new rates because it counted channels that are not part of the 
42-channel basic service package in calculating the per-channel cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contends, however, that the cable company moved many channels 
including CNN out of what had previously been a 53-channel basic tier in 
September and began offering them individually or as part of a new package. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would appear to be moving channels to an a la carte status to avoid 
regulation and to raise the rates," said city spokesman Fred Cunningham, in a 
report on cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills filed a complaint with the FCC in December contesting the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider told the council that if a Century appeal is successful, it is 
uncertain whether the company would try to recoup the $1.68 difference in cable 
rate fees for the months it loses during the appeal.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BELATED CANDIDATE FORUMS MAY HEAT UP COUNCIL 
RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With an earthquake-stunted political season, Santa Clarita's 11 active City 
Council candidates are only now getting their messages out to potential voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate forums are expected to play a larger role than normal for those 
seeking the three open council seats April 12, and moderated discussions are 
being presented by political parties, environmental groups, business interests, 
a service club, the senior citizens center and a local radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 The first will be at 2:30 p.m. today at Canyon Country's First Christian 
Church. Sponsored by the Democratic Club of the Santa Clarita Valley, it 
features wry references to regular council proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates' opening statements are being capped at three minutes, the time 
allotted to citizens at council meetings. And the entire forum is projected to 
take four hours and seven minutes -- "the length of a typical Santa Clarita 
City Council meeting," organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of the forums, there's so little time to hear what they have to say," 
said Frank Ford, event chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council race supposed to be nonpartisan -- and no declared Democrats 
running -- the club won't be making endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other forums are scheduled before the election, and some will focus on 
specific topics such as the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cast a spotlight on things other forums don't cover," said Karen Pearson, 
vice president of the Santa Clarita Valley chapter of the Sierra Club, which 
will sponsor one of the forums.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the quietest City Council candidates race I've seen in a long 
time. It's very important people know who they're voting for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club forum is set for 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Santa Clarita Valley 
Senior Center in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scheduled forums are: 
</P>
<P>
 * March 28, 7 p.m. at Placerita Junior High School in Newhall, sponsored by 
the Zonta Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 31, 7 p.m. in the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center in Newhall, 
sponsored by the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 4, 7:30 p.m. in the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center, sponsored by 
the Santa Clarita Civic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 16, 7 p.m. at Sulphur Springs Elementary School in Canyon Country, 
sponsored by the Canyon Country Chamber of Commerce, KBET 1220-AM and the 
Signal newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce is not holding its traditional 
forum because its operations were disrupted by the Northridge earthquake. A 
forum by the Santa Clarita Valley Congress of Republicans has been canceled 
because it conflicted with the earlier-scheduled Zonta Club event. 
</P>
<P>
 The three incumbents seeking reelection are Carl Boyer, Jo Anne Darcy and Jill 
Klajic. Their challengers are Larry Bird, an apartment owner and manager; 
Dennis Farnham, a Los Angeles police officer and small-business owner; Fred 
Heiser, an engineer; Tim Jorgensen, an emergency medical technician; Clyde 
Smith, former superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District; 
Linda Storli, a high school history teacher and former parks commissioner; 
Theodore de Vries, and Craig Wanek. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the ballot will be Kenneth Dean and Rosalind Wayman. Both have dropped 
out of the race.

 Officials from Palmdale, Lancaster and the county should pool their resources 
more efficiently to attract new industry and create jobs in the area, a 
consulting firm has urged. 
</P>
<P>
 PHH Fantus Consulting, a Chicago firm hired by local officials to determine 
how to jump-start Antelope Valley's economy, released the results of its 
$150,000 study Thursday at a meeting in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm urged local officials to set up an Antelope Valley Regional 
Partnership to coordinate efforts to retain existing businesses and lure new 
ones to the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, this study institutionalizes regional cooperation," said Vern 
Lawson, executive director of the Antelope Valley Local Development Corp. 
"There has never been a road map or blueprint for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson's organization, which markets the area to prospective employers, joined 
the two cities in paying for the study. Local leaders are eager to create more 
jobs because thousands of Antelope Valley residents now must commute long 
distances to workplaces in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the consultants said the Antelope Valley has "a substantial 
amount of human energy devoted to economic development. Unfortunately, because 
of lack of coordination, our analysis indicates that duplication of effort 
exists in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conversely, little comprehensive effort is occurring in other areas, such as 
convention, tourism and film attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate the duplication, the consultants recommended establishing the 
regional partnership, which would include representatives from the two cities, 
the county, Antelope Valley College and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 This group would assign or keep track of economic development tasks handled by 
cities and organizations to assure their efforts are conducted efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal isn't to take over projects that other groups are working on," 
Lancaster Councilman George Runner said. "It's to sanction and at times fund. 
It's not a competitive role; it's a steering role." 
</P>
<P>
 Runner believes the Lancaster City Council will endorse the formation of the 
regional partnership but does not know how much the council will agree to spend 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants recommended that the two cities and the Economic Development 
Corp. together provide up to $300,000, mainly to cover marketing and business 
research activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants' other key recommendation was to create an Antelope Valley 
Tourism and Film Commission, which would help bring more conventions and film 
crews to the area. This group would be financed by the two cities and their 
chambers of commerce.

 Where--Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (24-7)--Genevieve Evarts has been on fire in the playoffs, and 
she scored a game-high 22 points when the Sailors played Brea a week ago in the 
Southern Section Division III-AA championship game. Evarts isn't the problem. 
Her teammates combined for only 18 points against a Ladycat defense that was 
content to let Newport bring the ball upcourt. In the first game, the Sailors 
thought they could handle the emotional battle of playing Brea and they 
trailed, 17-2, after one quarter. Having lost once before creates an even 
bigger emotional battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (31-0)--The Ladycats' six playoff victories have been by an 
average of 45 points. Nno team has scored more than 20 points against them by 
halftime, and the Ladycats' average lead has been 32. Sarah Beckley has been 
terrific under the boards in the playoffs. In the midst of a slump in the first 
meeting with Newport Harbor, Nicole Erickson was four of 18 from the field--the 
rest of the team was 23 of 39 (59%). In Thursday's victory over San Luis 
Obispo, Erickson was nine of 11. No slump, no worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the game--Newport Harbor's post play was nonexistent in the first 
game--the Sailors got only two offensive rebounds and 18 total. When Brea broke 
the game open early, eight of its first 12 points came on follow shots. If the 
Sailors don't rebound, they won't win. And even if they do, they have almost no 
chance. Starting Lineups

 Where--Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (27-2)--It's hard to find a weakness with the Cougars, who have won 
17 consecutive games. Four starters are back from last season's team, which won 
the State Division I title. Crenshaw, ranked fifth in the nation by USA Today, 
averages 98 points and has scored more than 120 points six times. Kristaan 
Johnson, son of Marques Johnson, Tremaine Fowlkes and Reggie McFerren all 
average about 20 points, but the Cougars don't rely on those three players. 
They go nine deep and any one of them can hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (33-0)--The Monarchs, ranked second by USA Today, got rolling again 
Thursday, scoring 51 points in the second half to beat Fresno Bullard, 84-68. 
Freshman Schea Cotton has been a dominating force the last two weeks. He scored 
29 against Crescenta Valley in the first round of the regional and 36 against 
Bullard. Miles Simon has had consecutive off nights offensively, but don't 
expect that to last. Mater Dei has lost twice to Crenshaw in the regional 
final. The Cougars won last season, 63-61, and in 1986, 59-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the game--A lot will depend on Shaun Jackson, Mater Dei's center. When 
he's playing well, the Monarchs look smooth. When he gets in foul trouble, they 
tend to depend too much on Cotton and Simon. It's important that Mater Dei does 
not get caught up in a run-and-shoot game. If they do, it could be a first; the 
Monarchs have never been embarrassed since McKnight took over the program 12 
years ago. The Cougars' key is simple: Just keep playing the way they are 
playing. Starting Lineups

<P>
 Alemany (30-0)--Alemany is the No. 2-seeded team. The Indians won in the first 
round, 63-53, over Escondido and in the semifinals, 68-51, over San Diego 
Mission Bay.Alemany defeated San Bernardino, 49-46, in the Southern Section 
Division II-A final. Alemany won the division title in 1992 and has won six 
league titles in the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (31-0)--Woodbridge is seeded No. 1. The Warriors won in the first 
round, 71-41, over Bakersfield East and in the semifinals, 84-63, over San 
Bernardino. Woodbridge defeated Hemet, 59-47, in the Division II-AA final. 
Woodbridge won the Southern Section II-A title in 1991 and has won nine league 
titles in the past 11 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the game--Woodbridge has a quicker backcourt, a deeper bench and has 
played better competition. Warrior guards Jamie Oenning and Erin Stovall are 
athletic and skilled shooters. If they can spark the transition game with 
steals, Woodbridge should be in a good position. Alemany center Carly Funicello 
and forward Samantha Rigley must control the game under the basket or the 
Indians will struggle. This game should provide more of a challenge than either 
team has faced in the regular season or playoffs, but Woodbridge has the edge.

to Crenshaw, 79-45, Tuesday in the first round of the regional. "To beat a team 
like Crenshaw, you have to be patient. You can't play their up-tempo style." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and Mater Dei meet at 7:30 tonight at Anaheim Arena in a rematch of 
last season's Southern California Regional final. Crenshaw beat the Monarchs, 
63-61, that night when Kristaan Johnson made a layup at the buzzer. The 
Cougars, the City Section 4-A Division champions, are 3-0 against Mater Dei in 
regional play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hype is over," Tremaine Fowlkes said. "This is what everyone wanted to 
see. There is nothing else to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have won a record five State championships, including last 
season's Division I title, using a 1-3-1 or 1-2-2 trapping press that makes 
opposing teams rush the ball upcourt and out of their offense. When a team 
breaks the press, they can score easy layups. When they don't, they rush their 
shots or worse make turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what happens, Crenshaw manages to control the game and very few 
teams can maintain the pace for 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Long Beach Poly made 16 turnovers in the first half, including 10 in 
the first quarter. The Cougars beat Poly, 66-59, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the key to the game was the first five minutes," Palmer said. "The 
press bothered us early on. They're so quick. Even their big guys run the floor 
well. We had trouble getting the ball inbounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars also are a high scoring team, averaging 98 points, including two 
games that were stopped after the first half. They have scored 100 or more 
points 13 times this season, and twice scored more than 140 points. They have a 
17-game winning streak with their only two losses coming against Philadelphia 
Simon Gratz and Richland (S.C.) Northeast in the Beach Ball Classic I in Myrtle 
Beach, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars are led by the "Big Three" -- 6-6 1/2 forward Fowlkes, 6-5 forward 
Johnson, and 6-6 shooting guard Reggie McFerren. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowlkes, who signed early with California, leads the team in scoring with an 
average of 25.5 points and 15.8 rebounds. Fowlkes gets most his points off the 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a much bigger and physically stronger team," Fowlkes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the 1993 City Section player of the year, learned his post moves from 
his father -- former UCLA and NBA star Marques Johnson. Johnson (23.3, 9.2) is 
particularly hard to stop when he backs his way toward the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei is a real disciplined team with three or four good players," 
Johnson said. "We're going to try and force a tempo that they're not used to 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' best outside shooter is McFerren (19.3, 6.6), who likes to shoot 
from the top of the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Davis, a 5-8 1/2 transfer from Fremont, played against Mater Dei during 
his sophomore season. Nicknamed Tank, Davis averaged in double figures in 
points and assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Arch, a 6-5 guard is the team's top reserve and second best outside 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arch: "Our team is like a big bus. Mater Dei is a little Datsun B-210. 
We're on a mission to run them over."
