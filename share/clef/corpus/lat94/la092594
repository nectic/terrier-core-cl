 Surely the designers of the fashions depicted in the Aug. 28 Style section 
("Absolutely Fabulous") were joking. Such plug-ugly outfits I've never seen 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubber dresses yet. All that are missing are the fins and face masks. 
</P>
<P>
 The model isn't too swift either. Is that what is meant by the expression 
bee-stung lips ? 
</P>

 Where are you, Coco Chanel, now that we need you?

 Since fashion subscribes to the trickle-down theory, I wonder how these latest 
designer fantasies will manifest themselves in the mainstream, or if they will 
appear there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic, rubber, fishnet and stiletto heels seem better suited to the bedroom 
than the boardroom. Are these designers hinting that that's where women belong?

UGLY.

GRACE UNDER PRESSURE; GRACE, BY ROBERT LACEY (G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $24.95; 463 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gavin Lambert, Gavin Lambert is a novelist, screenplay writer and movie 
historian. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story of her life, as Robert Lacey so convincingly tells it, is of Grace 
under pressure. Pressure that began in childhood and never really let up. Her 
father, Jack Kelly, came from a poor Irish-American family in Philadelphia, but 
by the time Grace was born in 1929 he made his first $1 million in the 
construction business and built a 17-room mansion in the fashionable hillside 
suburb of East Falls. Like Joseph Kennedy, he was a philanderer who preached 
family values and a formidable patriarch who brought up his children to become 
all-American winners. Although he judged Grace the least likely to succeed, she 
turned out to be the only real achiever. The reason, according to her brother, 
was that "she got away from home early." 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems she never really got away. When Jack Kelly reluctantly agreed to 
let Grace enter the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, he was 
openly skeptical of her future as an actress. The pressure was on to prove him 
wrong, which she set out to do with a mixture of ambition and wounded 
self-confidence. It was the first of several tensions in Grace's life that she 
never resolved, for Kelly could never bring himself to admit he'd 
underestimated his daughter. "I'm glad she's making a living," was the nearest 
he came to a public compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 A shy and plump adolescent who spoke with an unattractive nasal twang, Grace 
had lost weight and acquired a striking angelic beauty by the time she arrived 
in New York at the age of 18. At the Academy she also acquired a new voice: 
smooth, sweet and high society. But the innocent-looking blonde from a Catholic 
home, a firm believer after nine years at convent school, was secretly coming 
to terms with a high-powered sexual drive. If confession could ease a guilty 
soul, she still had to keep up a front. Jack Kelly had his affairs on the side 
but Grace was a girl and supposed to be "good." She fabricated a cool, refined 
image so successfully that more than one early lover was astonished at the way 
she dropped all pretense in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 By then Grace was involved in her second intense affair with a married man, 
setting the pattern for most of her later romances. Among the men she fell in 
love with after she became a star were Clark Gable, Ray Milland, William 
Holden, Oleg Cassini, all married or divorced and totally unacceptable to 
Catholic parents. When they found out, as they always did, Kelly hit the roof; 
and as Lacey writes, "when it came to the ultimate loyalties, she was her 
father's daughter." But each time the rebel yielded to the conformist, she 
acknowledged an ongoing conflict within herself. Jack Kelly had taught his 
children that winners must always behave like winners, and this was another 
order Grace obeyed. The loser in many emotional battles always hid her pain and 
kept smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial, apart from the personal cost, was the worst possible training for an 
actress, and Grace's movie career got off to an unpromising start. Although 
white gloves made the right impression on Fred Zinneman when he cast her as 
Gary Cooper's prim Quaker wife in "High Noon," she gave a flat performance in a 
flat role. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Hitchcock viewed an unsuccessful test that Grace had made for 
another movie. Detecting a "snow-covered volcano," his imagination was stirred. 
The perfect lady who in Hitchcock's words could be "quite astonishing when she 
got going," was a recurrent erotic fantasy in his movies. And Hitchcock's 
fantasy, of course, was Grace's reality. The result was a partnership in which 
director and actress pressed each other's private buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible to guess how her career might have developed, for she was 
never as vibrant and original again, and worked only with run-of-the-mill 
directors in the two years that remained of her life as an actress. At the age 
of 26 Grace found her Prince Charming. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems more than coincidence that Prince Rainier of Monaco was the first man 
in Grace's life of whom her father (and equally strict mother) approved. 
Although Jack Kelly had always shrugged off her success as a movie star, he 
gave Grace his full blessing in the role of Her Serene Highness. "This," he 
said, "is going to be a big thing." Lacey believes that the couple fell 
genuinely in love. At least they genuinely believed they did, although Grace 
had no idea what she was getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new life, Grace soon found herself under familiar pressure. On the 
surface, a devoted wife and mother of three children; beneath it, an 
increasingly lonely woman whose marriage had settled into a sometimes rocky 
friendship. Obsessed with developing the real estate possibilities of Monaco, 
Rainier allowed tax exiles and business corporations to turn the place into a 
concrete jungle of hotels and high-rises. Although Grace never betrayed her 
feelings about this, her public activities suggested them. She founded a ballet 
school and garden club, began to give poetry readings at European arts 
festivals. But the conflict between rebel and conformist continued. 
</P>
<P>
 She enjoyed her royal image and at the same time felt trapped by it. 
Motherhood, then eating and drinking a bit too much, made her put on weight. 
She found release in a couple of extramarital affairs with men considerably 
younger than herself, she kept smiling, but her life ended as it began, in a 
home where she never felt completely at home. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a definitive biography with a shrewd final verdict on its subject: "A 
beautiful illusion created for an age that liked to be deceived." Forty years 
later, of course, in an age that likes to be undeceived, the media would have 
so thoroughly exposed Grace's private life as a movie star that Rainier would 
never have married her. And the final irony is that Grace died after an 
accident in which she lost control of her car. This passionately driven woman 
had always been a bad driver.

AMONG THE MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lily Dizon's masterful account of the search for her missing-in-action father 
opened a floodgate of emotions for me ("Searching for Nguyen Tan Hung, Aug. 
28). I left Vietnam in February, 1969, after serving a tour and a half as a 
Marine captain, but only now have I "rescued" my ribbons and medals from their 
dusty repository to encase in glass for selected friends to view. 
</P>
<P>
 The article has also motivated me to search for the wife of my close friend 
and roommate at the Basic School in Quantico, Va. I remember vividly the shock 
of reading in Stars and Stripes, "MIA: Capt. Patrick P. Murray, USMC." Many of 
my friends were KIA, but Pat was the only MIA. 
</P>
<P>
 My heart goes out to Dizon and the thousands of relatives of MIAs, American 
and Vietnamese, who suffer the fate of never really knowing the status of their 
loved ones.

 America is still a rich country, one with rich tastes and the clogged arteries 
to prove it. So thank you, Gratis, for providing healthful cuisine worthy of a 
more favorable review ("Lean and Mean," by S. Irene Virbila, Aug. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 And shame on you, Ms. Virbila for not inviting a more health-conscious friend 
to join you. Had you brought along me (I am a registered dietitian) or one of 
my cardiac rehab participants, you would have learned that many people no 
longer enjoy the rich taste of butter, cream and oil.

 Finally, there's a chef who understands that a vegetarian meal is not simply a 
steamed vegetable platter.

 Thanks for "The Man in the Iron Lung" (by Brenda Bell, July 31), but no thanks 
to letter-writer Leslie Bryant Morton or the other linguistically handicapped 
who want you to stop using good, strong words like crippled . As a physically 
helpless, pain-racked cripple with only her head and one hand still 
functioning, I protest the ministrations of the misguided language police. Fate 
has deprived me of my mobility, my teaching career and my social life, but I'll 
be darned if I'll let self-appointed disability experts deprive me of my grit.

 Whoa, I didn't know that killing a whale ("To Catch a Whale," by John Balzar, 
July 24) was "pagan ritualized murder" (Letters, Aug. 21). And is circumcising 
a baby sanctified torture/mutilation? And eating a hamburger cannibalistic 
bovine genocide? 
</P>
<P>
 I thought we were past the days when we labeled Christianity, Judaism, etc., 
the "true" religions and all other belief systems inferior or pagan. Many 
indigenous people fervently believe that they are participating in, and even 
perpetuating, the cycle of life by sacrificing animals. And they have a 
distinctly better track record of preserving nature than we do.

 One letter writer couldn't understand why Eskimos with TVs and electric 
shavers would want to kill whales. Well, perhaps in the same way the writer's 
life consists of freeway commuting and learning her jargon from the L.A. Speak 
section of Palm Latitudes. Whale hunting, in some small way, defines who these 
people are. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesson in common sense is needed here: The rest of the world doesn't revolve 
around or depend for its survival on the latest news about fashion trends or 
"The Industry." Some people can't accept that and are quick to talk out of 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 If S. Irene Virbila were to sample muktuk and comment approvingly on its 
piquancy, all these conscientious objectors would probably schlep down to some 
trendy Westside eatery to share the experience.

 One can learn some lessons by reading, but smug, self-righteous indignation

 Letter-writer Sarah Goldthwait seems to think that there is something wrong 
with "people who are trying to get in touch with their whaling roots while 
answering cellular phones, watching TV and listening to the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Does she believe that modern gadgets are somehow incompatible with cultural 
roots? In that case, European Americans, whose culture goes back to ancient 
Mesopotamia, Israel, Greece and Rome (none of which had electronic gizmos), 
also should eschew such conveniences.

By David Shambaugh, David Shambaugh is editor of the China Quarterly and 
teaches Chinese politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, 
University of London. His most recent books include Beautiful Imperialist: 
China Perceives America (1992) and American Studies of Contemporary China 
(1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans have long stereotyped China. Traders in the 19th Century brought 
back images of erudite mandarins and laboring coolies along with their silks 
and teas. During the Republican era (1911-1949), U.S. officials and 
missionaries depicted China as racked by conflict and corruption, yet striving 
to emulate American democracy. The American "missionary complex" to rescue and 
remold China in its own image was born. In the midst of the Chinese Civil War 
Mme. Chiang Kai-Shek passionately pleaded to a joint session of Congress for 
millions in aid "to save the children of China," while Missouri Sen. Kenneth 
Wherry exhorted his colleagues to "lift Shanghai up, up, forever up, until it 
is just like Kansas City!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mao's revolution brought a new set of defining images: robotic "blue ants" 
laboring in lock-step; ranting Red Guards denouncing American imperialism and 
attacking "capitalist roaders;" and the rapprochement of the Nixon era. In the 
1980s, Deng Xiaoping -- who emerged on top from the post-Mao power struggle -- 
was described as a "cuddly communist" and twice crowned "Man of the Year" by 
Time magazine for launching his "capitalist" economic reforms. The American 
missionary complex was reawakened and rushed to re-embrace the reformist China. 
</P>
<P>
 This was fueled in 1989 by the sight of millions of students and workers 
challenging the communist state, quoting Paine and Jefferson, and erecting a 
replica of the Statue of Liberty opposite Mao's tomb in Tian An Men Square (the 
hallowed ground of Chinese communism). These inspirational images -- broadcast 
by live satellite television -- were soon replaced by the brutal massacre of 
June 4 and the enduring icon of the lone man facing down three tanks on the 
Avenue of Eternal Peace. These perceptions have endured in the American public 
psyche for the last five years. Annual debates in the Congress over renewal of 
most-favored-nation trading status for China similarly revolved around the 
political repression Chinese and Tibetans have known since Deng Xiaoping's 
hitmen invaded Beijing, guns blazing, on that hot summer night. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication of two new books about China in the 1990s -- by longtime 
China-watcher Orville Schell and former New York Times Beijing correspondents 
Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn -- will do much to define American 
perceptions of China until the next cataclysmic event crosses our television 
screens. Both document in gory detail the repression and intimidation Deng's 
regime has unleashed on post-Tian An Men China but they also portray a diverse 
and complex society blossoming amid the Draconian coercion. The complexity they 
describe -- especially Schell -- will be difficult for Americans accustomed to 
simplistic stereotypes to digest, and will cause cognitive dissonance for many. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutality and abuse of human rights detailed in both books is shocking. 
Schell lays bare the horrors of the Chinese gulag, while Kristof and Wu-Dunn 
offer a chilling account of daily persecution and wrecked lives during 45 years 
under Communist Party rule. Both recount endless examples of individuals 
subjected to interrogation, harassment, ostracism, detention without charges, 
beatings, solitary confinement, forced abortions and sterilizations, hard 
labor, Draconian forms of torture and execution. Kristof and WuDunn recount the 
millions executed during various Maoist "campaigns," and the estimated 30 
million who perished in the largest famine in human history as a result of 
Mao's utopian "Great Leap Forward." One of the more grotesque revelations comes 
in secret Communist Party documents depicting widespread cannibalism during the 
Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Kristof writes that the motivation for the 
cannibalism was not hunger or psychopathic illness, but ideological. Cadavers 
of "counterrevolutionaries" were dissected and eaten at public rallies 
orchestrated by zealous Communist Party officials, "students butchered and 
roasted their teachers and principals," while "cafeterias displayed corpses . . 
. and served human flesh to government employees." These books are not for 
light reading before bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its title, "China Wakes" is a particularly damning indictment of the 
Chinese Communist Party and a nation not fully aroused from its long socialist 
slumber. There is also a personal bitterness that emerges as the Pulitzer Prize 
winning authors recount their five years of harassment while trying to cover 
the China beat. Kristof and WuDunn offer important insights into the trials and 
tribulations of being a foreign correspondent in China. They displayed 
considerable fortitude and ingenuity in the face of constant surveillance by 
State Security goons, regular denunciations by Foreign Ministry monitors and an 
impenetrable bureaucracy. While illuminating of their travails, the 
autobiographical nature of the text and frequent reflections on how they felt 
in given situations adds a personal touch but detracts -- in this reader's 
opinion -- from an otherwise potent text. "China Wakes" also lacks a certain 
coherence. It is written in choppy segments, like a series of news dispatches. 
</P>
<P>
 Orville Schell's "Mandate of Heaven" also strings together multiple vignettes 
of China in the '90s, but his is a more fluidly written volume. A seasoned 
observer of China, Schell has chronicled post-Mao China in several bestsellers: 
"Watch Out for the Foreign Guests!," "To Get Rich Is Glorious!" and "Discos and 
Democracy." Each has offered astute insights and polished narrative; "Mandate 
of Heaven" is no different. Schell has a particularly keen eye and ability to 
render visual and aural observations into expressive prose. A master of 
metaphor and cross-cultural comparisons, Schell brings a levity to "Mandate of 
Heaven" that is missing in the depressing "China Wakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Both books reveal the diverse cast of characters that inhabit China today: 
pimps and prostitutes; triads, hoodlums and gangsters; cellular phone and 
beeper-toting entrepreneurs; newly rich tycoons with Swiss bank accounts; the 
100 million homeless drifters and destitute vagrants (the so-called "floating 
population"); street urchins and beggars; child laborers in sweatshops; 
disgruntled industrial workers; rioting peasants; despotic cadres; corrupt 
officials; paranoid hard-line leaders who lounge in private Jacuzzis; 
swindlers, hustlers and scalpers; bodybuilders and pin-ups; rock musicians; 
transvestites; smugglers and gun runners; democracy activists and political 
outcasts; intimidated intellectuals; underground writers and publishers; 
masochistic prison guards; Han chauvinists and persecuted minorities; eremitic 
monks and Christian clerics; and other subterranean figures. 
</P>
<P>
 China today is the home of talk radio; horse racing and off-track betting; 
Formula One Grand Prix motor racing; karaoke bars and sex clubs; MTV and the 
Hard Rock Cafe. It is also a society were female infanticide is commonplace, 
late-term abortions are coerced and brides are bought and sold ( In Shanghai 
sex change operations can be had for a price; in fact, virtually anything can 
be had for a price in today's China. Schell reports that even prisons charge 
fees for family visits, parole hearings and reductions in sentences, while 
Kristof and WuDunn claim that prisoners have secured release for cash payments 
or gifts. These phenomena are little known in the United States, where the 
Orwellian police state, prison labor exports, democracy activists and human 
rights abuses have received predominant press coverage since 1989. More 
recently, reports of the China's booming economy and investment opportunities 
have hit the front pages (thus resurrecting another longstanding image -- of 
the illusive China Market), but the pluralistic mosaic portrayed in these two 
books has not generally penetrated American perceptions. Will they stick? 
Probably not, given the historical penchant for simple stereotypes and the 
difficulty of reporting on many of these phenomena (especially by television 
correspondents). 
</P>
<P>
 What is one to make of the new Hobbesian China? Kristof and WuDunn wrestle 
with the complexities and implications. Their central thesis -- persuasively 
argued -- is that China today displays all the classic signs of a 
disintegrating dynasty. Ruled by what they describe as "red emperors," who live 
remote and isolated lives behind high walls and are out of touch with their own 
society and the world beyond the Middle Kingdom, the population ignore or feign 
compliance with imperial edicts. The official ideology is a hollow shell to 
which even the supposed Party faithful no longer pay lip service. Corruption 
corrodes the body politic while workers and peasants are on the verge of 
revolt. An apparent illegitimacy pervades a moribund regime that clings to 
power through the only methods it has left -- instruments of coercion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kristof and WuDunn are upbeat about China's future. They do not predict 
the dawning of democracy but believe that "China will flourish and evolve". 
Orville Schell would concur, and his superb "Mandate of Heaven" offers ample 
evidence of the new dynamism in Chinese society. With an economy that has grown 
at 9% per annum over the last decade and was the world's largest recipient of 
foreign investment in 1993, China is slated to overtake the gross national 
product of Japan by 2000 and the United States by 2010. 
</P>

 The rise of China as the superpower of the 21st Century is a distinct 
possibility. Accommodating China as a rising power -- economically, militarily 
and politically -- will be a principal challenge to the international community 
and American foreign policy in the years to come. However, given the myriad 
developments that the market has spawned, as described in these two books, the 
China juggernaut could just as easily come off the rails. It is not 
unfathomable that China could fragment like the former Soviet Union with 
various minority regions seeking their independence, or that China could 
convulse again in civil conflict. What is clear is that the current state of 
affairs is tenuous, and that the rush of foreign investment is pouring into a 
very volatile country. No nation of such size has undergone rapid and wrenching 
change of such magnitude in such a short period as has China over the past 15 
years. Whether China grows strong and powerful or erupts in conflict, it will 
have a destabilizing effect on Asia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction of China's future has always been hazardous, and as Kristof and 
WuDunn remind us "China-watching is an exercise in humiliation," but the 
trajectory of change is clearly and elegantly described in these two compelling 
books.

JUST AN OLD FASHIONED LOVE SONG; HALF ASLEEP IN FROG PAJAMAS, BY TOM ROBBINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was pure coincidence that I read the latest Tom Robbins' (that guru of '60 
wit) novel, "Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas," over the Woodstock '94 weekend: not 
just because of the rain, which permeated the book and drenched the festival, 
but because it evoked memories of midnight discussions I'd had around the years 
of the first Woodstock, which dealt with similar if equally outrageous 
premises. No doubt Robbins' legion of fans will plunge headfirst into his 
latest storm of cosmic revelations without a life raft, but the uninitiated 
should be warned that their guide is a prim Filipina who narrates the book in 
the second person. The book jacket warns that trying to describe a Tom Robbins 
novel by summarizing its plot is like pointing to a snowflake and asking 
someone to grasp the concept of downhill skiing. That was equally true of many 
of those late night discussions, but I'll try anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the plot concerns the Angst Gwendolyn Mati -- an ambitious but 
slightly unethical yuppie stockbroker -- goes through on the Easter weekend 
following the stock market crash. On this clothesline Robbins hangs a number of 
bizarre plots and characters who interweave and overlap like an army of ants 
building a colony out of blotter acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen's best friend and neighbor is Q-Jo Huffington, a 300-pound psychic. Her 
boyfriend, Belford Dunn (think Ralph Bellamy) has a pet ape named Andre, who 
had once been sentenced to death for stealing jewels on the French Riviera, 
that is, until Belford rescued him. All three characters disappear relatively 
early on -- Q-Jo simply vanishes, which given her size is no mean trick (Gwen's 
joke, not mine), Andre runs away and a crestfallen Belford spends the rest of 
the novel in vain pursuit of him. Poor Gwen -- and now we come to the real 
story -- is left alone to deal with Larry Diamond, a "tall, slender man with 
bleached stringy hair hanging halfway down the back of a worn leather jacket" 
who crashes into her life with more force than the dire bulletins from the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 A former legendary broker, who gave it all up in the '80s, Larry has just 
returned from the University of Timbuktu in Mali, where he learned any number 
of things -- including mental telepathy, which he uses on Gwen with disturbing 
accuracy. Overcoming her initial distaste for this "scumbag," Gwen seeks to 
enlist Larry's aid both in her search for Q-Jo and to cover her financial 
indiscretions before the market opens on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry, who suffers from the big C, is more concerned with meeting Dr. 
Yamaguchi who has just arrived from Japan with a cure for cancer, which may or 
may not affect the Nikkei index. While Larry and Gwen chase through the 
rain-drenched streets of Seattle in pursuit of their quarries, Larry delivers a 
never-ending series of lectures on all manner of subjects that range from the 
difference between growing and transforming, the obsolete and retrograde nature 
of salaried employment, "those of us concerned with jobs are reading the global 
disappearance of frogs and the return of our amphibian ancestors from the 
DogStar Sirius, which incidentally is worshiped by an African tribe the Dogon, 
who live in Timbuktu. 
</P>
<P>
 And why is Larry telling Gwen all this? 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, Larry, wouldn't it be a fine thing, a swell thing, a boon 
to the community of man and to all creatures great and small, if this girl's 
soul was as ripe and as stunning as her ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, what's a girl to say? Not much. How can she even compete when Larry 
delivers all these bons mots with a W. C. Fields cadence -- unless he sounds 
like "William S. Burroughs ordering a root beer float." 
</P>
<P>
 As noted previously, the novel is narrated by Gwen in the second person, which 
you either get used to, as I did, or find enormously irritating, which I did 
also. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is indicative of your state of mind that you drive through past the 
Continental Place without bothering to gaze up at the ninth-floor windows of 
the luxury condominium that you have so coveted and for which you must deliver 
a down payment within a week or else lose it and your 'earnest money' to boot. 
You feel as if your brain, which only a few days ago sat like a well-fed hen on 
a nest of warm numbers, hatching schemes and clucking waltz time, has been 
painted with radium and smacked with a fly swatter. It's a wonder you find your 
way home." 
</P>
<P>
 Home? I found it difficult finding my way to the end of some of those 
paragraphs. But once I did, I realized that "Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas" is 
really an old-fashioned romance novel in which a sexually repressed heroine has 
her body and mind blown by a charming outlaw whose mouth is a character all its 
own. Larry's grin "widens like a rip in a wetsuit," but it is also "alarming in 
that it is simultaneously violent and generous, antagonistic and admiring." He 
has a leer which "can fold faster than a lawn sprinkling service in 
Bangladesh," a cackle "like a mechanical magpie laying a barbed-wire egg" and a 
kiss "so like a Mexican wedding dress, with layers of lace and tiers of frills, 
with flounces, embroidery, rows of pearl buttons and loops of bright ribbon, 
that the angry traffic turns into a fiesta and the parking lot attendant waving 
his arms at you becomes a drunken priest bestowing a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Larry, I want some of what Gwen's smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering underneath, overhead and everywhere else is the presence of the 
"visiting faculty" of the University of Timbuktu to whom Robbins dedicates the 
book. If you haven't guessed by now they include such psychedelic shaman as Tim 
Leary and Terence McKenna among others, so it should be no surprise that 
mushrooms, dolphins, frog-licking and other symbols and icons of the new 
consciousness appear in various forms and permutations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the book's characters I found amusing, such as Gwen's bongo-playing 
jive talking father, and when Larry wasn't smiling, grinning or cackling, he 
seemed like a perfect '90s counterculture hero. As always, Robbins gets off 
some snappy lines, "passion is not a walk through the woods, it is the woods," 
and when he contains himself, he evokes some wonderful images, "rain, that thin 
grey sheriff has also served to its coldhearted eviction notices to the crowd 
outside the Sorrento (hotel)." 
</P>
<P>
 But too often the characters' comings and goings are just there to service the 
main plot, and when Robbins gets carried away with his similes, he spends 
paragraph upon paragraph describing Seattle in the rain, you pray for the 
nearest drain to carry away the run-off. In the end I felt the same way I had 
when watching the news flashes about Woodstock '94. For those who weren't born 
when the first one occurred it must have been a wonderfully liberating 
experience, but unless you're a die-hard fan, it all seemed to be trying a bit 
too hard.

RICHARD EDER: WHERE, WHO, WHEN, WHY, WHAT, HOWE; A CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK, BY IRVING 
HOWE . EDITED BY NICHOLAS HOWE (HARCOURT BRACE: $27.95; 384 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a concept, part illusory perhaps, known as the brotherhood of arms. 
It evokes a respect between antagonists as well as comrades; not because they 
renounce their differences but because, in fighting for them, they have 
mutually undergone an ordeal that can uniquely bind. You don't much hear about 
a brotherhood of intellectuals. Like pigeons and unlike wolves, they peck to 
the death, and keep on pecking. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time of battles over multiculturalism, political correctness and 
deconstruction -- each a salvo of tiny mental genocides -- this makes the 
example of Irving Howe particularly precious. He was an intellectual who fought 
with military courtesy. Literature and politics were causes that you shed your 
blood for and, when you rested, you realized that your opponents were bleeding 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, who died this year, was one of our best literary critics, and he was not 
simply a man of letters. You could call him a gentleman of letters if it were 
not for the genteel implication. Earthy and concrete as he was, the likelier 
term ought to be peasant of letters. He had the unsentimental shrewdness, the 
instinct of hospitality and the acquaintance with growing things. Here, in "A 
Critic's Notebook," he reflects on the subject of anecdote in literature: 
</P>
<P>
 He brings up Mark Twain's Mississippi River yarn-spinners and Sholom 
Aleichem's tales of the shtetl . Anecdote, he writes, "holds the possibility 
that human beings may still connect, perhaps only briefly, through memory and 
story." It is characteristic of a pre-urban, pre-novelistic setting where, at 
day's end, people come in from the long defeat of life on the soil or on the 
road for the brief victory of a story. And he adds this lovely sentence: "Time 
isn't a problem, there's no place to hurry off to, another story is always 
welcome, things repeat themselves anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again in these posthumously collected pieces we experience criticism 
as the odor of life. Howe uses books and ideas as a baker uses flour and an 
oven; what he turns out can seem more like loaves than pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Edited by Howe's son Nicholas, who also wrote an introduction, the collection 
ranges from brief thoughts to fully developed pieces. There are jottings for an 
essay on style in the novel. There are reflections on some particular aspect of 
a writer's work: why Anna Karenina had to die, or why Sir Walter Scott, whom 
any 19th-Century canon would have entrenched, has quite fallen out of our own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items are slight. A few pages on the comic academic novel -- 
Kingsley Amis' "Lucky Jim" and Randall Jarrell's "Pictures From an Exhibition" 
for example -- suggest that Howe is reconnoitering and not finding much. More 
frequently his rambles turn into flights, almost in spite of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe has nothing very arresting to say about the difference between farce and 
comedy until suddenly he edges from literature into politics, and arrests us. 
Comedy implies civilization and the possibility of progress, he writes. Farce 
denies both, which is why "revolutionists are cool to farce." Howe continually 
edges into something else, as if literature were indeed part of something else: 
not a single enclosed principality but a river that waters them all. 
</P>
<P>
 He meanders. He is serious but does not take himself seriously. He has a 
grievance against Dostoevsky's "The Possessed" even though he admires it 
enormously. Its treatment of the villainous nihilist Verhovensky seems to him, 
an old-time Socialist, to condemn all revolutionary reform. But he allows that 
he may be wrong and that the scholar Joseph Frank may be right -- I think he is 
-- in interpreting it more traditionally as the portrait of a very specific 
amoral nihilism. 
</P>
<P>
 Meandering, he can speculate that some of the extreme characters in Dickens's 
last novels suggest that had he lived he "might have become Dostoievsky or 
rather, Dostoievsky is a name we give to the glimpsed desire of Dickens." This 
is not quite a finished idea; it is more of a provocation, a self-provocation, 
in fact. What it provokes is the useful thought that a novel may contain 
characters who don't fit it because they belong in some future book, which the 
writer has not yet thought of. 
</P>
<P>
 His seven pages on "Kim" are a contained explosion of pleasure, and powerfully 
contagious. "Kim" has that property: It snared Orwell and it has snared the 
radically opposite Edward Said. For his part, after instantly making us want to 
read or reread it, Howe quite wonderfully bustles us through Kipling's ability 
-- contentious nowadays -- to set an irresistible story amid the vast poverty 
of British India: "It brushes past social misery as more recent novels brush 
past personal happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 He has bustled us, in fact, into present-day literary contentions, and the 
collection's nerviest pieces take place there. "The Common Reader" deals with 
the changed nature of the audience addressed by those who write about 
literature. Samuel Johnson and Virginia Woolf used the term in various ways to 
denote non-specialized readers who read to receive pleasure and knowledge 
rather than, as Woolf put it "to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Up through the 1950s, he writes, the most distinguished literary critics had 
one foot in the university, but their writing, in such magazines as Partisan 
Review, was at least in part tied to a journalism that aimed at a cultivated 
general audience. Nowadays, the university has it all: "The literary theorist, 
rid of the grubby tasks of practical criticism and not obliged to pay very much 
attention to literature itself, can find satisfactory expression by remaining 
within the academy speaking to fellow theorists and not having to worry about 
that nuisance, real or imagined, known as the common reader." 
</P>
<P>
 He elaborates on the neglect of such readers -- "the kind of obsolete person 
who still enjoys stories as stories and still supposes that characters bear 
some resemblance to human beings" -- by the current critical fashions. In 
"Characters: Are They Like People?" he engages with the deconstructionist 
argument that the "people" in novels are in fact simply verbal constructs. Why, 
then, he wonders, have novelists struggled to the point of despair and madness 
to achieve the effect of human reality? 
</P>
<P>
 He can be very funny on the subject. When William Gass writes that one of 
Henry James' figures is not a real character but only "a controlling 
conception" and goes on to demand: "Does he even have a nose?" Howe replies: 
"Very likely. If he didn't James would have been the first to notice." 
</P>
<P>
 He quotes a critic on the heroine of Jane Austen's "Emma": "Emma Woodhouse is 
not a woman and need not be described as if it were." Emphasizing the "it" 
quality of a verbal construct, the formulation is itself pretty funny. Howe 
does not deny wit or, indeed, all manner of good qualities to those whom he 
opposes. He does, however, think they are terribly wrong and that they have 
wittily made a desert between the wellsprings of literature and the thirst of 
those whom literature has always existed to reach and to succor.

MOLECULAR SHARKS; THE DIZZYING MATTER OF WHERE A VIRUS FITS INTO THE GRAND 
SCHEME AND WHERE HUMANS FIT INTO NATURE'S HUMBLING PLAN; THE HOT ZONE, BY 
RICHARD PRESTON (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 352 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Sipchen, Bob Sipchen, a Times Staff Writer and the author of Baby Insane 
and the Buddha (Bantam, 1994), is currently working on a novel about surfing, 
firefighting, conceptual art and mental illness. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Hot Zone" got out of my backpack while I was off fishing. There were 
other choices in our motley array of tents -- Cormac McCarthy novels, Paul 
Bowles stories, "The Magic Mountain" and Ralph Cutter's "Sierra Trout Guide." 
But it was my nondescript advance proof of "The Hot Zone" that inflamed Jim's 
interest, and for the rest of our five-day trip the book and its story spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a full moon, with kids whittling around a comforting fire, Jim recalled 
a scene in which researchers slice through single cells with a diamond blade so 
sharp you would never feel its prick. The book jumped to Paul. Paul read 
feverishly, then described the hideous event known as "bleeding out." "The Hot 
Zone" passed to a Bay Area friend. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't regain possession and start reading until we returned to 
civilization. Only then, after involuntarily blurting "Oh no!" mid-sentence, 
did I fully comprehend the book's infectiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 What we had on that remote lake shore in the Sierra Nevada, I now realize, was 
a "microbreak." The story had erupted and, for the moment, been geographically 
contained. Trust me on this, though -- "The Hot Zone" is going to sweep the 
population like fresh gossip in an office with E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 And the whole story is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage that caused my uncharacteristic outburst comes a few chapters into 
Richard Preston's tour de force. Major Nancy Jaax, a veterinarian in the U.S. 
Army's little-known Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, has just 
taped herself into a sealed Chemturion biological "space suit" and stepped 
through an airlock into a dangerous and obsessively controlled Level 4 
biocontainment area known as "the hot zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Jaax is ripping apart a diseased monkey's skull. Wrist-deep in blood and 
tissue, she thinks: "No blood. I don't like blood. Every time I see a drop of 
blood, I see a billion viruses." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaax, is investigating a "filovirus" called Ebola, a "Level 4 hot agent" 
which, by definition, is lethal and contagious, and has no vaccine or cure. It 
is, we are told, "a perfect parasite because it transforms virtually every part 
of the body into a digested slime of virus particles." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, a filovirus traveled to Germany in the blood of an African Green 
monkey. There it "jumped species" to a man who handled research primates, and 
started spreading so quickly, Preston says, that for a few days "doctors in the 
city thought the world was coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, a hot agent known as Ebola Zaire emerged like a phantom tiger from 
the jungle. It rampaged through 55 villages, slaughtering nine out of ten 
people it infected, before mysteriously petering out. Most such "microbreaks" 
have remained confined to Africa. But there is no doubting the virus' ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 In one scene, Preston describes a virus undergoing "extreme amplification" at 
a Nairobi hospital. As the afflicted patient dies, blood and bile spout from 
every orifice, letting the virus find new "hosts" in doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the passengers of a crowded plane watched the same patient fill his 
airsickness bag to the brim with black vomit, a substance that smells like a 
slaughterhouse and swarms with the wildly contagious disease. In case anyone 
misses the point, Preston reminds us: "A hot virus from the rain forest lives 
within a twenty-four hour plane flight from every city on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that HIV -- a mere Level 2 agent -- has cut its tragic swath, it's hard to 
dismiss such observations as alarmist melodrama. And remember: "Ebola does in 
ten days what it takes AIDS ten years to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Given such startling facts, "Hot Zone" left me craving more biology. But it's 
clear why Preston pruned as he did. He uses the power of simple narrative to 
drive deep this story's urgent truths. Well-placed lyrical asides lodge 
Preston's biological mystery in parts of the mind that straight science often 
leaves untouched: troops of monkeys leap through the crowns of camphor trees at 
night; villagers sob outside huts in which their loved ones writhe and die; 
mummified baby elephants litter a crevasse in a cave where the virus may 
hibernate in insect or mammal hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book's credits, Preston recalls feeding his editor the cliche: "God is 
in the details." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she replied. "God is in the structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Preston, as it happens, is a master of both. In a scene that illuminates Nancy 
Jaax's harried domestic life, the wife and mother slices the palm of her hand 
while hastily opening a can of beans with a butcher knife. Preston reveals this 
detail -- along with the disturbing particulars of Ebola's aggression -- just 
before Jaax performs the monkey autopsy. How could I not blurt "Oh no!" when 
Jaax spotted the hole in her blood-sopped "space suit"? 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the book, horror lurks on the edge of banality. "The Hot Zone's" 
central crisis is a 1989 filovirus outbreak that decimated a population of 
several hundred research monkeys, at a corporate laboratory in suburban 
Virginia. Not knowing whether this strain of virus is deadly to human primates, 
suspecting that it may transmit through the air, Jaax joins a biocontainment 
assault. She enters the disease-ridden building to the squeals of children 
playing at a nearby preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 It is bad form to reveal a book's ending. I can say, though, that if you're 
alive to read this, events did not hand Preston his most dramatic climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be disappointed. Gripping as Preston's real-life plot may be, the 
questions "The Hot Zone" provokes are even more compelling. For instance: As 
new viral agents emerge, biological emergencies and individual liberties are 
bound to collide. (Remember the furor that has surrounded "fascist/lunatic" 
suggestions to isolate people with AIDS? How about murder charges against 
knowingly HIV-infected who have unprotected sex?) Where will the lines be drawn 
and by whom? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hot Zone" also inspires navel-gazing of a more fundamental sort. In his 
acclaimed book, "First Light," Preston put his talents to the study of the 
stars. "The Hot Zone" is strewn with astronomic metaphors. They're not 
gratuitous: microscopes as well as telescopes probe the cosmos. As Preston says 
in describing a hot zone researcher's scrutiny of a magnified cell: 
</P>
<P>
 "What loomed before his eyes was a huge, complicated vista, crowded with more 
detail than the mind could absorb. He might have been a navigator of a starship 
making a low-orbit pass over a huge, unexplored planet. . . . The cell was a 
world down there, and somewhere in that jungle hid a virus." 
</P>
<P>
 Viruses, Preston says, are "molecular sharks, a motive without a mind. . . . 
They exist in the borderlands between life and nonlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is barely possible to consider these things without discussing their 
"strategy" for attaining their apparent raison d'etre -- which is to spread 
like an imperialist army. "The more one contemplates the hot viruses," Preston 
says, "the less they look like parasites, and the more they begin to look like 
predators." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Johnson, the "discoverer" of the Ebola virus, remains in abject fear of 
the potential devastation it or some other hot agent could inflict on our 
species. Yet, Johnson tells the author, "I'm so glad nature is not benign. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you find the virus beautiful?" the author asks, as Johnson casts an 
imitation fly on the trout-rich waters of Montana's Bighorn river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah," Johnson says softly, one predator in awe of another. 
</P>
<P>
 The dizzying matter of just where a virus fits into God's grand scheme, or 
where we humans fit into nature's more humbling plan, runs through the "The Hot 
Zone" like the echo of a Zen koan. So it is really annoying when, in the book's 
final section, Preston steps out of his poet-journalist role and leaps with 
preacherly zeal onto a stump. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth, he declares, is "beginning to react to the human parasite, the 
flooding infection of people, the dead spots of concrete all over the planet, 
the cancerous rot outs in Europe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That we humans have been slothful environmental stewards seems beyond debate. 
Perhaps, as the Gaia theorists would have it, the earth is a throbbing organism 
that's not gonna take our guff anymore. On the other hand, it's equally 
plausible that our species has burgeoned exactly in order to survive the 
predations of AIDS, Ebola et. al. -- Hey! All the other parasites do it! 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, such trite speculation is only a momentary distraction from the 
subtler ruminations Preston's fine story-telling stirs.

 The lure of a full-season commitment, interesting characters and exotic 
locales are just some of the reasons such network stars as Lee Horsley 
("Paradise," "Matt Houston"), Lynda Carter ("Wonder Woman") and Rick 
Springfield ("General Hospital") decided to jump on the first-run syndication 
bandwagon this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Lee Horsley is excited about his new series "Hawkeye," the actor 
acknowledges that he probably would have turned down a syndicated show a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still fairly new and not as successful as it is now," Horsley says. 
"Now they seem to be doing very well. You get to do 22 episodes on the air, and 
you make a product to the best of your ability. It affords you the ability to 
build characters, which is so important to every show on television. You got a 
guaranteed amount of time to get it off the ground and that's the attraction to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Horsley was attracted to playing the rugged frontiersman, the same one Daniel 
Day-Lewis embodied in "The Last of the Mohicans," because he's "getting paid to 
participate in all of my hobbies. I build black-powder muskets. I had my finger 
on the pulse of the time period, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawkeye" is being produced in a remote forest in Vancouver. "We actually 
built a fort in a forest where there is no power. Everything that we have to do 
has to be my generator. I've done so many shows where I was a cop and worked 
nights in some alley in downtown Los Angeles. You feel blessed every morning 
that you go out and see real eagles flying around." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawkeye" also stars Lynda Carter as Elizabeth, a proper married woman who 
enlists Hawkeye's help to find her husband who has been kidnaped by the 
Iroquis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know nothing about syndication," she says. "I love the show. I did it 
because I love the character." And she loves the relationship between Elizabeth 
and Hawkeye. "She is married to an older man, and the truth is there is 
probably not much passion in her marriage. I think she's totally in love with 
Hawkeye -- the quality of the human being as well as the fact that he's a 
handsome guy, very heroic in his attitude and the way he thinks about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Horsley and Carter, Rick Springfield has had a ball working on his new 
show, "High Tide." Springfield spent 10 months filming the series in New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the 24-episode commitment," says Springfield, whose last network 
series, ABC's "The Human Target," was a major disappointment. "I was on hold 
for a year-and-a-half with that thing. When I finally did the series, they did 
eight episodes and they dumped it. It was like, 'What was that all about?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer Scott Bairstow, who plays Newt Call on "Lonesome Dove: The Series," 
also seems to be having the time of his life on location in Calgary, Alberta. 
And he isn't fretting over the fact that the Western series, which is based on 
Larry McMurtry's book and two popular CBS miniseries, is resting on his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I can't handle," he says. "I don't like it when people go, 
'Do you know how expensive this show is and how big it is?' I'm like, 'Dude, 
I'm an actor. I'm going to do the best I can, no matter if it's a low-budget 
independent film or it's the biggest thing to ever hit the world.' Art is art. 
If you don't put your heart into it, it doesn't mean a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And the 24-year-old actor has had no problem transforming himself into a 
Western hero. "I get into my cowboy duds and I walk into town and walk onto the 
boardwalk and say, 'Howdy' to people. It's like I'm living it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne-Joi Johnson, though, has mixed feelings about syndication. Johnson 
stars as a Pittsburgh policewoman in the action-drama "Sirens," which had a 
13-episode run on ABC in 1993; Johnson's one of three original cast members who 
joined the syndicated version. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, there are a lot of changes, good and bad (from the network and 
syndicated version)," says Johnson. "There's a lot more action. That's one of 
the positive changes that whet my appetite to come back to the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The series is a lot sexier. 'They're putting more attention on relationships. 
Our clothes are different." Like Horsley and Springfield, Johnson was tempted 
with the prospect of being employed for 10 months. "It was kind of hard to turn 
down, plus I'm getting to do everything. I'm getting to do the sex, love 
scenes, action, the emotional dramatic stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are problems. "There are hardly any women, if any, involved in the 
production. To write a show about three women with no women involved in the 
production end, you can imagine what we are going through. I don't know how 
hard they are working on it, but I have asked them to work on it and work on it 
fast." SUSAN KING

Sydow and newcomer Pelle Hvenegaard. 
</P>
<P>
 Babette's Feast (KCET Saturday at 11:30 p.m.) is an exquisite, subtle Isak 
Dinesen fable. Stephane Audran stars in the role of her career.

ON THE TOWN LOGO: THROWN FOR A LOOP; AN AUSTRALIAN FILMMAKER DISCOVERS AN 
INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH BOOMERANG

<P>
 Gerri and I gabfest over lunch at a chic pasta hang. A letter from a mutual 
friend worries us. Like Gerri, she's about to "chuck it all" and try her luck 
in the U.S.A. Gerri's afraid she's set a discouraging example. I try to 
dissuade her. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by best wishes from her daughter and friends, Gerri left Sydney, 
Australia, believing the cultural climate at home gave her little choice or 
chance. Like thousands of fortune-seekers before her, she took the heart-worn 
trail to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerri was one of a last wave of filmmakers generated by the Australian film 
industry boom of the '80s. It had taken her one day to raise the money for her 
acclaimed docudrama about Ned Kelly, a Robin Hood-like legend. But before she 
could establish her reputation, her career was stunted when the Australian 
government closed down the system of tax incentives that fueled Australia's 
golden era of cinema. Deductions of 100% of expenses, plus 20% of profits, 
encouraged private corporate investment in film. But this scandal-ridden 
windfall for the rich, for whom quality and profits were optional, ultimately 
hurt small investors. There weren't enough safeguards against rip-offs. When 
government funding ended, new talents like Gerri floundered. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gerri, today's Australian film industry is a closed shop where 
only "the favorites and one or two darlings" make movies. After a frustrating 
two-year money chase, she put everything she couldn't hock in storage and 
jumped from the fire Down Under into the palm-handled frying pan. When I ask 
what advice she'd offer others like our friend, she says: "There's no point 
coming here if you don't have a list of contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 When she talks about her project, a politically incorrect feminist comedy, her 
eyes widen excitedly, hands sweeping close-cropped red-brown hair. The years 
and stress lines vanish. But when I ask what's shakin' on the hustle front, the 
stress lines return. She's been repeatedly told her project reminds "them" of a 
British film that's currently a commercial splash. The strongest vetos come 
from women execs afraid that her project "will turn off the male audience." 
About now, she's jittery with every Northridge quake aftershock and battered by 
months of rebuffs, teetering between Prozac and the next plane home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no logic to these rejections! If my script reminds them of a film 
that made 80 million but had a budget of 10 to 15 million -- well, my film'll 
only cost about three million!" Gerri moans. "Hollywood has no humor. There's 
so much fear and no way to do straight business! 'If we met you socially, then 
we could accept your script for our clients,' " was the verdict from four major 
agencies. Exasperated, Gerri's approached the Canadians and the English. "The 
Brits are a lot cheekier. What's most shocking here (in Hollywood)) is there's 
NO RISK-TAKING ALLOWED! And they're not talking about the script -- but about 
box office . Creativity is not enough. You have to have a hard business edge. 
And how the ef do you live while following your dream ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly, I ask her to believe in magic and make a wish. She closes her eyes 
and claps her hands. "Miramax will say, 'Yes, here's the money! Go make your 
movie.' " Should the impossible come true, Gerri still wants to go home. She 
enjoys the weather and tooling around in her snazzy little convertible, but . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is like Calcutta! The cardboard houses smash you in the face." Gerri's 
haunted by the large numbers of homeless, a problem that is significantly 
smaller Down Under and doesn't cause the "secret guilt" she finds among 
well-heeled Angelenos. Racism is also among Australia's ills, but she's 
staggered by L.A.'s version. "I'm allowed to ask questions because I'm white 
and a foreigner," she says, but she's frequently warned by other whites to 
"avoid 'black areas' and 'greasy Mexicans.' " And she's mystified by the 
"Alice-in-Wonderland stuff" she hears condemning violence while supporting gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A.'s the most intolerant cosmopolitan city I've ever been in . . . . Seems 
something's going to explode any moment," she says, half-awed, half-terrified. 
I remind her that L.A. did explode and still grapples with recovery. Then, as 
an afterthought, I press Gerri to say something different about my hometown. 
She lowers her chin cagily, raises her brows and twinkles her eyes. 
</P>

 "You give good salad."

 The 1991 Dogfight (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.) is about two characters: a U.S. 
Marine (River Phoenix) headed for Vietnam and a dowdy waitress (Lili Taylor). 
Phoenix hopes to win a $50 bet by wooing Taylor in a contest to see who among 
his pals can snare the ugliest woman any of them can find. Phoenix and Taylor 
are extraordinary -- even if the entire film isn't -- in a story that 
eventually transcends appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial Andrew Dice Clay sanitizes his stand-up act for The 
Adventures of Ford Fairlane (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2 a.m.), but 
this 1990 film, in which Clay plays an L.A. private eye specializing in music 
industry cases, is a pointless exercise for the Diceman. 
</P>
<P>
 Total Recall (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a spectacular, ultra-violent 1990 hit, 
asks whether Arnold Schwarzenegger is a malcontent construction worker obsessed 
with dreams of Mars and sleazy brunettes or a turncoat secret agent, his memory 
erased by the all-powerful intergalactic "Agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Schepisi's underestimated 1992 cultural-clash comedy Mr. Baseball (KTTV 
Tuesday at 8 p.m.) racks up a home run for Tom Selleck, who brings an irascible 
Clark Gable-like charm to his tailor-made role as a veteran New York Yankees 
hitter who finds himself traded off to a Japanese team. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking Point (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) is a stylish 1989 TNT cable remake of 
the 1964 "36 Hours." Corbin Bernsen, as an American intelligence officer 
carrying vital knowledge about the Allies' planned invasion of Normandy, is 
captured by the Nazis only to wake up in an American military hospital in 
Germany and be told that the war has been over for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it doesn't add up, the 1992 thriller White Sands (NBC Friday at 9 
p.m.) is enjoyable for its New Mexico scenery and the avid acting of Willem 
Dafoe as a sheriff investigating the death of an Indian found in the middle of 
nowhere with $500,000 in cash -- and his co-stars Mickey Rourke and Mary 
Elizabeth Mastroantonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a fine 1993 
family film, a real improvement over the 1963 original because this time around 
Disney gave voices to the aging golden retriever, frisky bulldog puppy and a 
fastidious Himalayan cat making their way through a forest wilderness in search 
of the family who left them behind with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Polanski's Frantic (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) is an icy, elegant 1988 
thriller about an American (Harrison Ford, near-perfect) chasing his wife's 
kidnapers through the deadlier byways of Paris -- -- but the film doesn't go 
far enough at its end.

SEASON WITHOUT SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the changes for the next television season: How far can this 
corporate paranoia go? Now, besides cutting the time between programs, we must 
do without the often delightful theme songs. Can you imagine such programs as 
"Cheers" or "All in the Family" without them? I can only envision a bleak 
season ahead.

EMMY OR NOT, IT'S 'MURDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Sept. 11 issue of TV Times, an article about Emmy "losers" mentions 
Angela Lansbury and her lack of an Emmy.To us, she should have won every year. 
We've seen every episode (of "Murder, She Wrote) and watch it in reruns on USA. 
But I do believe Ms. Lansbury will not be too upset by being overlooked again. 
"Murder, She Wrote" is still in the Top 10 after 11 years and knocks off every 
feeble attempt at competition.

 NEED: A Novel by Lawrence David (Random House: $21; 363 pp.). "Need" has all 
the hallmarks of pop-trash, quasi-literary fiction -- the monosyllabic title, 
selection by the Literary Guild book club, a blurb from Bret Easton Ellis, an 
author educated at Bennington and appearing completely without affect in his 
jacket-cover photograph.Too bad: "Need" is a much better book than those signs 
indicate, Lawrence David having the good sense to flesh out and dignify a 
high-concept plot instead of merely exploit it. Joan Dwyer has been depressed 
all her life, suicidally so since being left by her husband three years 
earlier, and is being treated three days a week by psychiatrist Pam Thompson; 
Pam, a consummate professional, is devoted to her patients and less so to her 
husband, commercial artist Dennis Perry. When Joan and Dennis exchange phone 
numbers in a local bar within the novel's first 10 pages -- Joan having just 
left therapy, Dennis about to meet Pam for dinner and everyone quite ignorant 
of the triangle -- we know not only that they will soon embark on an affair but 
also that David intends to investigate the cracking open of psychic fault lines 
rather than string the reader along with theatrical plot twists. David, author 
of the earlier novel "Family Values," has constructed "Need" with uncommon 
ingenuity, putting his personal knowledge of depression, therapy and the 
suicidal impulse to good use.

 WHEN A MONKEY SPEAKS and Other Stories from Australia by Damian Sharp 
(HarperCollins West: $15; 213 pp.). Quirkiness is a positive attribute in 
fiction, highlighting the multifarious, idiosyncratic ways in which writers, 
readers and characters view the world.The oddness permeating "When the Monkey 
Speaks" is only intermittently effective, however, for some of the stories 
collected here are too peculiar to make sense, Damian Sharp's evocative writing 
and scene-setting not always enough to overcome sketchy, seemingly pointless 
narrative. Sharp is at his best when writing about physical challenges, perhaps 
because living in the Australian outback, where he spent a lot of time, 
requires such strength. In "Carter's Creek," a man sets out to swim the length 
of the 2,000-mile Murray River; in "The Defeat of Big Flo," a stranger arrives 
in a shanty town and vanquishes a frighteningly powerful aboriginal woman; in 
"Boxing," an angry young man attempts to dissipate his aimless energy by 
volunteering to fight an aborigine at a carnival. Sharp, a native Australian 
now living in the San Francisco area, has certainly captured what he calls at 
one point "that heat-soaked inertia, that state of half-dreaming, that basic 
bedrock Australian indifference to everything," but over the course of 11 
stories this virtual apathy grows tiresome.

 TALKING BACK TO PROZAC: What Doctors Aren't Telling You About Today's Most 
Controversial Drug by Peter R. Breggin M.D. and Ginger Ross Breggin (St. 
Martin's: $19.95; 273 pp.). Prozac, writes Dr. Peter Breggin, "constitutes a 
toxic interference into the brain. If it feels good, it means that the 
individual prefers impaired brain function to normal brain function." Passages 
like that have made Breggin, author of the best-selling "Toxic Psychiatry" and 
other books, unpopular in the pharmaceutical industry, and "Talking Back to 
Prozac" won't make him any new friends in the field . . . though it does 
vindicate many patients who have had unpleasant experiences with psychiatric 
medication. Breggin takes aim at a number of targets in this volume, a major 
mark being the Federal Drug Administration, which he criticizes convincingly 
for over-reliance (during the drug-testing process) on manufacturer-sponsored, 
manufacturer-manipulated studies, and he even catches an FDA division head 
saying that drug labeling shouldn't "cause injury to industry, as much as it 
should not cause injury to patients or physicians." Breggin makes clear that 
Prozac isn't the wonder drug portrayed in books such as Peter Kramer's 
"Listening to Prozac," to which "Talking Back to Prozac" is an obvious reply; 
the drug's side effects range from feelings of anxiety and grandiosity to 
insomnia, psychosis and further depression, and since its introduction in 1988 
has produced 28,000 FDA-filed adverse-reaction reports -- more, apparently, 
than for any other drug tracked by the agency. Breggin's views can be extreme 
-- at one point he calls Prozac not merely "anti-empathic," a pharmacologically 
accurate characterization, but "anti-life" -- yet there's unquestionably a 
great deal of truth in what he writes. Let the pill-swallower beware.

 IN AND OUT OF FASHION by William Klein. (Random House: $65; 256 pp.) American 
expatriate artist William Klein has completed 15 books and portfolios, more 
than 200 commercials and 24 films. Five films have been made about him, yet he 
remains largely unknown in the U.S.; this, his 16th book, offers some 
indication why. Klein is arguably the most radical photographer to have 
infiltrated the pages of Vogue Magazine, whom he worked for from 1954-66. 
Influenced by cinema verite, Pop art and the Bauhaus, Klein pioneered the use 
of open flash, long focus and wide-angle lenses in fashion photography; his 
flair for technical innovation is coupled with a savagely subversive 
sensibility that courses through every picture he takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't intend that my models laugh delightedly because they're wearing 
expensive dresses -- perhaps as class revenge, I like these make-believe ladies 
to have problems," says Klein of his models, whom he photographs so as to 
create a baroque parody of fashion. Born in New York in 1928 and raised during 
the Depression, Klein was keenly aware that it doesn't take much exaggeration 
for the fashion world to read as outlandish, and he took great relish in making 
that apparent in his overtly contrived pictures. He clearly finds the clothing 
business absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 For those unfamiliar with Klein, this book is a great introduction. Drawn from 
four sources, it includes work he did for Vogue in the '50s and '60s, images 
from four of his films, documentary photographs and recent images shot 
backstage at the Paris couture. The book itself is beautifully done as well. 
Large, with minimal text, its images all bleed to the edge of the page, and the 
book seems to pick up speed as you page through it. By the time you reach the 
final page, you feel a little stunned -- there's so much aggression and energy 
in Klein's insolent pictures that they reduce the idea of glamour to a pile of 
rubble. Kristine McKenna

 JENNIE: A Novel by Douglas Preston (St. Martin's Press/Wyatt: $21.95; 336 
pp.). It's a classic theme -- the ambitious, single-minded scientist who 
attempts to control nature and ends up being destroyed by forces far greater 
than himself.Douglas Preston, a science writer based in Santa Fe, may not have 
had that model in mind when he conceived "Jennie," but it's impossible to read 
the novel without thinking that he's written a brilliant, complex variation on 
this time-honored subject. Hugo Archibald, a physical anthropologist at the 
Boston Museum of Natural History, was on a collecting expedition in the 
Cameroons in 1965 when he witnessed a dying chimpanzee, shot for its skull, 
give birth to a daughter. The scientist doesn't admit to feeling guilt at the 
orphaning, but he names the baby "Jennie," brings it home, and changes his 
family's life forever. There are countless nonfiction books recounting animal 
adoptions, and they're usually feel-good accounts with relatively happy 
endings; Preston goes much deeper by teasing out the implications of one such 
tale, showing how a non-human family member can re-constellate lives and 
reshape beliefs . . . not always for the better. Preston tells Jennie's story 
through fictional book excerpts, interviews and telephone conversations, and 
this unconventional approach works perfectly because it lends the novel 
immediacy and emphasizes the manifold reactions Jennie inspired. Jennie the 
character, along with her extended family, are unforgettable creations, and 
"Jennie" the novel a dazzling fiction debut.

 ICED: A Novel by Ray Shell (Random House: $20; 264 pp.). There are many 
arresting passages in Ray Shell's first novel, "Iced," and none more striking 
than the narrator's comment that he has recently "taken it easy, which was hard 
'cause I have money."Cornelius Washington Jr., you see, is a crack-head: money 
always burns a hole in his pocket, represents nothing more than carfare to the 
next brief high, when the crack pipe will likewise burn yet another hole in the 
fabric of Washington's life. "Iced" is his 1991 diary, laced with countless 
nightmares from the past, and Shell -- a Brooklyn-raised actor now working in 
West End musicals in London -- has written it to express the rage and horror he 
felt on encountering, on a return visit to the U.S., some of his boyhood 
friends. "Iced" is a cautionary novel, but far from preachy and not the least 
bit wooden: Shell's writing is frighteningly compelling, especially when it 
comes to drugs and sex, the two obsessions that in Washington's life become 
virtually interchangeable. The most remarkable aspect of Iced, though, is that 
it's not a simple tour de force: Washington's drug-abuse confessions make for 
compulsive reading, but just as good are the descriptions of his early promise 
as a Columbia University scholarship student and successful, if cocaine-fueled, 
career in the music business. Washington is self-deluding, self-excusing, 
paranoid, often offensive and often racist, but at bottom he's a deeply 
sympathetic character, a victim of his own cocksure attitude as much as drugs 
and a callous, prejudiced society. "Iced," what Washington calls his "book of 
crimes," will make you angry and will make you flinch . . . and here that's a 
good thing, a sign that Shell has hit, squarely, a raw nerve.

 LEAD US NOT INTO PENN STATION by Bruce Ducker (Permanent Press: $22; 223 pp.). 
"Life is closer to drying dishes than to books.Characters in novels never have 
as much to decide as he does. One simply blows up the bridge. Or holds on to 
the fish. And Jake Barnes had to figure out where to take Lady Brett for 
brandy. Nothing major." Who'd have thought an attorney could write so 
lyrically, so allusively, so in tune with the quotidian? Bruce Ducker certainly 
can, but then he's at least as much novelist as lawyer: this is his fifth work 
of fiction, and it's a fine piece of work. Set in 1955 and starring high school 
student Danny Meadoff, "Lead Us Not Into Penn Station" is a coming-of-age novel 
written with the insight made possible by experience, and charming largely for 
what Ducker doesn't do; a minimalist in the Hemingway rather than the Carver 
tradition, Ducker skirts around Danny's sexual initiation, only alludes to the 
Dodgers' incipient abandonment of Brooklyn, draws characters mainly through 
elliptical dialogue. Danny has become a Fuller Brush salesman, hoping to 
contribute to his family's shaky finances, but before long his business life 
mirrors that of his father: the pals to whom he's sub-contracted some territory 
have gambled away customers' down payments at the track, leaving Danny, like 
his father, to swing. Ducker provides loving, thoughtful portraits of the 
Meadoff men, who seem easy targets for their exploitative, selfish associates . 
. . until Danny breaks the cycle in the novel's climax, standing up for his 
father in a rage kindled by filial loyalty and a sense of justice. Brooklyn in 
the 1950s is a familiar fictional landscape, but Ducker brings it singularly, 
almost cinematically alive. My capsule review: hated the title, loved the book.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'PALEOWORLD' EXPLORES THE PAST TO 
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT 
</P>

<P>
 What? "Jurassic Park," which roared into theaters with a vengeance last year 
and fanned even more interest in dinosaurs, "ain't the way it really was"? 
</P>
<P>
 So says "Dino" Don Lessem, a dinosaur expert who was a consultant on the 
Steven Spielberg blockbuster and is now working on PaleoWorld, premiering this 
week on The Learning Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Jurrasic Park' was fascinating and terrifying, but the dinosaurs weren't as 
fast as cheetahs, as smart as chimpanzees, and they certainly couldn't open 
doorknobs," Lessum, an animal behavior specialist, points out from his home in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "PaleoWorld" hopes to shed light on the evolution of creatures great and 
small, including humans and dinosaurs. It also tries to solve that age-old 
riddle of why the dinosaurs died off. ("There are multiple causes," Lessum 
explains. "We don't look for any one.") 
</P>
<P>
 "We live so much in the present," says the series' producer, Tom Naughton, 
from his Boston studios. "Life has evolved for hundreds and millions of years. 
How we became inheritors of this planet, how we came to control it, is an 
amazing story. In paleontology and 'PaleoWorld,' we're telling that story a 
little bit each week." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many unanswered questions, Naughton says. "I think we're exploring 
the past to appreciate the present. It gives you a real sense of depth and 
perspective so the general public can get a handle on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessum says each show tells a "scientific detective story, asking a question 
and answering it in a confined space, while illustrating it with the latest 
discoveries in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, T Rex didn't stand tall; he stood horizontally, like a 
teeter-totter, with its head down and tail up. But why is Rex usually shown 
standing up? Lessum explains: "The first scientists who put Rex together 
(skeleton) couldn't figure out a way to prop the animal up for display 
purposes. So they added 12 feet of fake tail and made him stand like a rearing 
horse!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other facts the show reveals: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dinosaurs have been found in 35 of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No one really knows what color dinos were. They could've been brightly 
colored like birds, which some scientists think may have evolved from 
dinsoaurs. Or they may have been drably coated like elephants and other big 
land animals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The T-Rex likely made a noise more like a loud belch than the roar he often 
makes in movies. Evidence? The size of his chest and throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaurs, Lessum believes, are the most successful creatures ever to live on 
Earth, based on the length of time they existed. Humans would have continue 
their species 100 times longer than we already have to equal the length of time 
dinosaurs were on the planet, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessum thinks the series' animation, both computer and drawn, will help kids 
become involved in the show. With the scientists' explanations and family 
discussions, audiences can "get a pretty good idea of the whole shape of life, 
and that's the biggest question to me of all: How we got here." 
</P>
<P>
 "PaleoWorld" premieres Wednesday at 5 p.m. The second episode of the series 
airs Sunday at 6 and 9 p.m. The show airs regularly on Sundays at 6 p.m. and 9 
p.m. and repeats Wednesdays at 5 and 8 p.m. on The Learning Channel. For ages 5 
and up.

COMMENTARY; CONFESSIONS OF A BASEBALL ADDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hello, my name is Susan. And I'm a baseball addict. Even though there's no 
baseball season to speak of anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Burns is my enabler. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew it was happening when I started humming "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" 
one too many times. Lately, the signs of obsession have gotten stronger. 
Whenever I go to a bookstore, I head straight for the sports aisle. When I go 
to the supermarket, I head for the mustard. When mail-order catalogues arrive, 
I quickly turn to the sports section to check the baseball memorabilia for 
sale. I've developed a crush on Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
 And now I've actually gone and purchased baseball "stuff." On a recent trip to 
Target, I bought a book on Joe DiMaggio and another on Jackie Robinson. I spent 
another night watching my newest video, "Ten Great Moments in Yankee History." 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, I've got baseball fever and I've got it bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to blame it mostly on Ken Burns. This summer, his 18 1/2-hour 
"Baseball" series slowly began to take over my life. It happened an "inning" at 
a time, as I watched the epic doumentary (now airing on PBS) unfold for a cover 
story. By the fourth inning, I was irreversibly hooked. When I confessed my 
obsession to Burns, he said with a laugh, "You'll have to go to B.A. -- 
Baseball Anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
 Facts and stats burn into my brain. No one's safe from a pop quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) What happened Sept. 30, 1927?  
</P>
<P>
 (b) When did Roger Maris break his record?  
</P>
<P>
 (c) What happened on July 4, 1939?  
</P>
<P>
 (d) What minor league team did Joe DiMaggio play with before he signed with 
the Yankees?  
</P>
<P>
 All my life, I've been passionate about new interests. Though I loved baseball 
as a little girl, somehow we drifted apart over the years. We did have our 
moments, especially when it came to New York Yankees great Roger Maris. One of 
my most prized possessions is an "official Roger Maris" bat. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was heartbreak too, like the time I begged my parents in 1962 to 
take me to a drive-in to see Maris and Mickey Mantle in the movie "Safe at 
Home." Unfortunately, the night we finally drove over, we struck out. The 
drive-in was closed that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, like many another potential great player, my career fell 
victim to injury. I was always a pretty good little power-hitter. But my 
blossoming career ended in seventh grade when I tried out for the girls' 
softball team. I broke my pinky finger trying to catch a fly ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm ashamed to say I've only seen two professional baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, I saw the Angels lose to the Minnesota Twins. And at Candlestick Park 
in 1974, I witnessed the Dodgers annihilate the Giants. But that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I've lived in Los Angeles for 18 years, the first and only time I've 
been to Dodger Stadium was to see U2. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm revved up and ready to go now -- now that Ken Burns has hooked me. And 
now that the owners and players have locked me and millions of fans out of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 So what to do, what to do, with this magnificent obsession? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's Burns' and Geoffrey C. Ward's companion illustrated history 
"Baseball" and David Halberstam's "October 1964" hot off the press. And 
hundreds of other books. 
</P>
<P>
 But I have a feeling that pretty soon I'll be dusting off my personal copies 
of "The Pride of the Yankees," "Bull Durham," "Rhubarb," "Angels in the 
Outfield" (the original, of course), "Field of Dreams" to feed my need. 
</P>
<P>
 And then it'll be time to replay "Baseball." And wonder about Burns' outtakes: 
Ah, Jackie, Babe, Lou, Ted, Satchel, Christy, Walter, Roger, Mickey, Willie ... 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, my name is Susan and I'm a baseball addict. ANSWERS: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) Babe Ruth hit his 60th homer. 
</P>
<P>
 (b) Oct. 1, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 (c) Lou Gehrig said his tearful goodby in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 (d) The San Francisco Seals.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; SEISMOMETERS OF THE GODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael R. Forrest 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When seismologist Jim Brune sees a big rock perched on a hillside, balanced 
like a beach ball on a seal snout, he doesn't smile and see a potential one-ton 
disaster right out of the Road Runner cartoons. He sees an ancient seismometer 
-- a beautiful instrument crafted by nature -- that is actually a record of 
strong ground motion going back into the wordless, machineless ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Precarious rocks are a direct measure of ground-shaking. I see them as 
low-resolution seismoscopes that have been in operation for thousands of 
years," says Brune. While most earthquake-hazard indicators are based on 
theoretical models, he says these rocks provide empirical evidence that an area 
has been seismologically stable for eons and is likely to stay so, a valuable 
bit of information for anyone looking for a safe place to, say, dump a bunch of 
radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Brune, a seismologist who has been on the California Earthquake Prediction 
Evaluation Council for 20 years, is a professor of geophysics at University of 
Nevada, Reno, and directs the seismological laboratory there. He first realized 
how to use these rocks as earthquake recording devices a few years ago while 
studying the site proposed for America's first permanent high-level nuclear 
waste facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. "I was at a Geological Society of 
America meeting in San Diego, and a geomorphologist was showing pictures of 
Yucca Mountain, and he said, 'See this dark varnish on the rocks along the 
slope of that hill? That shows that they've been sitting there, close to the 
air for about 10,000 to 100,000 years!' I said, 'Wow, there's the time scale!' 
" The varnish meant that Brune could tell with some reliability how long Yucca 
Mountain's precarious rocks had been standind undisturbed by earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area Brune studies is Victorville, where there are loads of precarious 
rocks only about 20 miles from the San Andreas fault. "There've been almost a 
dozen big earthquakes on the fault in the last few thousand years. Each one of 
them could easily have been felt here, no question. Felt strongly. But it 
wouldn't have been enough to knock these rocks down." So, says Brune, residents 
out here don't need to "sweat the effects of the Big One" as much as folks 
closer to the fault. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Yucca Mountain, the final decision on whether to bury 77,000 tons of 
spent nucelar fuel rods there is still several years away. But the mountain's 
rocks, says Brune, "make me feel a whole lot better about the seismic hazard 
there." Michael R. Forrest

 Like every other serous windsurfer in Southern California, Jim Martin used to 
spend a good part of each day calling around to friends and local shops to find 
out where and how hard the wind was blowing. But after months of racking up 
$300 phone bills and still missing those "epic" sessions of 20-knot-plus 
thermals, he figured there had to be a better way. 
</P>
<P>
 There was. These days, the beach calls Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin recently launched Call of the Wind, a network of 12 automated wind 
reporters that monitor conditions from Seal Beach to San Francisco. Subscribers 
select the sites they want to know about and, when the wind meets their specs, 
the system beeps their pagers so they can try to catch the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the low and high wind sped over the last 20 minutes, the average 
speed, the direction it's blowing, and the air temperature," the Ventura-based 
inventor says 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says his own phone bill dropped by $250 in the first month he had the 
system up. Convinced he had a winner, he closed his contracting business a few 
months ago and began to promote his new service. There are now 275 sailors 
paying the $15-a-month fee, and he's signing up three to five new users a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys laughed at first, but after they had it a week or two they were 
hooked for good," he says. "In fact, if their pagers don't ring after a few 
days, I get complaints that the system must be broken. I tell them to relax, 
the wind isn't blowing and they're just going through withdrawal." Tom Byrnes

PALM LATITUDES: SCHOOL DAYS; SELF-FULFILLMENT U. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing you need to know about Everywomen's Village -- an oasis of 
quaint bungalows barely noticeable among the cheap motels that cling to a 
stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard in Van Nuys -- is that, well, it isn't really. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it called Everyone's Village because that's who it's for -- 
everyone," says Anita Matthews, Everywomen's Village curriculum director. In 
the 12 wildly frescoed cottages men and women, young and old, engage in 
competition-free education, pursuing the school's goal of "self-understanding 
and creative expression through the joy of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 The name stems from the fact that 31 years ago two sisters, Lynn Selwin and 
Chris Edwards, and a third woman, Diane Rosner, wanted to help women who wanted 
some kind of learning experience but were intimidated by the idea of returning 
to a university. 
</P>
<P>
 They rented six bungalows and offered a few art, dance and personal 
development courses that were taught without any testing or grading. About a 
thousand people attended the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as many as 7,000 students take classes in computer programming, stone 
carving, Tarot reading, self-defense and more -- all without the slightest 
whiff of competition. Prices vary, depending on the subject and the number of 
classes; the three-session computer program class costs $168, for example, but 
most others are under $50. Over the years, the village has drawn a vibrant and 
diverse group of students, including such celebrity alumni as Barry Bostwick, 
Kristy McNichol and Jayne Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the instructors find the laid-back environment addictive. "I thought it 
would only last a short time," says John Zerby, Everywomen's Village one-man 
dance department, who agreed to teach the first dance classes at the request of 
founders Selwyn and Edwards. Thirty-one years later, he's still teaching -- six 
days a week. "I've had a lot of offers to go other places, but I like it here," 
says the 80-year-old veteran of the Broadway stage and the Folies Bergere, now 
completely at home in this cozy enclave. "It's a pleasant place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy of the school was never vocational," says Matthews, who joined 
the staff four years ago. "The idea was to kind of explore yourself, to look 
into yourself and to be a better person. We don't set any kind of goal other 
than self fulfillment."Mark Ehrman

 WHEN THE CENTURY WAS YOUNG: A Writer's Notebook by Dee Brown (HarperPerennial: 
$12; 223 pp.) . The author of "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" opens his 
autobiography with the declaration, "The early part of this century was the 
golden age of print, and I was born into it. . . . Even to this day the 
electronic devices do not match the authority of print." Brown's love affair 
with words began when he took a job as a printer's assistant. Deadline 
pressures forced the newspaper editor to use him to cover last-minute stories, 
and Brown discovered his vocation. His well-crafted sentences can be savored 
like old brandy.

 THE MIRACULOUS MILK COW by Herman I. Kantor with Eric Larson, illustrated by 
Jan Golden (Fithian Press: $9.95; 190 pp., paperback original). The warm tone 
of folk tales characterizes these fictional accounts of the author's 
great-great-grandfather, a rabbi in Orsha, Belarus. Kantor's tales depict 
day-to-day life in the shtetls of the Russian Pale -- scandals, gossip, marital 
problems, questions of religious observance -- as the people of Orsha enjoy 
life in a country where they are barely tolerated. Parents might want to read 
these stories aloud, although Kantor limits his readership by neglecting to 
translate many of the Yiddish expressions.

 WORLD PRESS PHOTO: 1994 supervising editor Kari Lundelin (Thames & Hudson: 
$19.95; 132 pp., paperback original). The World Press Photo Foundation was 
established in 1955 to provide an international forum for news photographers. 
The winners of their annual contest offer a depressing look at the state of the 
world: violence in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Russia and Afghanistan; 
floods and drug abuse in the United States; children suffering from diseases 
caused by the Chernobyl disaster. These dramatic photographs also prove that 
still images retain a special power that is very different from television news 
videos.

 THE ROAD TO MY FARM by Nora Janssen Seton (Penguin: $10.95; 225 pp.) . After 
studying art history at Harvard, the author shifted to Texas A & M to pursue a 
subject dearer to her heart: agriculture. Once she got past the astonished 
looks of her friends, Seton began to consider what she would want to raise on a 
family farm. Cattle and sheep offer higher profits but need intensive care; 
some plant crops require less work but involve greater risks from the weather, 
insects, etc. Her considerations lead to an informative series of reflections 
on the state of the American farm.

 EDGE WALKING ON THE WESTERN RIM: New Works by 12 Northwest Writers edited by 
Mayumi Tsutakawa, photographs by Bob Peterson (Sasquatch Books: $19.95; 160 
pp., paperback original). As the 20th Century limps to its conclusion, the 
Pacific Northwest has assumed a new importance in American culture.Tsutakawa 
asked 12 writers to explain why they live in the region. Sherman Alexie, Lawson 
Fusao Inada and David James Duncan offer intelligent discussions about their 
relationships with society and nature. But Brenda Peterson's touchy-feely essay 
about baby whales and Sharon Doubiago's artsy posturing contribute little to 
the reader's understanding of the Northwest's special appeal. With typically 
off-the-wall humor, Tom Robbins praises the rainy climate of Washington, 
noting, "I'm also here for the volcanoes and the salmon, and the exciting 
possibility that at any moment the volcanoes could erupt and pre-poach the 
salmon."

 HOAXES AND SCAMS: A Compendium of Deceptions, Ruses and Swindles by Carl 
Sifakis (Facts on File: $19.95; 308 pp., illustrated). Sifakis grafts two books 
together in this entertaining volume, a history of famous scandals and an 
analysis of everyday cons. The explanations of rigged carnival games and 
three-card monte (the game hucksters play on New York street corners) can help 
readers avoid being bilked. Sifakis' tongue-in-cheek accounts of famous frauds 
-- from the Affair of the Queen's Necklace that helped to bring down the 
Ancient Regime to Teapot Dome and the television game show scandal that 
inspired "Quiz Show" -- are even more amusing.

 ROAD SCHOLAR: Coast to Coast Late in the Century by Andrei Codrescu, 
photographs David Graham (Hyperion: $12.95; 194 pp.). In conjunction with a 
documentary film, the Romanian-born National Public Radio commentator roamed 
the U.S. in a '68 Cadillac, hoping "to discover America, which seems to get 
discovered over and over and never definitively."He visited various places, 
looking up old friends and talking to strangers. His sardonic perspective 
reflects the influence of the Eastern European Surrealists and Dadaists, but 
Codrescu is not ashamed to admit that he loves his adopted country, concluding, 
"What keeps us together is precisely the awed awareness of our differences -- 
and the wondrous fact that we can exist in each other's company and even -- 
occasionally, and, alas, too rarely -- love one another."

STYLE; INTERIORS; SETTING THE STAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior design and set design have long drawn from each other -- especially 
in L.A., where real homes often serve as movie and television locations. But 
for sheer theatrical panache, ceramics designer Ian Arthur's house is in a 
class by itself. As a boy in Scotland, Arthur built miniature Victorian stage 
theaters, complete with working lights and curtains. After buying a 1913 
bungalow on the Westside, he decided to pursue his passion on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur and Beverly Hills designer Alanna Ponder began by razing the ramshackle 
bungalow in 1989, then basing the new facade on the original. They finished it 
in 1991 with distressed paint, an antique door and dense vines ("Painters are 
always leaving their cards in my mailbox," Arthur chuckles). The modest 
exterior, like a false front, gives little hint of what lies within: a 
33-foot-high room that looks out onto a pool and garden through a window wall 
framed by a full-scale theater curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the curtain at the historic Los Angeles Theater, which Arthur and 
Ponder discovered on an L.A. Conservancy tour, Arthur's curtain was fabricated 
by a theatrical costumer from 500 yards of burgundy velvet. It is festooned 
with bullion- and crystal-trimmed swags and tassels, mounted on motorized 
commercial hardware and illuminated by 65 floodlights, spotlights and recessed 
floor "footlights." 
</P>
<P>
 The large room contains kitchen, living and dining areas; upstairs, the master 
bedroom and bath occupy a loft modeled on a theater balcony. "We wanted to 
expose all the spaces to the big window, so even the master bath is open to 
it," says Ponder, who designed the richly upholstered living room furniture, 
overscaling it slightly for the dramatic space. The kitchen underscores the 
design's whimsy with jazzy embossed-leather stools, corrugated-wood cabinets 
and terrazzo counters in which colored glass is scattered like confetti. In 
addition to using ceramic sconces from his La Brea Avenue shop, Fabby, Arthur 
created glazed plant pots and pool tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to keep it fun -- the house isn't serious at all," he says. "The 
lush fabrics and colors keep it from seeming cavernous and unfriendly." Noting 
the polished-concrete floor, Ponder adds: "It's also functional and 
low-maintenance." During pool parties, the glass doors swing open and indoors 
and outdoors blend seamlessly. At such times, guests are tempted to agree with 
Shakespeare that "all the world's a stage."JEFF BOOK

 To the average gardener, the idea that fairies have invaded the back yard and 
are camped out in the coral bells might seem preposterous. If the Wee Ones are 
really there, why don't they weed the tomatoes or squash some aphids to 
convince all of us doubting Thomases? 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, says landscape designer Ivy Reid, is simple: "They're shy." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid, who lives in Pacific Palisades and has a number of ersatz fairies in her 
garden, speaks of a time when human beings were more in sync with nature and 
often saw the little folk. "As we started disturbing nature and insulting 
fairies, they disappeared. They won't come out unless they know they're safe." 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage them in her own flower beds, Reid supplies bell-like blooms, such 
as foxglove and datura, which they reportedly like to creep inside. She offers 
thimbles of brandy -- another fairy favorite -- and a full complement of their 
beloved lavenders. As a further lure, she sets up scenes of 
twig-and-dried-flower fairies -- handmade by Debbie and Mike Schramer of 
Tacoma, Wash., and available at the Enchanted Cottage in Pacific Palisades -- 
lounging on petals and swinging from vines. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reid's awareness of the enchanted world began during childhood, it 
wasn't until a year ago, when she began to paint in her garden, that she 
actually felt the fairies' presence. "You have to be very still," she explains, 
"very open and receptive." 
</P>
<P>
 She admits that, for some people, the very thought is out of the question. But 
increasingly, she sees special fairy plots taking shape in friends' gardens and 
reports that her own clients have been asking for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For such fairy-watchers, the best times to spot the little guys are apparently 
moonlit nights or early mornings, when their help is needed to feed plants, 
color flowers and generally boost nature's bounty. Says Reid: "We may not know 
it, but we couldn't garden without them."SUSAN HEEGER

RESTAURANTS; MIXXED REVIEWS; AT CRITIXX IN PASADENA, THE TAPAS RUN THE GAMUT 
FROM 'APPLAUSE' TO 'LES MISERABLES' 
</P>

<P>
 For a brief moment in the '80s, Spanish tapas seemed poised for a major 
entrance onto the scene. But the idea of spending an evening, an often 
expensive evening, sampling an array of small bites quickly lost its appeal. 
Another food fad with a brief shelf life. For Americans, it was back to 
meatloaf and mashed potatoes and big plates of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few years, though, someone attempts to revive the concept of tapas. And 
in the past few months, the "little dishes" of Spain are making a small 
comeback with Cava in West Hollywood and with the opening of Alegria in Long 
Beach and now Critixx in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaded by a gnarled olive tree, North Hall, where Critixx is located, and the 
adjoining Pasadena Playhouse open onto a graceful courtyard where theatergoers 
gather during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest project from Sharon and Patrick Westmoreland, who also own the 
Pasadena restaurant Roxxi, Critixx has the advantage of a built-in clientele 
for pre- and post-theater noshing. The menu of "international" tapas can 
accommodate everyone from the playgoer who wants to dissect the production over 
a glass of sherry and a bowl of roasted almonds to a group out for wine and 
food sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first visit, I happened to order almost all of the best dishes. The 
roasted almonds were so fresh and crisp, I didn't mind paying $3.75 for olives, 
a tiny bowl of nuts and a couple of terrific, skinny hand-rolled bread sticks. 
Critixx bakes all of its own breads, including thin sheets of lahvosh , the 
Armenian cracker bread, and a spongy focaccia stained red with that California 
cliche, sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 A thick wedge of Spanish potato-and-egg tortilla, cousin to the Italian 
frittata , was earthy and good. Three seared, beautifully cooked scallops came 
with a delicious, rough-textured hazelnut romesco, a Catalan sauce of tomatoes, 
sweet peppers, chiles and pounded nuts. Mussels steamed in white wine and 
garlic were tender and delicious. A trio of small empanadas had a rich short 
crust, but the cumin-spiked ropa vieja filling could hardly be called spicy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinated quail was nicely charred, accompanied by creamed corn in Jack 
Daniels "red eye" gravy for a bit of Americana. Jamaican jerk chicken was a bit 
dry. "Musician's tart" is a lovely version of the Catalan classic, a mixture of 
dried fruits and nuts in a flaky tart shell. 
</P>
<P>
 The long, narrow room, with umber stucco walls and arched windows, is 
bracketed by the bar at one end and the open kitchen at the other. Neat rows of 
tables and black-and-cream leather bistro chairs are arranged in the middle. 
One busy weekend night, it's hard to hear above the din as a musician plays "La 
Vie en Rose" on an electrified violin. "Have you been here before?" shrieks our 
waiter. "The menu is tapas. See, there's cold tapas and hot tapas ," she says, 
pointing. "Any specials tonight?" we ask. "No, but I'm special . . . and I'm 
sure you are, too," she finishes in a rush. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, we don't choose nearly so well. Mini (more like micro) Spanish 
sausage skewers are set atop a huge mound of good, garlicky mashed potatoes, 
but $4.95 seems like a lot for those few bites of sausage. Soggy grilled 
zucchini rolls filled with herbed goat cheese gum up in the mouth, a candidate 
for the short list of the year's worst dishes. Fried calamari comes out 
strangely pale, chewy as rawhide. The delicate ahi tuna is obliterated by sweet 
ponzu sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen seems to be fixated on mayonnaise and sweet sauces. Along with the 
breads, the waiter sets down a small crock of aioli. The Spanish tortilla is 
dribbled with the same thin garlic mayonnaise. Shrimp wrapped in shredded yuca 
, a starchy tuber, come with a bland passion fruit mayonnaise-and-yogurt 
dipping sauce; empanadas sit in sweet garlic cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Jim Harringer has expanded the idea of Spanish tapas to world bites, but 
these dishes give only a slight nod to the culinary tradition of Japan, say, or 
China. The flavors aren't gutsy enough to hold much interest. To further 
confuse the tapas issue, Critixx's menu also includes a few main courses. 
Roasted baby chicken sprinkled with herbs comes out sadly overcooked; sliced 
grilled lamb loin sits on soggy spinach in a thin, sweetish sauce. Even that 
Spanish stalwart paella makes a pallid entrance: flavorful but pale rice, minus 
peas or greenery, just a few shellfish and shreds of chicken and Spanish 
sausage. The pile of rubbery calamari on top seems like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 The house sangria is agreeable, nicely chilled and not at all sweet, but it 
doesn't go particularly well with the food. A better choice might be the '92 
Alois Lageder Pinot Grigio from the Alto Adige region of Italy ($19.95). Or the 
first-rate '91 Tinto Pesquera (Bodegas A. Fernandez), a full-bodied Spanish red 
wine ($26.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The wine list offers a number of wonderful finds at $25 or under, including 
Antinori's '90 Chianti "Peppoli" ($24.95) and Capezzana's '92 "Barco Reale" at 
$18.95. Critixx also serves sherries by the glass, all from the distinguished 
Jerez house of Emilio Lustau. 
</P>
<P>
 Critixx may have the adavantage of a somehwat captive audience, but if it is 
going to make the Spanish tradition of tapas more than just a novelty, the 
kitchen has to loosen up and introduce more enticing, vivid flavors to its 
mostly monochromatic palette. Also, tapas may not translate well to a sit-down 
restaurant. In Spain, it is much more of a messily exuberant affair, with 
people crammed five or six deep at the bar, shouting out orders for sizzling 
garlic shrimp or grilled mushrooms, clamoring for wedges of potato or codfish 
tortilla or pimiento-stained octopus skewered on toothpicks. At Critixx, tapas 
have rarely been this sedate.

'GENERAL HOSPITAL' UPDATE: LILA'S BACK TO HER FORMER SELF

 We are happy to report that Anna Lee, 82, who plays Lila on "General Hospital" 
is back to work on the show and received a big welcome. Her first show was set 
to air Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 During Lee's absence, in which she was recovering from an infection after 
surgery last spring, veteran actress Meg Wyllie played her part. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's "General Hospital" co-star, Sharon Wyatt, who plays Tiffany Donely, 
recently played hostess to a group of Tennessee pals who attended the UCLA vs. 
Tennessee football game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ordered 75 tickets and could have used more," says Wyatt, noting that the 
entire group was "rooting for Tennessee. I've been a fan since I was a kid. I 
went to the University of Tennessee and played in the band. I played alto 
saxophone, which I started playing when I was in the fifth grade. At one time, 
I actually wanted to be a musical director." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Wyatt ever tinker with her sax these days? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have it any more," she says. "I let someone borrow it years ago, and 
they lost it. I haven't played since." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just call George Hamilton and Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza "The Bold and the 
Beautiful." The two were special guests invited to a big fashion show on the 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Spectra (played by Darlene Conley) presented The Grand Diva Collection 
-- a Spectra Plus-Size Fashion Show -- with designs by Anthony Armando (played 
by Michael Sabatino) on Sept. 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 In the story line, Hamilton played Sunny Stone, a department store buyer and 
long-time friend of Sally's. Piazza, last year's Rookie of the Year, appeared 
as himself to escort Sally down the runway after the fashion show. Also 
guesting was Linda Arroz, editor-in-chief of BBW (Big Beautiful Women) 
Magazine, who appeared as herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The fictional fashion show featured haute couture and ready-to-wear fashions 
and conservative business attire designed by Los Angeles designer Daphne 
Jogopulos. Jogopulos recently won the "Best New Designer" award from BBW 
Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 BBW Magazine provided technical assistance in the production of the "B&B" 
fashion show. The models used actually are from Specialty Models of Los 
Angeles.

THE CHARTS: BAKER'S COOKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita Baker was somewhat concerned that some fans might forget her after her 
four-year break from recording. But that core audience must still be there. Her 
"Rhythm of Love" opened strong--at No. 2 on the Times' Southern California pop 
album chart--and No. 3 nationally. Does the album have enough pop appeal for a 
long stay in the Top 10? Early indications are that it does. Singer-guitarist 
Eric Clapton struck another blow for classic rock with his new album, "From the 
Cradle," debuting at No. 1 on the pop chart. Don't be surprised if he's still 
cranking out hits in his 60s. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,36,11 Title, Artist (Nat'l

GREAT VOICE, GREAT GAMBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *** 1/2; BARBRA STREISAND, "The Concert" ( Columbia ) 
</P>
<P>
 This was the year's real "hell freezes over" tour. No longer so eager to 
abandon her most natural conquest, Streisand used her first tour in a 
quarter-century to triumphantly reconnect with the Show Tune, her set list of 
dozens of songs drawing mostly from the musical theater but now centered around 
a new "book" -- Barbra. 
</P>
<P>
 The autobiographical structure can be creaky in this two-CD set, recorded 
chiefly in New York (there's also an HBO-based home video of her Anaheim 
stint). Spoken segments with the diva recounting her history to imaginary 
therapists are very much on the shticky side. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to argue with the reminiscing gambit when it allows her a hook 
to include great songs of an old vintage and youthful tone she might not 
otherwise consider relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The set choices remain thoroughly smart, with the few pop singles mixed among 
the stage tunes strong enough to pass as showstoppers, and more obscure numbers 
(like the exquisite "Lazy Afternoon") picked over signature songs for some 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
 If finally all the scripted personal asides seem more come-on than true 
self-revelation, then you're left with an unsurpassed voice -- a vulnerability 
inset in its bold endowment -- that says everything it needs to about 
Streisand, and plenty about the way we were in the last gasps of Broadway's 
nationally galvanizing golden hours. That's not like buttah; it's pure gold.

HE MAY LOVE EVERYBODY, BUT LOVABLE LOVETT'S NOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 ** 1/2; LYLE LOVETT, "I Love Everybody" ( Curb/MCA ) 
</P>
<P>
 In the most anticipated album of his career, the Texas troubadour subverts the 
very reason for the anticipation. Sorry, but you won't find any odes to Julia 
or revelations about their relationship.In fact, all of the songs predate the 
big event. Maybe it's his small revenge on those who would put him in the 
fishbowl. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lovett certainly hasn't capitalized on the interest by making an 
accessible album. With the all-acoustic instrumentation and orchestral 
shadings, his mix of folk, rags, blues and shuffles has an antique, sepia-toned 
quality that's warm and classy. But the energy level ranges from moderate to 
low, and the songs present a gallery of creeps, cranks and losers. 
</P>
<P>
 These Newmanesque tales are meant to have the discomfiting twist of good dark 
humor, but too often they come off as familiar Lovett shtick. In contrast, his 
intimate, evocative songs -- notably "I Think You Know What I Mean" and "Just 
the Morning" -- seem like genuine expressions of a troubled soul's fears and 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Lovett, seem is the operative word: When an album has not one but two 
songs about singers who don't mean what they sing, you proceed at your own 
risk. Richard Cromelin

 Megadeth fans sew patches on the backs of their denim jackets; the most 
devoted of Slayer fans tend to do things like carve the band's name into their 
flesh. (One such disfigured arm makes its way into the album artwork here.) 
</P>
<P>
 Slayer -- the father of black metal, the codifier of thrash -- may have been 
outflanked on the left by the ultra-extremity of groups like Obituary and 
Cannibal Corpse, and on the right by the tremendous mainstream success of 
onetime peers Metallica, but the band has no peers at the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Slayer has abandoned the sludgy proto-grunge thing and the 
crossover riff-ditties for a return to its horrorcore roots, with spooky modal 
guitar solos and something of the formal purity of AC/DC. 
</P>
<P>
 The monotone, triple-speed songs of death and mass destruction -- cautionary 
tales drawn with a finer hand than Oliver Stone from the coarser half of mass 
media -- are as tuneless as they are intense, gargled out by singer Tom Araya. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure to draw gasps on both sides of the political aisle: "Divine Intervention" 
. . . a paean to Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 BROOKS & DUNN 
</P>
<P>
 "Waitin' on Sundown" 
</P>
<P>
 Arista  
</P>
<P>
 * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 For any act that's racked up as many hits and awards as this country duo, 
familiarity doesn't breed contempt so often as it breeds even more hits and 
awards. It's a minor miracle, then, that Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn spend so 
much time on their new one consciously avoiding repeating past successes. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean singles-by-the-numbers have disappeared: "Little Miss Honky 
Tonk," "My Kind of Crazy" and "She's the Kind of Trouble" are precisely the 
one-note two-steps their titles suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly half the album's songs dig a little deeper. "If That's the Way You 
Want It" compares favorably to one of those disarmingly earnest pledges of love 
from the Merle Haggard songbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The best writing is in Brooks' and Chick Rains' "A Few Good Rides Away." It 
opens like a predictable lookin'-for-love-in-a-truck-stop tale but develops 
before you know it into a genuinely touching mini-drama about a faithful 
waitress and her cowboy who refuse to let the daily grind make them abandon 
their quest for a better life. Such bright spots make this an admirable 
boot-scoot forward.

 JADE 
</P>
<P>
 "Mind, Body and Song" 
</P>
<P>
 Giant  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 While girl groups were all the rage back in the '60s, contemporary units such 
as En Vogue, SWV and Jade give a welcome jolt of life to that time-honored 
genre. At its best, Jade boasts an easy sensuality and street-informed 
sassiness that such Motown icons as the Supremes had to subdue for the sake of 
crossover acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, this is a superior, more mature album than "Jade to the Max," 
the trio's 1992 debut effort, which included hits such as the hip-hop-infused 
"Don't Walk Away." Though it peters out midway through, there's a definite 
confidence and ambition to the album's initial tracks -- in particular 
"Bedroom," which seems like just another boudoir-oriented throwaway, then 
quickly escalates into a vocal tour de force that few '60s Motown ballads can 
surpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Jade's Tonya Kelly, Joi Marshall and Di Reed co-wrote several tracks here. 
While all their moves aren't on target (a self-produced "When Will I See You 
Again" is shamelessly oversung), give Jade credit for exhibiting a creative 
independence and strength. Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to 
four stars (excellent).

 * * * Gerald Levert, "Groove On," EastWest. While some of these grunting, 
groaning tracks are standard R&B, Levert throws a few curveballs.There's a 
surprisingly tender, David Foster-produced track, "I'd Give Anything," along 
with "How Many Times," a caressing plea to a potential lover stuck in an 
abusive relationship. At his best, the singer recalls the Philly-flavored brawn 
of his famous dad, O'Jay Eddie Levert.

a lot of the vibrant spirit he brings to the concert stage.The singer and his 
skilled band energetically stretch the grooves of tunes drawn largely from "US" 
and "So." Not as much fun as being there, but close enough to satisfy.

the impression of this fairly casual-sounding set.If you've been waiting for

exasperating the next, Cale sometimes sounds as if he's just revving the engine 
during a tuneup.His 11th album in 22 years is typically living-room informal 
and intimate, but when he hits a blues-rock groove as deliciously earthy as the 
one in "Brown Dirt," the casual approach pays off. Albums are rated on a scale

 The recent 25th-anniversary revival of Dennis Hopper's '60s landmark film 
reveals that hippie communes may be a thing of the past but the film's portrait 
of a tragically divided America rings so true as to have been prophetic. Hopper 
and Peter Fonda, joined by Jack Nicholson (from left) in his career-making 
boozy but shrewd Southern lawyer, are amiable bikers on a journey to New 
Orleans for Mardi Gras that turns into an odyssey into the dark side of 
America. With Karen Black (Cinemax Thursday at 4 a.m.).

 AND ONE MORE THING: "I'm tired of reading articles about what women in rock 
are wearing and who they're dating," says Carla De Santis, a Bay Area 
musician-journalist who's going to try to do something about it: She's starting 
her own magazine, Rockrgrl, focusing on the less surface-oriented aspects of 
women in music, with hopes for a January debut. 
</P>
<P>
 De Santis, under the code name Rockrgrl, is well-known to America Online 
computer users as an eloquent observer of the alternative-rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In researching her project, De Santis came across some interesting figures 
that underscored what she views as a real void in such coverage. Analyzing the 
major pop music publications, including Rolling Stone, Spin and Option, she 
found that about only 15% of their stories feature women musicians.

 OH NO -- NOT U2!: Is U2 the most politically correct band in the world? Not in 
the minds of French environmentalists, who are slamming group members Bono and 
the Edge for uprooting several centuries-old trees to make way for a road 
leading to a mansion the two co-own near Nice in the south of France.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment, a spokesman for U2 merely acknowledged that the pair has 
some land near Nice. Bono is known to have spent the summer based there with 
his wife, Ali, and their two children, but has recently returned to another 
lavish home in Dublin, where he was also being criticized by the Irish press 
for a display of opulence after reportedly spending nearly $3 million to build 
a swimming pool. Dave Jennings, from London

 LONDON REPORT: The Cure is set to begin work on a new album after concluding a 
bitter legal battle with its former keyboard player and co-founder, Lol 
Tolhurst. Tolhurst sued the band, claiming that he had been pressured to leave 
in 1986 and to agree to a deal giving him only 2% of royalties from Cure 
records.The judge in the case rejected the claim, ruling that Tolhurst "had 
very serious problems with alcohol addiction . . . which were, at the time, 
severely limiting his ability to perform as a musician." 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Cure leader Robert Smith claimed that toward the end of his 
time in the band, Tolhurst had placed colored dots on the keys of his 
instruments to remind him which ones to press. Tolhurst had counter-claimed 
that all the band members had been heavy drinkers and had once run up a bar 
bill of $3,000 during a single trip to Vienna on the Orient Express.

 ELECTRIC ROCK: You've heard people say "don't give up your day job" to 
would-be rock stars, but it's usually directed at those who don't quite have 
the mettle for success, not those with a double-CD that earns a four-star 
review in Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Logan, whose album "Bulk" recently got that rave notice, is sticking with 
his day job nonetheless.In fact, he's having to take a week off from his gig 
building swimming pool pump motors at a small Doraville, Ga., electronics shop 
in order to make his L.A. concert debut on Friday at the Mint. But he has no 
plans to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The head of our label (Medium Cool) has been real good about not putting any 
pressure on us to do anything that would screw up our day jobs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't exactly sound like someone who's reaching for the ol' brass ring. 
But at 35, just having an album out and getting good reviews is more than Logan 
had ever hoped for. He'd been writing and recording on his own since the late 
'70s, in a rough-hewn style at times reminiscent of the Rolling Stones or the 
Replacements, never thinking anyone would be interested in releasing the 
material.  
</P>
<P>
 Logan says having an album out has been a very surreal experience. "It's so 
abstract," he says of the Rolling Stone review. "It's like somebody just pasted 
it in there and sent it to us as a joke. But it's real." STEVE HOCHMAN

 The long-rumored New Edition reunion album is un der way, with Bobby Brown, 
Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant and the Bell Biv DeVoe trio all expected to 
participate. They've done some preliminary recording and are set to go into the 
studio with Gerald Levert producing some of the album. . . . Scratch the 
Whitney Houston greatest-hits album off the Christmas shopping list. With work 
reportedly stalled on the two or three new songs planned to be included, the 
release has been pushed back to after the holiday season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mary J. Blige's first album in two years is coming in early November, with the 
singer having co-written seven of the tracks. . . . Despite concerns that 
Vanessa Williams' long run on Broadway in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" might 
cause her next album to be pushed back, it's set for a Nov. 22 release. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Unplugged" . . . "Unledded" . . . "Un pigged "? The voice of Kermit the Frog 
has been joined by those of Don Henley, Jimmy Buffett, Vince Gill, Linda 
Ronstadt, George Benson and, yes, Ozzy Osbourne for "Kermit Unpigged," an album 
in stores this week. Kermit duets with Henley on "Bein' Green," Ronstadt on 
"All I Have to Do Is Dream," Gill on "Daydream" and with his own Miss Piggy on 
Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives Me Crazy." The real kicker: Osbourne and Miss 
Piggy on "Born to Be Wild." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 David Bowie, although still without a U.S. record deal, is planning a new 
album for next year, with talk about some collaborations with Brian Eno, 
including a CD-ROM project. Bowie has also been pursuing his passion for art, 
interviewing the 86-year-old artist Balthus for the cover story of the current 
issue of the English journal Modern Painter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some would consider a Bee Gees comeback a miracle, so it's appropriate that 
the Brothers Gibb have recorded "Miracles Happen," the lead song for the 
soundtrack of John Hughes' remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." Also doing songs 
for the film are Aretha Franklin, Wynonna Judd and Crash Test Dummies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With the U.N. cultural ban on South Africa lifted after the end of apartheid, 
Hugh Masekela and Ladysmith Black Mambazo will be appearing during the Miss 
World telecast from Sun City on Nov. 19. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A pregnant Charlotte Caffey will sit out the upcoming Go-Go's reunion shows 
(including a possible Wiltern Theatre date in December), with former Bangles 
guitarist Vicki Peterson filling in. Peterson has been commuting between L.A. 
and New Orleans, where she plays with the Continental Drifters, which also 
features L.A. refugees Peter Holsapple, Susan Cowsill (of the Cowsills), Mark 
Walton (ex-Dream Syndicate) and Carlo Nuncio. The band has just released its 
debut album on the small Monkey Hill label. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another former Dream Syndicate figure, Steve Wynn, is working on the second 
album with Gutterball, his collaboration with House of Freaks.*

POP EYE: WHAT, AN ELVIS BIOGRAPHY WITHOUT 'CLAMBAKE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Elvis Presley died in 1977, the King of Rock 'n' Roll has also been the 
King of the Tab loids . . . the subject of spellbinding tales about drug use 
and claims that he's still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 So how can the real story compete with all that sensationalism? 
</P>
<P>
 Even the writer who spent much of the past decade researching and writing that 
story isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may find out (that no one cares)," says Peter Guralnick, whose "Last Train 
to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley," has just arrived in book stores from 
Little, Brown & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers believe that Guralnick may be pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high, even though rock biographies have sold erratically in 
recent years and there are already enough Presley books on the market to fill a 
ballroom at Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to do very well -- it's greatly anticipated," says Donna 
Passannante, spokeswoman for the Barnes & Noble, Bookstar and B. Dalton chains. 
The nearly 500-page volume covers Presley's life through his 1958 Army 
induction. A second volume, tracing the star's reclusive "dark" years in the 
'60s and '70s, is expected in two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's publisher shares the optimism. Initial hardcover press run: an 
impressive 100,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very careful to stay away from the Elvis book syndrome," says Amy 
Rhodes, Little, Brown's director of marketing. "It's really Peter Guralnick 
that we're selling. He has a sound reputation and has never failed to be 
well-reviewed and widely reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
 For his own part, Guralnick -- a preeminent music biographer through such 
acclaimed books as "Sweet Soul Music," "Lost Highway" and "Searching for Robert 
Johnson" -- has done his best to steer clear of all the tabloid hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I paid attention to this sort of thing it would have stopped me from 
writing the book," he says. "The need for Elvis as a continuing commodity is an 
unappetizing spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
 Guralnick says that there are no shocking revelations in his book, no hidden 
secrets, wild speculation or allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to portray the world as Elvis must have seen it, portray the 
characters as they come into the story, rather than as history came to judge 
them." Steve Hochman

Britains, Carroll Coates ("Afterglow" with Gerry Mulligan soloing, and "Love 
Comes and Goes" with George Shearing), plus Duncan Lamont's "Not You Again," 
also with Shearing.Joe Williams' guest shots on two tunes further strengthen 
this mainly low-key set (but it ends boisterously with Bessie Smith's "Soft 
Pedal Blues.") Cleo's sumptuous contralto does a splendid spot of overdubbing 
on the title tune.

 The World Saxophone Quartet finessed the departure of chief composer Julius 
Hemphill by recording with African drummers on its last album four years ago. 
With Eric Person now in the lineup (veteran James Spaulding is featured on two 
tracks here), the group returns with more focus on sonorous ensemble harmonies 
and riff-anchored pieces than fierce collective improvisations or the dense 
harmonic intricacy of Hemphill's works.The net gain in accessibility is 
counterbalanced by a relative lack of challenge -- with nearly two decades 
under its belt, the World Saxophone Quartet may no longer be stretching out 
into new musical frontiers.

 * * James Blood Ulmer, "Blues Preacher," DIW/Sony. This accessible thematic 
blues-rock album throws too much emphasis on Ulmer's vocals and lacks the 
exhilarating epiphanies of which the ever-erratic guitarist is capable.Only a 
three-song sequence started off by an effective slow reworking of his old 
classic blues "Jazz Is the Teacher" and capped by the album's lone foray into 
harmolodic funk, "Nobody but You," really works. Aubrey Dayle's leaden drumming 
strips the music of rhythmic momentum, and Ulmer is neither saying anything new 
nor building on old strengths here.

 What this album lacks in originality, it certainly makes up for in zest, 
enthusiasm and solid arrangements.The Puerto Rican percussionist, considered by 
many the best living conguero, displays his dazzling mastery of Latin 
percussion in this mix of straight-ahead standards and original works by 
pianists Hilton Ruiz and Eric Figueroa, among others. It is in the standards 
that the blend of Latin rhythms and jazz works best, however, notably in Ruiz's 
imaginative arrangements of "It Don't Mean a Thing" and "Seven Steps to Heaven" 
and Figueroa's arrangement of "Summertime."

 This set captures, as well as any recording possibly can, the intensity and 
brio of a heated live session. Recorded at Sweet Basil in Greenwich Village in 
1991, tenor man Grossman, in the midst of a splendid revitalization of his 
career, is backed in a very rare sideman appearance by McCoy Tyner, bassist 
Avery Sharpe and drummer Art Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 These are lengthy -- and, for the most part, broiling -- selections in which 
the musicians stretch out: "Speak Low" and "Impressions" run longer than 10 
minutes each, and the rest, save one, go nine minutes or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing the melodic complexity of Sonny Rollins with the hue and cry of John 
Coltrane, Grossman is generally ablaze -- though he is tender and wooing on the 
two ballads. Mostly, though, he plays gritty, punchy lines that are delivered 
with a tone that is alternately rich and rhapsodic, then spare and straining. 
</P>
<P>
 In his accompaniment, Tyner jabs at him with rocking chords, then stands back 
and "strolls" (or doesn't play), giving the music a great deal of space. In his 
solos, the pianist offers robust statements that threaten to burst at the 
seams. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer exhilarating energy and fire in the post-bop mode, this session is 
hard to top. Zan Stewart

CRITIC'S PICK: 'THE FUGITIVE'

 Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford, pictured) never rests, barely even stops to 
catch his breath. And neither does the film that capitalizes on his 
dilemma.This 1993 blockbuster, based on the '60s TV series, is a 
super-adrenaline stemwinder, a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the 
tension so tight it does everything but squeak. Laced with breakneck chases and 
eye-widening stunts, "The Fugitive" succeeds because of its other qualities: 
intelligence and wit. Director Andrew Davis, working from a sharp script by Jeb 
Stuart and David Twohy, has paid attention to all the film's characters, 
involving us all the more completely in the action. Tommy Lee Jones turns in an 
Oscar-winning performance as a fearsomely implacable and darkly humorous U.S. 
marshal (HBO Saturday at 8:45 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

CRITIC'S PICK: 'LEOLO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing describes "Leolo," nothing does it justice. It's a film you feel more 
than analyze, a movie that offers emotional rather than literal images.And 
though it is as intoxicated with language as it is with images, it comes so 
strongly from memory and the subconscious that it resists tidy summation. 
French-Canadian writer-director Jean-Claude Lauzon has turned his film, about 
the coming of age of an artistic boy in an unforgiving environment, into an 
assault, filling it with pitiless and profane images that can't help but make 
you squirm. The story revolves around 12-year-old Leo Lozeau (Maxime Collin, 
center) growing up in the decay of Montreal's tough Mile End neighborhood. 
(Pictured are Yves Montmarquette, left, as Leolo's brother, and a friend 
throwing Leolo overboard (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

CRITIC'S PICK: 'WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT'

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-energy mix of spectacular music, vigorous acting and cliched 
situations, this 1993 release is a rough-and-rowdy fairy tale with a feminist 
subtext. If that sounds perplexing, it pumps up the volume so much you won't 
have much time to think about it.Although subtitled "The True Life Story of 
Tina Turner," the film has less in common with anyone's reality than with 
generations of glossy show-biz biopics. The biggest assets in the film are the 
exceptional actors who play Tina and Ike. Angela Bassett (pictured) and 
Laurence Fishburne bring to this film the ability to deepen characters in ways 
that are not in the script. Although the picture rightfully belongs to the 
Oscar-nominated Bassett, Fishburne never fails to make Ike remarkably 
compelling, human if not defensible (TMC Tuesday at 11:20 p.m., Showtime Friday 
at 8 p.m.) Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; HARRIET SANSOM HARRIS SAYS 'I DO' TO LIFE AS A MRS. 
BUCHANAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Jeffrey" changed the career of Harriet Sansom Harris, who plays one of "The 
Five Mrs. Buchanans" on CBS' new sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the New York-based theater actress came out to Los Angeles to 
appear in the Westwood Playhouse engagement of 'Jeffrey," Paul Rudnick's 
acclaimed comedy about love in the time of AIDS. Harris, who also was featured 
in the original cast of "Jeffrey" off-Broadway, was the sole female in the 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a great thing for everybody who was involved in it," says 
Harris, who played multiple roles in the play, which is now being made into a 
movie with Sigourney Weaver cast in the part(s) Harris had. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking about herself, Harris says, "I guess if you can do comedy your 
chances of being cast is increased. I think that helped all of us because 
casting agents were looking for people who could be funny. It was much easier 
than coming out to California without a job or in a straight play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey" led to guest shots for Harris on "Frasier," "The George Carlin 
Show," "The X-Files," "Monty" and "Good Advice." And now a juicy starring role 
on "The Five Mrs. Buchanans." 
</P>
<P>
 In the deliciously acerbic sitcom, Harris plays the uptight Vivian Buchanan, 
"the prude from Indiana," who has a less-than-faultless past and twin children 
from hell. She and the three other Mrs. Buchanans -- Judith Ivey, Charlotte 
Ross and Beth Broderick -- have little in common except for fear of their 
insufferable and, some would say, evil mother-in-law, Mother Buchanan (Eileen 
Heckart). 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a wonderful character," Harris says of Vivian. "She is such a snob, 
such a control freak and so judgmental. But she's the most out of control 
person on the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Texas, Harris got involved in acting as a youngster. "I think my 
mother worried I was going to be terribly shy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was a place "to kind of stomp around and shake my fist. You can't do 
that in polite society. I think it really didn't do much for my shyness. I was 
still pretty backward for a very long time, but at least I was just scared of 
individuals. I'm at home in a room of 350." 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, Harris was accepted at New York's famed Juilliard School. "One of my 
godmothers read about Juilliard when she was in the dentist's office," Harris 
says, laughing. "She called my mother and said, 'This may be the place for 
her.' I was lucky enough to get in because I was in a private school at the 
time and the counselor was in despair that he wouldn't be able to recommend me 
to any place because he thought I wouldn't apply myself and that I had better 
get into a theater school because that seemed to be the only thing I was 
interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris blossomed at Juilliard. "It turned out to be great. It was wonderful to 
get to New York at such a young age and meet so many people who wanted to do 
what I wanted to do and didn't look at it as an unrealistic goal. It was also 
great because it meant all of those kids' parents actually thought they would 
become actors, too, or thought they should have a chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation, Harris joined The Acting Company, a repertory group with 
connections to Juilliard. "I stayed there for three years," she says. "We 
toured, like, 40 weeks a year." 
</P>
<P>
 After her stint with the company, Harris worked primarily in regional 
theaters. "I still have a kind of baby-like face," she explains. "It's not 
terribly well-defined. I don't have a great Roman nose. I didn't have an 
ideally pretty ingenue face, either. I was pretty tall and had a low voice. 
Nothing fit. There was no way to have a wonderful career as a 22- or 
23-year-old in New York. I was just a misfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says, "I was able to do a lot of ingenues who killed their mother 
-- that kind of good stuff. About six years ago, I started concentrating on 
staying (in New York) because I got too tired to go out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Mrs. Buchanans" tapes in Los Angeles, Harris still calls New York 
home. But, she acknowledges, she's having a wonderful time in California. "I 
have a lot of friends out here. The weather is great and much more like Texas 
than New York. You can have an outdoor life without being armed. At this point, 
I still need to come back to (New York) on my breaks because this is where I 
have lived for a long time. So this is very much home. But I feel the pull of 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" airs Saturdays at 9 p.m. on CBS.

ON THE SET; UNFRIENDLY PERSUASION; TORI SPELLING AND KELLIE MARTIN TURN THEIR 
SERIES IMAGES AROUND IN NBC FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS RUBIN, Chris Rubin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Socializing between the two female stars of the NBC movie "A Friend to Die 
For" is noticeably nonexistent on this set. 
</P>
<P>
 But no tales of young Hollywood fur flying here. Kellie Martin ("Christy") and 
Tori Spelling ("Beverly Hills, 90210") are just being professional: Martin's 
character, a smart but not very popular high school student, reveres Spelling's 
cheerleader character from afar and approaches her to be her friend. When she's 
rebuffed, she kills her. Plain and not-really-that-simple and, oh yes, based on 
a true story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be too friendly with her," says Martin, who acted with 
Spelling in the 1989 feature flop "Troop Beverly Hills." "My character is very 
in awe of her and then ends up killing her, so when they say, 'Cut,' I'm not 
going to say, 'Hey, Tori!' and have a big conversation with her and end up 
laughing. Because when they say, 'Action,' it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes she finds staying in character a little off-putting to others, 
though. "When I say I'm killing Tori Spelling, people say 'Whoa,' " says 
Martin, who, like Spelling, shot the movie over 18 days while her series was on 
hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Both actresses realize they are going against their "TV type" in the movie; in 
fact, that is one of the main reasons cited by each for accepting their roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling plays a spoiled child -- not an evil character, yet still far from 
her cloyingly sweet Donna on Fox's "90210." Martin, who plays the incredibly 
wholesome and religious title character in CBS' "Christy," portrays a young 
woman who kills in a moment of passion and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good script," says Spelling, "and it got me excited that the 
character was so different from Donna. I think people can't even fathom me 
playing this role. They'll be shocked when they see this, that I could play 
somebody like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the depressing nature of "A Friend," Spelling is definitely enjoying 
the change of pace. "I like having the opportunity to be the bitch," she says, 
sitting patiently for makeup and hair before the day's shooting begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love characters, like Heather Locklear on 'Melrose Place,' that play 
bitches. They always get the great lines. With this role, I get the zinger 
lines and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 She adds sadly: "I can't imagine a 15-year-old killing another 15-year-old. I 
think Kellie has the more difficult role. I can't imagine this happening, but 
it did happen." 
</P>
<P>
 (The names in "A Friend to Die For" have been changed, even the name of the 
town where it all happened.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of this interview the shooting of the funeral scene for Spelling's 
character is taking place. "I got really queasy doing the scene where I died," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 While the filming schedule for the project is short, director William A. 
Graham, a veteran of film and television movies, likes to squeeze in some 
rehearsal time before shooting. "I have a reading where all the actors sit 
around and read the script. I get them up from the table, have them move 
around, simulate the staging. My main purpose is not to solve big problems of 
interpretation, but to break the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham adds, "Tori's playing the bitch here. I tell Tori, 'Show me what makes 
you the most popular girl in the school. I don't want to see the bitchiness, 
just give me flashes of that, where she puts down (Martin)." 
</P>
<P>
 The director is a testament to the non-interaction between Spelling and Martin 
on the set: "The other actresses hang out in Tori's dressing room. Kellie stays 
on her own. I think she wants to stay alienated (from Spelling's character), 
not be too chummy." 
</P>
<P>
 While they're not overly friendly on the set, Martin enjoys working again with 
Spelling and feels compelled to say something about the snide press Spelling 
sometimes get. " '90210' comes with a certain stigma, good or bad. People 
resent a show and the actors when they become so famous so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tori gets a bad rap, like on 'Saturday Night Live' (sketches). It's hard to 
have a famous father or mother. Tori's made her own way. She didn't get this 
job because Aaron Spelling is her father," Martin says. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has anything bad to say about Martin. Graham is unreservedly 
enthusiastic. "She is a virtuoso performer, she does so much homework, she 
knows the script and the part so well, much better than I do." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Friend" offers as much of a stretch for Martin as it does for Spelling. A 
few years back, Martin was a regular on the ABC series "Life Goes On," where 
she played the girlfriend of a teen-age boy (Chad Lowe) with AIDS. Martin says 
of that character, "She had her share of problems, a dark side to her 
personality. She's more similar to Angela (Martin's character in "Friend") than 
Christy is. I want to play a psychotic or a blind girl or die, because they're 
extreme, different, challenging roles. I've reached one of those goals here." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a meaty part, one that I get to sink my teeth into, but it's draining 
and I have to go to places, dig deep, where with Christy I don't have to do 
that," Martin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angela has so may characteristics I don't have or wouldn't want to have. 
She's not that smart. If she was smart, then she would know that she doesn't 
have to be part of the popular crowd to be cool," says Martin, who doesn't run 
with Hollywood's in-crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl upon whom the film is based was paroled last year, and reportedly 
living in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Friend to Die For" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC. "Beverly Hills, 90210" 
airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox. "Christy" is scheduled to return (time to be 
announced) as a midseason replacement on CBS.

PROFILE; A SITCOM'S BEST-KEPT SECRET; WILL SERIES NO. 13 BE LIZ TORRES' LUCKY 
NUMBER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Even Liz Torres, a co-star on "The John Larroquette Show," looks surprised 
when she's reminded that the NBC sitcom is her 13th series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my God," she says laughing. "Has it really been that many ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Torres certainly hopes "The John Larroquette Show" will be a lucky No. 13. She 
bursts into her distinctive, deep, throaty laugh. "Jesus Christ," swears the 
woman who was raised Catholic. "And I'm almost a semi-name! Almost!" 
</P>
<P>
 The actress was nominated for an Emmy this year in the category of best 
suporting actress in a comedy series, but lost to repeat winner Laurie Metcalf 
("Roseanne"). Before the Emmy nod, she was a series regular on "All in The 
Family," "Phyllis," "Mama's Family," "The Famous Teddy Z," "The New Odd Couple" 
and "The Ben Vereen Show." 
</P>
<P>
 On "Larroquette" -- which has another tough slot against ABC's "Grace Under 
Fire" following last year's no-win placement against "Roseanne" -- Torres plays 
the feisty, streetwise, sarcastic Mahalia Sanchez. Mahalia assists 
Larroquette's alcoholic-turned-bus-manager John Hemingway at the Crossroads Bus 
Terminal, an urban stop in St. Louis where most of the regulars are at a 
crossroads in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Torres' resume includes numerous television guest spots, work in 
film, theater and nightclubs as well as a stint as a recording artist, she 
still says, "I never thought I had a career. I think Meryl Streep has a career. 
I have jobs that I am lucky to get." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an impressive bio," she acknowledges. "But it's not money in the bank. 
I've never had a hit record, never been in a film that's been nominated for an 
Oscar, and I've never gotten an Emmy. I've never had financial success. I'm 
just somebody who works." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the good-humored Torres says, with a conspiratorial wink, "I'm like an 
industry secret." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those actresses who never turns down a part, no matter how small," 
she says. "I don't have the luxury of picking and choosing. I take everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who recognize Torres from her roles "as the maid to nearly everyone in 
Hollywood," as she puts it, may be surprised to find that the Latina actress 
doesn't have a trace of an accent. Even more surprising is that the New York 
native says she couldn't really speak English until she was in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone around me spoke Spanish," says Torres, who is half-Puerto Rican and 
a quarter each Moroccan and Venezuelan. "We had a rule in the house -- only 
Spanish." Which is why, she points out, it's strange to play Latina women who 
speak so much -- albeit heavily accented -- English. "There are a lot of things 
they would be saying in Spanish." Even Mahalia would habla mas espanol.  
</P>
<P>
 Torres was certain she wouldn't get the role of Mahalia. "The producers were 
seeing thousands of actors for that part. Every Hispanic actress, it seemed, 
was up for it. They did casting calls in New York, Miami and L.A. They even 
flew someone in from Spain. I didn't think I had a hope in hell. I lusted for 
it in my heart, though." 
</P>
<P>
 When Torres first read the script, she says Mahalia "jumped out of the page at 
me. She's intriguing. I've never played anyone like her before. She stands up 
for herself and no-nonsense. She's really becoming a hero to me in some ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres loves Mahalia and has been pleasantly surprised by the way the 
character handles situations. She cites the show where Mahalia demands a raise 
equivalent to Hemingway's. "It was so unlike me," she says. "Whatever that 
aggressive gene is, I don't have it. I'm kind of floored by her, how certain 
she is." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress draws Mahalia from the many Latina women she encountered growing 
up. "I laugh at myself -- where I find things for Mahalia. Women like Mahalia 
do exist," she points out and adds, laughing, "Yes, there is stereotyping and I 
am she !" 
</P>
<P>
 Switching to a more serious tone, she adds, "There's always that possibility 
of stereotyping. But I'm never afraid of work. I'm only afraid of not working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've grown gracefully into this role," she says of her move from bombshell to 
character actress. "I look at this," she says, pointing at a photo from her 
nightclub days, "and I see Marie Dressler. I don't see myself as pretty or 
sexy. And when people say that about me, it's always so shocking. I'm so much 
happier now." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres believes that Latins are slowly making their mark on television. "I see 
all these Hispanic faces on TV and I remember when I was the only one. That 
makes me feel real hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also got high hopes for "The John Larroquette Show." "The cast's a very 
interesting group of people. I thought that midway, when the honeymoon was 
over, the actors would show their colors. But there aren't any flaws, aren't 
any flies. We have such a ball. I can't believe how I wake up and the first 
thing I do is thank God. I'm not religious, but I thank him anyway for giving 
me a job that I love." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which now precedes the very strong "Frasier," may get an audience 
boost from its impressive four Emmy nominations. Could this 13th series be the 
charm for Torres? She's sure got her fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The John Larroquette Show" airs Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC.

RETRO; DAVY CROCKETT'S NEW FRONTIER; DISNEY'S '50S HERO, PLAYED BY FESS PARKER, 
COMES TO VIDEO WITH THE 'RIVER PIRATES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years after he created the role of Davy Crockett on the ABC series 
"Disneyland," Fess Parker sees "an awful lot" of kids wearing the full Crockett 
regalia, including gun and hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to video, a new generation has embraced the "King of the Wild 
Frontier." The first three original Crockett episodes, which aired on 
"Disneyland" in 1954-55, currently are on Walt Disney Home Video under the 
title "Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier." Two more episodes, which 
aired in 1956, have just been released on Walt Disney Home Video as "Davy 
Crockett and the River Pirates" ($20). In this outing, Crockett and his 
sidekick George Russell (Buddy Ebsen) team up with burly Mike Fink (Jeff York), 
the egotistical captain of a Mississippi keel boat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas native has fond memories of playing Davy. "Those are special times 
to think back on," says Parker, who keeps busy these days as owner of Fess 
Parker's Red Lion Inn Resort in Santa Barbara and the Fess Parker Winery, 40 
miles north of the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a different world. It was a little easier to live in than the 
one we are in today. I think there was a very innocently injected sense of 
values (in the movies). I spend a lot of time at my winery on Saturdays and 
Sundays meeting the public, signing the bottles and reminiscing about different 
things and those days. I hear people say, 'You gave me a value system or the 
show did' and lots of positive comments. It's remarkable that it's four decades 
since we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, now 70, was an up-and-coming actor when Walt Disney cast him in the 
role of the stalwart frontier hero. Disney caught Parker's small role in 
"Them!," the classic 1954 horror film about giant ants on the rampage in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really interesting," recalls Parker, who played a young man who had 
witnessed the ants. "I had friends who were in the screening room when (Disney) 
noticed my scene. They all pretty much said the same thing that he said, 'Who's 
that?' No one knew. I was real new to the business." 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney executive at the screening knew the producer of "Them!" and asked him 
about Parker. The Disney exec, Parker recalls, "got my name and I guess he 
said, 'Have casting get in touch' with me. That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker says he had no idea "Davy Crockett" would take the country by storm. 
Kids went crazy buying Davy Crockett coonskin caps, outfits and muskets. "The 
Ballad of Davy Crockett," sung by Bill Hays, was a huge hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so tickled to have a job and thrilled to be with Walt Disney," Parker 
says. "It was just a magic time. Disney sent me to 42 cities in America. Buddy 
joined me in June when they joined the three television shows together." 
</P>
<P>
 The first three episodes of "Davy Crockett," Parker explains, were filmed in 
Technicolor but aired on TV in black and white. "They repeated them three times 
in one TV year and then released them seven months later as a first-run 
Technicolor motion picture. It was one of the first miniseries, I suppose, and 
then they turned it into a movie. That was novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides playing Davy, Parker appeared in several Disney feature films, 
including "The Great Locomotive Chase," "Westward Ho! The Wagons," "The Light 
in the Forest" and "Old Yeller." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under personal contract to Walt Disney himself for the first two 
years," Parker says. "At the end of the two years my contract was renegotiated. 
I was then with the (Walt Disney) studio and not Walt. I think those additional 
dollars may have cost me a little bit of Walt's personal attention, which was 
awfully good. He got busy with the theme park. The people running the studio 
and studio productions were less experienced in dealing with someone they had 
under contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't understand what (studio heads) Louis B. Mayer and (Darryl) Zanuck 
knew about building people. They were people, of course, but they were 
properties. They were valuable to the studio. The people who represented Walt 
didn't have that background. That didn't work out too well and I went on my way 
shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 And into the very popular NBC series "Daniel Boone," as the title character. 
When the series left the airwaves in 1970 after six seasons, Parker turned his 
attention to real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of 'Daniel Boone,' my children were growing up. My son was 9 when 
I got off the treadmill of making 165 hours of film. My little girl was 6. ... 
I could have done another series or two. I just thought it was time for me to 
concentrate on other interests. I just kind of drifted away. It wasn't like I 
said, 'I'm never going to do that again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Parker says, he just received a script. "I don't know if there is a 
part in it for me. I'm not sure if there is that I would want it. A producer of 
quite a bit of success sent it to me just this week and basically said, 'Read 
this and tell me what you think.' It would be fun with the right part. I 
haven't been competing for parts. If you are not in the competition, you don't 
come to mind (to producers). The people who are making films today may not even 
know who the heck I am and probably would say, 'Would you mind reading?' I can 
understand that. That's the way the world is."

<P>
 Regarding "A Chat With Mr. Mayhem," by Hilary de Vries (Sept. 11): 
</P>
<P>
 How unfortunate it is to read that Quentin Tarantino sees himself as a maker 
of "great films," yet he knocks Oliver Stone for attempting to inject some 
much-needed social resonance into the tired veins of his original script for 
"Natural Born Killers." If one cuts out what Stone contributed to the film, all 
that's left is a droll one-act journey of cult film iconoclasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Tarantino tries to tell us that Americans can't tell stories anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone is a proven storyteller and filmmaker who has his own moral perspective 
and a genuine point of view. His works will be long remembered because of this 
and the fact that the layers within them have substance, not superficial plot 
manipulation interwoven with monologues consisting of pop culture references 
that the audience is supposed to digest as characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Tarantino ever write or direct anything as memorable or thought provoking 
as "Midnight Express," "Platoon" or "JFK"? Right now it seems doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino's apparent lack of conviction, lack of anything to say about the 
human experience, further illustrates a man who is proud to be uneducated, 
ignorant and apathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories he tells aren't American stories, they're movie nerd stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino the Storyteller? No. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino the Regurgitator? Definitely.

 Before I read Hilary de Vries' interview with him, I had thought Quentin 
Tarantino a wildly overrated, plagiarizing, misogynistic wimp who somehow got 
the backing to make the Movie Mommy Didn't Want Him to Make. 
</P>
<P>
 But now I know better. He is also a shallow, self-serving, puffed-up ignoramus 
who learned about life from a video screen. 
</P>
<P>
 I finished the piece thinking, "Wouldn't it have been cool if a sadistic armed 
robber had walked into Video Archives years ago and subjected then-clerk 
Tarantino to a real-life dose of the butchery he has since so callously 
exploited on his way to the 'forefront of a new generation of filmmakers'?"

 How dare you! You forgot to mention that the 10-minute torture scene is an 
exact rip-off of the "Singin' in the Rain" torture scene from "A Clockwork 
Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 Stealing from one source is plagiarism, but stealing from many is research. 
Tarantino is a great researcher but not an original filmmaker. Who do we hold 
responsible? Tarantino or the insecure, frightened 
I'm-afraid-to-give-the-green-light Hollywood system? I think the system!

 Since the release of "Reservoir Dogs" in 1992, virtually every article on the 
history of the film and how it got made has got it wrong. The apocryphal story, 
as repeated by Calendar, goes: "After (Harvey Keitel) agreed to star . . . 
(Lawrence) Bender was able to raise the $1.5 million. . . ." This is the actual 
sequence of events: 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1990, Quentin asked me to help get the film made, and I joined 
him and producer Bender as an equal partner. Richard Gladstein, then at Live 
Entertainment, agreed to finance the film in January, 1991, the budget to 
depend on the value of the lead actor or actors. Keitel and Christopher Walken 
both read the script, liked it, and it seemed likely we would be able to make a 
deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Live submitted a deal memo to us on Feb. 4, contingent on the services of both 
actors or acceptable substitutes. We submitted a list. By the end of April, 
Keitel was signed, Walken was not. Live agreed to proceed at a reduced budget. 
In June, I went with Quentin to the Sundance directors' lab, where he had a 
chance to try out some of his directing ideas. We started production in August. 
The rest, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very proud of my continuing association with Quentin and Lawrence, and to 
have been a part of "Reservoir Dogs," contributing to the emergence of a major 
American filmmaker.

 Oliver Stone's over-picturesque, big-budget epics don't compare to Quentin 
Tarantino and the candid and un-self-promoting flicks he's made. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, the unappreciated films by Tarantino are not an alternative -- they're 
first class with gold-plated seats.

<P>
 In "Trust Us, This Is for Real" (by Paul Grein, Sept. 11), you quote Herb 
Alpert as saying that the resurgence of the Carpenters is linked to the dearth 
of classic pop songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no dearth of classic songwriting -- there is a dearth of record 
producers and artists who have a feeling for or an interest in such songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the old-line writers of famous song standards have a plethora of 
good songs lying on their pianos. But I have also heard many songs of great 
quality written by people in their teens and 20s that have all the musical and 
lyrical attributes of the finest classic pop songs. 
</P>
<P>
 They cannot get their songs recorded. Apparently nobody is interested.

 BURN CENTRAL: No matter how it happens, the best place to go for a serious 
burn injury is the Sherman Oaks Hospital. Today's Valley Briefing (B2) examines 
how the hospital's famed burn center, the only one in the Valley, treats 
victims. . . . The greatest number of burns (above) result from contact with 
flames.

<P>
 HOUSING SURPLUS: The 1990s California real-estate bust didn't spare Cal State 
Northridge, which is grappling with a $2.4-million deficit this year in its 
student housing program (B1) . . . And the Jan. 17 earthquake that rocked 
CSUN's campus has only compounded the school's housing glut. "No one would even 
deny we're in a predicament," said Ronald Kopita, CSUN's vice president for 
student affairs.

 HIGH ROAD TO CHINA? City officials from Lancaster are heading far from home in 
what they say is a bid to attract new businesses to a proposed industrial park 
and marketplace (B18) . . . But some residents are saying that the prospect of 
an all-expenses-paid trip to China, Taiwan and Hong Hong has clouded local 
politicians' priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT ENOUGH: Although Cal State Northridge senior quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin 
completed 25 of 46 passes for a career-high 358 yards, his last pass was 
intercepted at midfield in the final minute as Southwest Texas State held on 
for a 28-23 victory (C16). . . . Special-teams play did little to help the 
Matador cause. Two errant Northridge punt snaps led to Bobcat scores.

 PRISONERS OF WAR: At the age of 9, John Shelton didn't realize that the 
capture of his father during an Air Force mission over Laos would turn the 
entire family into prisoners as well. . . . For 29 years, the mystery

siblings in emotional shackles. But freedom for the family may now be in sight

 The Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital conducted 958 surgeries from

SIDS OR SUFFOCATION? HOW ONE BABY DIED AND SAVED ANOTHER; TRANSPLANT: DOCTOR'S 
SUSPICIONS LED TO TRUCK DRIVER'S MURDER CONVICTION. FAMILY ACCUSES POLICE OF 
FABRICATING CONFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At the age of 3 1/2 months, Paul Rakow took his last breath in a hospital 
room. Then his respirator was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, 13-day-old Quinn Kyles took his first breath with his new heart 
in an operating room 13 miles away. The donor: Baby Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a blessing borne of tragedy. One family's sacrifice becomes 
another's precious gift. One baby dies of a mysterious killer, Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome; another lives because of that terrible loss. A melodrama both 
bitter and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not how it seemed to one suspicious doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw a father too eager to donate his son's organs and too leery of an 
autopsy. He feared the hero was really a villain. So he intervened. The police 
were called. Their investigation began. And, they say, a confession followed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Ronald Rakow will be sentenced for suffocating his baby son in 
December, 1991, because he would not stop crying. The 28-year-old truck driver 
faces 20 to 60 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 For one mother, this shocking twist of events is hard to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit in judgment of that man," said Theresa Cropper, Quinn's mother. 
"No matter what the factual circumstances are, I will always be grateful for 
that one unselfish act that changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's heart is really happy in Quinn," she added. "Every night I give Quinn 
a big hug for Paul. We say our prayers for that family for a loss they'll never 
be able to compensate." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before Christmas of 1991, an ambulance rushed to Wyler Children's 
Hospital, part of the University of Chicago Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Its cargo was Paul Rakow; this would be the last journey of his short life. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul had been born six weeks premature that August. A respiratory problem 
later required him to be hooked to a portable monitor that would sound an alarm 
if he stopped breathing while sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day in December, Ronald Rakow, then a hospital security guard, was 
watching his son while his wife, Angela, was at work. Paul was not hooked to 
his monitor, but both parents said that wasn't unusual for afternoon naps. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, who had a slight cold, was crying and restless, despite his father's 
efforts to calm him. Angela Rakow returned home at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rakow went to change his son's diaper, Paul wasn't breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby lapsed into a coma; it took at least a half hour to resuscitate him. 
He was placed on a respirator at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Aaron Zucker, the hospital's chief of pediatric critical care, soon began 
wondering what really happened in the Rakow home. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker said he was troubled by Angela Rakow and her mother's "blase" attitude 
when he first told them Paul would likely die or have severe brain damage. He 
grew more alarmed that night when he was notified that the Rakows had inquired 
about organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in and began talking about the possibility of donating his organs 
from jump street," he recalls. "It's the kind of thing people don't do. They're 
too shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rakows, however, insist it was a doctor who initiated the transplant talk. 
And the defense argued that records showed a call to the donor bank from the 
hospital hours before Rakow arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents had had experience with transplants: Rakow's mother received a 
cornea; Angela said she donated the eyes of her stillborn daughter in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zucker notified the couple an autopsy was likely because it was an 
unexplained death, he said Angela Rakow adamantly objected, relating a bizarre 
story of accidentally walking in on a hospital autopsy and being shocked by the 
doctors' irreverent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angela Rakow, who calls Zucker "cold and callous," says her opposition 
stemmed from personal trauma -- her stillborn daughter "looked butchered" after 
an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker, however, says he was more unnerved by Rakow's behavior: He 
commandeered conversation, used medical jargon and knew precise times -- to the 
minute -- of events on that chaotic day his son stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker paged Rakow on Dec. 14, 1991, after a second test confirmed the baby 
was brain dead. Rakow said he would come to the hospital, but Zucker left after 
waiting for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he later learned the couple had gone to the pediatrician's office to 
voice objections to an autopsy, then did some laundry, and finally went to the 
hospital to sign organ-donation papers. Another baby received Paul's liver. 
</P>
<P>
 "If only one of those things had occurred, I probably would have not gone very 
far with this," Zucker said. "But I kept feeling something tapping me on the 
shoulder, saying, 'Here's another thing that ought to bother you.' . . . My 
conscience wouldn't have let me sit quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't act, he notes, until the Rakows' pediatrician, aware of the 
transplant, called to say she was spooked by the couple's behavior -- a feeling 
shared by other hospital staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 15 years as a doctor, Zucker, relying solely on 
intuition -- and no evidence -- called the hospital lawyer. He feared a child 
had been killed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the police were called. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker also relayed his suspicions to a friend, Dr. Robert Kirschner, Cook 
County's deputy chief medical examiner, whose office performed the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirschner said an autopsy cannot distinguish SIDS from suffocation. It's 
"always a diagnosis of exclusion," he said, and more than 90% of cases 
suspected to be SIDS actually turn out to be that. 
</P>
<P>
 As standard procedure, Kirschner dispatched an investigator to interview the 
Rakows. No foul play was detected. The cause of death remained SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As police investigated a medical mystery in one family, another celebrated a 
medical marvel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwain Kyles and Theresa Cropper had learned from prenatal tests that their 
son, Quinn, would have a heart defect. His only chance was a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say, 'Oh, God, give me a heart,' " Cropper said, because it would 
be inviting pain for another mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's parents, both lawyers, launched a high-profile publicity campaign for 
a heart and money for the transplant. Friends and family held a phone-a-thon 
calling trauma centers nationwide. Their story was featured on local TV news. 
Singer Stevie Wonder, a friend of Cropper's, held a fund-raising concert. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 15, 1991, Quinn received a heart. It was his mom's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most transplant recipients know little about the donor beyond age, hometown 
and sex. This case was different. 
</P>
<P>
 Both families lived in the same city. Both learned about each other from the 
media. Both appeared on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But they never met. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1992, Ronald Rakow was brought to the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, detectives had discovered something intriguing: During Rakow's 
first marriage, in 1989, his wife came home from work one night to find that 
the youngest of their three sons was unresponsive. Rakow told her the 
3-month-old boy had fallen off the table while he changed a diaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-wife said she saw a bruise resembling a handprint on the boy's back. 
The child was treated, and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the police wanted to talk about Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Cavanaugh, who later became Rakow's attorney, said they questioned his 
client for hours, then told him his son didn't die of SIDS, but suffocated 
because of the way he was placed on his pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 They left the room and when they returned, Rakow was on his knees, crying and 
praying. He was already racked with guilt, Cavanaugh said, but expected to go 
home -- and be charged with neglect for not having the monitor attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the session ended with a six-page statement written by a prosecutor 
-- and signed by Rakow. 
</P>
<P>
 It details an exasperated, angry father unsuccessfully trying to soothe his 
crying son. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the statement, Ronald "decided to stop Paul's crying and the only 
way he could do it was to stop his breathing. Ronald said he placed Paul's face 
down on the pillow and said he didn't give a ---- anymore and left him there. . 
. . Let your mother take care of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Rakow said he lied to his wife, "lied to every doctor he spoke to," opposed an 
autopsy, fearing it would reveal his son was suffocated and approved the organ 
donation to conceal what happened, the statement said. It added that he came 
clean because "he could not live with his lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh said Rakow never even read that statement and those were the 
prosecutor's words. He questions why no court reporter was present and no 
recording made. The statement, he said, is "about manipulation of his grief and 
distortion of his words." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Rakow, 27, also says police harassed, coerced and put words in her 
husband's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my husband harmed my son, he would not be living," she said. "I would 
never allow anyone to harm my children. I would kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my husband did not kill my son." 
</P>
<P>
 A jury disagreed. In August, after a five-day trial, Rakow was convicted of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors argued that Rakow knew his son was too weak to lift his head if it 
was stuck in a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 But the baby was not weak, Cavanaugh said. He presented medical experts who 
testified that they couldn't eliminate SIDS and suggested Paul could not have 
died in the manner prosecutors claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rakow testified he placed his son on the pillow with his head to the side. His 
wife testified she was a few feet from the baby and saw nothing amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury just didn't believe me," she said. "I find it very puzzling and very 
sad. I have no reason to lie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rakow is appealing his conviction. But there are even more family problems; 
his wife's son and two daughters were placed in foster care as a consequence of 
the case, and she is fighting to regain them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still grieving," she said. "I lost my husband, I lost my children due to 
this and I lost my son." 
</P>
<P>
 She tries not to think about Quinn Kyles. "I have so much going on in my life 
that takes precedence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Quinn, Theresa Cropper reports he is potty trained, attending preschool 
and doing cartwheels. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not follow Rakow's trial and still has trouble believing what 
happened. But her thoughts are with the Rakows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere a little baby's spirit is in heaven . . . an angel still having a 
lot of pain," she said. "That family didn't have to donate Paul's organs. They 
made my life a joy. . . . They deserved our prayers before this and I'll pray 
for him after."

CRIME VICTIMS BEGIN PRESSING FOR FINANCIAL RESTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN JOHNSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Kathy Tennihan was beaten so severely her eyes swelled shut. 
For months afterward she crawled because she was too terrified to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Today her attacker is free after serving 6 1/2 years for assault and battery 
with intent to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tennihan, 46, still pays with mental anguish she says prevents her from 
even working full time, and she believes her attacker ought to be paying too. 
</P>
<P>
 She is pushing for a state law to make financial restitution a mandatory part 
of punishment for violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two other states have laws requiring attackers to make recovery 
payments to their victims. And the new federal crime bill requires sex 
offenders and child molesters to compensate their victims for all losses, 
including the cost of psychological therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennihan and others say victims often need money -- not just apologies or 
stiff sentences for criminals -- to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges and victims' advocates say mandatory financial restitution can be 
unconstitutional and tricky to enforce. But they also say it could help 
eliminate the disparity between the criminals who serve their time and forget 
and the victims who bear scars for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of times victims feel left out of the criminal process," said Marshall 
Dayan, a Durham, N.C., lawyer who has been court-appointed defender in dozens 
of capital cases. "It seems to me that there's a place in the system for making 
the direct victims of crime a part of it. That place, to me, is having the 
offender make restitution directly to the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges in Washington and Utah are required to order restitution, said John 
Stein, deputy director for the National Organization for Victim Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five states have less comprehensive laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In all states, victims and their families can turn to victim compensation 
funds to be reimbursed for lost wages, medical bills and funeral costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Restitution advocates say such funds can be inadequate because of restrictions 
on payments and on what crimes are covered. Some states, for example, do not 
provide compensation for sexual assault, unless there was demonstrable bodily 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Pompelio, a lawyer from Sparta, N.J., said he knows the flaws in the 
system personally and professionally. His son was murdered in 1989, and since 
then Pompelio has pushed for greater compensation for crime victims and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey, like most states, caps compensation at $25,000. Pompelio says that 
cannot pay for the years of psychological therapy many of his clients have 
needed after being sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompelio, who runs the New Jersey Crime Victim's Law Center, said criminals 
should be made to pay as long as their victims suffer -- in some cases, 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims can turn to civil courts for restitution, a tactic Boulder County 
District Court Judge Richard McClean recommends in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kathy Tennihan knows civil courts provide no guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 She filed a civil suit against her attacker and was awarded $100,000, but to 
date she has netted only about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's out there and getting his life back together, but I'm still stuck," she 
said.

PARK SERVICE PLAN TO DOWNSIZE SPARKS DISPUTES; GOVERNMENT: INTERNAL DEBATE 
SLOWS AGENCY'S EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH ADMINISTRATION'S DIRECTIVE TO SHRINK WORK 
FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BARR, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Park Service -- the custodian of Yellowstone, the Everglades and 
the Washington Monument -- is poised to undertake a multimillion-dollar 
reorganization that will downsize the Washington headquarters and give new 
power to park superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan has divided the Park Service and created morale problems at 
regional and Washington offices facing staff cutbacks. Longtime employees 
contend the reorganization will cost significantly more than currently 
projected, will put parks at increased risk to environmental dangers and will 
weaken accountability. Supporters of the plan, however, say it will force the 
Park Service into dealing with environmental questions outside park boundaries 
and put more staff in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreements inside the Park Service reflect, in varying degrees, the 
debates under way in virtually all government departments as federal officials 
deal with how to implement the Clinton Administration's decision to shrink the 
federal work force by 12% over the next five years. For the Park Service, whose 
historical sites and parks attract about 273 million visitors each year, the 
proposed reorganization would transform traditions and practices that have 
remained mostly unchanged since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 George T. Frampton Jr., the Interior Department's assistant secretary for fish 
and wildlife and parks, in describing the plan's effect, said it would bring 
not just generational change but a "century change" to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" initiative provided the 
framework for the proposed Park Service changes. In keeping with Gore's 
directives, the Park Service will flatten its Washington headquarters 
structure, cut back its regional offices and try to shift personnel from mostly 
invisible desk jobs into the parks or into positions that directly support park 
rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service has tried to blend Gore's desire to reduce bureaucratic 
layers with past and current park efforts aimed at protecting the nation's 
treasured geographic and cultural sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frampton's view, the proposed reorganization will help shift the Park 
Service away from its traditional command-and-control management structure 
toward an approach built on peer groups, consensus and the development of 
partnerships with landowners, local and state governments and other groups 
outside park boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Everglades, for example, almost all the decisions about the quality of 
water in the park are made by farmers and state and local authorities. Frampton 
thinks the Park Service must become more agile in developing strategies to 
protect the parks from environmental threats that originate beyond park 
boundaries but affect park land. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan's critics include several Park Service employees who, speaking on 
condition they not be identified, contend that the downsizing effort will 
actually create a less unified system that will create new power centers. At 
the same time, the critics argue that stripped-down management ranks will not 
be able to stay on top of developments in 366 separate park system sites. 
</P>
<P>
 According to draft documents on the proposed reorganization, the Park Service, 
which has about 19,000 "full-time equivalent" employees, would shed about 1,300 
of them over 2 1/2 years. The Washington office, which numbers about 1,100 
employees, would be cut to 200 workers, according to the draft plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frampton suggested that the personnel cutback would not be as dramatic as 
envisioned in the proposal. He said current projections showed the Park Service 
cutting 700 jobs, with the Washington office losing about 350 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining how many people will lose work hinges in part on how many more 
employees sign up for "buyouts" and whether the Park Service is granted a 
fiscal 1996 budget increase that allows extra hires, Frampton said. As of Labor 
Day, 423 employees had opted for buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how the personnel numbers play out, Frampton said they are in 
keeping with the Administration's government-wide goal to decrease management 
structure substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened over time is that you ended up with a lot of people in the 
Washington office who basically review and check off decisions made at the 
regional offices. And the regional offices had two or three levels who would 
check off decisions made by superintendents," Frampton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those layers that existed only for double-checking and passing on decisions 
can be significantly reduced, Frampton said. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish that goal, the draft plan would pare back from 10 to seven the 
number of Park Service regional offices and consolidate or reduce staffing at 
national program centers that provide specialized expertise, such as historical 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional offices would be replaced with seven field directors who would 
have a staff about one-tenth their current size. The bulk of the regional 
employees would shift to 16 system support offices set up closer to the parks 
but outside the chain of command. The remaining employees would take jobs in 
the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks, in turn, would organize into "clusters," with 10 to 35 parks in 
each one. Park superintendents in each cluster would meet to figure out ways to 
stretch limited funding and to share approaches to environmental or other 
policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton acknowledged that the plan -- put together by a committee of rangers 
and managers -- would expand park superintendents' authority and, to succeed, 
requires improved leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It demands somebody other than a manager simply accustomed to taking orders 
and translating them into other orders," Frampton said. "If we're going to 
manage to protect park resources in the future, then they're going to have to 
be up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's critics argue that it is folly to expect park superintendents ever 
to agree on budget priorities, and some contend that the new 16 support offices 
will end up as fiefdoms asserting their independence from the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Frampton, who has met with a wide range of employees about the reorganization, 
said he had his own list of tough questions that need answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some significant risks to this reorganization. I think anytime you 
really try to look ahead 10 or 15 years and make changes to update an 
organization to your vision of what the future problems are going to be, it's 
risky," he said.

PLAN TO CUT MALL BUS SERVICE CALLED RACIST; CONNECTICUT: TEENS SOMETIMES BRING 
IN MORE TROUBLE THAN DOLLARS, SUBURBAN MERCHANTS SAY. THEY HOPE TO BAR BUSES ON 
POPULAR CRUISING NIGHTS, FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Almost every afternoon, Kiko Boyd and Tim McNeil hop a bus in Bridgeport and 
head to the mall in suburban Trumbull, where they check out the CDs and eat 
french fries, but mostly just hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not alone. On weekends, the corridors of the sprawling Trumbull 
Shopping Park are clogged with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials complain that the crowds sometimes bring in more trouble than 
dollars. They've come up with a plan to keep the Bridgeport youths out: bar 
buses from stopping at the mall on Friday and Saturday nights, the two most 
popular cruising nights for teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups call the plan racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of kids who are troublemakers, but they're not all from 
Bridgeport, and I think this is pointing the finger at Bridgeport kids, and 
it's not fair," said Alma Maya, a member of the Puerto Rican Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greater Bridgeport Transit District intends to ask a federal judge to 
ensure that bus service continues. Mall officials deny their plan is 
discriminatory, but have agreed to wait for a court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of kids and the behavior concern us," said Gary Karl, the mall's 
general manager. "We just are unable to deal with it effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of banning the buses came after one teen shot another in the leg last 
year at a store entrance just yards from the bus stop. Karl said it was an 
isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear of crime lingers in Trumbull, a quiet suburb just over the border 
from Bridgeport, which led the state in murders last year with 63. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, 16, and Boyd, 14, who are both black, said that mall security guards 
often harass them, ordering them to split up if they are in groups of more than 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truthfully, I think it is racial," McNeil said. "I can't say no one causes 
trouble, but half the kids who come here want to buy things and they get kicked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other youths say they get harassed regardless of color. Paul Kochiss, a white 
18-year-old from Bridgeport, said guards pester most groups of teens who hang 
out in the corridors outside Filenes, Abraham & Strauss and other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't come to the mall to spend money all the time. You come to see your 
friends and look at girls," Kochiss said. "They don't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall operators have proposed stopping buses from coming to the mall after 6 
p.m. on Fridays and 4 p.m. on Saturdays. Karl said the plan is intended to deal 
with a legitimate safety issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Friday evenings and late Saturday afternoons, we have what we feel is an 
unnecessary increased level of young people in the shopping center . . . coming 
via public transportation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But stopping the buses would also end an economic lifeline for teens who work 
at the mall and have no other means of transportation, Maya said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would inconvenience the 86% of the passengers who aren't teen-agers, 
said William Finch, the transit district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit district lawyer Thomas Weihing said the plan would violate the 
constitutional right to freedom of assembly and would be unfair to handicapped 
people who depend on the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has moved the bus stop to the far end of a parking lot, hired police 
to help its security guards and increased bicycle patrols on the grounds. Teens 
say these are better ways of dealing with the gangs that sometimes congregate 
at the mall than stopping the bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's trouble every once in a while," said Adam Catropa, 14, of Stratford. 
"They should keep the buses, but they should have more security."

MURDER MOST FOWL EXCUSED BY JURY

 He admitted he cock-a-doodle did it, but the jury let him go free. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael T. Lloyd, 23, was acquitted of cruelty to animals last week for 
shooting to death a neighbor's pet rooster that he claimed kept him awake at 
night with its crowing.The jury deliberated only half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it true, Mr. Lloyd, that on July 5, 1993, you came home from work, had 
a few beers and decided to waste the rooster?" prosecutor Glenn Coffey asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get no sleep because of the chickens," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have gotten up to two years in jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Farley Holt argued that the animal, Henry D. Rooster, had 
"gone from being a pet to a pest." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a law to take care of barking dogs, but why isn't there one to 
control crowing roosters or any other animal or fowl?" he asked the jury.

COLOR KIDS SCARED: SEXUAL-ABUSE TRAINING PROGRAMS RAISE QUESTIONS; EDUCATION: 
PROGRAMS RANGE FROM COLORING BOOKS WARNING THAT MOST ANYONE COULD BE AN ABUSER 
TO CLASSES. CRITICS FEAR EFFORT COULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

 A coloring book asks, "Who COULD be a child molester?" and then answers with 
pictures of nearly everyone in a child's life: a priest, coach, policeman, 
teacher, Mom, Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 A preschool curriculum instructs teachers to hold up a drawing of a girl 
sitting in her uncle's lap and ask, "What if Donna's uncle put his hand down 
Donna's pants? Would that be OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 So much for childhood innocence. Between their ABCs and recess, schoolchildren 
now must ponder a darker world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual-abuse prevention programs for children have gained wide acceptance 
since they first appeared in the early 1980s, now reaching an estimated 
two-thirds of all U.S. children. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, nobody knows if the programs really work, and some researchers say 
they may do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the programs have not been proved effective in preventing abuse 
and may confuse youngsters, possibly twisting their sexual development in later 
years. Even some advocates of prevention efforts say many programs are 
misguided, outdated and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs have been experimenting with kids since they started," said 
Neil Gilbert, professor of social welfare at UC Berkeley and co-author of the 
book, "With the Best of Intentions: The Child Sexual Abuse Prevention 
Movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert challenges the ideology behind many prevention programs, saying they 
wrongly borrow from feminist principles in assuming young children can be 
"empowered" to fend off sexual predators. In reality, he said, children are no 
match for adult abusers, physically or mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think adults ought to be responsible for protecting kids," Gilbert said. 
"We shouldn't be saying, especially to young kids, 'It's on your shoulder.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Studies he conducted in California found that preschoolers and first-graders 
could not grasp some concepts presented in abuse-prevention programs. Many 
could not distinguish between good and bad touching, and training appeared to 
increase the number of first-graders who thought that any kind of touching was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs also may have unintended consequences down the road, Gilbert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the long-term effects of introducing children to the notion 
that sexuality is bad and dangerous," he said. "When they have their first 
sexual experience, we don't know if this will come floating back into their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Any assessment of prevention efforts is complicated by the hundreds of 
different programs in use, ranging from 20-minute puppet shows to two-month 
courses. All try to teach children to recognize sexual abuse, to say no, and to 
tell an adult. But the similarities end there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools use methods discarded years ago by experts, said Joan Cole 
Duffell, community education director for the Seattle-based Committee for 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools, strapped for funds, turn to local advocacy groups that do the 
training cheaply but may have little knowledge of child development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear them," Duffell said. "They're really not prepared to know what kids 
are ready for at this age, and they don't know how to teach them." 
</P>
<P>
 Duffell's nonprofit organization markets "Talking About Touching," a six- to 
eight-week curriculum considered one of the nation's most comprehensive. It 
reaches 300,000 preschool and elementary schoolchildren a year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Duffell believes abuse-prevention training is worthwhile if done 
right, she said it is often done wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these programs should be looked at in a critical light," she said. 
"Anybody who's going to do a one-shot program with 5-year-olds about 'the uh-oh 
feeling when someone touches you' is only going to leave them confused." 
</P>
<P>
 A child's age also matters, she said. Many preschool programs start with 
3-year-olds, figuring that if a child is old enough to be abused, he or she is 
old enough to learn about abuse. But Duffell's group recommends waiting until 
children turn 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing what we know about learning and developmental issues, there really is 
no healthy point in telling a 3-year-old about sexual abuse," Duffell said. 
"They'll become confused, and the most you can hope for is that you'll scare 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The first nationwide study of prevention programs, released last fall, yielded 
a mixed bag of findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The University of New Hampshire's Family Research Laboratory conducted 
telephone interviews with a national sample of 2,000 children ages 10 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 While 67% of the children said they had received abuse-prevention training, 
only 34% had been exposed to what the researchers considered high-quality, 
comprehensive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive program was defined as one with at least nine of 12 
components, such as involving parents, having more than one class, letting 
children practice prevention skills, and exploring abuse by family members, not 
just strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the positive side, the study found that children with comprehensive 
training were more likely to tell someone after being sexually abused. They 
also were more likely to use preferred strategies such as yelling, demanding to 
be left alone, or threatening to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I take it to be encouraging," said David Finkelhor, the study's lead 
investigator. "What's important about this study is that it's the first to 
suggest that exposure to these programs may be able to affect what children do 
in these victimization encounters." 
</P>
<P>
 But the study supplied critics with ammunition, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Children appeared to receive little benefit from the brief, less comprehensive 
programs, actually scoring slightly lower on a knowledge test than children 
with no training at all. Even the children with comprehensive training, while 
scoring better for knowledge, were no more likely to stop an attempted abuse 
from being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 And in what Finkelhor conceded was "a troubling finding," children with 
comprehensive training were more likely to be injured during abuse, possibly 
because they were more prone to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the uncertainties, Gilbert believes money spent on programs aimed at 
young children might be better spent instructing parents and teachers to be 
more vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Finkelhor believes the programs should be improved, not scrapped. Any 
negative effects, such as scaring children, appear to be relatively mild, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrast it with the general fare of violence they get on TV," Finkelhor 
said. "Most of that seems more threatening and scary than this information." 
</P>
<P>
 Duffell considers abuse-prevention training a necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad we have to do it," she said. "It's a trade-off that many parents 
and teachers are willing to live with, because they don't want the consequences 
of their children being abused." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a limit to what any school program can do, Duffell said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the strongest findings in Finkelhor's study was the benefit of parental 
involvement. Although school programs did not increase the likelihood that a 
child would thwart an attempted assault, parental instruction did. One of the 
greatest benefits of school programs appears to be the discussion they can 
stimulate at home, the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents say, 'Oh, my kid got personal safety this week at school, so I 
don't have to worry anymore,' " Duffell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, parents have to be constantly worried about it. They need to work 
on good communication with their children. They need to be concerned about 
where their children are at all times. If you put all your eggs in the basket 
of teaching kids what to do in the event of a sexual assault, you're not going 
to solve the problem."

IN NEBRASKA, DUELING CANDIDATES STRAP ON LIE DETECTORS; POLITICS: A CONGRESSMAN 
AND HIS CHALLENGER EACH TAKE POLYGRAPH TESTS AFTER DISPUTED AD AIRS. BOTH SAY 
THEY WERE VINDICATED. 
</P>

<P>
 Candidates are often accused of lying, but not many get around to taking 
lie-detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nebraska, two congressional candidates agreed to be strapped to a polygraph 
machine in a high-tech political showdown over whether the GOP candidate said 
public schools were teaching immoral values. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Rep. Peter Hoagland, who is seeking a fourth House term, and 
Republican challenger Jon Christensen each passed the tests. Of course, they 
were asked different questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen passed a test administered by an independent polygraph examiner 
hired by the Omaha World-Herald. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the only person in America running for Congress who is a certified 
honest individual," Christensen said with a wide grin the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests followed a feud over a Hoagland television commercial, which 
portrayed Christensen as a religious-right extremist critical of public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the commercial, an Omaha schoolteacher says Christensen came to her home 
and told her that public school books in Omaha teach immoral values. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen denied chatting with the woman, Barbara Lebedz, or campaigning in 
her neighborhood. He said he believes education is a local issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen called Hoagland a "manipulative liar." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute snowballed after Lebedz was asked whether she would submit to a 
lie-detector test. She said she would if Christensen would. He said he would if 
Hoagland would. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen took the test first, on Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Hoagland took a test administered by a private investigator 
hired by Hoagland. Hoagland stood behind Lebedz's account, and said his test 
showed he did not concoct the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebedz never took the test. A polygraph examiner hired by Hoagland told her 
she was too emotional to undergo the exam at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 She attempted to take the test days after reporting to police that her family 
had received two death threats in phone calls about the commercial. The 
Hoagland campaign pulled the ads, citing the calls. Omaha police are 
investigating the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen and Hoagland are in a tight battle to represent the Omaha-area 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he passed his test, Hoagland remains skeptical about the machine's 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, I have thought it makes no sense to have the credibility 
in this particular instance to be determined by a lie-detector machine," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did he take it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it would be helpful to take it; I knew I was telling the truth," he 
said. "If it would satisfy some people, then it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Polygraph results are inadmissible in Nebraska's courtrooms. Critics say it is 
a subjective test that hinges on the examiner's skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies say the test is 75% accurate, while others say it is 80% or 90% 
accurate, said Gaylon Kuchel, a criminal justice professor at the University of 
Nebraska at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 It is rare for politicians to submit to such tests, but there were a few 
instances when candidates volunteered to take the test in the 1980s, said Henry 
Kenski, associate professor of communication with the department of political 
science at the University of Arizona in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lie detector is kind of extreme myself," said Kenski, co-author of 
the 1990 book "Attack Politics."

YUPPIE BIKERS: REBORN TO BE WILD; LIFESTYLE: THE BELOVED STEEL STEED OF THE 
BLUE-COLLAR CROWD IS NOW COVETED BY CELLULAR-PHONE TYPES -- AND BY SPECULATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The thunder of motorcycles echoes from factory walls in a downtown industrial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Down a dead-end street, men in boots and leather vests suck on beers in a 
smoky bar or swagger near the pool tables, sticks in hand. Outside, more than 
50 Harley-Davidsons cool beneath the street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like an outlaw gathering -- until Michael Blatter whips out a 
cellular phone to call some biker buddies dining across town. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a yuppie in disguise," the 30-year-old advertising executive admits. 
</P>
<P>
 So are most of the other Tuesday night regulars at Lucky's, an upscale pool 
hall in a gentrifying neighborhood. On "Biker Night," lawyers and commodity 
traders roll in on gleaming new $15,000 Harley Specials and Fat Boys to rub 
fenders with the lovingly maintained Electra Glides of grittier blue-collar 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they strike sparks. 
</P>
<P>
 "An average guy can't afford a new bike because the yuppies are buying them 
all up and putting the price out of reach," griped Ed Fern, a burly Chicago 
Park District worker with a red face and sandy goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 They agree on at least one thing: Harley-Davidson rules. The brawny 
American-made motorcycles with huge, throbbing V-twin motors have turned a 
corner at the image junction. Hairy, tattooed tough guys -- Harley's core 
buyers in the '60s and '70s -- ride a road crowded with business titans, 
fashion designers, politicians, Hollywood actors and -- gad! -- accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 The late publishing magnate Malcolm Forbes made Harleys acceptable. Actor 
Mickey Rourke made them fashionable. Now Harleys are must-have items for those 
who must have everything. To paraphrase an unofficial, off-color Harley slogan, 
if you don't ride a Harley, you ain't rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the big bikes, priced at $14,000 to $17,000 new, is so strong that 
buyers must wait at least a year for delivery, and year-old models fetch $3,000 
to $4,000 more than new ones, according to Tim Farrell, a dealer in suburban 
Berwyn. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a speculator's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people that should be keeping their bikes more than a season are 
selling them because they're getting so much money for the bikes," Farrell 
said. "We don't want to sell to speculators. We want people to ride the bikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Harley-Davidson considers such speculation "disgusting," spokesman Ken Schmidt 
said. He said the Milwaukee-based company plans to boost production to 100,000 
bikes in 1996, up from 93,000 this year, but hopes to always keep supplies 
limited to maintain Harley's "mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Herwitz, a 31-year-old criminal lawyer in cowboy boots and designer vest, 
said he bought a used Harley for $10,000 last year "because it's a good stress 
release and it's a good investment." He doesn't take his "hog" on the 
expressway and keeps it a secret from his mother because "if she knew I bought 
a motorcycle, she wouldn't speak to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than head out on the highway, many rich urban bikers -- yes, they call 
themselves "rubbies" -- ride only from bar to bar in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy says, 'Let's ride down to Kentucky for the weekend,' the yuppie 
biker will check the mileage on his bike," said Pete Krakowski, a 26-year-old 
chemical engineer with blue-collar roots who comfortably straddles the gap 
between rubbies and "real" bikers. "As long as they keep their mileage down, 
then their bike's worth more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Yuppies who like to feel the wind in their hair gel get more respect from the 
live-to-ride crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a guy who makes $100,000 a year. He's a yuppie but he ain't afraid to 
do what we do," Fern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever!" 
</P>
<P>
 Herwitz longed for less diversity. He said he feared his bike would be stolen 
and whispered that some of Lucky's patrons "would slit my neck if they had a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 When the road calls, blue-collar riders might grab their sleeping bags and 
head for Wisconsin. Affluent bikers are pickier. Restaurateur John Tarantino 
and Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace shipped their Harleys to Las Vegas so 
they could tour the Southwest on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riding is so great out there," Tarantino said wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with deep pockets and exotic tastes spend thousands to customize their 
steeds. Tom Herndon, who said he earns $400,000 a year peddling oral video 
equipment to dentists, spent $20,000 to have his Harley rebuilt into a 
showpiece chopper with an "Easy Rider" U.S. flag motif. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 47, I'm a grandfather, I've got all my kids out of college and now it's 
my turn again," said Herndon, a tall Eric Clapton look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But those reborn to be wild must make concessions to age. Herndon said his 
bike's maiden road trip, to the annual Harley riders' meet in Sturgis, S.D., in 
early August, was on a trailer behind his Winnebago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too old to ride 1,100 miles in two days," he said.

BURIAL DRESSES FOR NEWBORNS HELP TO EASE THE SORROW; LOUISIANA: VOLUNTEERS 
CREATE SHROUD-LIKE GOWNS, USING SOFT CLOTH, BUT DREAD THE CALL FOR A NEW 
SHIPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The notice in the church bulletin wasted no words, coming to the point with 
heartbreaking swiftness: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sewers needed to help put together baby dresses. These baby dresses are used 
for infants who die at Earl K. Long Hospital. The infants are presented to 
their parents and family to hold and say their goodbys. Obtain a dress kit with 
everything cut and ready to sew." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally: "Bring only thread and your love." 
</P>
<P>
 Now women like Cissy Davis patiently cut patterns of tiny, baby gowns from 
soft cloth, creating shrouds for dead infants. They bring them to the hospital 
a dozen at a time, always dreading the call for another shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're glad you can help, but you're always sad when the nurses call and say 
they don't have any more dresses," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there seems to be an insatiable demand. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Louisiana had the nation's eighth-highest infant mortality rate -- 
more than 11 babies lost for every 1,000 born. Nationally, 9 of every 1,000 
died, giving the United States a higher rate than Singapore, Spain or Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, simply, is that too many babies are born too early, weighing too 
little. Too many women lack access to prenatal care or fail to take advantage 
of the care that is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,600 deliveries at Earl K. Long in the last year, 20% of the mothers 
had no prenatal care. About 25 babies are brought each month to the hospital's 
intensive-care nursery, most born not long after the pregnancy's halfway mark. 
Many weigh just over a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventilators gently force oxygen into underdeveloped lungs. Tubes the size of 
fishing line carry nourishment and medication into their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 When death is imminent, nurses take the family into a nearby office to say 
goodby. Often, a mother will rock her baby until it dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the families are poor. If the parents want a funeral, the nurses will 
work with a local church or service organization to raise the money. Or the 
nurses might encourage a funeral home to donate a casket, marker and a small 
plot of land at a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 There remains the problem of how to clothe these tiny corpses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly impossible to find clothes for babies born prematurely, many of 
them small enough to cradle in an adult palm, said Cindy Collins, a nurse who 
supervises the neonatal intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 So a year ago a pediatrician at the hospital called the First Presbyterian 
Church in Baton Rouge and asked if a woman's group there would be interested in 
making infant burial gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we asked them to do is to make some real little dresses that the parents 
could feel good about burying the babies in or keep as a memento," Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, Anna Miller and Pam Downing agreed to lead the project. They found a 
doll dress to use as a pattern. They purchased fabric and trimming, cut dress 
pieces from the cloth and placed the materials in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement in the church bulletin drew immediate results. Some women 
asked for kits; others donated material and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lady didn't have a sewing machine, but she wanted to make one so she 
sewed it by hand," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the seamstresses have stitched almost 100 dresses. Whenever the 
hospital runs out, the women take a dozen to the nurses, and "that's where it 
hits you," Downing said. "It hits more going there than doing the sewing. The 
babies are so tiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a mother of three grown children, wasn't prepared for the emotional 
jolt. "The first little dress I made -- it really bothered me to think I was 
making a dress for a baby who was going to be put in it that was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 As she works, she remembers her own baby brother, born too early to survive. 
"My mother wouldn't let me go to the funeral," she said. "I often wonder, what 
did he wear when they buried him?" 
</P>
<P>
 She prefers to keep her distance from the beneficiaries of her work. She 
doesn't meet the mothers she sews for and rarely inquires about the babies she 
sees in the nursery, clinging to life. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and all the other seamstresses know that their efforts are 
appreciated. Cindy Collins said many mothers bury their babies in these lovely 
dresses, but reserve the bonnets and blankets as keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a piece of something they can keep that says this baby was real," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've never gotten to take the babies home. A lot of times they've never 
gotten to feed them. Some family members think, 'You couldn't have gotten 
attached to them that fast because he or she was never a real person.' But 
that's not true."

 Nine people who attended an Oktoberfest two weeks ago were poisoned by the

PENNSYLVANIA'S AMISH COMMUNITY PLOWS NEW GROUND IN THE HEALTH CARE ARENA; 
MEDICINE: SECT DISAPPROVES OF INSURANCE, SO IT DEVISED A PLAN TO INCORPORATE 
DISCOUNTS FOR GROUP PURCHASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At least half of Dr. Nick Dragann's family practice comes from the Old Order 
Amish, families who farm the broad fields of Lancaster County. 
</P>
<P>
 From Dragann, the Amish get homespun, quality medical care. From the Amish, 
Dragann gets patients who are prompt and pay cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the success of doctors such as Dragann, a Lancaster hospital has 
fashioned a loosely structured health referral and payment program for the 
county's plain people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care issues are touching everyone, and their community is not immune," 
said Robert E. Lee, vice president for planning and marketing at Community 
Hospital of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which started in April, is not traditional health insurance, since 
Amish ways forbid taking out such policies. But it does incorporate one major 
element of managed care -- discounts for large group purchases, even though 
these particular patients pay no premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Community General was already in the good books of the 20,000-strong Old Order 
Amish, the region's most conservative Anabaptist sect, because of its 
osteopathic approach to medicine, which focuses on the entire body's 
interrelationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients receive all types of treatment, from vital obstetrics care for 
Amish women who typically have five or six children, to treatment for Maple 
Sugar Urine Disease, a rare blood sickness that strikes Amish children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials declined to discuss further specifics of the plan, citing 
competitive concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've joked that I've had managed care for 20 years and each household has its 
own manager," said Dragann, who sees about 125 patients a week, half of them 
Amish, at his office in Gordonville, 10 miles east of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kind of fell in place. They don't want to deal with anything 
governmental -- anything that uses the word insurance -- so we kind of 
approached it saying, 'We want more of your business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster County's Amish have been self-insured longer than most health 
insurance has existed. Congregations traditionally offer "church aid," 
earmarking part of their members' tithes for health care and distributing money 
to ailing members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amish are usually reluctant to discuss internal community matters with 
outsiders, but when Community Hospital President Mark C. Barabas approached a 
group of Amish bishops in March about provisions for their medical care, things 
clicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there are any barriers for using common-sense concepts when it 
comes to health care, to do what's fair and what's right for a particular 
constituency," Barabas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it sort of reflects the spirit of the times," said Donald B. 
Kraybill, director of the Center for Anabaptist Studies at Elizabethtown 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hospitals are looking for ways to develop loyalty, and the (Amish) objection 
historically has been to commercial health insurance, that it sort of 
merchandises your life," Kraybill said. "This is a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Gable, spokesman for the Hospital Assn. of Pennsylvania, said many 
hospitals in the state employ the same tactics in targeting different groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no different than what a lot of our hospitals do -- direct contracting 
with self-insured groups, in most cases businesses," Gable said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle Hospital in central Pennsylvania has tried a similar discount 
approach with the less-conservative Mennonite population there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at Community Hospital, which serves 6,000 in-patients and 
65,000 outpatients a year, hope the association with the Amish enhances both 
revenue and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just the Amish hospital, but it certainly wouldn't bother us if 
people thought of us that way," Lee said. "Given their reputation for 
straightforwardness and solidity, that would be a very positive thing."

CHURCH'S MEMBERSHIP RISES; SO DOES CRITICISM; RELIGION: IN 15 YEARS, THE 
BOSTON-BASED GROUP HAS GROWN FROM 30 MEMBERS TO 50,000. BUT CRITICS SAY ITS

 She's 24 years old, an MIT graduate working on a doctorate in cell biology at 
Tufts University. She's friendly, personable and religious. 
</P>
<P>
 And at many colleges, Elsa Mak is not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Mak belongs to the Boston Church of Christ, which in 15 years has swelled from 
30 members to about 50,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It is how it became one of the nation's fastest growing churches that has 
stirred criticism and prompted dozens of colleges to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
 Members say the church has flourished because of the appeal of its 
back-to-basics approach to religion. People tired of the pomp and ritual of 
traditional churches are drawn to the Boston church's pure dedication to the 
Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say they are being duped. They say the church is obsessed with 
growth and will do almost anything to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, including former members, say the church smothers recruits with 
false friendships -- "love bombing," they call it -- to lure them into the 
church and keep them there. It dominates their lives and, they say, threatens 
them with eternal damnation if they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members recruit wherever they can -- on the street, in parking lots, 
and especially on college campuses. They say they are following God's command 
to proselytize, but their efforts have buttressed the arguments of those who 
call the church a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it a cult? Even some critics don't like the term. The Boston Church 
isn't like many cults of the past 25 years. Kip McKean, its 40-year-old leader, 
calls the shots, observers say, but he hasn't made himself a highly visible, 
charismatic guru. Critics haven't charged him with living luxuriously. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no serious concern that the Boston Church of Christ will turn violent, 
and members don't walk around in trancelike stupors. Mak is a typical member: 
intelligent, likable, unfailingly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all the things your mother would like you to be," said Robert 
Randolph, associate dean for student affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. "That's one of the biggest problems about them. They're extremely 
nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers critics see are more subtle: a loss of individuality, estrangement 
from friends and family and members losing control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie Morrill remembers her first encounter with the church. She was 
approached by a friendly young woman on a New York City street in 1992; she 
welcomed the conversation. Morrill was 28, a social work supervisor, far from 
her Rochester, N.Y., home. She was lonely and struggling to live on a small 
salary in the big city. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman invited her to church, Morrill said no. "I thought, what are 
you, some kind of Jehovah's Witness?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman kept calling her and Morrill attended a service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen," she said. "People 
holding hands, praising God. I thought this was really it." 
</P>
<P>
 She joined, moved in with members and tithed 10% of her gross wages. Her life 
revolved around the church, with services, Bible studies and little time to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In her free time -- on bike rides or Staten Island Ferry trips -- she was 
expected to invite strangers to church, she said. On dates with church members, 
she and her companion might invite a waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me that everyone else that doesn't belong to this kingdom, everyone 
else on the outside, is not saved, is going to hell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she came home for Christmas, her family had arranged for her to meet an 
exit counselor. After three 12-hour sessions, she returned to New York, quit 
the church and her job and headed home. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrill's experience was typical, church critics say. They say the church 
preys on the weak and lonely to make them feel wanted. It identifies weaknesses 
of members -- perhaps a history of failed romances or a drinking problem -- and 
convinces them the problems will recur if they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a manipulative process in which friendship is a technique. It's not 
friendship," said Jeff Davis, a former minister in the mainstream Churches of 
Christ who has counseled ex-members of the Boston movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Bauer of Bowie, Md., a leader of the loose-knit ex-member movement, said 
church members are taught "we are the only saved people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of jargon has a way of inspiring the Oliver North-type rogue 
treatment of people that really hurts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members say they are being criticized for trying to live under the 
strict guidance of the Bible -- something considered unusual in a secular 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the Bible is the solution, the only solution, and that is a 
radical stance," said Gordon Ferguson, 51, a church elder. 
</P>
<P>
 They reject accusations that they target the downtrodden and note that many 
members are, like Mak, well educated and popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members are professionals. For example, a Boston-based evangelist, Doug 
Webber, is a Yale-educated physician who gave up his practice to work for the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they don't try to control members' lives but offer suggestions, as a 
parent would. Members often turn to church leaders for advice, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 Members don't deceive -- or at least they are told not to, Webber said. And 
they take proselytizing seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important stuff. This is a life-changing thing. This has an impact on 
eternity," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church says its good work is often ignored. Last year, its charitable arm, 
Hope Boston, donated $100,000 for AIDS research at Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 There are disgruntled ex-members, they say, but many others have seen their 
lives improve through the church. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Bible-oriented teachings, the Boston Church is similar to the 
mainstream Churches of Christ. But while the mainstream churches comprise 
18,000 independent congregations, the 163 churches of the Boston movement are 
linked under what is sometimes called the International Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Church was formed in 1979 when McKean, an evangelist from Florida, 
took over the mainstream, 30-member Lexington Church of Christ. By teaching 
disciples, and sending them out to find more disciples, McKean and his 
followers were able to expand into a congregation encompassing the whole Boston 
area. Services were held in the Boston Garden. Members began starting new 
churches across the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Britnell, a mainstream Church of Christ minister in Athens, Ala., said 
there are a lot of similitaries in the teachings of the mainstream churches and 
those of the Boston church. But "one of the things we disagree with them on is 
their effort in gaining converts and controlling them." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't deviate from old-line Church of Christ teachings. It's just they 
have become high-pressure evangelists," said J. Gordon Melton, director of the 
Institute for the Study of American Religion in Santa Barbara, Calif. "They 
work the streets. They understand young adults are the best targets. That's why 
they're growing." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent service at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel, most of the more than 200 
participants were young. 
</P>
<P>
 The service was a cross between a Bible study and an old-time revival. Members 
sang, discussed biblical passages and stood and described how they've been 
helped by God's power. The service leader encouraged them to invite people to 
church and to contribute money to spread the church overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say membership is leveling off nationally and, amid reports depicting 
the church as a cult, the church is losing members as quickly as it recruits 
them. Bauer said members had stayed in the church an average 4.3 years in 1991. 
Now the average membership lasts 2.8 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally, the church is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could describe it as a church dedicated to church growth," said the Rev. 
Jerry Handspicker, professor of pastoral theology and evangelism at the 
Andover-Newton Theological School. "They want to be large. They want to make 
converts. They want to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
 Handspicker's interest in the church is more than academic. His 33-year-old 
son, Nathan, was a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Handspicker said that he didn't like the church, but that he didn't try to 
interfere with his son's membership. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw some good from the church: His son enjoyed Bible studies and the 
camaraderie. But Handspicker also saw the church as authoritarian and 
demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, Nathan quit without prodding. 
</P>
<P>
 Handspicker explained, "He started thinking, I don't think the God I know in 
Jesus wants me to do this."

 Canada may impose driving bans on people convicted of buying sex with 
prostitutes in their cars, Justice Minister Allan Rock says. 
</P>
<P>
 The government wants a major crackdown on street prostitution with tougher 
curbs against both prostitutes and their clients, Rock told the Southam News. 
</P>
<P>
 Other measures being considered include increasing penalties for two-time 
offenders and mandatory prison sentences of at least five years for pimps 
living off the earnings of juvenile prostitutes.

DISPUTE OVER CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE IS BURIED IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL; 
RELIGION: CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS LOBBIED FOR PARENTS' RIGHT NOT TO PUT THEIR 
CHILDREN UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Working quietly through two sympathetic congressmen and outmaneuvering 
children's advocates, the Christian Science church is about to gain important 
ground in Congress in an emotional fight over medical care for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit of their effort is a single paragraph buried deep within the year's 
biggest spending bill. It would block the Department of Health and Human 
Services from doing what it's done for years: Pressuring states either to 
require parents to provide medical care for their children despite religious 
objections, or oblige local authorities to supply such treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Scientists, like members of some smaller religions, believe in 
attending to illness with prayer, not medical treatment. They have been under 
fire from some doctors, prosecutors and former Christian Scientists after 
several well-publicized cases in which children of some church members died 
from diseases that could have been cured with medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe the Constitution allows legislators to single out one class 
of children and say they don't have the same rights to medical care other 
children do," said Rita Swan of Sioux City, Iowa, who left the Christian 
Science church after her 16-month-old son died of meningitis. She works against 
religious exemptions from providing care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not fanatics who only care about putting our children into heaven, not 
caring if they die," countered Phil Davis, who lobbies for the church in 
Washington. "We think we've done a pretty good job with children." 
</P>
<P>
 Swan says at least 165 children have died since 1975 after medical care was 
withheld on religious grounds. Davis says the figure is "a handful," and says 
many other youngsters have died under doctors' treatment during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision is the latest controversial pronouncement inserted into one of 
Congress' 13 annual appropriations bills, which finance federal agencies. Over 
the years, those measures have been used to halt smoking on airlines, make it 
harder for poor women to get abortions, and wind down the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 All but four states -- Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and South Dakota -- let 
parents withhold medical care for their children for religious reasons. 
(California law includes a religious exemption, but parents can be prosecuted 
if their child's health is endangered by withholding medical care.) The 
Department of Health and Human Services allows the religious exemption, but 
requires states to provide medical treatment for ailing children. 
</P>
<P>
 HHS considers Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana and the District of 
Columbia to lack the needed procedures for providing emergency care -- and 
could cut federal child abuse aid to those states if they fail to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight began late last year when Christian Scientist lobbyists out to block 
HHS decided to focus on the $250-billion appropriations bill financing HHS and 
the departments of Education, Labor and other agencies for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1974 federal anti-child abuse law up for renewal next year, a victory 
would stall HHS's enforcement efforts for one year and create momentum for a 
permanent change in the law in the church's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Church lobbyists in Washington and officials from their Boston headquarters 
began talking to members of the Appropriations panel. Committee members also 
began getting visits and telephone calls from Christian Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the people Davis spoke to was Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), a Christian 
Scientist who has opposed HHS's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been constricting the ability of thousands of individuals to practice 
their religion in good faith and good conscience," he said. "I offered to open 
some doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith helped Davis get an appointment with Rep. John Edward Porter (R-Ill.), 
the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that wrote 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt there was a serious question of religious rights being encroached 
upon," said Porter, who was reared as a Christian Scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter approached Rep. Neil Smith (D-Iowa), who chairs the Appropriations 
subcommittee. Smith agreed to put Porter's provision into his bill, barring HHS 
from requiring states to drop their religious exemptions or order medical care 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was interest in it, and I didn't see much harm in delaying things for 
one year and not getting all involved in a religious brawl," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 With little debate, Smith's subcommittee -- and then the full Appropriations 
Committee -- approved the spending bill, including the provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, opponents like Swan, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the 
National District Attorneys Assn. and even HHS itself realized the only way to 
defeat the provision would be a fight on the House floor, a battle they felt 
they would lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members (of Congress) see religious freedom and they want to go with 
religious freedom," said one lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 The House passed the overall bill in August with no mention of the provision. 
Instead, opponents turned to the Senate, which was just starting to write its 
version of the bill, in hopes of getting softer language. 
</P>
<P>
 They got it from Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), the liberal chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee that writes the spending bill. Harkin's 
provision would prevent HHS from denying child abuse aid to recalcitrant states 
for a year. The agency would retain its authority to otherwise persuade states 
to drop their religious exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the overall bill containing Harkin's language last month. 
When House-Senate bargainers meet to write compromise legislation, they are 
expected to accept the Senate language. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fight will be rejoined next year.

SILENT MAJORITY IS SUDDENLY SPEAKING UP BY PHONE, FAX, EVEN E-MAIL; DEMOCRACY: 
THE GOVERNMENT, CELEBRITIES, EVEN THE NEWS MEDIA ARE GETTING INTO THE ACT. BUT 
SKEPTICS QUESTION WHETHER ANYONE IS REALLY LISTENING.

 The silent majority is mute no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens are yakking to the government and the news media, implored to share 
their opinions by toll-free telephone, computer and fax. Across the land, 
people hear the powerful begging: Talk to me -- and talk and talk and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in June, CNN watchers catching the latest on the O. J. Simpson drama 
heard the news reader break her usual solemn demeanor and graciously say, 
"We're taking your calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Not content with its own Postal Service, the Clinton White House has rolled 
out an electronic red carpet, piling e-mail on top of what many now call "snail 
mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bouza, Minneapolis' former police chief, is running for governor as an 
"interactive candidate." Dial 1-800-HEY-TONY and hear his views, then tell him 
yours. 
</P>
<P>
 And turning to page 3 of the New York Daily News, readers recently saw a plea 
to decide by telephone poll: "Should Chelsea Be Allowed to Go to Woodstock?" 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities are crawling all over the on-line grapevine. Any day, the likes of 
Mick Jagger and Mel Gibson, Erica Jong and Joan Jett and Jamie Lee Curtis are 
participating in conversations with people they never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to describe this trend, James Love used the analogy of a microphone at 
a town meeting. Said Love, who uses e-mail for grass-roots organizing as head 
of economic studies for a Ralph Nader organization called the Center for Study 
of Responsive Law: "Technology is adding more microphones, lots more 
microphones, where people can talk about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, elected officials and the news media seemed high and mighty, 
hard to reach without connections and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from a letter to the editor, a note to the White House or City Hall or, 
for the really riled, a public protest, there were few ways to talk back beyond 
the bar stool, kitchen table or office water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new technology, people are crashing old boundaries between the hoi 
polloi and the powers that be. 
</P>
<P>
 Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Does it make a difference? Is this a 20th-Century Tower of Babel raised to a 
keyboard-clattering, telephone-jangling roar of nonsense? 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics say, at best, it releases tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is symbolic democracy," said Ray Suarez, host of National Public 
Radio's daily call-in program "Talk of the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "This form of radio satisfies something deep in people who are, at all levels 
of society, feeling more cut off from government," Suarez said. Americans these 
days, he said, feel "that government is a remote, self-perpetuating institution 
that goes on without them, without asking them. This form of radio lets off 
some of the steam." 
</P>
<P>
 At worst, this more voluble America distracts people from real action, others 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "One has to wonder," said Robert Unmacht at The M Street Journal, a weekly 
newsletter for the radio trade, "if people had been able to call the king 
(Britain's King George III) and say, 'This damn tax, it's a really nasty unfair 
thing,' if they would have called off the revolution. Once you've blown off 
steam, you don't quite have . . . to go further." 
</P>
<P>
 Holding forth on current events is a national pastime as venerable as the 
cracker barrel and front porch. It was modernized by Phil Donahue, credited 
with enlarging the dialogue the day he leaped into the audience of his barely 
new "The Phil Donahue Show" and let a woman ask his guest a question. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio audience itself arrived by serendipity; it was an afterthought, 
compensation for people who had come to see another TV show that had been 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1967, the same year the toll-free 800 number was first available 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the remarkable presidential campaign of 1992 that enlarged the 
conversation by pulling even the presidency down to street level. 
</P>
<P>
 While his opponents flew from primary to primary, independent billionaire Ross 
Perot popped up on "Donahue," "Larry King Live" and C-SPAN. Soon, Bill Clinton 
was taking your calls on "Today." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of being manipulated," Clinton said then of his freedom from 
the press. George Bush tried to buck the trend, and lost. Town meetings were 
redefined; television became the village. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the computer-equipped can reach Clinton at "presidentwhitehouse.gov." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Gordon, a 37-year-old manager of word processing and graphics at a San 
Francisco construction management firm, sends four or five e-mail letters every 
month to the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton or members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "You send two sentences, that say, 'I think this and this,' or, 'I support 
that,' and kaboom, it's a count." 
</P>
<P>
 She dispatches her letters at work, a task that takes two or three minutes, 
tops. "I feel better," she said. "I feel like a better informed voter. I feel 
more a part of what's going on, versus someone who's standing back and 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only in Washington that folks are hip to e-mail. So is the mayor of 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both politicians and the public are desperately searching for ways to 
overcome . . . a tremendous gap in communication," said Mayor Roxanne Qualls. 
"Any politician worth his or her salt knows you do have mechanisms where you 
listen to people. Otherwise, you become extremely removed and out of touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy American-style has always counted on news organizations to carry 
messages back and forth but, until lately, it's largely been a one-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even these entities are getting into the act. U.S. News & World Report, 
the Army Times, the New York Times and television networks are among a growing 
number of news organizations soliciting critiques of their reporting from 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 William Allman, a senior writer who covers science for U.S. News, said 
entering an e-mail dialogue with readers has ousted him from the journalistic 
cloister. 
</P>
<P>
 "This connects you to the people who actually read your stuff," Allman said. 
"You find out American people are very skeptical. They question what you say. 
That has been very productive, as painful as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before e-mail, radio was turning up the volume of public opinion. But 
even that forum has expanded dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, the number of news and mostly talk radio stations has more than 
tripled, and call-in shows are as standard as the weather report. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer primarily the haunt of crazed insomniacs, talk radio and, 
increasingly, television, are heating up with an electrical storm of call-in 
programs attracting all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 All-talk radio began in 1960 at KABC in Los Angeles. By 1989, almost three 
decades later, just 319 radio stations followed the news and mostly talk 
format, according to Unmacht at The M Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, their numbers exceed 1,000, and virtually every one of the nearly 
12,000 radio stations in this country has some talk programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Even TV has gotten into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 You can e-mail ABC and, on the air, the newsmagazine "Dateline NBC" urges 
viewers to comment on current events by fax, phone mail or the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the familiar Larry King and local variations of him are America's 
Talking, a cable channel owned by NBC, and such shows as "Direct Line" on 
National Empowerment Television, a conservative public affairs channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia, which produces the "Donahue" and "Rush Limbaugh" shows, this fall 
will inaugurate The Talk Channel, another all-talk cable TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Aug. 22, CNN began "TalkBack Live" a daily current events show in which 
the 150 audience members also are the guests. Cameras and microphones are 
posted at shopping malls to take remote commentary, and viewers also 
participate by fax and e-mail that is read on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight and lure of the show is a mystery guest with the power to act on 
the subject in question who steps forward for the show's final 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 All this speaking up is a sign of democracy in transition, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been taught that we're really bad people in the citizenship department, 
that we're shallow, stupid, that we're couch potatoes," said James Love, the 
electronic grass-roots organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made people really think about what the real opportunities are. As a 
result of this, there's an interest in redefining how you make a democracy 
actually work."

INFANTS' BRAIN WAVES MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL LEARNING DISORDER, PSYCHOLOGIST

 Parents who count their newborn's fingers and toes soon might be checking 
something else: the baby's brain waves. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern Illinois University psychologist says that after nearly 20 years of 
research, it appears an infant's brain waves can reveal whether the child has a 
learning disorder. That could be good news for about 700,000 infants born 
annually who are at risk of developing learning problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is if we can identify these kids at birth, we can start intervening 
shortly after, eight or nine years earlier than it otherwise would be," said 
Dennis Molfese, who has been directing the study with his wife, Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the case, then we can get sort of a running start on not only 
teaching the kids strategies to circumvent the disability, but perhaps even to 
do away with the disability altogether," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lofty ambitions didn't concern 5-year-old Robert Jones, his sandy-blond 
hair covered with electrodes. He sat still recently while listening to 
computer-generated beeps and boops, seeming more intrigued by a picture book 
before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a preemie baby and he's been involved in it since then," said his 
mother, Margaret Jones. "He enjoys it. This year, he just wanted to do it, so I 
let him." 
</P>
<P>
 The research began in 1977 with 32 babies who were tracked for four years, 
including the Molfeses' own son, David. The infants were monitored while 
listening to noises. The premise is that their brain waves show how well they 
can discriminate between speech sounds, which is a key step to learning 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, armed with $1 million in grants from the National Institutes of 
Health, the Molfeses have been following 400 newborns. They are finding that 
standardized tests have confirmed their predictions in 100% of those tested 
between birth and 3 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain wave of a baby who may be learning disabled shows a large trough in 
areas that are shallower in infants with average or superior capabilities. And 
it all happens in the blink of an eye: A brain wave lasts only about 
seven-tenths of a second and packs a punch of 5- to 10-millionths of a volt. 
</P>
<P>
 Molfese said the test also reveals children who may have larger vocabularies, 
understand directions and complex sentences better and have an advantage at 
mathematics and puzzle solving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the most important cutting-edge research in predicting language 
or learning problems in newborns," said Virginia Berninger, a psychologist 
specializing in early reading disabilities at the University of Washington in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 William Greenough, a University of Illinois psychologist studying the effect 
of the environment on brain development, was more sparing with his praise but 
said Molfese's work appeared significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly seems like it would be a reasonable thing to do," Greenough 
said. "It sounds like a fairly major breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 A baby with dipping brain waves isn't condemned to academic mediocrity, 
Molfese said. Environment and family also play a major role in a child's 
intellectual development, and remedies such as special reading programs are 
available, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Early intervention will be the next phase of Molfese's research. He said 
children with learning disabilities usually aren't detected until the third 
grade, and then it might be too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm a firm believer that you can intervene and change things," 
Molfese said. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes when his study is finished in 1 1/2 years to persuade doctors to use 
his test to screen newborns.

FBI SURVEILLANCE OF I. F STONE PROVED ONE THING: AGENTS COULDN'T SPELL; 
GOVERNMENT: NEWLY RELEASED FILES SHOW AGENCY'S EFFORTS TO DETERMINE IF GADFLY 
JOURNALIST WAS COMMUNIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE FEINSILBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 30 years, from the Depression through the McCarthy era, the Korean War, 
the Vietnam War and most of the Cold War, the FBI kept tabs on I.F. Stone, the 
gadfly journalist. But not without difficulty. Even getting his name right was 
a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts were fairly straightforward: He was Isidor Feinstein when he was 
born in 1907 and had his name legally changed in 1938 to Isidor Feinstein 
Stone. He wrote under the name I.F. Stone. He was called Izzy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the FBI's records he was "Isadore Finklestein Stone." He was "Isidor 
Feinsteine." He was "Isadore Finglestein Stone." He was "Irving F. Stone." He 
was "I.M. Stone." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's file on Stone, a 4 1/4-inch, 1,794-page stack, was recently released 
under the Freedom of Information Act. Much information is blacked out and 332 
pages were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 The file reveals as much about bureau operations in those days as about Stone. 
And it shows how tedious and confusing it was to document the thoughts of a 
maverick who for six decades offered opinions on everything political. 
</P>
<P>
 America's best-known leftist journalist was hard to pigeonhole. He called 
himself a socialist. Was he a card-carrying Communist? Then why was he always 
stepping on the party line? 
</P>
<P>
 "What have we on him?," asked Director J. Edgar Hoover on July 29, 1941. And: 
"What is his name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stone left no doubt what he thought of Hoover. "The great sacred cow," he said 
in a speech, "the big Dick Tracy of our society, the immortalized secret police 
chief, the center of one of the biggest publicity build-ups in American 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone wrote thousands of articles in liberal papers, including PM, the New 
York Post and the Compass, and, from 1953 to 1971, in his own newsletter, I.F. 
Stone's Weekly and I.F. Stone's Bi-Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 He traveled the country making speeches to leftist audiences. He signed 
petitions and ads and lent his name to letterheads. He denounced the House 
Committee on Un-American Activities and the Smith Act, requiring the 
registration of foreigners, and the McCarran Act, requiring Communists to 
register as foreign agents. 
</P>
<P>
 On a passport application he refused, "as a matter of principle," to say 
whether he was then or ever had been a Communist. Late in life, he described 
himself as a "New Lefty before there was a New Left." He died in 1989 at age 
81. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a June 10, 1955, memo to Hoover, a single informant, his identity 
blacked out, tagged Stone as a member of the Communist Party. He said Stone 
belonged to the party from the mid-1930s until as late as 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Another informant said Stone "was certainly not a CP member" and had nothing 
in common with the party's "slavish attitude" toward Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, 1949, the files noted, Stone told 2,500 people at a "Caucus for 
Peace" rally in New York that he was "one of those damn Reds and had his red 
woolen underwear on." Two years later, the file said that Stone "has openly 
admitted being a 'Red.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, William C. Bullitt, the former U.S. ambassador to France, said Stone 
"served the interests of the Soviets more completely than anyone he had known" 
and deserved close scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone must have known he was being watched. Sometimes he began his speeches: 
"Fellow Communists and FBI agents . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping track of Stone must have been humdrum. FBI records described him as a 
"notoriously sloppy dresser, hair never combed." 
</P>
<P>
 Checking his outgoing mail, agents found he had written a letter to the 
Sonotone Corp. in Elmford, N.Y., maker of hearing aids. "It will be noted that 
Stone uses a hearing aid," the FBI file said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 11, 1953, the files recorded, Stone arrived in Chicago via American 
Airlines Flight 255. He carried a brown briefcase. He took the bus to the Loop. 
He tried to get a room at the Palmer House, but it was full. He "proceeded to 
the Hamilton Hotel . . . where he registered at 3:50 p.m." He was assigned to 
Room 603. He made 22 local phone calls and one long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day he spoke at a banquet of the National Conference to Repeal the 
Walter-McCarran Law and Defend Its Victims. 
</P>
<P>
 His less-than-revolutionary message, according to an FBI informant: "Stone 
thought the United States was a wonderful country in which to live and that it 
provided more opportunities for the foreign born than their ancestors had ever 
experienced, in spite of certain laws such as the Smith Act and the 
Walter-McCarran Law." 
</P>
<P>
 If the bureau couldn't decide what to make of Stone, neither could the 
Communists. They portrayed executed spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as 
innocent martyrs. Stone thought they were guilty, but not deserving of the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communists said South Korea had started the Korean War. "I am sorry to say 
that the South Koreans had to defend themselves from aggression," Stone told a 
rally, the files noted. His speech was not well received. 
</P>
<P>
 One informant told the bureau that Stone "at times does, and at times does 
not, agree with the CP line." Another said Stone only "pretended to be a 
critic" of the Communists. A third said "his total disrespect for people in the 
national scene is remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, after a visit to the Soviet Union, Stone was "highly critical of the 
present Soviet system," the FBI recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, he described President Dwight D. Eisenhower as one who "sincerely 
wants peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, at Amherst College, Stone "told the graduates to have faith 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he even praised the FBI's work investigating the 1970 Kent State 
shootings, when National Guardsmen fired into an anti-war rally at the Ohio 
university, killing four students. 
</P>
<P>
 The files recorded a speech Stone made in 1971 at a rally in Washington: 
"Stone spoke out in favor of President Nixon's wage and price freeze." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the final entry.

ORPHANAGE IS REBORN AS HAVEN FOR THE VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE; MISSOURI: DRUMM 
FARM WAS SHUT FOR STRAYING FAR FROM ITS PURPOSE. IT WAS REOPENED WITH A RENEWED 
COMMITMENT.

<P>
 Peter doesn't say much. When he does, his voice is so quiet the listener must 
strain to make out his words. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's easy to detect that life is looking up for Peter. At 15, he had come 
halfway across the country to escape an abusive home life on the East Coast. He 
seems at last to have found stability here at the Andrew Drumm Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they moved me out here right after Thanksgiving, I was real happy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter -- not his real name -- is one of six new arrivals at the institute, a 
boys' home with a long history that only recently reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute is better known locally as Drumm Farm. It was founded in 1929 as 
a boys' orphanage by a rancher, Andrew Drumm, on about 320 rolling acres 
outside this Kansas City suburb. Among its alumni -- and present-day 
cheerleaders -- is Richard Rhodes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The 
Making of the Atomic Bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, trustees contracted to care for children with medical or 
behavioral problems. After about 10 years the board of directors decided the 
institute had strayed too far from its founder's intent, closed it, and 
reopened about a year ago with a renewed commitment to its original mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think historically we know what was right with this place," said director 
Rufus Little, the man chosen to lead Drumm's rebirth. "They provided a lot of 
structure, a lot of activity, a lot of security and a healthy kind of lifestyle 
for the kids who lived here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place really played the role of a good family for kids. That's what 
we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys attend public schools in Independence or Kansas City. They come home 
to a collection of red-brick buildings that range in age from the historic 
Drumm home, built in 1888, to a dining hall built in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 A young, recently married couple serves as live-in house parents, helping with 
homework, discussing the boys' problems, calling doctors when needed and 
generally doing everything parents do. The boys do household chores and earn 
allowance money. 
</P>
<P>
 The program appears to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter, for example, first moved to Kansas City with a foster family. When the 
family no longer was able to keep him, a state caseworker contacted Drumm Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he really needed was stability, a good place he could count on being for 
a long time without the threat of being moved," Little said. "They brought him 
out here, and we liked him immediately. He's got real potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting into the Drumm program isn't easy. Most boys are referred by the 
courts or the Missouri Division of Family Services. But few are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is interviewed and screened through psychological evaluations to make 
sure they are a "right fit," in Little's words, "kids who can do well in public 
school, kids who don't have serious emotional or psychological problems, kids 
who have some enthusiasm for making something out of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the applicants, he said, need more or different services than Drumm 
can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "That bothers me a little bit," he said. "But I think we have to know what our 
limitations are. And, frankly, there's nobody out there providing the kind of 
services we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Little wants the institute eventually to accommodate about 20 residents evenly 
divided between boys and girls. That will require expensive renovation of a 
pair of dormitories that are a half-century old. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, much of Little's time is spent raising money. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute has a $4.5-million endowment but may spend only its investment 
income, a tight budget when insurance alone is $30,000 a year. Additionally, 
most of the residents need counseling, also expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more money to keep this place running," Little said, let alone 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Drumm Farm was a working farm and its acreage supported the 
institute. That is no longer practical, Little said, though the board is 
considering operating a nursery or a sod farm. Board members aren't interested 
in selling or developing the land, Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens has to be compatible with our mission here," he said. "We 
want to do something that produces income and provides some kind of experience 
for kids being educated here." 
</P>
<P>
 Little came to Drumm a year ago from Choate-Rosemary Hall, a Connecticut prep 
school for wealthy youngsters. He's spent his first year at the farm 
"developing partnerships." 
</P>
<P>
 He arranged for an alternative school at the institute with 75 students from 
the local school district taking classes there. And Evangelical Children's Home 
runs a transitional living program for youths 16 to 21; eight of those young 
people are in another Drumm Farm building. He's also cultivating cooperative 
programs with the YMCA and the local Little League to give Drumm's kids access 
to those childhood activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kinds of things I think make a lot of sense for the needs of 
the community today, and certainly make a lot of sense for us financially," 
Little said.

PROTESTERS AGAINST NUDITY PLAYING 'SHOW AND TELL' IN EAST TEXAS TOWN; FEUD: THE 
MORALITY OF SEX-ORIENTED BUSINESSES IS UNDER SCRUTINY IN LONGVIEW. SOME BARS 
NOW ADVERTISE "FULLY CLOTHED" WAITERS.

<P>
 The proliferation of sex-oriented businesses in this Bible Belt town has 
protesters photographing patrons and local bars advertising "fully clothed" 
waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to regular topless bars, Longview has all-nude, 
bring-your-own-booze joints and the East Texas Chicken Ranch, a nude steakhouse 
named after the inspiration for the Broadway hit "The Best Little Whorehouse in 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of this oil-rich town surrounded by pine trees don't want that 
link to fame, or anything else the nude spots might bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need this. Longview is becoming a big joke. Do we want to be known 
as the best nudity place in Texas?" said Evelyn Scott, a member of Citizens 
Against Pornography in Texas, or CAP-IT. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the group began regularly photographing and videotaping customers 
going in and out of the nude spots and writing down license numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters also record when the customers go in, who they are with and their 
vehicle descriptions, said Bruce Edge, a CAP-IT spokesman. They haven't yet 
done anything with the information, but are considering taking out newspaper 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow it to continue, it would mean more of them and a total moral 
decay of the community," said Edge, a candy store owner. 
</P>
<P>
 CAP-IT has had some success: An all-nude strip club and a nude tanning salon 
closed in July. 
</P>
<P>
 And some bars have been trying to attract customers by advertising "fully 
clothed waiters" and "fully clothed dart tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
 But disc jockey David McBride thinks protesters have crossed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen such petty, low-class tactics as here in East Texas," he 
said. "I've never seen people so self-righteous in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way someone can be offended by an establishment like this in 
Longview is to pay a cover charge and come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 10 years ago there wasn't a stripper to be found here. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theorize Longview's prime location contributed to the increase in nude 
establishments. It's the only town of its size -- 70,000 people -- on the 
highway between Dallas and Shreveport, La., where casino gambling was recently 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they're going for. You get your gambling in Shreveport, but on 
your way back you get your sexual interests fulfilled," said Paul Anderson, 
minister of the North Side Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg County also has liquor sales, unlike the surrounding dry counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there are about a dozen nude establishments in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission can only regulate businesses with 
licensed liquor sales, and state law doesn't allow totally nude clubs to have 
liquor licenses. So in Longview it's bring your own. 
</P>
<P>
 Longview and other Gregg County towns recently passed ordinances and 
regulations requiring fees and restrictive zoning for nude clubs. Some 
establishments have sued. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is going to try and push me out of town, I am not going to go for 
it. I am here for the long haul," Chicken Ranch owner Andy Anderson told the 
Longview News-Journal after filing suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should have better things to worry about. There has been everything 
from whorehouses to gambling casinos to you name it up and down East Texas 
since God knows when," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CAP-IT has received some civil liberties complaints about its tactics, but 
"that same law that protects them, protects me," Edge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge said CAP-IT only wants to make the community a better place. But the town 
remains divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been humorless in Longview lately," Mayor I. J. Patterson lamented. "I 
can't even afford to have a flat tire in front of that Chicken Ranch."

HIROSHIMA SURVIVOR AND NUCLEAR SCIENTIST TEAM UP; TECHNOLOGY: THE TWO MEN ARE 
JOINING FORCES TO PAVE THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY. THEY HAVE CREATED A DEVICE TO 
HELP THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED GET AROUND. BUT FUNDING IS A PROBLEM.

 At age 7, Thomas Takashi Tanemori emerged from the ashes of Hiroshima to begin 
life as an orphan. 
</P>
<P>
 As an angry young man of 18, he immigrated to the United States, fired by 
dreams of prosperity -- and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 56, almost blind from a deteriorating eye condition, Tanemori has a new 
goal -- developing a device to help the visually impaired get around. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner? 
</P>
<P>
 A scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the nation's 
premier Cold War nuclear weapons designers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as though I have made a full circle," said Tanemori. "Once they were 
the enemy, in a sense . . . but now we are working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Moore, the scientist working with Tanemori, is equally impressed by the 
twisting currents that have shaped Tanemori's journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you miss that irony? I just sort of get amazed at the serendipity," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Tanemori's early involvement with U.S. forces began in August, 
1945, with the detonation of the atomic bombs that helped bring World War II to 
a close in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers a brilliant flash, then being dug out of the rubble of his 
elementary school by a passing soldier. Miraculously, he was reunited with his 
father on the banks of a river teeming with the dead and injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reunion was brief. His father wasted away from radiation poisoning 
over the next 40 days. Tanemori himself was near death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was seven-tenths of a mile from the (blast)," he said. "I was considered 
dead, and as a matter of fact they already made a cremation box. But I 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later he came to California, bent on somehow making Americans feel the 
"pain, loneliness, anger, as I have done." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he hoped to make a fortune in the land of "money trees and 
streets paved with gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he ended up at a migrant camp, where he fell ill and was shuttled 
from hospital to hospital by doctors who thought he had radiation poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he had food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Tanemori's fortunes looked up. He was taken in by a San Francisco 
family who encouraged him to go to college. It was an education he put to 
diverse uses, working at various times as a schoolteacher, Baptist minister and 
cultural consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way his anger at the United States evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, he became a U.S. citizen, one of his proudest accomplishments. In 
1987 he discovered he had retinitis pigmentosa, which has all but robbed him of 
his sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an inherited condition, but no one else in his family had it, said 
Tanemori. He suspects the atomic blast may be to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years he struggled with "agony, soul-searching, anger, depression." 
But then came a day when he decided "going blind will not end my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He contacted his congressman, Rep. Bill Baker (R-Danville), and, through him, 
met Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Tanemori already had proposed a system to save blind people the 
indignity of stumbling down unfamiliar streets, a tape-recorded guide to cities 
similar to self-guided tours at many museums. Moore, the lab's deputy division 
leader for computers and communications engineering, refined it. His idea: 
Place electronic tags on objects such as a street corner, a sign or a bus. A 
device carried by the user would read and decipher the tags. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, "you might get instructional directions, like, 'The restrooms 
are 50 feet on the right.' You can get all manner of messages." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The devices could help the visually or hearing-impaired or "just people who 
get lost easily," he said. It could operate in different languages to aid 
tourists or be coded with information emergency teams need. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore estimates he could have a prototype available for field tests in less 
than a year. But funding is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come to the conclusion that this is not a technological issue," Moore 
explained. "It is finding a sufficient number of applications and the political 
will to go in and solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who works on the project mostly in his spare time, is devising 
strategies to find the approximately $3 million to $5 million it will take to 
pay for a three- to five-year development program. 
</P>
<P>
 His is not the only entry in the smart environment field. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, more than 90 "Talking Signs," were recently demonstrated in 
the Powell Street Bay Area Rapid Transit station. 
</P>
<P>
 Those signs, developed by the Smith-Kettlewell Institute for the Blind, work 
by beaming signals in infrared light that trigger voice messages on a hand-held 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moore hopes to coordinate with other researchers. He points out that the lab 
has experience working in partnership with companies who otherwise are fierce 
competitors and could help set standards for the burgeoning industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanemori, meanwhile, eagerly awaits the next chapter in an eventful life. 
"This is a great new beginning," he said.

DENTIST GIVES UP PRIVATE PRACTICE TO HELP THE POOR; COLORADO: MORE THAN 90% OF 
CHARLES BELTING'S PATIENTS ARE AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL, AND HE IS THE 
ONLY DENTIST FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES. HE WORKS 10- AND 11-HOUR DAYS, BUT HE LOVES 
IT. "IT'S A GIVING-BACK CONCEPT, A SPIRITUAL PATH," SAYS THE DOCTOR. "IT 
INVOLVES GOD." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Colorado's San Luis Valley, an area roughly the size of Massachusetts, 
migrant workers and other poor people have only one person to turn to when they 
get a toothache. 
</P>
<P>
 He's Dr. Charles Belting, the staff dentist at Valley-Wide Health Services in 
this village on the north end of the valley, the only rural public health 
clinic in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach another public health clinic, Belting's patients would have to travel 
150 miles to the east to Pueblo, about 200 miles to the west to the 
Montrose-Delta area or about 100 miles to the south to Questa, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "North? Well, there just aren't any," Belting said. "They're all private up 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 There are only about a dozen other dentists -- all in private practice -- in 
the entire San Luis Valley, which covers 8,200 square miles and encompasses 
some of the poorest counties in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't enough of me," Belting said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belting typically works 10 to 11 hours a day. When he's not working in the 
clinic, he may be visiting migrant labor camps or lecturing students on good 
dental practices. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of his patients are at or below the poverty level and the rest, 
he said, are "patients who can pay a portion, or all, of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take at least three more dentists and a full-time hygienist to do 
the job adequately," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicago native who earned his DDS degree at Northwestern, Belting, 39, 
turned his back on private practice and its financial rewards seven years ago 
to move to the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd driven through here and was aware of the poverty," he said. "I wanted to 
help out and do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was in private practice in Arizona before taking the Valley-Wide job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the money," he conceded. "I believe I have the skills to be a really 
good dentist, but I want to share. It's a giving-back concept, a spiritual 
path. It involves God." 
</P>
<P>
 Belting's clinic runs on Medicaid funds and has a sliding scale for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, a visit to the dentist costs $5 to $10, but some patients "can't 
even pay their light bills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't pay, we don't make a big deal out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You find a lot of people, like the migrant workers, who feel an obligation to 
pay even as little as a dollar a week to work off a $5 fee," Belting explained. 
"They are so concerned about being honest, even with that small an amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Belting's practice generally is limited to pain relief, extractions and such. 
</P>
<P>
 He refers patients who need extensive dental work or oral surgery to clinics 
in Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is to prevent dental problems and take care of acute pain," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belting calls on dental students from the University of Colorado Dental School 
and the University of Texas for help, as well as retired dentists and the dozen 
or so private practitioners in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Belting concedes he sometimes thinks of the good life of private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a bad day, I'm tempted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm dedicated to helping people. I have enough to live on. I drive an old 
diesel pickup and I don't live in a fancy home," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 By his estimation, Belting earns about a third to a half what a dentist in 
private practice makes. However, as he put it: "I don't need $40,000 or $50,000 
to make me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 As a public health dentist, Belting's salary is paid by the clinic, which gets 
its money from federal community health center grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Belting recently received a $100,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson 
Community Health Leadership Program, the country's largest nonprofit group 
dedicated to bettering U.S. health care, to help continue his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belting was nominated for the grant by his boss, Marguerite Salazar, executive 
director of Valley-Wide Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of only 11 dentists receiving the award from among 300 nominees 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the grant, $5,000 was intended for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 He split it among his staff -- hygienist Ted Johnson and assistants Tony 
Velasquez and Rose Espinosa -- and "recycl(ed) it back into the clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money will go toward establishing another clinic in Alamosa, 
about 35 miles away, a more central location for a clinic in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would entail hiring another dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our patients have to travel from 30 to 90 miles one way to get here," 
Belting said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very inconvenient and most of them don't have very much money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belting would maintain the clinic in Center because the location "serves the 
migrant camps, some of whom have never seen a dentist for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of them, I'm the first dentist they've ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's never enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government wanted to solve uninsured health care, they should put more 
money into this system," Belting said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, community health centers will get some recognition in health care 
reform."

UCI CHANCELLOR'S VISION IS AMBITIOUS; BUT HER STATEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES FISCAL 
RESTRAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel Wilkening's anticipated vision statement for the 
university was ambitious for its stated goal of advancing the university's 
standing among research institutions, and it was appropriately restrained in 
its recognition of fiscal realities for higher education in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was little that was not already somewhere in the pipeline as a 
part of the university's thinking, it was important that Wilkening present her 
own cohesive and defining picture after coming on board last year. At that 
time, it already was clear that the university was going to have to operate in 
a fundamentally altered financial environment because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The passing of the torch from former Chancellor Jack Peltason, a consummate 
builder who now presides over the entire university system, was a benchmark. It 
marked not only the inauguration of a new chancellor in Irvine, but also the 
advent of a new era of operating within fiscal constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening has made the best of her listening skills, and she clearly has done 
her homework and refrained from making premature statements. Rightly, she 
wanted a chance to assess things for herself.  
</P>
<P>
 The university community naturally has been anxious about what a change at the 
top would mean, coming as it did on the same tide as the fiscal crisis. So if 
there wasn't a whole lot by way of new proposals, Wilkening's "vision thing" 
set parameters and reaffirmed direction. Without such a statement, the campus 
would have been left to wonder what had not been addressed. There still may be 
unanswered concerns for particular segments of the academic community, but at 
least there is a road map to consult. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening has challenged her faculty to further the research standing of the 
university through grants from government and the private sector. She hopes to 
move the campus into the ranks of the nation's top 50 research institutions by 
the year 2000, which is a worthy goal, and suddenly not that far off.  
</P>
<P>
 She properly sees the campus's youth as an asset in this regard, already 
capitalizing on a growing reputation and unencumbered by programs that might 
prove to be baggage for older universities, which cannot innovate as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Californians are especially concerned now about where their tax dollars 
go, it is good politics as well as good policy to meet the challenge of 
providing strong teaching on campus while this drive for research excellence 
moves forward. Moreover, with public attention to education growing, the 
chancellor was wise to agree with the academic planning council that the 
department of education should not be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity was a theme in the chancellor's inaugural speech in October, and it 
again turned up as a campus asset in the vision statement, as it should. The 
statement also gave further evidence of a meeting ground between the Orange 
County economy and the campus's unique potential, the attention given to 
biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick will be to pursue this wish list while advancing UCI as a 
well-rounded campus. The chancellor's vision presented few surprises, but she 
has presented a plausible and even reassuring picture in a time of fiscal 
uncertainty throughout the University of California system.

DRESSING FOR SUCCESS -- ON VOLUNTEER BASIS; UNIFORMS FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN IS A 
GOOD IDEA, SO LONG AS PARENTS MAKE THE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several years ago, it was an isolated experiment in Orange County. At Pio Pico 
Elementary School in central Santa Ana, parents were saying that school 
clothing was expensive and that the dress of their children might result in 
their being targeted as gang members. The alternative was a practical voluntary 
program for youngsters to come to school dressed in inexpensive uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Judith Magsaysay, looking back on the experience to date, offered 
this rationale as well: "I think the uniforms also offer a sense of purpose. 
The children understand they are dressed to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience and those reasons for supporting it have obviously proved 
convincing for others. As school started this year in Orange County, 
administrators were reporting that some 25% to 30% of children were showing up 
in uniforms, and about 50 elementary schools this year were trying out a 
voluntary shift to color-coded uniforms.  
</P>
<P>
 The cost of school clothing, the concern about unintended gang association, 
and the seriousness of purpose that may go along with uniforms all have 
contributed to a receptive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 These reasons for permitting uniforms are compelling. But in public schools it 
is important that these opportunities not be considered a requirement. Let 
parents and youngsters, not school administrators, be the ones to decide that 
it is worth going with the experiment.  
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, like the new Woods Canyon School in Aliso Viejo, the 
administration reports that 65% of pupils are wearing them. It is interesting 
to see the phenomenon catch on at a new school, not just in the older and more 
developed parts of the county.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly this is an indication of the appeal of the idea that goes across a 
spectrum of locations and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing uniforms for public school students is a good idea, provided that 
they are not made a requirement.

BOLSA CHICA INLET MUST BE RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "Middle Ground is Best for Bolsa Chica" (Sept. 4) certainly 
hit the mark with regards to some of the issues surrounding Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing numbers initially proposed by The Koll Co. have always been 
interpreted by the Amigos as a beginning point from which the true bargaining 
on the eventual unit count at Bolsa Chica would begin. And yes, short of a land 
exchange, some development at Bolsa Chica seems inevitable. However, we feel 
that the possibility of the restoration of the natural tidal inlet at Bolsa 
Chica must not be discarded due to lowering the housing numbers. Restoration 
with a tidal inlet must be continued to be examined and given full 
consideration for a number of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a wetlands restoration plan that includes a tidal inlet is generally 
recognized by wetlands experts as being biologically superior to any other 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, in order to effectuate the plan advanced by the county, the largest 
and most valuable feeding area in the currently existing wetlands will be 
destroyed. In essence, in order to restore wetlands, and make the new proposal 
work, a significant area of working wetlands will be dredged and lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, in order to build and maintain the mechanism that will irrigate the 
county's proposed restoration plan, millions of dollars in significant building 
and maintenance costs will be incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, due to the potential for increased tidal flows in Huntington Harbour, 
the county could incur significant liability risks that do not currently exist. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these problems will occur if a tidal inlet is returned to the Bolsa 
Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 It is crucial that the current plan be centered around restoring the natural 
tidal inlet at Bolsa Chica, and that the county include this option in all 
plans for Bolsa Chica.

SANTA ANA GRAPPLES WITH HOMELESSNESS; FORGING A COMMON FRONT WITH OTHER CITIES 
OFFERS MORE HOPE THAN CAMPING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana is fighting a battle against the problems of the homeless on two 
fronts. One has potential hazards; the other holds promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago the city passed initial judicial muster for its law banning 
camping at the Civic Center. That law substituted for an earlier measure to ban 
camping anywhere in the city, which a state appeals court struck down. The 
state Supreme Court still could uphold that previous law, but it would be 
unfortunate if it does. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the more limited measure that was upheld by a Superior Court judge holds 
the danger of becoming a tool to harass the homeless and perhaps spur a 
campaign to drive them out of the city altogether. The city attorney said that 
was not the intent; Santa Ana merely wants to stop the camps that pop up around 
the Civic Center, with its numerous city and county buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt the shopping carts, cardboard lean-tos and black plastic 
bags filled with belongings can be ugly. There is no doubt that passersby are 
annoyed and sometimes frightened by the homeless. There is no doubt that 
garbage occasionally found around the tents can be a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 But pushing the homeless elsewhere is not a solution; then they just become 
some other city's problem. Instead, other cities should help Santa Ana. Here is 
where Santa Ana's other initiative holds promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The city provided the countywide Homeless Issues Task Force with a grant to 
investigate a countywide approach to the problem of the homeless. One good 
suggestion was to have each city put money, perhaps $1 per resident, into a 
fund that would provide a variety of programs for the homeless. The county 
would also help finance the programs, which could include more beds in shelters 
and expanded mental health and substance abuse programs. Churches and temples 
have been asked to provide assistance and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of cities are investigating whether state law allows them to 
contribute to the fund. If they can, they should. If not, they should explore 
other ways to help, perhaps by opening their own shelters or expanding programs 
to help the homeless inside their own cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness is a regional problem that demands a regional solution. There are 
an estimated 12,000 homeless in Orange County. The number of beds in shelters 
is approximately 900. Santa Ana has not solved the homeless problem within its 
borders, but its attempts to do so deserve assistance from other cities.

CARGO FLIGHTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LAND AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Here we go again! Good old Newport Beach NIMBY. United Parcel and Federal 
Express want to run one flight each out of 73 a day and you hear the whining 
and throwing of big money to lawyers to make a big deal out of a very minor 
matter ("Law Firms Enter Cargo Flight Fight," Sept. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 Why not find some way to start to shift the entire thing onto the backs of the 
people in the El Toro base area? We have a good idea who is behind this. The 
fine hands and money of (George) Argyros and Buck Johns smell all the way to 
our area. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge a massive "no" vote on Initiative A in November to force these fat cats 
back into their lair for good. 
</P>
<P>
 AARON SPEVAK

<P>
 * I would like to comment on two stories from Sept. 16.  
</P>
<P>
 The first concerns allowing cargo flights at John Wayne Airport. Does the 
county accept any federal, state or local money to help operate the airport? If 
so, it appears that the constitutionality of the 1985 agreement restricting 
flights is in question. UPS, Fed-Ex and all the other cargo carriers are, in 
the long run, regulated by the federal government -- the same government that 
keeps track of passenger carriers as well.  
</P>
<P>
 If the county is accepting any public money at all, then a review of the 
agreement seems to be in order. How can it be fair to single out a UPS, or a 
Fed-Ex, just because they are not carrying people? Those who might needlessly 
worry about any noise must consider the fact that the aircraft that would be 
used by the two cargo carriers are among the quieter of the jets that use the 
airport every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The second story concerns the county's route allocation plan. It's nice to 
have an airport staff that is willing to change with the times by allowing some 
slight modifications to the way that departure slots are allocated to the 
airlines. This definitely would help increase competition between carriers and 
help keep fares down.  
</P>
<P>
 There are those who say there is little room for growth at the airport . All 
one needs to do is look south of Gate 1A. There is room for seven to eight more 
gates where the old terminal used to be.  
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport is one of the county's biggest assets. It's a shame to see 
it underutilized because of a few who, years ago, forced the county into a few 
agreements which are by today's standards outdated. Oh well . . . I guess there 
is always El Toro!

UNDERGRADS IMPORTANT AT CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * (UC Irvine) Chancellor Laurel Wilkening's plan to position UCI among the top 
50 research universities in the United States is certainly ambitious and may 
indeed lead to significant economic benefits for Orange County. At the same 
time, it is a plan that likely will lower the quality of undergraduate 
education at UCI.Larger classes and less emphasis on the quality of 
undergraduate teaching are the sure consequences of such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there is an attractive alternative for students who are seeking a 
quality undergraduate education at reasonable cost. Undergraduate education is 
the primary mission at Orange County's other public university -- Cal State 
Fullerton. Here teaching and learning are valued as highly as scholarly and 
creative pursuits. In most cases our classes are smaller than at the UC 
campuses, and they are more likely to be taught by a full-time faculty member 
than a graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
 While our research efforts are not as extensive nor as well known as those of 
our colleagues at UCI, they are, nonetheless, quite respectable. Most 
important, they provide numerous opportunities for participation by 
undergraduates -- something that is less common at the research universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective and current students who want to learn in an environment where 
undergraduate education is genuinely important should take a close look at 
CSUF. It remains one of the best values in higher education.

STATE SHOULD ACT ON SCHOOL CHILD CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Accolades to Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) for considering to 
co-author a bill representing 200-plus parents in South County ("YMCA 
After-School Program Comes Up Short," Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Two days prior to the opening day of school, parents were informed by the YMCA 
that it could not accommodate their children in after-school day-care programs 
throughout South County.The reason given was that the state, with preschool 
guidelines, had a per capita (standard) at each school site. Some parents 
suffered in silence; all scrambled to find a suitable place for their children 
after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the state Department of Social Services block a request by the YMCA to 
care for additional children? During World War II, the state furnished child 
care for families. Today, families are sinking in a quagmire of paperwork which 
will only produce latch-key children and the problems surrounded by that 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-care need is urgent. Provided they meet all the revised guidelines 
for elementary-age children, the state should grant the Y's request to expand 
and safely care for our children.

RULES FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * With such an attitude about juvenile delinquency proffered to students of 
social ecology at UCI by Arnold Binder ("Restrictions on Youths Strain 
Families, Burden Government," Sept. 18) it is no wonder we have more and more 
social problems among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know where Binder is coming from but his views are scary. With the 
permissiveness that psychologists and sociologists have fostered in the past 
generation, even "good" parents are losing control of their young at an early 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew has long been an aid to parents in maintaining control of teens' 
hours. Take that away and watch the vandalism increase and parents' worries 
multiply!

IRVINE VOTE ON GRANT BAD FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The city of Irvine has invested a great deal of time, energy and money over 
the past two years trying to enhance the city's image as a "friendly place to 
do business." This image was tarnished, however, when the City Council voted 
(Sept. 13) to turn down $500,000 in federal HUD Community Development Block 
Grant (CDBG) funds designed to promote the development of small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 These funds were earmarked for allocation as loans to stimulate small-business 
development in Irvine. The loan program posed no financial risk to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Finance Commission, a fairly conservative group, voted 5 to 0 to 
endorse the CDBG loan program. The Irvine Chamber of Commerce spoke in favor of 
it as did executives from local financial institutions. Residents testified in 
support. No matter, Irvine's "business-friendly" City Council didn't want to be 
that friendly, especially to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision reveals a significant contradiction in the City Council's 
policies to promote business development. Not many months ago, the City Council 
voted to continue the policy of using local tax dollars to subsidize the cost 
of processing development plans with the city. The subsidy is considerable at 
$52.84 per hour, the difference between the actual rate charged and full cost 
to the city. The conditional use permits for Village 38, as an example, 
consumed 90 hours of staff time or a taxpayer contribution of $4,755.60 to the 
Irvine Co.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is spending local tax dollars to subsidize the Irvine Co. and 
other developers but is not prepared to use federal tax dollars to help 
stimulate the creation of small businesses. Consistency, if nothing else, 
demands that if the city doesn't want to be in the "banking business," then it 
should get out of the "subsidy business" as well.

EFFORT TO SAVE THE RAMS IS MISDIRECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As I read The Times' articles next to each other, "Offer to Save the Rams 
Not in Ballpark, Team President Warns" and "Rebuilding After Drug Sweep Begins" 
(Sept. 10), it occurred to me: Wouldn't it be wonderful if the people trying to 
save the Rams would put their effort and money instead into supporting the 
Santa Ana police's drug sweep? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' owner already knows what (she) is going to do. After the Rams are 
long gone, we still need safe streets. It seems strange that the Santa Ana 
police are trying to take drugs off the street and the Rams are putting money 
up for (player Darryl) Henley.

 Where are our priorities?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CORRECTIONAL REFORM; PRIVATIZING PRISONS, 
JAILS MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN PROMISING; WHILE IT'S SEEN AS A PANACEA, THE 
PROJECTED COST SAVINGS COULD BE SHORT-LIVED AND AT THE EXPENSE OF STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY PONTELL, Henry Pontell is a professor in the department of 
criminology, law and society at UC Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, policy-makers, practitioners, scholars and others have been 
actively searching for ways to improve America's ailing correctional system. By 
most measures, we have been spending more and doing worse. Amid more recent 
proposals and alternatives has been that of privatization -- giving the private 
sector a significant role in the administration, financing and construction of 
correctional facilities. This is beginning to occur in Orange County with small 
jail-holding facilities in Seal Beach and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selling the walls" may seem to make sense given both our dismal record in 
corrections and the severity of government budget shortfalls. A closer look, 
however, reveals myriad potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest in privatization has intensified as a response to increasing jail 
and prison populations, burgeoning costs and the widespread perception that the 
government-administered criminal justice bureaucracy has failed in its mission 
of appropriately dealing with convicted criminals. As these conditions worsen, 
interest in private corrections initiatives will increase. While there has 
always been a place for the private sector in contracting goods and services 
with public agencies, turning over jail and prison systems to profit-making 
enterprises could be a huge mistake, not only in terms of constitutional issues 
but in terms of taxpayer costs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of privatization contend that private correctional systems put cost 
reductions above responsibility of a government for its prisoners. Government 
is in charge of domestic defense, which includes correctional systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, on the other hand, argue that such philosophical objections are a 
luxury that an overcrowded system cannot afford. They also contend that private 
correctional systems are less costly to operate than existing facilities 
because they are designed with economy in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the claims of both sides, there is little reliable information or 
enough research to tell us how privatization can work, whether it can solve our 
current problems and at what human and financial cost. Even if such answers 
were available, however, the more basic and perhaps most important question of 
contracting out people's freedom to the lowest bidder would remain untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 The major perceived benefit of privatization is cost reduction and taxpayer 
savings. While some studies exist that show the average cost per inmate to be 
lower in private versus public institutions, critics contend that these savings 
will be short-lived and that long-term expenses will exceed current 
correctional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, cost-cutting measures could run rampant, as not only taxpayers' 
voices in decisions are lost but also the government's control over quality of 
construction of facilities. Minimum standards for government would become 
maximum standards for the private sector, allowing it to save money in order to 
ensure profits. The shortcomings of low-quality construction surface later in 
the form of increased maintenance and renovation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly perhaps, the government and taxpayers bear the responsibility 
and cost of monitoring compliance. No matter how much we would like to do so, 
government and taxpayer liability in this realm cannot be eliminated by 
delegating powers to a private entity. Thus, without rigorous government 
oversight (and related taxpayer costs), privatization efforts could backfire. 
When these costs are considered, the economic advantages of privatization begin 
to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point that is often overlooked in assessing privatization is that 
private industry is already deeply involved in corrections policy. Recent 
research has identified a "corrections-commercial complex" akin to the 
military-industrial complex that operates without public scrutiny and exercises 
enormous influence over corrections policy. 
</P>
<P>
 As participants in this complex define their activities in the public 
interest, it becomes increasingly difficult to ascertain how much benefit 
accrues to taxpayers and government and how much to profit-oriented companies 
whose interest lies in building and operating as many facilities as cheaply as 
possible. Soaring correctional budgets, waste and inefficiency, defective 
construction and inadequate services could follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing, however, is the distinct possibility of a connection 
between "get-tough-on-crime" politics and the profit-generating interests of 
the corrections industry. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as the 1960s, jails and prisons in many parts of the United States 
(including California) were privately owned and operated. Their record was 
nothing short of scandalous. Gross exploitation of prison labor, fraud, 
political corruption and sheer brutality have characterized private corrections 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that something must be done to improve the state of our 
nation's prisons and jails. Orange County has wallowed in its own jail 
overcrowding problems for well over a decade. Crime and punishment in a free 
society involve complex questions that are betrayed by simple solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Private jails and prisons do not offer a correctional free lunch. Whatever 
direction is taken regarding privatization, a thoughtful and complete review 
must be given to all of the issues involved. How we resolve them will say a 
great deal about how we wish to be perceived as a society. Until this occurs, 
rushing into privatization is inappropriate.

SCHOOL BUS RULE

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the school bus lights law ("The Danger Presented by Lack of 
Visibility"): It doesn't seem necessary to propound on this subject with 
several thousand words for it to be understood.Simply put, educate the children 
with an unbreakable rule. Remain on the curb until the bus has proceeded at 
least one-half block or farther before crossing the street -- at the green 
light or designated crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if it is a hazardous area, employ more crossing guards, budgets or no 
budgets. There is no shortage of people willing to do this.

 * It seems to me that the doctors and students that protested at Bryco Arms 
("Taking Aim at Gun Maker," Sept. 20) have their priorities mixed up. With 
80,000 to 100,000 deaths each year in the United States due to "medical 
misadventures" by people such as these protesters, I think we would be better 
off with them studying their trade rather than wasting their time blaming Bryco 
for a cultural problem.

DEVELOPMENT MIGHT WRECK ALISO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am very upset about the fact that Aliso Beach has had so many closures 
this summer because of sewage spills! 
</P>
<P>
 Peripheral development, by dumping into the Aliso Creek basin, is destroying 
the pristine beauty of our shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more devastating to our beaches would be the proposed San Joaquin Hills 
toll road. The accumulation of runoff from the storm drains of that 
superhighway would inundate Aliso Beach after each rain. 
</P>
<P>
 As a taxpayer of Laguna Beach, I am opposed to supporting outside developers 
who continue using our shoreline as a dumping ground. We are about to see our 
ocean water quality being reduced to the standards of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Will my 2-year-old son enjoy swimming and surfing in pristine water as I had 
the privilege of doing?

FORGET ANGELS, RAMS AND A NEW BALLPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I and many fans and would-be fans don't agree with Katherine M. Babb, an 
Orange County architect and planning consultant, that we need a new stadium 
("Forget the Strike, Forget Angels and Rams, We Deserve a New Ballpark," Sept. 
9). 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium holds 64,593 people and is the second-largest stadium, next to 
Cleveland, of any baseball park.It has plenty of parking, good freeway access, 
it is clean and has courteous employees. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need is to help the Rams out -- way out! We don't need this spoiled 
owner. Just don't let the door hit her on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys have apparently given up on getting a championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 With this market, I'm sure there are a number of winning teams that would love 
to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing needed is realistic ticket prices and parking prices. One thing 
we don't need is for our city officials to keep giving our tax money away. 
</P>
<P>
 Show us a club interested in producing a winning team and reasonable prices 
and we will be back.

NOT-SO-WILD GUESS ON WHY DEER RAN THROUGH HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Times reported the story of a deer that inexplicably ran 
through a Laguna Beach home, demolishing two plate-glass windows en route, then 
swam (1.5) miles toward Catalina before rescuers could lure him back to shore 
("Stag's Splashy Exit Leaves Laguna Talking," Sept. 18). Unfortunately, the 
experience was too much for the hapless buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being an animal specialist, but relying on 17 years as a licensed 
therapist, I believe I have solved the mystery. "Buck" began life as a 
well-adjusted male, enjoying our open spaces and county parks, with grassy 
expanses and freedom from preying hunters. Then came the Laguna fire, 
destroying much of his habitat. Food was hard to come by. He may have lost 
loved ones. Eventually he developed post-traumatic stress syndrome. The summer 
drought further depleted food and shelter. Already living close to the deer 
poverty level, poor "Buck" felt helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 The final stressor occurred when the earthmovers rolled in to slash a freeway 
through his dwindling land. It pushed him over the edge. Surmising that the 
world was coming to an end, he panicked, suffering the delusion that the Laguna 
Beach home would provide a safe haven. Almost immediately he was overcome with 
hallucinations of grassy fields in the Pacific Ocean. Clinically speaking, poor 
"Buck" suffered a brief psychotic episode. 
</P>
<P>
 As we solve our transportation problems by building highways through our 
county parks and open spaces, many similar tragedies are inevitable. When 
considering possible solutions, it occurs to me that much human suffering from 
high density living has been treated with medication. Perhaps we could put out 
salt licks laced with Prozac. Just a thought from one who loves our local 
wildlife.

DOCTOR IN ABUSE CASE DESERVES PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am extremely disappointed to see my colleague's, Dr. Annette C. Bernhut, 
medical judgment being challenged ("Boy's Injuries, Ordeal Stun Officials," 
Sept. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 I know nothing about this particular case of child abuse, other than what is 
reported in The Times, but I do know Dr. Bernhut professionally. She is an 
excellent, skilled, caring physician. 
</P>
<P>
 It is disgraceful to see her reputation attempted to be destroyed. Dr. Bernhut 
was astute enough to recognize suspected abuse and report the case. In my 
opinion, Dr. Bernhut should be thanked, congratulated and receive special 
recognition for saving this child's life.

LANDING REAL ESTATE PROFITS IS NO SURE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the lawsuit against the present TMI management ("A Hard Investment 
Lesson," Sept. 19), my wife and I have been longtime investors in Teachers 
Management & Investment Corp. We realized even in the heady days of real estate 
offerings that real estate, regardless of the market, is by its very nature the 
least liquid of all investments. Also along with high profits and some tax 
write-offs there will be losses. It should be obvious to investors that 100% 
investment of one's retirement money into real estate is not a balanced 
investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the current lawsuit, I have no reason to suspect the present management 
of TMI of fraudulent dealings. They are doing a good job of trying to clean up 
some of the poor purchases of raw land by the former TMI management. For 
example, when hotel purchases were promoted by the former management, I knew 
from personal business dealings that building hotels is a very high-risk 
operation. We stayed out of these investments. I feel that the former 
management of TMI was starting to spin out of control, not because of fraud but 
poor business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit claims a Ponzi scheme is involved here. This would mean the older 
investors would be paid off by the new investors. In TMI who are the new 
investors? New properties have not been offered for four to five years! 
</P>
<P>
 As to the accusation of the commingling of investment funds, I have to believe 
if this is true, the examiners and auditors from the State of California will 
quickly discover this. The investors who are suing TMI are pressing very 
serious charges against TMI management. If the charges are true, it is not just 
a civil case but a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 What do the four dissident limited partners want out of this? They claim TMI 
is broke. They cannot really believe this, as I think their motivation is to 
recover as much investment money as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 I happen to believe that these people do not want revenge but rather a 
financial settlement. Now if this should happen, what about the other thousands 
of investors like me? I believe we would be left holding an empty bag. The old 
story -- the attorneys and a few clients would get the money.

'STANDARDS' NOT THE ONLY ISSUE WITH VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Rival Systems for VCR 'Replacement' Could Spark Standards War," (Sept. 14) 
overlooks what might be a major stumbling block to the future of the video CDs. 
Since the quality of the picture and sound is very high with these CDs, the 
firms selling them are basically selling products that are nearly of "master" 
quality.Masters are what the companies use to make the current VHS tapes sold 
to consumers. By selling master-quality discs to consumers, the studios are 
really selling masters to all the illegal duplicators at incredibly cheap 
prices. Anyone can shop for low-quality VHS dupes of almost any film made today 
in most major cities. When these CDs are produced, the dupers will be able to 
make high-quality copies onto VHS tape and sell them for the same low prices, 
so I can't see why VHS will not continue for a long time as the primary 
consumer system. The big manufacturers must deal with this problem even before 
they worry about setting standards.

COUNTRYWIDE AND ITS DRESS FOR SUCCESS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boss makes $3 million a year and is fond of cute and expensive clothes 
("From Peak in '93, Countrywide Comes Uneasily Back to Earth," Sept. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his employees make $10 an hour, and he expects them to dress like Anne 
Klein or Beau Brummell. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the boss should loosen his tie a little. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure the 1,440 people that were laid off were really impressed with the 
results of the mandatory policy of dress for success. (Pomposity over 
substance.)

CROSS ABOUT INSURER'S PLANS FOR FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was amazed at the article announcing a giveaway by Blue Cross of $2 billion 
accumulated while it was a nonprofit corporation ("Blue Cross Plans to Use $2 
Billion for Foundation," Sept. 16). My wife and I have been members of Blue 
Cross and paid regular premiums for more than 20 years, and they have increased 
considerably over our complaints.We just paid our current quarterly premiums, 
amounting to $1,107, which is approximately our Social Security check for the 
month. Blue Cross now takes 25% of our annual Social Security income. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do the state regulators want to give the policyholders' money to someone 
else? Why not work out a distribution plan to return $2 billion to those of us 
who put all of that money into Blue Cross' coffers?

GALLERY; BORDERLINE REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Steinhart writes of it this way: "This is a land of glimpses. Of the 
bobcat that darts across the road, the coyote that slinks behind the cactus. . 
. . To see in this landscape, you have to think differently." 
</P>
<P>
 That land lies along the U.S.-Mexico border. Steinhart and photographer Tupper 
Ansel Blake spent two years exploring the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of California 
areas and produced the new book, "Two Eagles/Dos Aguilas" (University of 
California Press). 
</P>
<P>
 But coffee-table beauty isn't the point. The book's mission is to stem the 
abuse of the region by both countries. At risk are the rich wildlife and 
landscape; the desert millipede, the red-tailed hawk and fluttering two-tail 
swallowtails, the Maritime marshland and the bug-eyed couch spadefoot.

SOCIAL CLIMES / TIME OUT; THE GUY KNOWS HOW TO THROW A PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 9 a.m. and something inside Don Ernstein's house smells good. Really good 
-- buttery, sweet, eggy. "I never eat like this," he confesses, browning fat 
triangles of French toast stuffed with peanut butter and bananas in a pool of 
melted butter. "I have cereal for breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
 But today Ernstein is making his breakfast party menu from "The Complete Party 
Book" (Viking Studio Books) to demonstrate there doesn't have to be high 
anxiety when throwing a party -- even if something flops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already burned the chicken-apple sausages this morning," he admits. "But 
that's OK -- I just thought, 'I'll make more.' That's the thing about parties. 
If something goes wrong, you can always have another party. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're doing a catered party, usually everything is going to go fine 
because you're working with professionals," he says. "When you're doing it at 
home . . . something could happen. But you just sort of have to hang loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernstein lives by the advice he doles out. His 12-year-old Los Angeles-based 
catering and party-planning company -- Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods -- 
has thrown fetes for Jane Fonda, Tina Brown and Bill Clinton. His book came out 
of a desire to demystify and simplify the party-giving process, offer creative 
and inexpensive decorating tips, and give complete menus for everything from a 
brunch to a dessert party to an appetizer buffet to a late supper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I get nervous at my parties? No," says the former graphic designer. "I 
have shpilkis like a week before the party -- and I'm not talking over the top, 
but I'm just aware that there's stuff to be done. The day of the party I'm 
relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 What are some tricks of his trade that non-pros can use? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do as much ahead of time as possible. "I love to set the table the day 
before because I can play around with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Concentrate on what you like to do. "If you only like doing the flowers, 
then serve takeout," or have the party catered. (Ernstein orders Chinese food 
and serves it in takeout cartons.) 
</P>
<P>
 * See your home in a new light. "I'll sit in a room and look at it and listen 
to it. . . . There are certain things that are going to work better than 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the unexpected for decorations -- a bouquet of flowers mixed with fresh 
herbs, some colorful peppers. A bowl of purple and white eggplants can be a 
centerpiece one day, ratatouille the next. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you don't live formally, don't entertain that way. "I think people are 
intimidated by that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Know your etiquette if you're the host or a guest. "People bring flowers to 
your house . . . but they don't always know your taste, and you may have spent 
all this time making sure everything looks the way you want. So you run into 
the kitchen and throw them in the sink and put in a little water and deal with 
them later.  
</P>
<P>
 * "And make sure you clean out your bathroom cabinets," Ernstein says. "People 
go through them. If I were to tell you that I didn't open cabinets, I'd be 
lying to you. I don't always do it, but I've done it. It's human nature." 
</P>
<P>
 What's Ernstein's favorite kind of party to give in his own home? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dinner for eight to 12 people. I'd use the dining room table as a buffet and 
I'd have fried chicken and mashed potatoes and great bread -- corn muffins or 
something -- and chocolate cake. I just love basic food. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (entertaining) isn't something you've been brought up with, you can still 
establish your own style," he says. "You may hate the way your mother did 
things, maybe it was always formal and you had to sit in the living room.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can do a buffet on the kitchen counter. And you can go to a restaurant 
and see how they do things there, or go to Crate & Barrel and see how they set 
a table. You just have to have the desire to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernstein says his love of cooking and party-giving can be traced to his 
grandmother: "She loved having people over. The bottom line was that she always 
wanted people around her, and I want people around me."

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ; IN OCTOBER, ALMOST A ROYAL FLUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles won't be the only royal Brit popping into Los Angeles next 
month. The Duchess of York, better known as Sarah (Fergie) Ferguson, is coming 
to the Carousel Ball on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to be duchess of the ball," said Barbara Davis, who's chairing 
the fund-raiser for the Children's Diabetes Foundation. "I'm thrilled she's 
joining our community in the fight against diabetes." 
</P>
<P>
 The duchess, who'll be staying with friends, will in all likelihood be seated 
at the same table as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who's receiving the 
foundation's Brass Ring Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Fergie won't be in town long. She leaves before Prince Charles arrives on Oct. 
31 for the UK/LA festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Full Closure: The Westside is losing another of its ultra-discreet dining 
spots. Dominick's, the small, unmarked, unadvertised nightspot on Beverly 
Boulevard with the entrance out back, will be closing in October "unless 
something miraculous happens," said owner Lynne Giler. She cites four years of 
just breaking even as the reason for closing up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go back to writing," Giler said. "I did it successfully for 15 
years. I don't what possessed me to open a restaurant in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Rag Cruising: Considering a past dispute, it's a bit surprising to hear Tom 
Cruise will be on the cover of November's Premiere magazine in connection with 
a story on the making of "Interview With a Vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Cruise and the magazine wrangled over John H. Richardson's feature 
on Scientology's relationship with Hollywood. The controversial religion, of 
which Cruise is a member, threatened lawsuits. Cruise, who declined to be 
interviewed for the article, received a series of questions from a magazine 
fact-checker regarding what the article said about him. He sent a heated 
response with a request it be printed verbatim, which the magazine did. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor's spokeswoman, Pat Kingsley, told us Cruise had said in his printed 
response that he would talk to Premiere in the future, that it would be wrong 
to confuse Scientology's relationship with Premiere with Cruise's relationship 
with the magazine, and "they printed what he wanted them to. Let bygones, be 
bygones."

ADULT KIDS DON'T UNDERSTAND JOYS OF BEING GROWN-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About Beverly Beyette's "Stop, Smell the Crayons" (Sept. 9): To all you "adult 
children" out there, perhaps you don't understand. Being a grown-up has it all 
over the dubious joys of childhood.You may do exactly as you please with no one 
telling you to go to bed or what to eat or do your homework or take out the 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's that important to you, go ahead and assume a funny name ("Name tags 
are a wonderful way for people to hide," says "Dr. Play," Howard Papush. Hide 
from what?), sniff away at the crayons, play pretend games or Duck-Duck-Goose. 
Who's stopping you? More to the point, why do you need some Dr. Play to give 
you permission to do so? And at a price? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Pan Syndrome is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions in this country. 
It doesn't seem to be making for a happier society, as people emulate the 
cruelty and self-centered pettiness endemic in childhood, which is the dark 
side of cuteness and youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The happiest people I know, myself included, are adults who don't need to hide 
from the worries of the world, who don't require supervised play, who derive 
fun from today and tomorrow, not yesterday.

AN OFFENSIVE MIX OF STORY AND PHOTO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Holiest Moment of the High Holy Days" (Sept. 14) was about Yom Kippur, 
the holiest and most solemn holiday of the year for most Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 So can someone please explain to me who made the choice that was offensive, 
insulting and insensitive to put an article above the continuation of this 
story on page E5, which shows two camels mating, a picture which degrades the 
Yom Kippur article beneath it?

CASUALLY DRESSED PROFS HAVEN'T MATURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Fashion-Minded Professor" (Sept. 1): These are the same so-called 
students of the late '60s and '70s who rebelled about dress, classes, standards 
and learning. They haven't changed nor grown up since the days I taught in 
university.Yet they cry all the time about not being treated like 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should they be? They lack maturity, taste and an honest desire to leave a 
better place for students. I'm sure they feel proud that they still do as they 
choose and to hell with standards of any kind.  
</P>
<P>
 Class, taste and maturity mark a truly educated person.

 Gaile Robinson's article was, perhaps unwittingly, one of the saddest comments

</P>
<P>
 Clothes do help make the man. A university-level instructor's main function 
should be the seamless placement of knowledge into the brains of the students.  
</P>
<P>
 This function would seemingly be more successful if the instructor is dressed 
for the job as is Judge Lance Ito, an airline pilot, any policeman.

GO AHEAD AND SMOKE -- LEAVE REST OF US ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ihave read Garry Abrams' piece "Smoker's Fantasies Light Up His World" (Sept. 
15). His characterization of "many anti-smoking zealots" as "pompous twits" is 
not germane to the important issue of why many of us are indeed zealots in our 
pursuit of tobacco control. 
</P>
<P>
 What is lost in inflammatory rhetoric is the truth that secondhand smoke is 
dangerous to all who breathe it. It is a Class A human carcinogen, not a 
nuisance. Thousands of people a year are not dying of a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams anticipates a "tut-tutting" and "fulminating" of persons such as I over 
"the poor tobacco addict" incorrectly. The damage smokers do to themselves is 
their choice and their business, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
 What those of us interested in tobacco control want is protection from 
secondhand smoke in the workplace and in public venues. Yes, such protection 
means restrictions on smokers, but it does not take away their right to smoke.

TV TALK SHOWS TURN HER OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At last somebody has told it right in "Next! When Abnormal Becomes Normal!" by 
Shari Roan (Sept. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Just a sampling of the plague of talk shows should give any thinking person a 
cold chill. Our society is on a slippery slope to God-only-knows-what. And 
anyone in the audience who holds up a timid hand and dares to say some of this 
is wrong is looked upon as some sort of bigot. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently a problem came up in our family, and I listened to my 14-year-old 
granddaughter spouting phrases lifted directly from the talk shows without a 
clue to their true import. Yes. Children are watching.

 Ahhh, the urban mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Soggy clothes, thousands of cigarette butts, countless plastic bags, a 20-foot 
hunk of tarpaulin and six bullets were among the nearly 29 tons of trash that 
Westsiders pulled from Ballona Creek during last weekend's Coastal Cleanup Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The event Saturday brought about 200 local residents out to help clean up the 
Culver City section of the creek and its immediate surroundings. As some 
volunteers donned wading boots and used rakes to pull trash from the water, 
others applied 100 gallons of paint to the creek's concrete walls to cover up 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic foam cups and containers, which typically dot the creek, were the most 
prevalent pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cleaning it up has saved the lives of fish and birds who are known to 
strangle on this kind of stuff," said Joan Satt, the city's waste reduction 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, thinks the creek will stay clean for long. The next cleanup 
is scheduled for April 22 -- Earth Day, Satt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like washing dishes," she said. "You never seem to get done."

 INSIDE JOB: Police reported that on Sept. 16, Adam Leslie, a 38-year-old Los 
Angeles comedian, allegedly stole a gold-and-diamond pendant from a jewelry 
display case in the Neiman-Marcus department store in Beverly Hills -- then 
swallowed it. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard confronted Leslie as he tried to leave the upscale store, 
police said. Leslie confessed to ingesting the tiny, $2,600 pendant, they 
reported, which was less than an inch high and shaped like the numeral 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie attempted to regurgitate the pendant for the guard, authorities said, 
but was unable to do so. Beverly Hills police then reportedly took him to the 
hospital for X-rays, which revealed the pendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Leslie pleaded with them, saying he would return the pendant if 
they would let him off. The return was easily arranged: He was given a laxative 
and taken to the Beverly Hills jail, where . . . Let's just say the pendant 
appeared. Leslie was booked on a charge of grand theft and released on his own 
recognizance.

 DADDY & ME: Jay Goldinger is not pleased. Kids, he complains, "always think of 
Mommy when they're growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 So Goldinger, owner of a Beverly Hills bond brokerage firm, is starting "Daddy 
& Me" classes. The two-hour classes, being organized with the help of a 
psychologist, will include play time, story time, snack time, swimming, park 
visits and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The key challenge, Goldinger says, is to keep the dads interested. To do so, 
he plans to have the fathers host the classes on a rotating basis. Dads, he 
figures, will want to attend the classes organized by others to ensure enough 
people will come to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, recruiting fathers has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been tougher than trading bonds," he said last week. "Dads just 
aren't used to this. Some of these guys' wives faxed in the applications, and 
when I called the dads about signing up they said, 'What? I did?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldinger says he has managed to stir enough interest to go forward with 
the project. The secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "You get down on your knees and beg," he said.

CITY BATTLING GARCETTI OVER GRAFFITI LAW; CRIME: CULVER CITY OFFICIALS WANT TO 
PASS A TOUGH ORDINANCE TO PUNISH TAGGERS. BUT D.A.'S OFFICE CONTENDS IT IS THE 
PROSECUTING AGENT FOR ALL JUVENILE CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City officials are battling with Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti for the right to prosecute minors under a proposed anti-graffiti 
ordinance that city officials say is among the toughest in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti proposal, to be considered by the City Council on Monday night, 
would impose penalties on taggers, including the revocation of their driver's 
licenses, jail time, fines and community service work. It would also require 
that graffiti removal be paid for by owners of property where repeated tagging 
has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are proposing the measures because Garcetti's office 
has failed to enforce state graffiti-abatement provisions already on the books. 
They say that for the past year, the city has unsuccessfully pressed the 
district attorney to allow it to handle its own graffiti enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti is not worse in Culver City, we just have less tolerance for it," 
said Vice Mayor Steven Gourley. "We don't want our city to look like Los 
Angeles. It's ugly, and there's no enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office contends that it is the prosecuting agent for 
all juvenile crimes, and should remain so. "We can't separate some crimes and 
hand them to certain cities," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City officials say the need for an anti-graffiti drive is clear. The 
city, they point out, has spent $54,000 in the past year to clean up more than 
1,900 graffiti markings. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the highest-profile provision in the proposal would suspend the 
driving privileges of convicted taggers -- a sure-fire way to stop young 
offenders, said one school official. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the most important thing to them -- their license," said William 
Coates, assistant principal of Culver City High School. "Some of the hardened 
kids, the ones who are really involved in gangs, there's not much else you can 
do to embarrass them." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, taggers would also be fined up to $50,000, 
jailed for up to a year and sentenced to perform up to four days of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see them clean up school property . . . embarrass them and make 
them do it in front of their peers," Gourley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minors would be prohibited from carrying "graffiti implements" -- including 
spray paint, markers and etching devices -- in most public places when a parent 
or a guardian is not present. The responsibility of paying fines would fall to 
the parents, and parents unable to pay would be sentenced to the same community 
service time as their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance also targets property owners. Culver City would clean 
up graffiti four times on the same property but, after that, property owners 
would be asked to voluntarily clean it up or pay the city to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 If, six months after the ordinance takes effect, the council determines that 
property owners are not responding, such payments will become mandatory and 
property owners who fail to make them would face penalties of up to $1,000 and 
six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cleaning up graffiti is (business' and homeowners') responsibility," Gourley 
said. "There are some people, like absentee landlords, that won't do anything 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Culver City considers its proposed ordinance to be the strongest 
anti-graffiti measure in the county, the city of Los Angeles punishes taggers 
much the same way -- with, among other penalties, community service work and 
the suspension of driving privileges, according to Delphia Jones, director of 
Los Angeles' Operation Clean Sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 But compared to other cities, Culver City is going a step farther. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers in Santa Monica do not have their driving privileges suspended, said 
Helen Albright, who handles graffiti enforcement in Santa Monica. And although 
the city requires offenders to clean up graffiti, it assigns fewer hours of 
community service for each violation than Culver City is proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reason for Santa Monica's softer approach, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much, and kids get resentful," she said. "You can go too far."

AFTER 26 YEARS, MALIBU RECYCLING CENTER WILL CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drop-off recycling center on Civic Center Way will close Oct. 30 because 
there hasn't been enough material collected there to keep the site operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, operated by a company called Recycle America, was created in 1968 
and is believed to be one of the oldest recycling facilities in the nation. A 
citywide curbside recycling program went into effect in June, 1992, and a 
commercial recycling center opened this month.

CULTURE; A CENTER THAT DEFINES 'COMMUNITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MATSUDA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thump of basketballs and the shouts of teen-agers reverberate inside the 
gym at the Venice Japanese Community Center. It's a balmy evening and the 
mostly Japanese American teen-agers, part of a youth basketball league, are 
giddy and playful as they near the end of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, a contingent of mostly middle-aged Japanese Americans met in the gym 
for their weekly country line dancing lessons, and elderly residents sat down 
for a lunch as part of the senior citizens' nutrition program. 
</P>
<P>
 The community center's crowded schedule continued that evening with a bonsai 
club, adult Japanese language class, Boy Scouts meeting and Japanese 
folk-singing group. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the ebb and flow at the little-known center on Braddock Drive that 
serves as a gathering place for local Japanese American families, many of whom 
have roots in the area's farming history. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's older members once worked fields of celery and other crops before 
housing developments, paved roads and million-dollar condos were built. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the average age of the area's Japanese American population 
has increased, said Kenji Koda, president of the center. Although the community 
center has about 1,100 member-families, many of the children have moved to find 
jobs or more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is so expensive. The children that grew up in the area can't afford 
it," Koda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation has declined over the years for the former stalwarts of the 
center: the youth-oriented Japanese language school and judo club. The judo 
club membership is about a dozen, and the Japanese school has only 20 to 30 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Koda speculated that the declining enrollment of the Japanese school may also 
be a result of increased competition from other Japanese-language programs in 
the area, including public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Services at the center -- which has an annual budget of $85,000 drawn from a 
yearly carnival, bingo nights, membership donations and renting out space in 
the buildings -- have evolved to reflect the graying trend. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior nutrition program began in 1982 to serve hot lunches each weekday to 
elderly residents in the area. The center also offers watercolor and yoga 
classes to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But some youth-oriented programs, such as basketball leagues, kendo and 
karate, are more popular than ever, said Jim Akioka, center manager for more 
than 20 years and past president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other center groups include a local chapter of the Japanese American Citizens 
League, a fishing club, ballroom dancing, shodo-kai (calligraphy), taiko 
(drumming), odori (dancing), Boy Scouts and karaoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, housed in a group of nondescript stucco buildings, also has a 
gardeners' association and flower arranging and bonsai classes -- testament to 
its agricultural history. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of the community center date back to the 1920s. The volunteer 
group that runs it was formed in 1921 as a Japanese American farming 
association known as the Venice-Palms Sangyo Kumiai. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sangyo Kumiai, or industrial association, conducted its meetings at the 
Venice-Palms Japanese Language School, built in 1924 near Jefferson Boulevard 
and Centinela Avenue. (In 1929, the school moved farther west on Jefferson near 
McConnell Avenue before moving again to its current site on Braddock Drive in 
1941.) 
</P>
<P>
 The group catered to families living in what was known as Venice-Palms, said 
Owen Yoshikawa, 82, who moved to the area in 1924. The area was roughly bounded 
by Overland Avenue, Jefferson Boulevard, Venice Boulevard and the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice-Palms area was nationally known for its high-quality celery, said 
Frank Matsuoka, 86, who moved to the area in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Depression, a series of natural disasters struck the 
farmers in the 1930s. In the early part of the decade, Ballona Creek, then a 
winding dirt channel, broke its banks and flooded the area, Matsuoka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farming was interrupted by World War II, when the area's Japanese Americans 
were forced to live in internment camps. After the war, the community center 
served as a way station for Japanese American families returning from the 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Over three years, more than 100 families lived in tents and trailers set up on 
the community center grounds until they could find permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, the center underwent an expansion that included an office, conference 
room, multipurpose room and renovation of the existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Japanese Americans needed the community center for cultural, 
social and economic reasons, said Mitsuo Inouye, past president. As younger 
Japanese Americans face less discrimination and gain greater access to the 
mainstream economy, the social and cultural needs remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've assimilated into society, but we still need a place to get together," 
Koda added. "I'd like it to keep on being a part of the community."

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT PREPARES TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Move-in day is approaching at the Carlton Apartments, a recently completed 
24-unit complex for low-income families that housing officials hope will 
stabilize a multiethnic neighborhood racked by gang activity, the 1992 riots 
and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly rents, which are adjusted for tenant income, range from $343 for a 
two-bedroom unit to $775 for a four-bedroom unit. The first tenants will move 
in by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This neighborhood is (made up of) mostly low-income people trying to work 
hard, study and get jobs," said Heidi Guyldarian, a 25-year-old Armenian 
immigrant who has been hired as resident manager of the complex near Hollywood 
Boulevard and Western Avenue. "A lot of people lost their homes in the 
Northridge earthquake. Projects like this help keep kids off the street, and 
will be better for parents, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Hollywood Community Housing Corp. developed the project, which 
cost just under $4 million, according to executive director Jack Gardner. Most 
of the budget came from the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles and 
Mission First Financial, a subsidiary of the Southern California Edison Corp. 
The housing corporation has 10 other low-income housing sites in various phases 
of completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood has a lot of low-income families living in severely overcrowded 
facilities," Gardner said. "Sometimes there are eight to 12 people crammed into 
a studio, often a slum unit. . . . A lot of households have been doubled and 
tripled up in other units since the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Gardner said that the Carlton Apartments will probably mark the end 
of his organization's efforts to build new multiunit housing in Hollywood, 
partly because of concerns over high construction costs. Some community groups 
had criticized the Carlton project as too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Gardner said, his organization will focus on renovating 
foreclosed and other existing properties, which is generally cheaper than 
building from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carlton Apartments complex includes a rooftop sun deck, landscaped 
courtyard, laundry room, underground parking and a children's playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said that 1,500 applications were received for the 24 available units. 
A lottery was held last month to help establish tenant priority, with special 
preference going to the homeless, displaced and people paying more than 50% of 
their monthly income in rent, he said. SCOTT COLLINS

chambers to deal with," said Tom Pyne, the newly elected president of the 
Westside Council. "It's more effective for us to pool our resources, share our 
knowledge and tap into the expertise we have in our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than six months of discussion, the coalition members met earlier 
this month to elect officers and draft bylaws for the new organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the naming of Pyne as president, Thomas Crail of the West 
Hollywood chamber, Steve Fazio of the Brentwood chamber and Donald Savoie from 
the Westchester/LAX chamber were elected vice presidents. Malibu chamber board 
member Mark Olson will serve as treasurer, and James R. Merlino of the Venice 
chamber will be secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chambers represented on the Westside Council include those of Beverly 
Hills, Century City, Culver City, Hollywood, Marina del Rey, Miracle Mile and 
Pacific Palisades. Altogether, the council will be representing more than 7,500 
businesses, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 A prominent concern of the council, its organizers say, is retaining 
businesses on the Westside. When a local business fails or leaves, Pyne said, 
the loss not only affects the city where the business was located, it also 
hurts the communities where the employees lived and shopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council plans to play an advocacy role on behalf of small businesses, 
presenting a common front before state and county officials whose decisions 
affect local businesses. Said Pyne: "The way to make a better community is to 
have a strong economy, and to do that, small businesses must flourish." SUSAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; MOTORCADE TO LAUNCH VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The African American Vote Project kicks off today at its Crenshaw district 
office, in the hopes of spurring blacks to participate in the election process. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, a statewide effort under the auspices of the state Democratic 
Party, seeks to register African American voters and ensure that they vote. 
Organizers say they are looking to Los Angeles' black community to take the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a throwback to the '60s in that we've realized we've got to hit the 
streets to make it happen," said Darolyn Davis, spokeswoman for the project. 
"Politicians have been out of touch with people for the past 20 years. Voter 
turnout has been shamefully low." 
</P>
<P>
 A ceremony is scheduled for 3 p.m. at the project's office at 3653 La Brea 
Ave. A 30-car motorcade will wind its way south to four other offices, in 
Inglewood, South-Central, Compton and Carson. The caravan will include the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and local and state politicians, including state Treasurer and 
gubernatorial hopeful Kathleen Brown, former state Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Los Angeles City Council members Mark 
Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters. The event will also feature food and live 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 The project plans to recruit black voters through telephone banking and 
canvassing of public places. The project will continue through the Nov. 8 
election.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our push is not only to get people registered, but (to) get them to vote by 
mail," said project manager Sam Walton, who says the project is working with 
more than 2,000 churches statewide. "Another thing we want to get across to 
people is accountability -- keeping up with an official once he or she is 
elected." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is also setting up in the Bay Area, the Central Valley, Sacramento 
and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the effort to stem the tide of general voter apathy is a must, 
particularly with anemic voter turnouts in recent years that fell below 30%. 
"The only thing we can do now is get active," she said.

ISSUES: HARMAN'S STANCE ON CONTROLLING HANDGUNS IS DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Westside Watch "Targeting Harman" (Sept. 15): Obviously Ed 
Worley, coordinator of NRA Members Councils in California, is not aware of what 
is going on in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples: In Chicago, an 11-year-old child kills a teen-ager with a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic and is then murdered himself.In Houston, a police 
officer is left blind in one eye and deaf in one ear after being shot by a man 
opening fire on the first person to walk into the station lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver, a pawn shop places an ad in the local paper promoting 
"back-to-school bargains on handguns." High schools all over the country are 
installing metal detectors at front doors to prevent guns on campus. In San 
Francisco, a state appeals court lets a widow sue the state for allegedly 
failing to check the records of her husband, a former mental patient, who 
bought a handgun and then killed himself. A psychiatrist states that guns are a 
culprit in suicides -- 55% of the teen-age boys who commit suicide do so with a 
firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of guns has created a major health hazard. Sorry, Mr. 
Worley, but I am thankful to be represented by Congresswoman Jane Harman, 
someone who shares my concern about the quality of life in our country. Your 
comment that "it will not be difficult to get anyone to volunteer against Jane 
Harman. I can tell you that" is totally inappropriate and irresponsible.

MUSEUMS: SUBWAY ACCESS AND THE FUTURE OF LOS ANGELES TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest your article updating the community on the many new 
museums which are creating a "Smithsonian-like" museum row in mid-Wilshire. 
With this exciting development, it makes it more critical than ever that the 
Los Angeles subway system return to Wilshire Boulevard with a stop at these 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
 For the tourists who will come to Los Angeles in future years and for all of 
us who live here, it is essential that the Wilshire Boulevard museums be 
accessed by a safe, pollution-free transit system which does not further 
congest our streets. There is really only one answer, and that is the extension 
of the L.A. subway system to the Wilshire museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time ago I was quoted as saying "Can you imagine the Paris metro without 
a stop at the Louvre?" With the expansive museum complex that is developing in 
L.A., the community must insist on a metro stop at "L.A. Louvre."

FOR SENIORS; WHEELCHAIR HOSTESS SAYS: 'LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sue Gordon remembers all too clearly the day she was shopping at the market 
and someone asked her how she managed to get her wheelchair into bed at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so taken aback by that question that I just rolled away," she recalled. 
"But later, after I told friends, I thought of a few answers I should have 
given like: 'I have this huge ramp in my bedroom and I just slide down it into 
bed,' or, 'A sky hook hangs from the ceiling and hoists me like a piece of 
lumber into bed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years Gordon, 50, has had multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease that 
attacks the central nervous system. She uses a wheelchair but is not "confined 
or bound" to it, she is quick to say. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not house-bound either. "Terms like these," she said, "conjure up images 
which are simply not true." 
</P>
<P>
 What is true is that people who use wheelchairs don't get to go to many 
parties. So Gordon created a way to bring a few laughs into the lives of other 
disabled people by organizing Sue's Socialites -- monthly parties for disabled 
people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been organizing them for 17 years with the help of her parents, 
Shirley and Chick Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, they arrived at Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey at 7 
a.m. to secure a section of the picnic table area for Gordon's last summer 
beach party, to take place at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She puts this together on her own. Her whole life is her telephone. We're 
here to do what we can do because it's very important to have the socializing 
-- it's the one thing that's missing when it comes to services for the 
disabled," said Shirley Schneider, 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick Schneider, 80, is not one for words. He acted as a waiter to the more 
than 40 guests and did other chores. He usually does the shopping. "These are 
Sue's kids and we're the mama and papa," Chick Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Gordon accomplishes from her wheelchair is micro-management at its best. 
Her first parties were organized with a list of people interested in attending 
provided by the Westside Center for Independent Living. Through word of mouth, 
the parties have grown. During the holiday season, about 90 people attend; 
about 60 showed for a recent party. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Zenzola, a retired graphic artist, helped Gordon when she first started 
the parties. They used to go shopping together. He has spina bifida -- a 
congenital disorder of the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important for people in wheelchairs to get away from their everyday 
environment as well as for the general public to see us as individuals having a 
good time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is undaunted by the task of organizing the party, which includes 
ensuring that people have transportation. "I'm not the type to ask for help, I 
only give it. It doesn't make (sense) to sit home and watch the grass grow, I 
had to do something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon persuaded Cantor's Deli to donate potato salad and cookies for the 
recent party. Shirley Schneider and many others cook. Although Gordon charges a 
nominal fee of $5 per person, it doesn't come close to the $350 monthly cost 
for the special transportation needed for people using wheelchairs. Money is 
always a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the funds, so I have to get donations and I'm running out, which 
means I'll have to do less parties," Gordon said. "When I started it, I never 
thought it would grow, but the more the merrier . . . let's have lots and lots 
of people." 
</P>

LOAN SCAMS TARGET HOMEOWNERS WITH EQUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Writers Group.

<P>
 If you've got dings or dents in your credit and you want to borrow mortgage 
money, remember the name Essie Goodwin. A 61-year-old widow and retired federal 
employee who lives in Washington, Goodwin faced a cash squeeze during the 
refinancing boom of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed money to fix her home and to pay off debts. A local mortgage broker 
approached her with a combined home improvement-debt consolidation offer that 
would put a new first mortgage on her house with a monthly payment less than 
her current automobile payment of $495. 
</P>
<P>
 It all sounded fine to Goodwin. But tucked away in the boilerplate print of 
the closing documents she signed were facts about the loan that she didn't 
comprehend until weeks later: The mortgage's note rate was 24%. Total fees and 
commissions came to 10 points. (A point equals 1% of the loan.) The effective 
annual percentage rate (APR) was 36%. Monthly payments were $700, not $495, and 
the term was 12 months, not 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With a monthly retirement income of $1,215, Goodwin's new mortgage could have 
bankrupted her quickly. Fortunately, she got a lawyer who persuaded the broker 
to restructure the loan to 8%, no points and $296 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Extreme as her case sounds, Goodwin is hardly unique, according to a new 
national survey of legal aid attorneys conducted by Public Citizen, a consumer 
group that has lobbied Congress to toughen up federal protections against home 
mortgage rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that legal aid attorneys in 25 states report receiving more 
than 5,000 complaints of rate- and fee-gouging by loan sharks who target 
homeowners with high equity balances but sub-par credit situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study focused primarily on low-income, urban homeowners, mortgage 
industry executives confirm that middle- and upper-income borrowers with spotty 
credit can be equally vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one San Francisco-area mortgage broker, who asked not to be 
identified, says he recently refinanced a local businessman who had several 
hundred thousand dollars of equity locked up in his home, but needed $100,000 
in cash quickly -- "within four or five days" -- to make a payment related to 
his business. He went to a firm that advertised fast turnarounds and came away 
with the following deal: A 14.95% note rate, 10 points in fees and commissions, 
and a prepayment penalty hidden in the note documents requiring six months 
interest for an early payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy ended up paying $125,000 for the use of $100,000 for five weeks," 
said the mortgage broker who refinanced him out of the deal with a 30-year loan 
under 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage consultant Allen C. Hardester Jr. of Columbia, Md., says rip-off 
loans are a multibillion dollar national industry, targeted on credit-impaired 
homeowners "who simply don't understand that legitimate, fairly priced mortgage 
money sources exist for them." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you know what you should pay as an applicant with credit problems in 
this fall's mortgage marketplace? Hardester offered the following three-tiered 
guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 -- For borrowers in the most vulnerable category -- those who are in danger of 
foreclosure after missing several mortgage payments but who have sizable equity 
stakes -- immediate preventive steps are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since your current lender probably has given up on you, says Hardester, you 
need to pull out the Yellow Pages or talk to a local nonprofit credit 
counseling service -- "not a for-profit credit repair service" -- and ask for 
the names of lenders specializing in sub-par credit situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid recent growth in the so-called "B and C" mortgage market for 
financially pressed borrowers, he says, "means that the price you're going to 
pay (for refinancing) is lower than it's ever been in relative terms." 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of competitive price should you expect if you're what lenders call 
"two or three down" -- you've missed two or three payments? Hardester says 13 
1/2% to 14 1/2% plus two points should be the maximum in the current market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For borrowers with more moderate credit problems -- a record of multiple 
late payments rather than non-payments -- Hardester says energetic shopping 
should yield you a loan at 11 1/2% to 12 1/2% with two points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, for borrowers with just a few credit dings -- a couple of late 
payments and a high household debt-to-income ratio -- Hardester says 10% to 11% 
should be the max. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to avoiding a rip-off: No matter how messy your credit may seem to 
you, the new, highly competitive marketplace for sub-par credit applicants may 
be able to bail you out. 
</P>
<P>
 And the low teens -- not 20% to 30% -- should be the most you pay.

HOT PROPERTY: 'FISHY' CATCH UP THE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 English comic actor/writer/producer JOHN CLEESE, who has been writing a film 
re-teaming the cast of his blockbuster 1988 comedy "A Fish Called Wanda," and 
his wife, ALYCE FAYE, a psychotherapist, have bought a home in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which cost a bit more than $1 million, has three bedrooms and three 
levels with walls and windows of glass. The lower level has an apartment in it, 
with access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Star of the classic "Monty Python" and "Fawlty Towers" TV series, both of 
which he also co-wrote, John Cleese, who won an Emmy for a part he played in a 
"Cheers" episode, has small roles in the upcoming films "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein" and "The Jungle Book." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Charles is expected to attend a 25th anniversary celebration of the 
comedy troupe Monty Python and a pre-release screening of "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein" when he is in Southern California Oct. 31-Nov. 4, to attend some 
of the UK/LA Festival events. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese, 54, is writing a film with the working title "Death Fish II." The film 
is scheduled to be made in England next year with the same cast of "A Fish 
Called Wanda" but with different characters and a new story. Cleese was 
co-star, screenwriter and executive producer of "A Fish Called Wanda." 
</P>
<P>
 His best-selling book in England, "Life and How to Survive It," which he 
co-wrote with his former therapist, is due to be released in the United States 
in January. Until then, Cleese plans to stay in his main residence in West 
London, where he has lived for the past 17 years. He and his wife also have an 
apartment in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife is an American citizen, and all four of their children (her two and 
his two) live in the United States, according to his business manager and 
"Death Fish II" co-producer, Steve Abbott, who gave this as one reason why the 
Cleeses bought a home in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also fell in love with the California coastline years ago when he drove 
it, and then when they (recently) stayed overnight in Santa Barbara, they 
walked on the beach and fell in love with the house. . . . It was a quick 
decision based on a long-time plan," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Seibert, who represented the Cleeses in buying the Santa Barbara house, 
said, "They thought they'd be here in September, but he has been working hard 
in London, so they probably won't be here again until January." 
</P>
<P>
 Seibert was with Fred Sands Realtors when she made the sale but subsequently 
established her own firm, Ocean View Real Estate, in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Kings President BRUCE McNALL'S Holmby Hills home, which has nearly $20 
million in loans and judgments against it, has been put on the market at $5.59 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sports entrepreneur, who entered bankruptcy proceedings in May and agreed 
to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud 
investigation, paid about $7 million for the home in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1937 and gutted and rebuilt in the 1980s, the home, which is on 1.5 
acres, is about 10,000 square feet in size, with five bedrooms and eight baths. 
It also has a tennis court and an entertainment center, off the garden below 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, credited with turning Southern California onto professional ice 
hockey, was sole owner of the Kings from 1988 until May, when he was forced to 
sell a 72% interest in the team because of financial problems that led to his 
filing for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where his house 
will be sold, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Country singer GLEN CAMPBELL'S former Hollywood Hills home, owned by the 
estate of his ex-wife -- the late B. J. Campbell, has been sold for about $2.8 
million, according to public records. The home was for sale in early 1992 at 
$10 million.

 The 15,000-square-foot home was built by the Campbells in the early 1970s, 
shortly before they were divorced. It has 10 bedrooms and a tennis court, all 
on 6.5 acres overlooking Beverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers, two doctors, were represented by Sandy Walton and Margie Burrows, 
both of Fred Sands' Studio City office.

 Veteran actor ALVY MOORE, best known for his role as county agent Hank Kimball 
on the long-running TV sitcom "Green Acres" and his wife, Carolyn, have sold 
their home in Northridge for close to its last asking price of about $350,000, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moores, who have relocated to their Palm Desert home, had lived in the 
four-bedroom home since 1962, one year after it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 The house had suffered some earthquake damage, but the Moores had fixed it up, 
said Fred Sabine, who had shared the listing with Linda Sabine, both of 
Prudential California Realty's Northridge office. The buyers were described as 
"a young couple with a couple of kids."

NO MORE GREEN HAIR; GROWING NUMBER OF SOUTHLAND POOL OWNERS ARE USING CHLORINE 
ALTERNATIVES TO DESTROY CONTAMINANTS IN WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BOLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Bolton is a Santa Barbara free-lance 
writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Screenwriter Robert Towne's hair had turned green. His skin was chewed up, his 
eyes burned constantly, and he said he reeked of a "God-awful after-smell." 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of swimming several thousand yards a day, every day, in his 
chlorinated, back-yard lap pool were more than Towne could endure. 
</P>
<P>
 So Towne investigated alternatives to chlorine, then switched to ozone, a 
powerful chemical that kills pool contaminants much faster than chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans have used ozone to purify their public pools and drinking water for 
decades, but it is only now gaining acceptance in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joy to swim in it," Towne said. "I hate to take a shower after 
swimming in the pool. My pool water is much cleaner than my tap water." 
</P>
<P>
 Towne is among a small but growing number of Southern California's 450,000 
pool owners who are seeking to reduce or eliminate chlorine from their pools. 
Three of the most popular options are ozone, ionization and chlorine 
generators. 
</P>
<P>
 Large public pools also are moving away from relying solely on chlorine. 
Pierce College is testing a combination of ozone and bromine pellets; UC Santa 
Barbara will be sanitizing three pools in its new aquatics complex with ozone 
and liquid chlorine later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, pool owners (or a pool service) test pool water at least once a 
week for chlorine, pH, acid demand and total alkalinity. Based on the results, 
they pour in liquid chlorine by the gallon or fill floating dispensers with 
chlorine tablets, as well as mix in a host of other chemicals to clean and 
balance the water. On a regular basis, they may also "shock" the pool with a 
megadose of chlorine to kill bacteria, viruses and algae that have gotten out 
of hand, despite the weekly routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone, as Towne found, is an appealing option. His pool water is remarkably 
clear. It glistens and sparkles beneath dappled sunlight. The pool is a 
convincing example of how effective the gas can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone is a powerful oxidizer, killing much faster than chlorine. It quickly 
attacks bacteria and viruses and destroys body oils, suntan lotion, urine and 
other contaminants that readily turn a swimming pool into a murky, scummy mess. 
Ozone also coagulates tiny minerals into larger pieces, making them easier for 
a filter to capture. 
</P>
<P>
 A jolt of electricity or light forms ozone by breaking up oxygen molecules, 
then reforming them into ozone molecules. The problem is ozone lasts only about 
20 minutes before it converts back to oxygen. In a swimming pool, that means an 
ozone generator should run for the better part of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Towne sanitizes his 15-by-75-foot lap pool 12 hours a day using a 
system called "corona discharge," which zaps very dry air with high-voltage 
electricity to create highly concentrated ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks flicker like fireflies trapped inside slender, glass tubes when the 
system is on. The ozone that the sparks create disinfects the pool water in a 
chamber. The gas is vented into carbon filter that absorbs it, while the clean, 
rejuvenated water returns to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "This pool is 100% chlorine-free," said Steve Stubbs, president of Coastline 
Pool Construction of Los Angeles, who installed the unit. "The absolute key is 
(ozone) distribution. . . . I have found that the corona discharge, if it's 
done properly and applied forcefully, is pretty incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubbs added that a serviceman comes twice a week to clean the filters and 
adds only muriatic acid to maintain the pH level. 
</P>
<P>
 Such purity and technology bear a hefty price tag. Stubbs said corona 
discharge systems range from $10,000 to $25,000, depending on the pool's 
configuration, location and needs. Stubbs recently installed a $40,000 set of 
similar ozone units on the Santa Monica YMCA's indoor swimming pools, where 300 
to 400 people swim daily. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the pools are not be chlorine free. A highly concentrated dose of 
ozone cleans the water, then is vented into a special charcoal filter and 
destroyed. Bromine, a halogen related to chlorine, is added just before the 
water goes back into the pool, to conform to a state health code requiring all 
public pools to maintain a free chlorine residual of at least 1.5 parts per 
million while using a stabilizing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 Although homeowners do not have to abide by the free chlorine residual rule, 
many still cannot bear the lofty cost of corona discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is ozone produced by ultraviolet light, with units priced 
(before installation) from $300 for a small spa to $2,500 for a standard pool. 
UV lamps last several years: replacement lamps cost about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 UV light creates a low concentration of ozone, so the ozonated water can be 
injected directly into the pool via special jets or through the pool's return 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The ozonated water bubbles to the surface, sometimes releasing a faint odor. 
"It has an electrical smell, kind of like lightning or what old sewing machines 
give off," described Grant Castleberg, who has used an ozone generator to 
disinfect his Santa Barbara swimming pool for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the ozone concentration is lower and the gas' life is so short, 
Paulette Scoville, a spokesperson for San Luis Obispo-based Del Industries, 
which has manufactured ozone systems for 21 years, recommends that UV-ozone 
owners never turn off their pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Even still, algae and bacteria can overwhelm the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to shock the pool occasionally," said Kim Martin of Golden West 
Pools in Newbury Park. "In their literature, the ozone companies claim a 90% 
reduction (in chlorine consumption). If you use only 10% chlorine, that's 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Castleberg: "I don't have to use chlorine for disinfecting. . . . I 
don't check the chlorine level at all. I just use (chlorine) to control algae." 
</P>
<P>
 A second chlorine alternative is to clean the pool water with ions; an idea 
that has lept from covered wagons to outer space and now to swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Western pioneers are said to have used a rudimentary ionization system to 
purify their drinking water: they dropped copper and silver coins into the 
wooden water casks that they had strapped to their covered wagons. The jerking 
of the wagons apparently jostled the coins enough to release ions to kill 
bacteria and control algae. 
</P>
<P>
 This century, NASA scientists studied using silver ionizers to disinfect 
drinking water on the Apollo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In swimming pools, an ion generator produces silver ions to kill bacteria and 
viruses, and copper ions to kill algae. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing it (ionization) will not do is oxidize organic material, like 
body wastes from swimmers," said Tom Stieb of Nova Specialties in Santa 
Barbara, who installs commercial, computer-controlled ion generators on the 
large, custom pools that he builds. "You have to burn that out occasionally, or 
you will overwhelm ionization as far as algae control." 
</P>
<P>
 Stieb advises his clients to shock their pools with potassium monopersulfate 
once every two weeks in the summer and every six weeks in the winter, instead 
of using chlorine or bromine. He said the granulated powder is a rapid 
oxidizer. "In 10 minutes, it's completely gone. There's no odor. It doesn't 
bleach hair or eat swimming suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Ionization requires precise monitoring of copper levels, total dissolved 
solids (TDS) and pH. Stieb said when the TDS exceed 1,000 ppm, it's time to 
drain the pool. Not willing to leave the pH balance to chance, Stieb routinely 
installs automatic pH controllers along with the ionization units. Packages 
range in price from $4,000 to $6,000, including $1,500 for a pH controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Much smaller, less sophisticated residential model ionizers cost about $500, 
with the ion-generating unit mounted on the pool's return line. Stieb said the 
flow cell that dissolves the silver and copper into the water typically lasts 
four to six months. Replacement cells may cost $50 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Big or small, ion generators are controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell you right upfront, they (ionizers) work. But there are 
problems. Water chemistry is more important than anything else," said Ernie 
Nebiolini of Sunrise Pools in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they get too much copper into the pool, that turns the walls blue," 
Nebiolini said. "You get all kinds of algae problems. They do not work 
efficiently above 90 or so degrees. People were calling me and saying 'My pool 
is turning green.' 'It smells.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nebiolini said he "got burned" by ionizers. He finally removed "many, many" 
ionizers that he had installed and replaced them with devices called chlorine 
generators, the third popular method of sanitizing swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorine generators create a simple form of chlorine out of rock salt. 
</P>
<P>
 In-line chlorine generators, sometimes called saltwater generators, call for 
dumping several bags of rock salt directly into the pool water. The salty water 
circulates through the filter system. A small electrical charge zips through 
the water just before the water returns to the pool, splitting the salt into 
sodium and simple chlorine or hypochlorous acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hypochlorous acid is very unique in that its properties maintain a 
bacteria-free pool without a chloramine buildup," said Ron Cardinal, general 
manager of Kreepy Krauly West, a manufacturer of pool-cleaning equipment. "You 
never ever have to shock a pool with an electrolytic converter because you 
always have a pool that is free of chloramines." 
</P>
<P>
 Organic chloramines -- byproducts after the chlorine has done its work -- are 
what swimmers should truly blame when they complain about a stench of chlorine, 
said Terry Fitch, vice president and general manager of Anthony Pools in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're smelling chlorine that means there are chloramines in the water. 
The water molecule has a casing on it, so it's not accepting the sanitizer," 
Fitch explained. "I don't go near a pool where I can smell the chlorine." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Pools' chlorine generators convert salt to an ounce of chlorine gas a 
day in a brine tank. A venturi tube feeds the gas into the return line just 
before the water flows back into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do more renovation of old pools than new pools. . . . We won't put a 
saltwater generator on an old pool because we know there's going to be some 
reaction on the galvanized and copper piping," Fitch said. "(But) because we're 
making chlorine off-site, there's no negative impact on the pipes." 
</P>
<P>
 The process that creates chlorine gas also produces caustic lye. Fitch said 
the lye is automatically bled off, fed into the pool water and used as a pH 
buffer, reducing the need to add as much muriatic acid to balance the pH. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Pools commonly packages its chlorine generators with two other 
specialty products. A series of zinc baffles installed within the plumbing 
releases zinc ions to kill algae. And a band of super magnets, strapped onto 
the pipes, causes any tiny mineral particles to coagulate, to reach a size 
large enough for a filter to trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the three-part system costs about $1,600 to install. Single 
in-line, saltwater chlorine generators range from $550 to $1,000 or more, with 
installation extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the type of chlorine generator, proponents say the best thing 
about the units is that they maintain the chlorine at a constant balance, 
preventing the water -- and swimmers -- from suffering wild swings in chlorine 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem for a typical guy who doesn't have automation is that the 
chlorine level is all over the place," Fitch said. "The water looks terrible, 
so he pours in chlorine. Then the level is too high. The first person who 
swims, their hair turns all green." 
</P>
<P>
 Aida Barta said she's been pleased to discover that she can dive in and swim 
with her eyes open while her saltwater generator chlorinates her Camarillo lap 
pool. Adds Dusty Bruce, a saltwater user in Fullerton, "There's no red eyes. 
You can't taste it. Your hair doesn't turn green." 
</P>
<P>
 A few pool owners using in-line generators, however, said they did detect a 
mild salty taste in their water. One described it as similar to saline solution 
used to clean soft contact lenses. Kreepy Krauly recommends a salt level of 
2,500 ppm: a teardrop is three times as salty as that. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West Pool's Kim Martin views the slightly elevated salt levels as a 
bonus. "They're great systems because the salt level in the pool is the same as 
your body. The pool doesn't pull the salts out of your body like a chlorinated 
pool does, so it doesn't dry out your skin."

AT HOME: RENEWAL SPARKS CITY WITH A VANTAGE POINT; SIGNAL HILL: REDEVELOPMENT 
PLAN IS PAYING OFF FOR CITY THAT HAS VIEW OF LONG BEACH HARBOR AND BEYOND. 
</P>

 When Neena Strichart hears children playing in her Signal Hill neighborhood, 
the sounds bring back pleasant memories. Often the kids are those of a neighbor 
and friend from the days when the two of them were growing up in that same 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents bought this house (in 1965), when I was 10 years old," Strichart 
said, "and I bought it from my mother in the late 1980s." Strichart paid 
$160,000 for the 1928 two-bedroom Spanish-style stucco with a small guest 
house. Her mother, Marjorie Gromme, had bought a condo about five blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a happy neighborhood," she said. "My husband, Steve, and I plan to 
stay here always. If we ever move, it will be to the top of the hill to a 
condominium when we are ready to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Signal Hill, with 8,800 residents in 2 1/2 square miles, is an incorporated 
city that is completely surrounded by the city of Long Beach. The western 
border is Atlantic Avenue, the southern borders are Redondo and Temple, and 
Spring and Wardlow form the northern border. Long Beach Municipal Airport 
adjoins the northeast tip of Signal Hill, and the San Diego (405) Freeway 
offers three exits to Signal Hill as it runs through the northern edge of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 When people talk about moving to the top of the 365-foot-high dome for which 
Signal Hill is named, they often are seeking a view of the Long Beach Harbor, 
the Queen Mary and Catalina Island. Hundreds of years ago, this high piece of 
ground provided a vantage point for Indians to send smoke signals to other 
tribes in the coastal basin, Catalina Island and the San Pedro peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1700s, the territory that included Signal Hill was colonized as 
Alta California and was ruled by King Carlos III of Spain. In the early 1800s, 
six ranchos were created, each with access to the hill, again affording an 
advantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-1800s, two immigrants from New England, Abel Stearns and 
Jonathan Temple, known as the Yankee Dons, each bought a rancho that included 
portions of Signal Hill. That same hill became a festive gathering place for an 
annual spring horse race that was a rivalry between Stearns and Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 A terrible drought in the mid-1880s wiped out what had been successful cattle 
operations. In 1866 the Stearns and Temple ranchos, Los Alamitos and Los 
Cerritos, with the dome right in the middle, were bought by Flint, Bixby and 
Co., a partnership of three cousins from Maine. Members of the Bixby family 
continue to own property in the area and have maintained a presence in Signal 
Hill. Alamitos Land Co., owned by the Bixby family, plans to build 
single-family homes on the hill's southeast slope. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day Signal Hill was created by an oil boom that began in June, 1921, 
when Alamitos No. 1 blew a gusher that changed the destiny of the hilltop. By 
February, 1922, there were 400 rigs at work. In 1924, the oil producers 
incorporated the city to avoid a barrel tax proposed by the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, Signal Hill and its oil industry dealt with the Great 
Depression, and, in the 1940s, World War II, when oil production soared and the 
city thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s and '60's oil operations were scaled back. And from the mid-1970s 
to today, Signal Hill has experienced change, headlines and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal redevelopment plan was adopted by the City Council in 1974 that 
called initially for improving the city's infrastructure as well as park and 
common area upgrades. In 1982 the redevelopment focused on economic growth and 
a balanced, business-friendly community. 
</P>
<P>
 This was also a period when Signal Hill was in the headlines. In 1981, Ron 
Settles, a Long Beach City College football star, was arrested for speeding in 
Signal Hill. Police said Settles wielded a 9-inch butcher knife at three 
officers and refused to hand over his driver's license. A small quantity of 
cocaine was found in the car he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 90 minutes of being placed in a cell, he was found hanging from a cell 
bar with mattress cover tied around his neck. There were accusations that he 
had been beaten. No police officers were charged in the case, however, and a 
wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Settles family was settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment policy began to pay off in the mid-1980s, with major 
retailers coming to town, including Office Depot, Price Club, Home Depot, 
PetsMart, Auto Parts Club and soon a Toys-R-Us. There is a six-dealership auto 
center on Cherry Avenue. Today, oil revenues account for less than $180,000 of 
the city's $10 million annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy McClanahan has been in Signal Hill long enough to have witnessed much of 
the recent history unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, with her and her two sisters, moved into a small rental in 1922. 
Three years later, her father bought the house for $3,950. McClanahan and her 
husband, Roland, bought the house from her parents in 1938 for $4,250 and 
raised their son Jack, there. A widow now, McClanahan still lives there and 
works part time for Signal Hill Office Supply. 
</P>
<P>
 McClanahan recalls the oil derricks that once dominated the hill. "I liked 
them. It kind of fit into the name Signal Hill," she said. "I also remember the 
nice Japanese gardens on the east side of the hill before (World War II). We 
used to go up to get our vegetables. I've seen the town go from the oil fields 
to business." 
</P>
<P>
 Signal Hill has also developed as a town with more condos and townhouses than 
single-family homes. In the Multiple Listing Service, according to realtor 
Valerie Condon of ReMax Real Estate Specialists, there are 73 condo units 
available, priced from $99,000 for a two-bedroom, 1 3/4-bath unit to $239,000 
for a three-bedroom and three-bath unit, while only 17 houses are listing, with 
prices from $99,900 for three bedrooms and one bath to $360,000 for a 
five-bedrooms, 3 1/2- bath house with a view. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the 1980s, they overbuilt the area with condos and townhouses," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that many of the units take advantage of the spectacular view. "This 
has the potential some day to be like a Rolling Hills Estates, or a Palos 
Verdes. The views are incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the resale homes offered and the Alamitos Land Co. project of 280 
single and multifamily units, Coscan-Davidson Homes will soon begin 
construction of two 21-unit buildings. The company holds development rights to 
the 525-unit Hilltop Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Martha Jennifer Sadler began looking for a mobile home to buy, her 
realtor, Valerie Condon, suggested she would be better off to look at a condo, 
and they began looking in Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 She found a two-bedroom unit with a fireplace that she liked and bought it for 
$113,500, moving in in October, 1993. Her unit has a view of the Queen Mary 
from the patio off the master bedroom. The complex has about 80 units, and a 
pool, Jacuzzi and weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful here," she said. "I have everything I wanted and needed for 
the rest of my life. . . . I'm a native of Long Beach, and living in Signal 
Hill lets me be close to my job at McDonnell Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach, 
but away from Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadler said that she is particularly impressed with the Signal Hill Police 
Department, and how safe she feels in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Meicht and her husband, Mike, and son Marc are also new homeowners in 
Signal Hill and quite happy with their recently purchased townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lived in Signal Hill for 14 years as renters. We wanted to buy here 
because it's such a nice community -- a city within a city -- very safe with a 
little country look to it, " said Brenda Meicht. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked into this townhouse I fell in love immediately but thought it 
was out of our category. We put in a bid -- it was a repossession -- and we 
bought in the mid-$150,000 range. It was in good shape, with white Berber 
carpet, a wet bar, a beautiful fireplace. It is a trilevel. The living room is 
spacious, and we have a beautiful balcony and two private patios. It is a 
beautiful building with a lovely entrance -- kind of has a Fifth Avenue look." 
</P>
<P>
 Meicht said that they could have purchased a home with a view, but the one 
they settled on appealed to her far beyond what a view offered. "We have two 
huge bedrooms, three full baths and about 1,800 square feet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are particularly impressed with the safety of the neighborhood and 
the quick response time of the police department, Meicht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Risings, an investigator and public information officer with the 
30-officer department, said that the problems they deal with are much like 
those of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see some domestic violence, some traffic accidents," she said. "We have a 
graffiti program. As soon as it is found in the city, it is cleaned up. We keep 
a good handle on it." At a Glance

YOUR MORTGAGE; UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPOUND ACCOUNTS WORK

 What is an impound account? 
</P>
<P>
 An impound account is an account that's set up by a lender to collect funds 
from the borrower that are used to pay future property tax bills and hazard 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 After closing, you'll pay one-twelfth of your insurance premium and property 
tax bill to the lender each month for as long as you have an impound account. 
The impound amount is usually added to your principal and interest payment so 
that you make just one payment per month to the lender. The lender is then 
responsible for paying your property tax and insurance bills. 
</P>
<P>
 An impound account is almost always required if the borrower makes a down 
payment of 10% of the purchase price or less. Lenders, however, do have the 
option of requiring an impound account if the borrower makes a down payment of 
less than 20% of the purchase price. This requirement will vary from one lender 
to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is collected from the borrower at closing to set up the impound account. 
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) limits how much a lender can 
require a buyer to deposit in an impound account. This amount will vary 
depending on when you close. If the property tax bill was recently paid and the 
next installment isn't due for some time, the amount required to start the 
impound account will be less than it'll be if the property taxes need to be 
paid in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount collected at closing will usually be enough to cover several months 
worth of taxes and insurance. Since the lender also collects the first year's 
hazard insurance premium at closing, an impound account requirement can add 
significantly to your closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most borrowers prefer not to have an impound account unless it's 
required, some borrowers prefer having one because it relieves them of the 
obligation of having to make several relatively large payments a year. An 
impound account might be a good idea if you're on a tight budget, or if you've 
had difficulty managing your money in the past. Even if an impound account 
isn't required, the lender gives you the option at closing of having one if you 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: The irony of the impound-account requirement is that it's 
required of borrowers who have the least amount of money to put down. Most 
cash-strapped first-time buyers have difficulty scraping together enough money 
for a 10% down payment, plus closing costs. This is precisely the situation 
where lenders insist on an impound account, which adds to the amount of cash 
the buyer will need at closing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a way to get around this requirement. Many lenders will waive the 
impound account requirement if the borrower puts slightly more than 10% down. 
For example, if you can put enough cash down to equal 10.1% of the purchase 
price, you can probably avoid having an impound account. You'll still be 
required to buy private mortgage insurance (PMI) which protects the lender from 
a buyer default. PMI is required by most lenders when the borrower puts less 
than 20% cash down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: If you do end up with an impound account, make sure to carefully 
monitor the payment of your property taxes and insurance premiums. Lenders make 
mistakes. If the lender fails to pay your property taxes or insurance bills 
when they're due, you could end up with a negative credit rating. The lender is 
responsible for making these payments, so you can justifiably argue the point 
with the credit rating agency. But it's usually a hassle to correct errors on 
credit reports.

SOUTHLAND HOME SALES UP 20% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes in Southern California are up by 20% in the 
first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year, 
according to TRW REDI Property Data, a nationwide real estate information 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Between January and August, more than 138,000 single-family homes and condos 
closed escrow in the six-county region, with an average selling price of 
$210,135. Sales were particularly strong in Orange and Riverside counties, 
which showed increases of 26.2% and 23.5%, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q.: We are running out of space in this house and are trying to decide between 
adding on to it or buying a new home. Which makes more sense? 
</P>
<P>
 A.: Homeowners should consider several questions before making a choice 
between adding on to an existing home or moving up to a bigger house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How much money is available, either from cash reserves or through a home 
improvement loan, to remodel the current house? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How much space is required? Would the foundation support a second floor or 
does the lot have room to expand on the ground level? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What do local zoning and building ordinances permit? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How much equity already exists in the property? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are there properties for sale that would satisfy housing needs? 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the decision should be based on individual needs, the work 
involved and what will add value. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the "Cost vs. Value Report," published annually by Remodeling 
Magazine, among the hottest improvement projects in 1993 were family room 
remodels and master bed-bath suites. Growing families made bedroom additions 
more popular than ever, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, consider limitations of your neighborhood. It makes more sense to add on 
to the smallest house than to further improve the largest one.

REALTORS VOICE OPINIONS ON 'AS IS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take exception to Robert Bruss' out-of-date and uninformed opinion in the 
Real Estate Q&A column on Sept. 18 ("Can Agent Make Seller List Home 'As 
Is'?"). 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, no broker can make sellers list their properties "as is." 
Professional agents give sellers informed advice and leave the ultimate 
decision to the seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, it is not a "major mistake" to list "as is" as Bruss contends, nor 
does it tell prospective buyers to be especially wary. It merely acknowledges 
the reality of today's litigious environment. As a consumer advocate, Bruss 
should applaud "as is," which introduces the realistic expectations that 
prevent buyers' post-sale disappointment, fairly apportions responsibility and 
avoids lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss is misinformed that "as is" lowers property value. He may be mistaken 
because some professional sellers that use "as is" happen to also be handling 
troubled and damaged properties; foreclosures and probates, for example, are 
offered by the courts in "as is" condition to protect the heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 By law all sellers must disclose all known defects. Sellers have this 
obligation whether they choose to sell "as is" or choose to warrant the 
condition of their home. But since few sellers are engineers or building 
contractors, they are not qualified to warrant the condition of their home, nor 
should they be expected to. 
</P>
<P>
 Our responsibility to our clients mandates that we strongly recommend 
sensible, forward-looking consumer protection measures such as "as is," 
measures that put liabilities where they belong and are appropriate for 
marketing real estate in the '90s.

<P>
 We are in complete agreement with Robert J. Bruss' answer that an "as is" sale 
is perceived as a red-flag warning to buyers to be especially careful and that 
offering a home for sale in "as is" condition does not bring top price for the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is our strong opinion that to offer a home for sale "as is" is a disservice 
to both buyers and sellers.

TRY INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT FOR BUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was surprised to see your "Gardening Q&A" columnists' advice about 
controlling the proliferation of aphids (Sept. 4). Today, integrated pest 
management (IPM), not toxic spraying, is the way to go. He should be aware of 
growing concern over the possible adverse health effects of the chemical 
poisons he recommends. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Beverly Hills' Health Commission (four of its five members are 
physicians) and the City's Recreation and Parks Commission have endorsed the 
IPM methodology. The City Council has approved the purchase and release of both 
ladybugs and lacewings to help control the annual aphid infestation of certain 
street trees. 
</P>
<P>
 So far we have met with considerable success. However, it will take time for 
this technique to be as fully effective as we want it to be. But for the 
health-sensitive and concerned among us, it is definitely the preferred way to 
go.

ON-LINE APPRAISAL IS SIMPLY MARKET DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the article on on-line appraisals ("Should Lenders Opt for 
On-Line Appraisals?" Sept. 4), the technology is not new, just the packaging. 
As a real estate appraiser, I can gather the same information, and more, in 
minutes, to get an idea of a probable price range of what a specific home may 
be worth. Is this an appraisal? Hardly. It is simply market data, and from this 
the valuation process begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Many factors at and around a specific property decide where in a price range 
the value of the property may fall, or if it is worth even less or more than 
preliminary research may have indicated. Remodeling, special features or 
upgrades, quality of construction, deferred maintenance, earthquake damage, 
infestation, environmental hazards and proximity to traffic noise and other 
nuisances are just a few factors that an appraiser must observe, in person, to 
begin to pin down the value of a specific property. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive at a specific value from market data alone, which is what the new 
system does, is at best a disservice to many homeowners who may be turned down 
for mortgage loans because they didn't quite fall in the proper place on a 
computers generated graph or analysis. At worst it is a dangerous tool by which 
many loans will be granted without thorough, independent analysis. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The utilization of on-line appraisal services to determine market value will 
have dire consequences well beyond that experienced during savings and loan 
crises of the 1980s. No amount of electronic data can tell a lender the 
condition of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 As an appraiser with over 10 year's experience with FHA as well as 
conventional lenders, I can assure you that numerous problems will result from 
using on-line appraisal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing illustrates the dilemma better than a property I recently appraised. 
The owner of that property believed that the property was worth $450,000. The 
comparable property suggested a value of $400,000. I appraised the property for 
$290,000. Public records incorrectly reported that the property was 200 square 
feet larger than it turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, that same property was in substantially inferior condition when 
compared to the surrounding properties. These factors as well as others 
resulted in a much lower value than would be suggested by a data service 
appraisal. Is a $300 appraisal fee too much to pay to prevent a mistaken 
overestimation of $110,000? I think not.

11 DISTRICT COST OF FUNDS INDEX STABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the letter from the loan officer ("11th District Cost of Funds 
Index Down Side") who took issue with Robert J. Bruss' article, I find myself 
compelled to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no other indexes that have consistently proven to be as stable as 
the 11th District Cost of Funds (COFI index).In fact, it has never moved more 
than 2% in any calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her statement that the majority of COFI adjustable loans have negative 
amortization is typical of the misinformation that is prevalent in our 
industry. COFI loans, like all the indexes, come in many different shapes and 
sizes. The most popular of these gives the Borrower the option of negative 
amortization.

IN DEFENSE OF CHLORINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joan Bolton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of discussing alternatives to chlorine, it's important to note 
that the people who make and sell conventional chlorine products say that 
chlorine too often gets a bum rap. They say poor overall pool care is more to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 factor is the pH. Too much acid or too much alkalinity will cause a 
lot of performance problems " said Jeff Cornett, president of Chem Lab 
Products, which produces and packages swimming pool chemicals. "Itchy, 
irritated skin, burning of the eyes, scale buildup on tile, on equipment -- 
those are generally associated with pH, not the performance of chlorine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Green hair is another issue," said Brian McDermott, president and CEO of 
Leslie's Swimming Pool Supplies, a chain that sells traditional chlorine 
products as well as alternative sanitizers. "Generally, the biggest culprit is 
copper, from copper algaecide. Or from a chemical imbalance, causing metals 
from the equipment to leach into the water." 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott added, "We really advise swimming pool owners to look at their care 
of the total system. It is rarely just one little thing that makes a dramatic 
difference." Joan Bolton

HOW SAFE IS CHLORINATED WATER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BOLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is chlorinated water safe? 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, chlorine's nationwide use as a disinfectant in municipal 
water sources has prevented thousands of deaths from people drinking 
contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a landmark study in 1992 by Robert D. Morris of the Medical College of 
Wisconsin in Milwaukee concluded that people who drink chlorinated water run 
greater risks of contracting bladder and rectal cancer than those who drink 
non-chlorinated water. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris linked 4,200 new cases of bladder cancer and 6,500 new cases of rectal 
cancer in the United States each year to drinking chlorinated water. 
</P>
<P>
 A follow-up study by scientists at the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences in 1993 pointed to byproducts formed when the chlorine reacted 
with contaminants as the likely causes of the cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that the chlorine levels in our drinking water and our 
public swimming pools generally match: both are typically required to contain 
at least 1.5 parts per million free chlorine residual. (State code allows a 1 
ppm chlorine residual in public swimming pools if a stabilizing chemical is not 
used. However, Los Angeles County Department of Health Services official 
Richard Kebabjian estimates that at least 75% of public pools do use 
stabilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 But while scientists have studied the risks of chlorinating drinking water, 
they have paid scant attention to chlorine in swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Among few studies is one that Kebabjian, as chief environmental health 
specialist for the county's recreational health program, is currently helping 
to conduct into the feasibility of drinking swimming pool water during an 
emergency, such as a major earthquake. Kebabjian expects to issue a report 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ken Cantor, an epidemiologist with the National Cancer Institute who 
specializes in analyzing the effects of chlorine in drinking water, knew of 
only two recent studies related to pool water. Scientists in Italy in 1990 and 
1993 monitored the chloroform levels of people swimming in indoor pools 
(chloroform is a common byproduct when chlorine reacts to organic substances in 
the water). 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian scientists found that all of the swimmers ingested at least some 
chloroform, but did not say whether that ingestion might affect the swimmers' 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent much scientific inquiry into pool water, Morris said he is most 
concerned about breathing chlorine byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can absorb some of the chlorination byproducts in your skin. You can also 
absorb by inhaling," he said. "In swimming pools, you're dealing with prolonged 
exposure for people who are swimming regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 On a broader scale, last February the International Joint Commission on the 
Great Lakes region recommended phasing out all chlorine products. 
</P>
<P>
 And Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner has proposed a 
new study into chlorine's health effects. A "national strategy for 
substituting, reducing, or prohibiting the use of chlorine and chlorinated 
compounds" would follow within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "No decisions have been made," said EPA spokesman John Kasper. "Everything is 
contingent on the study, which has yet to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Kasper: "There have been studies that have suggested that some of the 
byproducts are carcinogens . . . . (But) there was a time in this country when 
waterborne diseases ran rampant. Chlorine disinfection has huge, huge, health 
benefits that shouldn't be lost when you're talking about some of the other 
problems."

HANDYMAN Q&A: REPAIRING VINYL FLOOR SEAMS IS AN EASY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By POPULAR MECHANICS, FOR AP SPECIAL FEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Our vinyl floor is separating at the seams in some areas. What's the 
best way of repairing this condition? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: You can close simple tears and separated seams in vinyl flooring by 
buying an inexpensive seam-sealing kit. Make sure it's the same brand as your 
vinyl. In some cases you'll need to re-glue the vinyl to the floor. While this 
is easy enough to do, it's usually not required. In any case, you simply apply 
a little flooring mastic to the undersides of the separated vinyl and press it 
back in place. To keep it there while it dries, set several books or a brick on 
the seam or tear for a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
 With the vinyl stuck firmly in place, insert the applicator tip of the sealer 
bottle into the seam or tear, and pull it along until the entire seam or tear 
has a coating of sealer. Allow it to dry completely before resuming traffic in 
that area. How Much Ventilation Does Attic Fan Need?

 Q: I am considering installing an electric attic fan in my roof. I've been 
told that because I have only small openings in the gable ends of my house, 
I'll need more ventilating holes for the fan to work properly. How much venting 
is needed for the turbine vents which are turned by the wind? Would this be a 
better solution to my problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The FHA Minimum Property Standards require that 1/150 of the ceiling area 
be free ventilating area. A 20- by 30-foot ceiling equals 600 square feet. 
Multiplied by 1/150, that equals 4 square feet of vents. You can reduce this to 
1/300 of the ceiling area if 50% of the ventilators are in the upper portion of 
the roof. They must be at least 3 feet above the eave or cornice vents. You can 
also reduce the square footage area by the same amount if there is a vapor 
barrier not exceeding one perm on the warm side of the ceiling. An 
electric-powered fan will move air more effectively than a wind turbine. What's 
Causing Painted Clapboard to Blister? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I had my clapboard siding painted about three months ago and the paint is 
now starting to blister. The boards were scraped, sanded and primed before 
painting, and a good quality paint was used on the job. What could be causing 
this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Paint blisters are caused by two factors -- painting when it's very hot or 
in direct sunlight, or by moisture. In the former case, the blisters form very 
quickly -- no more than a couple of days. Your problem is more likely caused by 
moisture in the form of water vapor that is trapped inside the walls. The 
moisture, which originates from cooking, baths, showers, etc., seeks to escape 
by penetrating right through your siding and pushing off the exterior paint in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow the moisture to escape through a path of lesser resistance by opening 
windows after you shower, installing exhaust fans and installing vents in the 
siding.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Disbud your camellias, leaving only one bloom bud per branch to get the 
largest blossoms.Leave some further down the stem for later bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant Bearded Iris this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prune deadwood and weak or diseased branches of trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pull out summer vegetable plants and annuals that are spent and add them to 
your compost pile.

GREEN THUMB; JUST A PLOT OF LAND, NOT A LOT OF LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

waiting for her bookkeeping career to take off.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Monet's elegant, painterly gardens or Martha Stewart's over-amped 
horticultural compulsions are what many aspire to, the reality of most of our 
situations is quite different. The world is filled with people who have the 
muse but not the means to create their own tiny Edens. 
</P>
<P>
 My reality is an apartment in an unfashionable pocket between Silverlake and 
Los Feliz where all the flower pots I had lovingly tended seemed to walk away 
on little feet of their own during the night. Indifferently maintained lawns, 
ranging in color from green to beige, accessorized by bushes shaved into 
geometric patterns, are maintained by a slash-and-burn gardening team that 
appear to have an excessive fondness for small, gasoline-powered engines. 
</P>
<P>
 After many years of gazing in despair at the two 12-by-12-foot plots of 
half-dead grass in front of my apartment, I had one of those epiphanous 
moments. Composing an embarrassingly unctuous note to the landlord, I proposed 
that if he would allow me to take over the care of the area directly in front 
of my apartment, I would plant drought-tolerant plants (thereby keeping his 
water costs down to a minimum) and the gardeners could skip my place while 
continuing to plunder the rest of the block. He agreed. An additional 
consideration was to keep my own costs to a minimum; my income is what can only 
generously be described as moderate, and, let's face it, I am toiling in 
someone else's field. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weekends were spent digging up the remnants of the lawn with a 
borrowed shovel and hand trowel bought for 59 cents at Sav-On. I severely 
pruned back the long neglected lantana so it would cascade over the brick 
retaining wall instead of growing into the tangled hedge it had become. When 
all the lawn had been dug up, I spread steer manure over the soil, turned it 
lightly, watered and turned it again. I also put down stepping stones scavenged 
from demolished buildings and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, I planned to only use seeds in an effort to keep costs to a 
minimum. California poppies and nasturtiums are easily started from seeds and 
nasturtiums, in particular, take off quickly and bloom abundantly, giving early 
gratification to the nascent gardener. However, my experience with seeds in 
general is that it's too tedious a procedure with very iffy results. Target and 
Home Depot sell pony packs of alyssum, lobelia, Mexican sage and other 
drought-tolerant plants for $1.49, the same price as a pack of seeds and with 
much better odds for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraniums are a good choice for the low-budget gardener. They grow everywhere 
in Los Angeles and are easily started from cuttings; each joint on the stem can 
potentially take root. The best technique I found is to start cuttings in a 
gruel consistency solution of water, potting soil and root hormone. There are 
many beautiful varieties of geranium (no longer the weedy, neglected plant, 
once the scourge of so many California gardens) and once established, they take 
off quickly, again, giving early gratification to the budding gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 I longed for a bougainvillea, but even the cheapest ($4 at Home Depot) was 
more than I felt comfortable spending. Everyone told me bougainvillea don't 
take as cuttings, but what did I have to lose? 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving a cutting in a rooting solution for two weeks, I planted it. 
After three more weeks and no action, I decided to dig the thing up. But when I 
knelt down to do the deed, I noticed two microscopic green buds at a stem joint 
-- I couldn't have been more ecstatic if I'd birthed the thing myself. Don't 
listen to negative advice: It may be difficult to start something from a 
cutting or seed, but it's certainly worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps at this point I should mention what I would hope is obvious: Don't 
steal. Always seek out and ask the owner or tenant of the property if you may 
take a cutting or a few bricks for stepping stones or whatever. You'll be 
surprised how many people are more than happy to help a fellow gardener, and 
besides, even if they say no, you meet a lot of really nice people. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the most surprising result of my little gardening foray is social. 
Understand that I am as far from sociable as you can get. I barely knew any of 
my long-time neighbors and have always been way too shy to even pass the time 
of day with local merchants with whom I've done business for many years. But 
being outside on weekends and weekday evenings, well people just naturally stop 
and chat. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Victor, the mailman, is an avid gardener who not only takes 
care of his place, but his brother's yard also. The woman who walks her whippet 
down our street invited me to come by her house for cuttings. My friend and 
neighbor, Everett, was invaluable in lending me tools and helping me prune the 
bushes into more natural shapes, and the older couple across the street shyly 
presented me with a small plant they had bought for me.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the little girls, one smart and astonishingly agile, and the 
other shy, with her sweet, soft little voice, who love to help weed and trim 
off spent blossoms. Whenever I'm out, they come by and help. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening has taught me to move through the world differently. What exactly is 
growing in someone's yard, or along the freeway, or in a vacant lot? It teaches 
humility in its best sense. It brings you back into the world's details and 
imparts a sense of the divine through the experience of small, mundane 
miracles. All kinds of people have gardens of some sort and they all seem to 
love to talk about them. One of my neighbors told me that every time she passes 
by my little garden, it makes her smile. Me too.

HAITI: CAN WE 'DO THE RIGHT THING'?; THE CARTERIZATION OF CLINTON

 There was a picture of a carnival procession, men, women and children wearing 
bright masks. Of a morning. . .The harsh colors gave an impression of gaiety, 
the drummers and trumpeters seemed about to play a lively air. Only when you 
came closer you saw how ugly the masks were and how the masquers surrounded a 
cadaver in grave-clothes; then the primitive colors went flat. . .Wherever that 
picture hung, I would feel Haiti close to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Greene, "The Comedians" 1965 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have always been of two minds about Jimmy Carter. We admire his 
decency, integrity and moral courage; he's a good preacher. But he's also 
feckless, naive and ineffectual; he's a lousy leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? Carter's done it again. On Monday, he looked like a triumphant 
peacemaker. On Tuesday, he looked like a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 And look what he did to President Bill Clinton. In his Sept. 15 speech to the 
nation, Clinton accused the Haitian military regime of creating a "reign of 
terror . . . executing children, raping women, killing priests." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear," Clinton said. "Cedras and his accomplices alone are 
responsible for this suffering and terrible human tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, we signed an agreement, brokered by Carter and approved by 
Clinton, that commits U.S. forces to work "in close cooperation" and "with 
mutual respect" with Haiti's military and police forces.  
</P>
<P>
 We saw what that meant Tuesday. As Haitians gathered to celebrate the arrival 
of U.S. troops, Haitian police attacked them with whips and rifle butts. At 
least two demonstrators were clubbed to death. U.S. troops stood by and watched 
in disgust. That, apparently, is "mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to create an "in-your-face" atmosphere," a Defense Department 
official said. "What you really want to do is co-opt them over time." Sure. 
That's exactly how you deal with thugs and murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans believe Clinton is a good and decent man who wants to do the 
right thing. But according to the Gallup poll, the perception has been growing 
all year that Clinton "can't get the job done." The public is divided over 
whether he's "tough enough for the job." In other words, the Carterization of 
Bill Clinton continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti was an enormous gamble on Clinton's part. He was out there all alone. 
The public opposed sending troops to Haiti. Congress was in open revolt. The 
President didn't even have his own party behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are not isolationists. The U.S. public has two objectives in world 
affairs. One is to do good. The other is to stay out of trouble. The problem 
is, every time we try to do good, we end up getting in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 1992, Americans supported intervention in Somalia to save people 
from starvation. We wanted to do good. And last week, according to the polls, 
Clinton persuaded Americans it was worth sending U.S. troops to Haiti to stop 
abuses of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did the public oppose sending U.S. troops? Not because Americans didn't 
want to do good, but because they weren't convinced it would work. Americans 
believe military missions should have a military purpose: to drive Iraq out of 
Kuwait, to deliver food to starving people. We want a problem we can solve, 
quickly and decisively, like the Persian Gulf. If it looks like we're getting 
involved in another country's politics and Americans start getting killed, 
public support collapses, as it did in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The smartest thing George Bush ever did as President was not to take Gen. H. 
Norman Schwarzkopf's advice and overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. If we 
had, the United States would have been responsible for everything that happened 
in Iraqi politics. In Somalia, we pretended the famine was some kind of natural 
disaster, like an earthquake. We discovered pretty quickly what we should have 
known all along -- the famine was caused by politics. There was no way we could 
solve the problem without entangling ourselves in Somali politics. The minute 
that happened, we were out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way we can solve Haiti's problems without becoming entangled in 
Haitian politics. Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) calls it "gunboat liberalism." The 
minute we install Aristide as president, he becomes our man. And we become 
responsible for everything that happens in Haiti. That's what gets us in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 So Carter came to the rescue. He made a last-minute deal with the Haitian 
military. The initial response, from the American public and from Congress, was 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 For about a day, it looked like it might even be a diplomatic triumph for 
Clinton -- his Cuban missile crisis. We went eyeball-to-eyeball, and they 
blinked. Clinton said the military rulers of Haiti would go, and they promised 
to go. Of course, they promised the same thing last year, too -- so don't 
celebrate yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the crisis make Clinton look tough? Well, the Haitian military rulers 
didn't believe his threats until the last possible minute. He had to go to 
extraordinary lengths to prove the United States was serious about using force. 
They only believed us when, according to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, 
our forces were "cocked, primed and ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had to send a former President, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and the current chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to 
prove he meant business. Remember Theodore Roosevelt's "Talk softly, and carry 
a big stick"? That's what we did in Haiti. But it was Carter who talked softly. 
Gen. Colin L. Powell carried the big stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti was not the Cuban missile crisis. Without a Cold War, how could it be? 
Haiti is a weak and impoverished country, not backed by any rival superpower. 
There is no nuclear threat, no threat of a world war. The Cuban missile crisis 
was exactly the kind of foreign policy Americans like. The United States 
threatened, the Soviets backed down and it was over. We never had to go into 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 But look where we are now. In Haiti. In the middle of Haitian politics. That's 
why, even after the deal was announced, Americans still said they opposed 
sending U.S. troops into Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military has always resisted the notion that our troops can perform a 
police function. That's why they were first told not to interfere as Haitians 
were brutalized by police forces. But by Thursday, troops were told they could 
step in. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public is saying is, "How did we get involved in the first place?"  
</P>
<P>
 Ask Carter. Carter said he told Cedras he was embarrassed by U.S. policy 
toward Haiti, particularly the embargo. "I made a very emotional speech," 
Carter said in Atlanta Monday night. "I was ashamed of my country's policy." 
</P>
<P>
 So he drew up an agreement allowing the military rulers to remain in office 
until Oct. 15. And with no requirement that they leave Haiti. Carter called it 
"a serious violation of inherent human rights for a citizen to be forced into 
exile." The agreement also calls for a general amnesty for the military.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton accepted the deal. Now it's under attack from all sides. Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide has refused to endorse it. Randall Robinson, the activist whose hunger 
strike moved Clinton to act on Haiti, denounced the deal, saying, "It's 
tantamount to ending World War II and telling Nazi war criminals they're 
welcome to stay with their assets and with amnesty and work with the Germans to 
try to re-establish democracy." Conservative Rush Limbaugh put it succinctly: 
"Cedras is clearly the winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it was never Carter's intention to make him feel like a loser. Last 
week, The Los Angeles Times published the transcript of a phone conversation 
between Carter and Cedras, in which Carter invited Cedras to teach at his 
Sunday school. "Rosalynn sometimes says that I'm too sympathetic to people who 
are unsavory," Carter told the New York Times, "but I have to understand their 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of that horrifying interview, Carter acknowledged that back in 
1990, he wrote every member of the U.N. Security Council -- except Margaret 
Thatcher -- urging them to vote against the resolution authorizing the use of 
force in the Persian Gulf. He said, "I sent President Bush a copy so I wouldn't 
go behind the President's back." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also told the New York Times, "The key to Cedras's decision was his 
wife. Mrs. Cedras was impressive, powerful and forceful. And attractive. She 
was slim and very attractive." It's the same old Carter. He still lusting in 
his heart after women.

HAITI: CAN WE 'DO THE RIGHT THING'?; CONCESSIONS TO MAKE A DEMOCRACY

 There was a picture of a carnival procession, men, women and children wearing 
bright masks. Of a morning. . .The harsh colors gave an impression of gaiety, 
the drummers and trumpeters seemed about to play a lively air. Only when you

<P>
 Graham Greene, "The Comedians" 1965 
</P>
<P>
 If you knew Haiti, it was an amazing sight -- those helicopters like giant 
insects buzzing over the beautiful, ravaged land; men in camouflage landing and 
taking up combat positions at the little airport as if this might be their war, 
and all the Haitians waving and cheering. You wondered if the Americans had 
secured the airport's gift shop and bookstore and the little bar. You hoped 
they were buying up Creole dictionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 You could tell the Haitian military was not supporting the U.S. intervention 
because the Haitian people had not been given tiny American flags to wave in 
front of the TV cameras. (When Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier fell and the 
Americans spirited him out of the country, the people had the flags.) At the 
bottom of the screen on CNN, a cutline ran: U.S. Occupation of Haiti. If you 
knew about the Americans' 1915 landing in Haiti, it was like a deja vu you had 
never really vu 'd. 
</P>
<P>
 History makes you pessimistic. The words being used were Army-bureaucratese, 
circa Vietnam: "permissive entry," "administrative landing." The style, too, 
was Vietnam: cooperation with dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 It was odd -- after the "success" of the Carter Mission -- to watch all the 
television people congratulating themselves and the U.S. team on a successful 
venture (No U.S. soldiers hurt!) when you knew what a capitulation we had made 
to the Haitian generals -- butchers on Thursday, and honorable on Monday. Of 
course, for many TV commentators, last Thursday, with President Bill Clinton 
examining graphic photographs of Haitian Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras' victims, was as 
far away and forgettable as 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 28, 1915, we invaded Haiti with one ship and one battalion. We 
conquered in a day. It wasn't very bloody -- two sailors died, victims of 
random shootings. The Haitian Army, even more pathetic than now, was 
immediately disarmed. We stayed for 19 years, in which we used Haitian slave 
labor to build roads for Haiti, and alienated the population, while waging an 
intermittent and brutal war against anti-American guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the intervention was even less bloody, but by the second day 
of the occupation, Haitians were already paying with their blood for the 
"bloodless" incursion. At least two Haitians have been killed by the 
still-ruling Haitian authorities since the occupation began -- one in Cite 
Soleil (an Aristide stronghold) and one, a hapless coconut vendor helping the 
crowd celebrate the Americans' arrival, killed by a policeman's baton. Who 
knows how many died in the provinces, with all cameras trained on the capital. 
And no one is sure what the term of the occupation is to be, or what its goals 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the Carter mission was a shock to the Aristide government -- 
which up through last Sunday night had been talking with U.S. officials in some 
detail about the transition to democracy and the disarming of the Haitian 
forces. With a gun to their heads, the Haitian military, about to be invaded by 
a force that is -- to put it mildly -- vastly superior, got the following 
concessions: 
</P>
<P>
 You can stay in power until the end of your appointed term. 
</P>
<P>
 You leave hororably. 
</P>
<P>
 You and your men receive complete amnesty for all crimes committed. 
</P>
<P>
 You remain in Haiti if you so desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's return is not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The army retains all its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo will be lifted while the junta is still in power. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be consulted respectfully on occupation strategy and military 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Michel Francois will not be included in this agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will sign this agreement with de facto President Emile 
Jonaissant, whose government the United States does not recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that when you put a gun to someone's head, he begged for mercy. 
Of course, he has to believe you're willing to shoot, and he has to believe the 
gun is loaded with bullets not blanks. In this case, we put a gun to his head, 
and then we begged him for mercy. The dirty secret is the Clinton 
Administration didn't want to invade and the generals knew it. They really had 
the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? One theory is that it has always been the U.S. plan to allow the Haitian 
military to remain more or less intact, and to grant the leaders of the coup 
and its bloody aftermath some kind of legal amnesty. After all, the military is 
the only institution that works in Haiti -- or so the U.S. Embassy in 
Port-au-Prince believes. 
</P>
<P>
 This theory goes on to postulate that though Jimmy Carter was the front man 
for this mission, Gen. Colin L. Powell was the important figure as far as the 
Haitian generals were concerned. (They'd been asking to have him as negotiator 
for more than a year.) Powell is himself a Caribbean military man (Jamaican by 
birth), with sympathies for the difficult position the Haitian generals find 
themselves in. He is also a military man who knows how to deal with military 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 For all who wondered why Aristide did not say thanks the day after Carter 
returned, well, there was nothing to be thankful for. No date was set for his 
return; if he does return he may have to return with his enemies still covertly 
at the head of the army and living in Haiti; the United States -- by signing 
the agreement with Jonaissant -- essentially recognized the de facto government 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's behavior after the discussions was both insulting to the Aristide 
government and nothing short of loopy: failing to mention the democratically 
elected Aristide government, praising Cedras as "honorable," describing 
Jonaissant as forceful; dandling Cedras' son on his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Aristide and his people have seen enough of the U.S. government to 
know not to expect things to be straightforward, they were understandably 
nonplussed by the upshot of the final negotiation. But in the end, Aristide bit 
the diplomatic bullet and said "merci." He said thank you in exchange for the 
21-gun salute for a head of state on the steps of the Pentagon in front of 
network news cameras. Not a bad deal. That was one photo-op whose implications 
will be hard for the Administration to renege on. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the many disastrous aspects of the Carter-Cedras "compromise," one 
may emit a cautious cough of approval for certain aspects of what's happening 
-- not forgetting that the idea of an invasion was wrongheaded from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 First, since the incursion wasn't resisted by the Haitian Army's high command, 
perhaps thousands of Haitians who would otherwise have been killed by soldiers 
and paramilitary shock troops in the hours just before and after the invasion 
have been spared. Second, many young American soldiers are getting a good 
education about what's going on in Haiti. Third, Americans have abandoned the 
illogical idea that they can "guarantee civic order" without interfering in 
Haitian-on-Haitian violence. Fourth, one must assume the Americans intend, 
slowly, to disarm, downsize and reconfigure the Haitian armed forces. If not, 
why are we there? The Army is the problem in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 There are steps the Americans can take to make the Haitian people more 
confidant about the long-term goals of the occupation. Haitians must be allowed 
to demonstrate in favor of democracy -- if only to prove that the U.S. presence 
has changed something. A date must be set for Aristide's return; Francois, head 
of the Port-au-Prince police and paramilitary, must be dealt with and his men 
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a blanket amnesty for all those who committed crimes during the 
past three years must be rejected by the U.S. government because democracy 
cannot be constructed in a country that has never resolved the issues of its 
past; an impartial international and Haitian truth commission (excluding 
Carter) must be established for making recommendations in war-crime cases, and 
Cedras and Army Chief of Staff Phillipe Biamby must be exiled or brought to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 When progressives point out that Aristide was duly elected by 67% of the 
Haitian people, men like Cedras and Biamby always retort that Adolf Hitler, 
too, was elected. But this is not true. Hitler, as head of the Nazi Party, was 
appointed chancellor by President Paul von Hindenburg in 1933. Hitler then 
staged corrupt elections that gave his party's coalition a slender 
parliamentary majority. The Fuhrer then ruled by decree during the rest of the 
Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, much of the battle over Haiti policy during the past 
three years has been waged with such slogans and slurs. Now it's time get real. 
We're there. No matter who wins the fight in Congress and the U.S. media over 
what Aristide's real personality is like -- and the fight has little to do with 
fact -- it's clear that the Clinton Administration believes there can be no 
democratic resolution to the Haitian crisis without the man who represents 
Haitian democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing Aristide back implies a real U.S. commitment to democracy in Haiti. 
Once he's back, the Haitian people will feel that positive change is again 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he would invade Haiti to do "the right thing." Now that he's 
pulled off an occupation to kudos from almost all his enemies, he should profit 
from that position of power to mark himself off from previous U.S. 
Administrations, distance himself from the Haitian army and begin working with 
the Aristide government and other respectable Haitian elements to bring about 
justice, reconciliation and a lasting peace.

THE BEST WAY TO WEAKEN CASTRO'S HOLD ON CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Julian Nava, Julian Nava, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, is a professor 
of Latin American history at Cal State Northridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Administration's refusal to broaden its recent talks with Cuba beyond the 
refugee problem was seriously misguided. With the Cold War over, most Americans 
believe that we should do to the Cubans what we have done to the Russians, 
Chinese, Vietnamese, even the North Koreans -- try to make friends with them. 
Yet, we cling to the hope that deteriorating economic conditions in Cuba will 
spark an uprising and force Fidel Castro to leave his island in disgrace. 
Judging from my observations and conversations during a recent tour of Cuba, 
such a scenario is very unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban man in the street likes Americans and their life style. But they 
profoundly resent our imperial and interventionist attitude. Cubans see in 
current U.S. policy a revival of the hateful Platt Amendment in their 1902 
constitution, which gave the United States the right to intervene in Cuba's 
affairs whenever it saw fit. The United States abrogated this "right" in 1934 
as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "good neighbor policy." But it 
retains, over Cuban objections, its base at Guantanamo, paying about $1,000 a 
year in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans say they are poor communists but are ardent revolutionaries. What does 
this mean? There is no shortage of criticism of Castro's regime, but it is 
directed toward how to make things better, not how to overthrow the system. 
This important distinction appears lost to U.S. policy makers. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the Cuban revolution has produced a socialist generation. In 1960, 
opponents of the revolution either fled Cuba, were executed or imprisoned as 
counter-revolutionaries. Accordingly, people in Cuba today are a substantially 
different breed from the Fulgencio Batista generation. They overwhelmingly 
support revolutionary changes. We must accept this fact whether or not we like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 If we substitute social reform for communist revolution , we will better 
understand Cuba. Before 1960, living conditions for the vast majority of Cubans 
were wretched. Power, privilege, wealth, education and health care belonged to 
a mostly white, professional upper class. So many of them fled in 1960 that the 
University of Havana was left with about 17 professors. A similar brain drain 
affected other professions. To be a Cuban revolutionary was to want social 
equality, public education, health and jobs, as well as a chance to get ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his regime, Castro committed a cardinal sin when he set out his goals 
for a new Cuba. He asserted that Cuba's future would be free of U.S. political 
domination. Within days, the U.S. media launched the virulently anti-Castro 
themes that still, in one degree or another, infect reporting on Cuba. The new 
Cuban leader replied in kind. Soon, bilateral relations deteriorated to the 
point where President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved plans for an invasion of 
Cuba by U.S.-financed Cuban exiles. It fell to newly elected President John F. 
Kennedy to carry out the invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 While honorable people can differ over the cause of the bilateral friction, 
Cubans reminded me that only after 1960 was a successful plan devised to wipe 
out illiteracy. Public education, from primary schools to Ph.D. programs, was 
soon available. Public health services became almost universal and better than 
in most Latin American countries. Cuba now has about 55,000 doctors. Public 
housing is plain to see. And women have free access to education at all levels, 
and the best jobs as well. Such social gains define revolutionary reform in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton may fall into the trap that embarrassed Kennedy if he 
fails to realize that U.S. hostility toward Castro has helped him remain in 
power, not weakened him. Fears of another U.S. invasion are real enough to 
justify political controls that Cubans grumble about but accept. Each week for 
years, Radio Marti has broadcast thousands of hours of exhortations to 
sabotage, overthrow or flee from the tyrant Castro. Cubans I spoke with laughed 
at the clumsiness of these broadcasts from Florida, but claimed they are proof 
of continual U.S. hostility. Said one youth who served two years in Angola and 
studied electrical engineering in Budapest: " . . . those fat cat Cubans in 
Miami will never overthrow the revolution. If you send in Marines to help them, 
we have over 500,000 like me who will take to the hills, if need be. We are all 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old embargo has taken its toll. Cuban high school students must 
work on farms half time. Food is rationed. Since the Soviet Union broke up, 
Cubans, on average, are said to have lost 25 pounds -- and that includes 
government officials. I saw a pediatric ward with 23 cribs and only three 
thermometers. Only children up to age 7 get rationed milk; most adults eat one 
good meal a day. 
</P>
<P>
 On my last day in Cuba, I shot a video of a pregnant woman. She pointed to a 
raft that she and her husband planned to use to get to Florida that night. "My 
baby will be born in Guantanamo," she said with a smile. "Do you think it will 
be American?" By now, she is either in a Guantanamo camp or drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 Normalizing relations between two neighbors with a common heritage of values 
will go far to promote healing and redeem our national dignity. Clinton should 
summon the courage to do what is fair and wise, and end the U.S. economic 
blockade of Cuba. To skeptics, I would say, see Cuba for yourself.

HOW DID WE EVER GET INTO THE HAITI MESS? WE HAD BETTER FIND OUT -- FAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ink was barely dry on the agreement negotiated by Jimmy Carter's team in 
Haiti when second guessing began. It came as a shock to many that the 
Administration had postponed its proclaimed goal of overthrowing the junta and 
that the landing in Haiti was brought about with the cooperation of leaders 
whom President Bill Clinton had described as mass murderers 72 hours earlier. 
But criticism should focus on the policy that left no other option except 
military invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Any prolonged military occupation must be avoided; another attempt at 
nation-building will trap us in an endless enterprise before it ends in a 
fiasco. Too much has already been staked; some relationship between means and 
ends must be re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic dilemmas of postwar U.S. foreign policy have been the result of 
enterprises undertaken lightly, with little if any opposition, and from which 
extrication proved hellishly difficult. The Carter mission has eased the entry 
of U.S. troops into Haiti -- a success that is also an admission ticket to the 
far more complex danger of U.S. forces finding themselves engulfed in the 
passions and conflicts of Haitian factions far more practiced in violence than 
in pluralism. A prolonged U.S. military occupation of Haiti will almost 
guarantee that the hatreds accumulated over decades will overwhelm the purposes 
for which we entered. 
</P>
<P>
 I have always held grave doubts about military intervention to restore 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. That the United States should favor 
an elected president over a murderous junta is inherent in our values and 
justifies diplomatic pressure and embargoes of the kind that had, after all, 
helped to overthrow the Duvalier dictatorship. But American lives should only 
be risked when there is a demonstrable threat to the national security, on 
behalf of clearly defined objectives, and with forces proportionate to the 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration policy fails all three tests. Haiti poses no conceivable 
direct threat. The Administration's stated objectives are vague and the force 
deployed disproportionate to any sensible goal. When CNN airs daily briefings 
by the press officer of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince describing locations 
from which to view the planned invasion of the country to which he is 
accredited, and promising the arrival of additional personnel to handle the 
overflow demand for invasion coverage, the argument that the Haitian threat 
cannot wait for less drastic measures becomes hardly plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal achievement of the Carter mission is that it provides a graceful 
exit from becoming engulfed in the vortex of Haitian domestic politics. It is 
senseless to talk of the "restoration" of democracy in a country that has never 
known democracy, or to equate the fact that Aristide was elected with a 
certificate of democratic practices. To turn Haiti into a pluralistic society 
may take a decade or more and cannot be achieved by military occupation. Even 
the limited task of disarming Haiti's armed forces implies difficult decisions: 
How, when and by whom is the army to be disarmed or restrained? To whom do we 
provide protection once Aristide is back in power? What precisely are the terms 
of amnesty for the generals and army and which parliament approves them -- the 
existing one or that emerging from future elections? Will Aristide abide by the 
amnesty despite his opposition, and what is the U.S. obligation to enforce the 
Carter agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can the dilemmas of a prolonged military operation be avoided by turning 
nation-building over to the United Nations. I hope the President was speaking 
euphemistically when he presented U.S. policy on Haiti as reflecting some kind 
of international political consensus. For the international support we elicited 
was a tribute to U.S. power, not to its purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The artificial nature of this international support has already levied an 
exorbitant toll. One of the most hallowed principles of U.S. foreign policy is 
to keep the military power of other continents out of the Western Hemisphere. 
From the Monroe Doctrine to the 1947 Rio Treaty, every U.S. administration has 
insisted that hemispheric problems be settled by the nations of this 
Hemisphere. Yet, the Administration recoiled from involving the institution 
specifically designed for that purpose -- the Organization of American States 
-- because it realized that our partners in this Hemisphere would never approve 
military intervention. Appealing for military assistance from outside this 
Hemisphere in an inter-American issue sets a precedent future U.S. 
administrations may regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Another such booby trap is inherent in the Security Council resolution 
authorizing the use of force to replace the Haitian junta, which passed with 
Russian support. The precedent for Moscow's ambitions in what Russia calls the 
"near abroad" is hard to miss -- the worrisome policy of forcing the republics 
of the former Soviet Union to return to the imperial fold. That this tacit quid 
pro quo is understood in Washington is reflected in pronouncements by Madeleine 
K. Albright and Clinton, who stated that each major power has a special 
responsibility for peacekeeping and stability in "its own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dangerous doctrine. U.S. actions in Haiti, however ill-advised, do not 
affect overall security. U.S. interventions in this Hemisphere have been 
short-lived; Russia's military advances have tended to be permanent. They are 
certain to rekindle ancient fears and tensions. Three conclusions follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. military presence in Haiti ought to be brought to a rapid conclusion, 
preferably by the end of this year. By then, we will have restored Aristide to 
power and disarmed or neutralized Haitian forces threatening his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once U.S. forces -- except for a small training mission -- are withdrawn, 
the remaining tasks can be assigned to inter-American institutions. 
Governmental reform could be assigned to the OAS; economic assistance to the 
Inter-American financial institutions -- backed up, of course, by a continuing 
U.S. interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Haitian crisis provides an occasion for the Administration to review the 
practices that produced such stark alternatives and such an obsession with 
public relations. Symbolic of these tendencies was the decision to launch the 
82nd Airborne Division while American emissaries were still on the ground in 
Haiti. Surely, there was no need for surprise when the projected landing sites 
could be seen on television. If the purpose was to land before the Congress 
could pass a resolution of disapproval the next day, the enterprise marked an 
astonishing disintegration of the executive-Congressional relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest risk we face is an open-ended commitment of military forces to 
tasks for which they are not designed. The greatest need is a bipartisan 
reassessment of our foreign policy and, above all, a prudent definition of the 
circumstances in which U.S. power is to be engaged.

MISSING THE BULLY PULPIT: CLINTON'S INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Dallek, Robert Dallek is the author of books on Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan. He is Harmsworth Professor of 
American History at Oxford. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's most successful chief executives have been preaching Presidents -- 
men with a vision of where the country needed to go and a facility for leading 
it there. For Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wil son, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry 
S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, the White 
House was a Bully Pulpit from which they could win Americans over to a cause 
imbued with moral and practical good sense. The second Roosevelt, borrowing 
from the Bible, may have put it best: "Where there is no vision the people 
perish." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout our history, Americans have been most drawn to the activist 
presidents with a coherent idea of how to achieve a more prosperous, just and 
peaceful society. Administrations with a Square Deal, New Deal, Fair Deal, 
Great Society, and Reagan Revolution have been more popular and accomplished 
than those without a core idea of how to advance the national well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 But Americans are lukewarm toward a President who seems to stumble from one 
problem to the next without any clear sense of his overall intentions or, if 
they exist, any ability to communicate them to the public. Sadly, this 
describes President Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been particularly true in foreign affairs, where Americans are always 
reluctant to tread and do so comfortably only when they have a clear idea of 
what potential and actual sacrifices in blood and treasure mean. The crusades 
to end war and defeat Nazism and communism appealed to the national belief in 
purifying world politics and making the world safe for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But having a good cause is not enough, even for the most righteous of our 
presidents. They must also be effective communicators -- politicians with 
resonant voices, an infectious smile, a buoyant manner, a kindly demeanor, an 
extraordinary ordinariness. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be the magical phrases that stick in people's minds and seem worth 
repeating. Wilson gave speeches that were so lyrical you could have danced to 
them. Franklin Roosevelt, the greatest of our great communicators, invented the 
"fireside chat," the warm, homey, hearth-side talk broadcast from his living 
room in the White House to every one else's across the country. "I miss the way 
the President used to talk to me about my government," people told Eleanor 
Roosevelt after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "In human affairs, the public must be offered a drama," Roosevelt told Charles 
de Gaulle at the Casablanca conference in January, 1943. And such dramatics, 
staged by a master playwright and actor, were the stuff of political leadership 
on major questions vital to the life of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, recall the failure of Herbert Hoover. Described as dour, 
uninspiring and rigidly puritanical, critics complained that "a rose would wilt 
in his hand." Witness the defeat of Jimmy Carter, a man of transparent decency, 
whose most memorable speech glumly described the country's "malaise" and made 
him an easy political mark for the charming, easy-going Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton knows all this. Moreover, he is one of the most intelligent and 
attractive personalities to have held the presidency in this century. His skill 
as a speaker and with the press are more than a match for any politician 
currently on the national scene. His address to the Congress earlier this year 
arguing the necessity of health-care reform was beautifully crafted and 
compellingly delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to his current difficulties with Haiti. True, for the moment, 
the Carter-Sam Nunn-Colin L. Powell negotiation with the military junta appears 
to have saved the President's political life. Averting a military clash that 
would have cost American lives and opening the way to the restoration of Father 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, the agreement is being hailed by the Clinton 
Administration as a triumph of the President's diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton and his advisers would do well to consider how close they came to 
political disaster. Whatever the merits of putting U.S. forces in Haiti -- and 
much can be said against it -- Clinton's greatest failing, once he decided to 
exercise the military option, was the decision to proceed without public and 
congressional backing. 
</P>
<P>
 How could someone as astute and practiced in U.S. politics as Clinton have 
decided to commit himself to a military action supported by only 31% of the 
public and less than a solid majority in the Congress? Surely, the President 
knows that even initially popular responses to aggressions challenging or 
seeming to challenge America's national interest lost part, if not much, of 
their appeal once lives began to be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Roosevelt spent more than two years preparing an isolationist America 
for involvement in a war that meant far more to its well-being than Haiti could 
ever be. Truman and Johnson, despite widespread national support for combatting 
the communist threat, lost political control in the waves of recrimination that 
engulfed their policies in Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, George Bush, in the most masterful episode of his term, brought 
90% of the country to his side with the shrewd preparations that preceded the 
military response to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. However overdrawn, comparing 
Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and the Iraqi attack to Czechoslovakia and 
Munich, was a clever political appeal that won Bush not only public support but 
also a strong congressional endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the distressing thought of a hostile Iraq in control of Persian 
Gulf oil made Americans more receptive to Bush's appeal for intervention in the 
Gulf than they would be to any argument about toppling a military dictatorship 
in Haiti. Still, a candid presidential case against inhibiting the flow of 
Haitian migrants fleeing economic privation and political terror in their 
country would have had resonance with many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did make the case to the American public about the criminality of the 
current regime. But what about Aristide? It is doubtful that more than a 
handful of Americans know enough about the man to make the idea of sacrificing 
American lives to re-establish his power compelling. But the fact that he was 
the only democratically elected president in that benighted country's history 
and that he is a Catholic priest with a genuine moral compass would mean 
something to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 America's past failed hopes of bringing democracy to Haiti by landing the 
Marines in 1915 is enough to make the current involvement seem like another 
episode in a long list of Caribbean misadventures. But even if Clinton's 
decision to use U.S. muscle to advance democracy's cause and block another 
flood of poor immigrants to our shores ends badly, there is still no excuse for 
his failure to practice the politics of foreign policy more effectively than he 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he confronts the next inevitable overseas crisis, he should recall how 
presidents like Roosevelt and Kennedy, his two favorites, prepared the way for 
tough responses to complicated world problems. Roosevelt, for example, lived by 
the proposition that a successful policy abroad required a stable consensus at 
home -- one nurtured by presidential persuasion. Haiti, so far, is a 
demonstration of how not to win domestic support for a risky foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us hope that Clinton will not take a narrow escape from a Haitian 
political disaster as a reason to ignore what his lead-up to the invasion 
should teach. Shuffling around a press secretary has nothing to do with a 
President's ability to talk to the public. Clinton must recognize that the best 
of our presidents have done a lot of on-the-job training. It could make the 
difference between remaining in the White House or joining all those other 
one-term Presidents in this century who lacked the wisdom and eloquence to 
advance their political fortunes and the national well-being.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DAVID LIZARRAGA; IN THE BUSINESS OF REBUILDING THE 
EASTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Mungen, Donna Mungen is a producer for the A&E Network and a 
contributor to National Public Radio's All Things Considered. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To a large part of Los Angeles, the economic movers and shakers on the 
Eastside are as unknown as the names of its major arteries of industry. But for 
the millions who tread and trade along Whittier Boulevard and Cesar Chavez 
Boulevard, David C. Lizarraga is a major entrepreneur in the redevelopment of 
their community. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief operating officer of the East Los Angeles Community Union -- or 
TELACU -- Lizarraga, 53, and his team have built industrial parks, affordable 
housing and mixed-use commercial complexes, opened a bank and developed social 
programs. With his board of directors, he weighs all investment decisions 
between profit and social responsibility. His political influence stretches 
from California's palm-dotted boulevards to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in East Los Angeles, the teen-age Lizarraga made a hard U-turn from a 
life of crime to become a youth counselor in a United Way program. During the 
1960s, he redefined public housing in Los Angeles with the Casa Maravilla 
Housing Community. And by the early 1970s, Lizarraga had control of TELACU. 
This grass-roots organization rose out of the 1965 Watts Riots and community 
leaders' concern about their disenfranchised status. While greater Los Angeles 
was experiencing an economic revival, East Los Angeles had an unemployment rate 
three times higher than the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the 25-year-old TELACU had a portfolio worth one-third of a billion 
dollars. The company is the second-biggest minority-owned business in Los 
Angeles County, and ranks 21st among Latino-run corporations nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Affable, but reserved around the press, Lizarraga has not forgotten the early 
1980s, when TELACU's reputation sagged after allegations of financial 
irregularities. After putting his fiscal books in order, Lizarraga embarked on 
a dazzling development schedule and diversified TELACU's investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Lizarraga has the ears of Mayor Richard Riordan, President Bill 
Clinton, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros, 
corporate leaders and the rapidly growing Mexican-American community. Married 
and the father of one son, Lizarraga had just become a grandfather for the 
third time when he recently sat down to talk in his corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Does TELACU give the Mexican-American community clout?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: In a capitalistic society, those without capital are impotent and 
cannot make any changes unless they do it through the vote or through mass 
action. Disinvested communities, be it an American Indian reservation, the 
barrio or the ghetto, are all forms of economic reservations. Economic 
empowerment is as important as political empowerment . . . . So we formed the 
"nonprofit" organization TELACU as an umbrella for the "for-profit" holding 
companies that have the assets, income and employees, which give us economic 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
 And you can't ask people to come and invest in your community if you're not 
willing to do it yourself. Why should we ask people from the Westside to come 
to this community if we don't have local people willing to take a risk? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have 12 subsidiaries under the TELACU umbrella. Do you have favorites?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're very proud of our real-estate division, our financial-services 
division, which has a bank within it, and our operating companies, which has 
our job-creating operation. But I'm particularly proud of this industrial park 
(where TELACU headquarters are) because this was a disinvested, broken-down 
tire site where B. F. Goodrich once employed 2,300 people. But once the 
automobile industry deteriorated, it was closed down. 
</P>
<P>
 So we were able to show our community that you can invest in East L.A. As they 
saw the physical changes come to this building and this industrial park, they 
could see people cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you think enterprise zones are a viable economic catalyst for community 
development?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The enterprise zone is more than just an attempt to build industrial space. 
It is an attempt to attract expanding businesses to where they will create 
employment in an area that has certain demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 So empowerment zones are important because they bring in investors and 
business who are looking for benefits that they otherwise would not have. The 
empowerment zones also mean not only reinvesting, but also empowering the 
community and making it part of the strategy and process. Enterprise zones are 
merely saying to the business community, we need your help. We are willing to 
give you some incentives, if you will come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did your experience developing the Casa Maravilla Housing Community prepare 
you for leadership within TELACU?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It taught me the value of community participation. The original draft plans 
were for the traditional high-rise structure popular in the Midwest, like 
Chicago and places like that, because it was more cost effective and a better 
use of land. But we persuaded the housing authority to allow community 
participation in design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Their involvement yielded a tremendous benefit in the long run. Today, 15 
years later, the Maravilla Projects look like no other housing project in L.A., 
because it has no graffiti. What I have learned is that you can depend on the 
community if you ask them to participate, and that they will come up with a 
product that will have long-lasting use. That is the benefit of community 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that why you restructured the TELACU board of directors?  
</P>
<P>
 A: David Lizarraga does not own the stock. The nonprofit owns the stock and 
they determine what happens, how the profits are spent and how they are 
reinvested. We felt the community needed to have control of the destiny of this 
organization. We have a majority of community residents on our board, but we 
also have members from the private sector -- i.e., investors, bankers. But it 
is really important that those board trustee members are community residents 
and that they always have a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you pick the businesses to include in your industrial parks?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We look at the bottom line as it relates to both the social and economic 
benefit. In one example, we could have leased 1 million square feet of 
industrial space to a single warehouse, but that would have only created 50 
jobs. Instead, we selected the plastics manufacturer Win-Cup, Inc., which makes 
spoons and forks for food franchises like McDonald's. That way we created 600 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've placed a special emphasis on senior housing. Why?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We began with housing for seniors because the traditional family unit has 
broken down, and they were very needy. We now have City View Terrace under 
construction. It's 600 single-family units for first-time buyers. We also have 
three other developments in the pipe line . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We believe in home ownership and giving families their first opportunity to 
build equity, instead of being renters all their lives. That is why we started 
our Community Thrift and Loan Bank, almost 14 years ago. We wanted to fight 
red-lining by showing that our borrowers are good borrowers and that you could 
make a profit in this community. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that our community is not a high-risk borrower and we believe the 
housing niche that we are addressing -- which is the moderate- and low-income 
buyer -- is a good candidate for home purchase. Fifty percent of our bank loans 
are for mortgages, but we don't lend to our own developments; we consider that 
a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you select your development sites in such diverse sites as 
Hawthorne, City of Commerce, Moreno Valley and San Antonio?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our greatest impact has obviously been in East Los Angeles. But in the 
past, cities have come to us saying we need your help and participation and 
we'd like to work with you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century Freeway project is an example of a very successful program created 
by the state to provide second mortgages to home buyers, and we participated, 
along with the federal government, because we believed in partnerships with the 
private and public sectors that benefit the community. 
</P>
<P>
 With the San Antonio Business Center, that was a little different story, 
because we needed to assist another sister organization, the Mexican American 
Unity Council. They are a community-development corporation like us and they 
were looking to develop an industrial park, and we helped them build it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's been said that anyone interested in a career in East L.A. must get 
your "king-making" seal of approval.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think there is anyone that I have crowned king in any shape or 
form. However, we are fortunate to have many Latino representatives in the 
state Legislature and in Congress whom we've supported. I don't think anyone 
can make someone else a king or leader. That's a voter decision. Now, we will 
roll up our sleeves and put our shoulders against the wheel and make a go of it 
with anyone who wants to help us. And I definitely do not look forward to 
participating in politics in a formal manner. I think everything we do in our 
community has political nuances -- from the street sign to where you create 
your next industrial park. My goal is to help build other TELACU-type of 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you restore TELACU to good graces after the allegations of 
misappropriation of federal funding?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We went through some difficult times -- but we survived. The only way you 
make hard times better times are by your actions. So, we moved ahead with our 
housing strategy and let that speak for us. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of our growth curve. You don't make the same mistakes twice. What 
has made us successful today is that we now know what we are not. If you really 
want to have an impact, you build a team. Share the dream, share the vision, 
share the success, because quite often you might have to share the failure. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not perfect, but we're willing to take a risk, because quite often you 
might have to share the failure. We're not perfect, but we're willing to take a 
risk, because the only other alternative is not to grow. Anything that doesn't 
grow has to die, and you always have to strive to have more impact and that is 
the responsibility one has in the community-development process. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does your Youth Services Club reduce the seduction of gangs?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our youngsters need options. We tutor them and get them through high 
school. Many of them are referred by the court system as being problematic, but 
we don't think they are problems. We just think they need guidance and 
direction. We try to get them in college, and we've given our youth over a 
million dollars in scholarships to attend local colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is your scholarship program a matching system?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Prior to our involvement many local colleges weren't making financial loans 
to our youth. So, we challenged them to match our dollars. Sometimes we had to 
shame them, but we've been able to leverage our dollars and that is what it's 
all about.

DOUBLE WHAMMY AGAINST WILDFIRES; L.A. COUNTY LEASES 'SUPER SCOOPER' AIRPLANE 
AND BEEFS UP SAFETY REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By leasing the firefighting plane known as the "Super Scooper" and moving 
swiftly to adopt a series of tough new fire safety proposals, the Board of 
Supervisors has taken laudable steps to protect the residents of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Scooper, an amphibious plane that can snatch up seven tons of water 
in flight, comes highly recommended by fire experts. But over the years, the 
plane has seen very limited action in California because of what most state and 
local officials viewed as its prohibitive cost -- a single craft costs $17 
million, or about $1 million per fire season to lease and operate. 
</P>
<P>
 That view began to change after last year's firestorms, which destroyed more 
than 1,000 homes, burned about 200,000 acres and resulted in nearly $1 billion 
in public and private losses. State officials now acknowledge the need for a 
test program for the airplane. Yet Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature have 
yet to come up with a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 This inaction stands in marked contrast to the performance of the L.A. County 
supervisors, who last Tuesday gave final approval to a three-month contract 
with the Quebec government to lease a Canadair CL-215T Super Scooper. In 
addition to its $719,000 lease fee, the plane will cost $515 for every hour it 
is aloft. Expensive, yes, but a bargain in comparison to the cost of an untamed 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also approved a long-overdue ban on wood shake and shingle 
roofs in the county's high-risk fire zones, as well as stricter building and 
fire codes, improvements in water delivery systems in fire-prone areas, and 
stronger brush clearance rules. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. officials should consider sharing the Scooper -- and its costs -- with 
neighboring Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Nature has 
a way of reminding us that, when it comes to a fire, political boundaries are 
meaningless.

IRAQ'S ARMS -- DON'T TRUST, DO VERIFY; U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST OIL EXPORTS 
SHOULD BE LIFTED ONLY UNDER THE STRICTEST CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iraq's biggest money-earner is oil, but ever since the 1991 Persian Gulf War 
that nation has been under U.N. Security Council-imposed sanctions that have 
kept its oil from being sold on world markets and prevented hard currency from 
flowing into Baghdad's treasury. Those sanctions would be lifted, the council 
said 3 1/2 years ago, once it was clear that Iraq no longer posed a security 
threat to its neighbors, especially Kuwait, which Iraq invaded and brutally 
occupied in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the council has been told by Rolf Ekeus, the diplomat it put in charge of 
monitoring Iraq's military status, that Saddam Hussein's regime has lost its 
capability to produce weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical or 
biological -- and that therefore the regional military threat it presents has 
been largely removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the oversight system put in place by the United Nations to make sure 
Iraq doesn't cheat on the weapons ban works, the council will probably be asked 
sometime next spring to allow Iraq once again to begin exporting oil. Under the 
right conditions -- and only under the right conditions -- the United States 
should support that request. 
</P>
<P>
 A key condition is that Baghdad give up its spurious claim that Kuwait is 
simply a lost province that Iraq has the right to reclaim by force. Kuwait is 
an internationally recognized sovereign country, as legitimate a political 
entity as Iraq itself, and Baghdad must recognize it as such, along with the 
redefined border between the two states that was fixed by the U.N. Boundary 
Commission in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A second condition is that Iraq agree to accept indefinite international 
monitoring of its imports, to prevent it from reacquiring the machinery and 
materials to rebuild its now liquidated unconventional weapons capability. An 
essential part of that oversight would be cooperation from all countries that 
do business with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddam Hussein's regime came perilously close to setting up a nuclear weapons 
industry because it was able to obtain massive amounts of needed technology 
from outside, often by deceit, sometimes with the compliance of suppliers and 
export-hungry governments. That can't be allowed to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 It of course remains a moral outrage that Hussein and his bloody-handed 
collaborators are still in power. But a change of government in Iraq was not a 
demand set by the Security Council for lifting the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 If Iraq is found no longer to be a threat to its neighbors, then the legal 
basis for the sanctions disappears. The foundation for that finding has now 
been laid, with a monitoring system to ensure Iraq doesn't rearm soon to be 
tested. If that system can be shown to work effectively, and with the 
additional conditions we noted above, the time will have come to lift the 
sanctions.

DOMESTIC PARTNERS VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of the "domestic partners" legislation he has 
demonstrated a failure of moral leadership (Sept. 12). He has pandered to the 
bigots of the radical Christian right instead of providing for the needs of 
more than 1 million Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 This legislation would have strengthened true "family values" by providing 
domestic stability for many. We can only hope that a future governor will have 
more moral courage in this matter.

 Thank you, Gov. Wilson, for vetoing the unmarried partners bill. For years we 
have been complaining about the rise of illegitimacy and the breakdown of 
morality and family values in our society. Of course, this has contributed to 
the rise of juvenile crime and the gradual erosion of civilized society. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz's (D-Sylmar) bill would have furthered this trend by 
giving unmarried couples the status of those couples who have made moral, 
legal, and religious commitments to each other. Why bother getting married 
anymore and starting a traditional family? Just shack up with whomever you 
please, abort your unborn babies . . . and don't forget to let the taxpayers 
pick up the tab for all of your irresponsible activities.

 Wilson probably should have signed the domestic partnership bill; visiting in 
the hospital is a pretty non-threatening activity. However, we all recognize 
that there is a bigger agenda behind this innocuous bill. Therefore we should 
pause and think this through a little.  
</P>
<P>
 There have always been people who cohabited without getting married, and 
society has always felt the need for a few rules about it. These have 
traditionally been handled as "common law" marriages. People live together long 
enough and they are married under common law. Most states have common law 
marriages, but California in its wisdom abolished them along ago. Between 
"palimony" suits and now, domestic partnership agitation, abolition would 
appear to be yet another "progressive" reform that has proven superficial.

 A veto for AB 2810, which would have allowed 500,000 unmarried couples (93% 
heterosexual/7% homosexual) to register with the state as domestic partners, 
was camouflaged under a Wilson-glorifying headline for his signing of a bill 
that allows women to wear pants to work. 
</P>
<P>
 I resent the absence of full consideration by The Times to those issues that 
affect me as a registered and voting citizen of California.

DEBATE OVER PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Prop. 187 Is Sore Subject for Illegal Immigrant Students" (Sept. 17) hits the 
nail right on the head. If for no other reason, Prop. 187 must be defeated for 
the scholastic assassinations it would inflict on innocent children of 
undocumented residents and the disruption that would ensue in the education of 
our youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has firmly established that laws denying education to 
classes of children in the U.S. are unequivocally unconstitutional.  
</P>
<P>
 California has severe problems, to be sure, but to enact racist, xenophobic 
and misdirected legislation as a political remedy will never serve this state. 
Prop. 187 would turn teachers and health-care providers into secret police, 
forcing them to look at a child's skin color and accent, instead of looking 
into the mind. No less cruel, Prop. 187 would force innocent children to learn 
to lie in order to protect their family's existence.

 The Times writers who wrote this article know very well that the students they 
interviewed will have graduated and presumably illegally obtained jobs by the 
time Prop. 187 is resolved in court, should it pass. It is the as-yet-unarrived 
illegal immigrant students who may not get a free education. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that the provisions in Prop. 187 will cause hardship to 
illegal aliens. That is its intent. It is hoped that it is the first of many 
propositions that will make life much, much harder for them, thereby 
discouraging others. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 may not be humane or generous. The humane and generous policies of 
past decades didn't work.

 Regarding the commentary "Make it 'SOS' for Snake-Oil Salesmen" by Carl 
Shusterman (Commentary, Sept. 15): 
</P>
<P>
 I am again baffled by the argument that immigration laws should be enforced by 
sanctions against private employers spending their own money to hire workers 
without adequately investigating their immigration status, while government 
employees spending taxpayers' money should be free from this burden. 
</P>
<P>
 If we expect private citizens to enforce the immigration laws by verifying 
legal residence before hiring people, why shouldn't our government exercise the 
same diligence when dispensing taxpayer supported services?

these students may qualify for free or reduced price meals while at school; (3) 
The tax money used to pay for all this must come from somewhere. Any wild 
guesses? (4) With all the emphasis given to these "non-English speaking 
students," what about the concern for the remaining students?

 As the first-generation son of immigrant parents, with four children in the 
LAUSD, I was deeply disturbed in reading James Coleman's commentary, "Illegal 
Immigrants Are, by Definition, Criminals" (Sept. 12). For him to relegate a 
whole segment of the children, whom he is responsible for in some official of 
semiofficial capacity, to the category of the "criminal class" was itself 
criminal. Are those who have helped dig a financial hole for the school 
district now looking for a scapegoat? He seemed to be keen with his selective 
use of historical analogies, but he forgets that the Nazis of the '30s used 
Jews, leftists and homosexuals as the reason for Germany's economic weakness 
during the world Depression, much like their modern brethren use the Turkish 
immigrants as scapegoats for the shrinking German bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls any historical claim to the Southwest territories as 
counterproductive, citing that "humanity has seen the ownership of land change 
hands countless times," yet forgets that humanity has historically migrated 
from country to country, continent to continent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminal" is the new code word for "those who are expendable." Why should 
"criminals" receive emergency health care allowing more "criminals" to be born 
in our country? Why give these young "criminals" an education? Why should real 
Americans feed these "criminals" by letting them work? With the use of this one 
word Coleman tried to strip a whole group of people of their humanity, but it 
seems he only succeeded in exposing his own moral and political decay.

MONORAIL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times did it again. The Sept. 10 article suggesting that the "monorail" 
would only be $19 million less than the "subway" is misleading.It is true that 
a hybrid "subway" would cost less to build than originally expected. However, 
it would be an alignment that is not environmentally approved and is contrary 
to every promise made to the residents of the San Fernando Valley for a 
deep-bore subway through residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley was assured a full Valley transit system that will 
take us into the 21st Century, not an unsightly open trench "ditch" that will 
divide neighborhoods, destroying the communities we are trying to preserve. 
This interpretation of "subway" will surely invite crime, graffiti and the 
potential of life-threatening accidents. This latest scheme is just another 
attempt to discount the quarter-billion-dollar difference between the 
environmentally approved versions of monorail and subway, with no attention 
being paid to providing a safe and aesthetically pleasing transit system for 
the entire Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway experience for the MTA has been a nightmare; the recent problems of 
Hollywood, the problems along Mid-Wilshire, Hill Street and 7th Street all 
prove that the underground rail construction program in Los Angeles is 
seriously flawed. This contributes to the agency's near bankruptcy and growing 
liability.

 Imagine Los Angeles with a volunteer fire department. Imagine California not 
requiring skyscrapers to be earthquake-resistant. Imagine south Florida with no 
hurricane emergency evacuation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, imagine a world racked by emergencies of unprecedented scale with no 
disaster prevention and response capacity. For the people of Rwanda, as for the 
people of Somalia and Bosnia, Haiti and the Sudan, there is no need to imagine 
the result: The unnecessary deaths are all too real. 
</P>
<P>
 The drumbeat of major human disasters that accelerated several years ago 
should have put the international community on notice that it is time for a 
systematic, preventive response to large-scale emergencies. But rather than 
responding with visionary, forward-looking programs, the United Nations and its 
leading member countries -- the United States, the European community and Japan 
-- continue to respond in an uncoordinated, delayed, ad hoc fashion. This 
collective failure to take action to save lives borders on the criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 This was to have changed two years ago with the creation of the Department of 
Humanitarian Affairs within the United Nations. The DHA, created partly in 
response to U.S. pressure, was supposed to become the global mechanism for 
emergency coordination. Its director was appointed by and would report directly 
to the U.N. secretary general. The DHA would bring order out of chaos, 
providing early warning information, mobilizing donor governments for emergency 
programs and coordinating the various U.N. and government agencies that respond 
to distress. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the DHA has been a failure. Even though Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali was instrumental in the conception and creation of the agency, he 
has not provided the financial and institutional support required to fulfill 
its mandate. In the Somali emergency, it became evident quickly that DHA had no 
power and that the U.N. agencies normally involved in emergency response -- the 
World Food Program, UNICEF, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees -- could 
avoid DHA coordination without sanction. In recent crises, including Rwanda, 
the agency has been virtually invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Its main 
functions apparently are to issue information bulletins and hold conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 International non-governmental organizations tend to have more advance warning 
of disaster, work much more effectively through indigenous institutions in the 
affected communities and devise more creative programs than either the United 
Nations or governments. But their collective capacity is far too small to mount 
the required comprehensive response. As for governments, they tend to act 
unilaterally in emergency situations, with the timing and the content of the 
response driven by domestic political considerations rather than needs on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world in which major humanitarian disasters occur frequently, the 
international community can no longer conduct itself as if emergencies are an 
aberration. Corrective action is imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general, with support of the leading industrialized countries, 
must invigorate the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, giving it the staff and 
budget necessary to carry out its core functions: planning for long-term 
disaster prevention and coordinating the international response to acute 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A re-empowered DHA will need permanent resources. Concrete initiatives should 
include prepositioning emergency supplies (food, water-supply equipment, oral 
rehydration salts, tents, blankets, latrines) in DHA-managed warehouses in 
logistical hubs in disaster prone regions. The agency must staff these disaster 
units with trained personnel, permanently equipped with transportation and 
logistical materials. 
</P>
<P>
 When not responding to an immediate emergency, the staff of these units would 
engage in training for local governments and non-governmental organizations in 
disaster preparedness. They would also function as the ongoing human 
early-warning system for the United Nations and the international community, 
alerting the appropriate powers to looming emergencies and taking initial 
preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach would link humanitarian response to long-term peace and 
development. Every recent humanitarian disaster has had a political dimension. 
Mass suffering is inextricably tried to political failure. The weakness of the 
United Nations in the area of peacekeeping is also acute, as we have seen in 
Rwanda with hundreds of thousands of deaths after the withdrawal and subsequent 
failure to reintroduce U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world focuses appropriately on the disaster in Rwanda, serious food 
shortages are looming in the Horn of Africa and the south, with as many as 7 
million people potentially at risk from drought. Humanitarian problems of this 
magnitude are a regular feature of life in the global community for the 
foreseeable future. Absent a significant investment in disaster prevention and 
response, images of suffering will continue to assault the world with 
depressing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to respond in time is not the result of compassion fatigue or lack 
of media attention or funds -- the usual excuses -- but of incompetence and 
failure to address a critical systems failure in the international humanitarian 
system. The United Nations, with active moral and practical leadership from the 
United States and the other industrialized countries -- must take on this 
effort as its responsibility to the vulnerable members of the world community.

COLUMN RIGHT / JOSEPH FARAH: PETE WILSON: A LIBERAL IN GOP CLOTHING; PUSHING 
TAX INCREASES AND APPOINTING TREE HUGGERS BELIES HIS ELECTION-TIME MASQUERADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH FARAH, Joseph Farah is editor and publisher of the monthly state 
political newsletter Inside California and the biweekly cultural and media 
watchdog publication Dispatches. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a saying: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."  
</P>
<P>
 That's why Gov. Pete Wilson will not get my vote this November. He has fooled 
the California electorate too many times by occasionally (usually around 
election time) masquerading as a conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of people -- good, honest, well-meaning conservatives -- got hoodwinked 
into voting for Wilson in 1990. Remember the line four years ago? We were told 
we needed to hold our noses and vote for Wilson because only a Republican 
governor could ensure a fair reapportionment of congressional districts. Today, 
the attempted extortion of our votes is solely based on fear-mongering about 
how bad Kathleen Brown will be if she's elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Could she really be that bad? Probably. But it's doubtful that she could be 
much worse than Wilson. It's doubtful that anyone could be. And, at least, with 
Kathleen and Willie Brown running the state, there won't be any doubt about who 
is responsible when things get worse. Voters need to understand the bankruptcy 
of liberalism and hold those responsible accountable. Politicians like Wilson 
only serve to confuse the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny, though: At the same time Wilson is predicting doom and gloom if 
Kathleen Brown gets real power, he's also complaining publicly that she has 
been staking out positions just like his. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, Pete! The reality is that Kathleen Brown has been running a fairly 
conventional liberal campaign -- so conventional and so liberal that she has 
blown a once seemingly insurmountable 25-point lead in the polls. If she had 
done what most observers expected her to do, run to the right of Wilson (and, 
Lord knows, there's plenty of room over there), chances are she would be 
coasting to victory. So, governor, if Kathleen Brown's positions on the issues 
mimic your own, there's a reason for that. You're a liberal, too!  
</P>
<P>
 Am I exaggerating? Check out Wilson's record:  
</P>
<P>
 * He pushed through the largest tax increase in the history of any state in 
1991.  
</P>
<P>
 * He supported shifting $2.3 billion in local property-tax money to the state 
in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 * He dramatically increased funding for the Office of Family Planning, the 
state's little piggy bank for Planned Parenthood and other population-control 
extremists.  
</P>
<P>
 * He teamed up with Willie Brown in support of the permanent sales-tax 
increase, tricking the public into believing they were supporting law 
enforcement.  
</P>
<P>
 * He has placed far-out, tree-hugging nature-worshipers in key regulatory 
roles, chasing old businesses out of state and shutting down job-creating 
entrepreneurs before they ever get started.  
</P>
<P>
 * He has signed anti-gun legislation; asset-forfeiture laws; higher property, 
corporate, gasoline and estate taxes; new snack and newspaper taxes, and higher 
motor-vehicle registration fees. He has also supported massive bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Would things have been any better if Dianne Feinstein had been elected in 
1990? As awful as Feinstein is, the answer is probably yes. Why? Had a Democrat 
been governor for the past four years, the Republican minority in the 
Legislature would have galvanized its opposition to pork-laden state budgets. 
Instead, Wilson has consistently undercut Republicans in the Assembly and 
Senate by supporting unconscionable budget increases during California's worst 
recession ever. That's why even Kathleen Brown would be preferable to another 
term of Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 Am I advocating a vote for Brown? No way. That would only be validating the 
bad choices the two major parties have given us. I plan to vote for the 
Libertarian candidate, Richard Rider, and urge all conservatives -- Democrats 
or Republicans -- to do the same. Rider is not some nut. He's not a fringe 
character. To prove the point, before the primary election, he selflessly urged 
his own supporters to vote for conservative Republican Ron Unz, even though 
Rider himself was on the ballot. A stockbroker and financial planner with a 
degree in economics, Rider is a Vietnam veteran. Unlike most Libertarian 
candidates before him, he's running full-time and even has a modest television 
campaign. In other words, he could be the straw that breaks Wilson's back.  
</P>
<P>
 There's another reason why conservatives should be looking for such an 
opportunity. If Wilson is reelected, he becomes the favorite for the Republican 
presidential nomination in 1996. Scary? Hard to believe? Remember, the field 
will be crowded, and many in the Wilson camp are already planning to do for the 
nation what they have done for California. God forbid!

THE REAL BATTLE BEHIND THE SEQUESTER DEBATE: WHO'S ON SIMPSON'S JURY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is former president of the Los 
Angeles County Criminal Bar Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To sequester, or not to sequester, that is the question facing Superior Court 
Judge Lance A. Ito in the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark has urged Ito to sequester a jury to ensure 
that the state receives a fair trial. The defense team, led by Robert L. 
Shapiro, does not want jurors sequestered during what could be a long trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Sixth Amendment, it is the accused who is entitled to a fair trial, 
and the accused whose rights Ito is constitutionally compelled to protect. Any 
"right" the government has to a fair trial is derivative. By definition, a fair 
trial for Simpson is a fair trial for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Clark really want? 
</P>
<P>
 There are no reported cases of a prosecutor ever requesting a judge to 
sequester a jury. Sequestration only occurs when the media, as it is wont to do 
from time to time, exploit a story to the point of creating a "carnival 
atmosphere at trial," making any verdict superfluous to a media-goaded 
lynching. 
</P>
<P>
 The case most relevant to Simpson's in terms of the potentially adverse 
effects of pretrial publicity is that of Dr. Sam H. Sheppard, whose conviction 
for murdering his wife was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In Sheppard's 
case, the court noted that, "Beyond doubt, the press had shown no responsible 
concern for the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial; the community from 
which the jury was drawn had been inundated by public- ity hostile to the 
defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case is different. For one, the latest Harris poll shows strong 
community divisions on Simpson's guilt in the murders of his former wife and a 
friend three months after his arrest -- and in the context of the greatest 
media circus since the Scopes "Monkey Trial." Also, unlike Sheppard, Billy Sol 
Estes, Charles Manson and other well-known defendants, Simpson is not the only 
party suffering from bad press. The Los Angeles Police Department, the coroner 
and the district attorney have all made mistakes in the case, as the press 
keeps reminding them. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries only get sequestered when the media chooses frenzy and ratings over 
responsibility. There is virtually nothing a judge can do to discipline an 
irresponsible media -- or worse yet, a pseudo-press for which factual 
renditions are more likely cosmic coincidence than the result of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 What is sickening to any prosecutor or defender who has tried a high-profile 
murder case is the cavalier disdain that tabloid shows have for accurate 
reporting. Last night's "recreation" was probably watched by one or more jury 
members and that error-filled fictional presentation probably stuck in at least 
one juror's mind because it is "visually indelible" even though it is false. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution in the Simpson case is not worried about the tabloids, 
print or electronic. What Clark seeks to achieve through a sequestered jury is 
to eliminate certain groups of prospective jurors whom the defense wants: 
blue-collar workers, people with children in the home, professionals and 
students, among others. What she wants are jurors who fit this profile: 
authoritarian personality, older than 50, white or Latino from a 
demographically conservative area, first- or second-generation Asians, 
"go-alonger's" rather than "show-me's," women who hate sports, women who have 
been abused, police supporters and conformists. More women than men. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense wants younger African-Americans (a vast number of whom believe 
Simpson will not receive a fair trial), younger whites and Latinos, men, 
especially men who work with machines or tinker, "show-me's," women who will 
not identify with Nicole Brown Simpson, third-generation Asians or later, 
anti-authoritarians, sports fanatics, people who have had bad police 
experiences and those who are racially tolerant. More men than women. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle to sequester, then, is not a battle to protect Simpson's right to a 
fair trial. It is a battle over what the ultimate jury pool will look like. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixth Amendment requires that the jury pool reflect a cross-section of the 
judicial district in which a case is tried. Sequestering would increase the 
number of prospective jurors who claim hardship, and hardship removals are 
always higher for those lower on the socioeconomic ladder -- racial and ethnic 
minorities. And it is this group whom polls show to be more likely Simpson 
sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 census, the adult population for the Central Judicial 
District, where the trial will unfold, was 20% white, 21% black, 48% Latino and 
11% Asian. Those percentages, however, do not reflect the large undercount of 
Latinos and blacks; they must be adjusted upward, according to a recent federal 
appellate-court decision. By contrast, the last survey available from the jury 
commissioner shows that Central District jury pool was 50% white, 22% black, 
18% Latino and 10% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the statistics reveal an extreme overrepresentation of whites 
and an extreme underrepresentation of Latinos in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges are not fond of lawyers who point out such demographic anomalies, 
though most criminal lawyers just let them ride. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, however, if it looks as if the jury pool is getting 
stacked, one suspects that Simpson lawyers Shapiro and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. 
will not "let them ride." For if Ito chooses to sequester the jury, the effect 
would be to increase the percentage of whites available in the pool. Senior 
citizens and child-less government workers who have infinitely paid jury 
service would have a greater chance of ending up as jurors. And these jurors 
are more likely to be conservative, harbor racial biases and inclined to 
convict. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito may avoid ever getting around to the sequestering problem. After 
damaging false news reports were broadcast by some TV stations last week, Ito 
announced that he was "beyond outrage." If news directors fail to heed his 
threat to cut off the courtroom cameras by continuing to air such false 
reports, the need to sequester would become less compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no First Amendment right that entitles television stations to 
broadcast the proceedings live. Rule of the Court 980 asserts: "The court may 
refuse, limit or terminate film or electronic media coverage in the interests 
of justice to protect the rights of the parties and the dignity of the court, 
or to assure the orderly conduct of the proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it may be TV pundits rather than jurors who find themselves 
sequestered in a hotel cut off from the news.

TIRED POLITICAL SYSTEM LOOKS FOR A TONIC; ARE INCUMBENTS AND THE TRADITIONAL 
PARTIES LOSING POWER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Oklahoma last week, eight-term Rep. Mike Synar lost his campaign for 
renomination on the Democratic ticket to a 71-year-old political novice who had 
no hired staff, ran no TV ads and spent less than $17,000 on the race. What 
defeated the nationally known Synar? The biggest single factor seemed to be 
incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state last week, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, first elected to 
Congress in 1964 and running unopposed in the Democratic primary, was able to 
get only 35% of the total vote cast. Two years ago he tallied 52%. What 
happened? Again, dissatisfaction with veteran officeholders appears to have 
been a key. 
</P>
<P>
 These early election results are said to have chilled many in Congress, 
especially House Democrats. Yet they are more confirming than startling. The 
anti-incumbent mood is not new. That it has continued to grow -- witness the 
broad support for term limit measures -- is clear. But that mood in itself 
signals a larger sense of alienation from the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 A new survey by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press, based on 
interviews with more than 4,800 voters, describes the mood of the electorate as 
"angry, self-absorbed and politically unanchored." Increasingly, government 
inspires not trust but cynicism, with federal programs seen by a staggering 69% 
of those questioned as usually wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-government mood has a number of striking concomitants. Among them is 
the decline in support for the traditional two-party system, and what could be 
the accompanying emergence of a perhaps durable constituency for third-party 
alternatives. Ross Perot's personal appeal may have fallen somewhat since he 
ran for President in 1992, but the appeal of perotism -- of the self-proclaimed 
political outsider doing populist battle with a bloated, inert, unresponsive 
government -- remains a powerful force in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 And not without reason. In his new book "Arrogant Capital: Washington, Wall 
Street, and the Frustration of American Politics," excerpted in the current 
Time, Kevin Phillips connects Washington's imperial growth to the gap that 
people now feel between themselves and their government. To a large extent 
influence, which in Washington is power, has been transferred from elected 
officials and those they are supposed to represent to the more than 20,000 
congressional staffers, to the 91,000 people associated with lobbying, to the 
interest groups that contribute so heavily to campaigns. Parties once 
represented deeply held convictions. Now, "exhausted parties" become easy prey 
for special interests, "because there is little heartfelt belief to get in the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, to be sure, nothing sacred about the Republican and Democratic 
parties, and preserving them in their current form is not a national 
imperative. But the two-party system, however it has fallen into disarray, has 
had historic value. It has contributed significantly to political stability, 
forcing factions into compromising coalitions and in so doing controlling 
political extremism. This is no small achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time of continuing political, social and economic flux and uncertainties 
the potential for demagogic extremism must be taken especially seriously. Will 
Americans' fundamental common sense keep it in check? Phillips holds out the 
prospect of a revitalization of the political system through a "bloodless 
revolution" aimed at dispersing power away from Washington and from lobbies and 
interest groups, while reversing the trend toward an increasing concentration 
of wealth. These may prove to be the real political issues to be debated over 
the next few years.

JAMES FLANIGAN: SUPER-REGIONALS BANK ON INTERSTATE CONSOLIDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quietly, almost without notice, Congress recently passed a law allowing 
interstate banking -- and provided an object lesson that times change but 
visions endure in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate banking was the great vision of Amadeo Peter Giannini, who founded 
Bank of America in 1904. And it was the cause of enormous controversy in the 
1920s, as Giannini tried to put his ideas into practice, acquiring banks across 
the country -- forming the present-day First Interstate Bancorp and 
Transamerica Corp. in the process -- and preaching that banks should sell 
insurance and investments as well as make loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking aroused passions in those days, and Giannini's efforts were thwarted 
by rival bankers in the East, Wall Street financiers, the onset of the Great 
Depression and laws restricting interstate branching, passed by a Congress 
fearful that powerful banks would control the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Times change. Fearing that weak banks would undermine the economy, regulators 
in recent years have encouraged interstate mergers to keep bank doors open in 
Texas and other states suffering recession. 
</P>
<P>
 And so a consolidation has begun in U.S. banking, from 14,000 banking 
companies less than a decade ago to 10,840 today. From that pack has emerged a 
group of strong banks with operations in several states, known as the 
super-regionals. They include Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., with 1,900 
bank offices in 10 states; Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank, which this year 
acquired Dreyfus Corp., the mutual fund company; Los Angeles' First Interstate, 
which owns 1,100 banks in 13 states and Cleveland-based KeyCorp, with more than 
1,300 banks in 13 states from Alaska to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 The super-regionals, large outfits at $50 billion assets and more per company, 
reflect a banking industry on the move. But they don't arouse fears of 
concentration, as banks did when the U.S. economy was dominated by big 
companies. Rather, the super-regionals serve the new American economy, aiming 
to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's community banking," says Victor Riley, chairman of KeyCorp, who started 
from Albany, N.Y., and built his company through acquisitions in smaller cities 
-- Tacoma, Wash., not Seattle; Fort Collins, Colo., not Denver. It's a 
"big-fish-small-pond" strategy that earns higher rates of profit than most 
big-name global banks -- such as Citicorp, Chemical and Chase Manhattan -- can 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the stock market accords Key, Mellon and the others a higher 
price-earnings ratio than the global banks. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Riley, who was born in 1931 -- the year Giannini almost went 
bankrupt trying to shore up Bank of America stock against raids by speculators 
-- made a move that caught the attention of the banking industry and pointed 
the way to its future. He merged KeyCorp. with Society Corp. of Cleveland to 
create an institution with $60 billion in assets and a major capability in 
managing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Society was the successor to the old Cleveland Trust, a manager of industrial 
family money dating to the 19th Century. The new company starts out with $34 
billion under management, financial products for managing 401(k) accounts and 
other employee benefit plans and a successful line of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the key to the banks' future, says Riley. With interest rates 
rising on what banks have to pay for deposits and competition heating up to 
make loans, profits on traditional lending will narrow, he notes: "So we'll 
have to do more varied business with our customers, manage their pension and 
employee benefit plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Investment management has been thought of as the domain of the brokerage and 
mutual fund firms, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity and such. Bankers were deemed too 
slow-witted to keep up with highly paid fund managers. "But with the trust 
assets our company has now, we can contract out for the best money managing 
talent," Riley says. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle is joined to manage the fabled savings of the baby boomers. That's 
why Mellon Bank acquired Dreyfus. Analyst Thomas Hanley of CS First Boston says 
he thinks KeyCorp will take more steps, acquiring or forming a joint venture 
with a money management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The business will grow rapidly, 12% to 15% a year, Hanley predicts. And banks 
could do well, because they offer loans as well as benefits management. 
"Because of their experience in judging credit risks, banks seem destined to 
maintain a key role" in financial services, says John Hoenig, president of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the strategies of KeyCorp, First Interstate and other 
super-regionals point up several trends in the U.S. economy: 
</P>
<P>
 First, that it is basically strong. Competition to make loans means there is 
money around, with banks vying to lend to small and medium-sized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the move into asset management will force banks to greater cost 
reductions. "Banks have to get their costs as low as Fidelity and Vanguard and 
other fund outfits," says analyst Raphael Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman. 
That's why First Interstate last week announced staff cuts and consolidation of 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But most significant for California, the passage of the interstate banking law 
will prompt more banks to come here -- and those already here to beef up 
operations. First Interstate Chairman Edward Carson also said last week that 
the bank would concentrate on its western territory and not try to go 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 KeyCorp's Riley says he understands the attraction, in a global and historic 
context. "Just think of what built so many cities on the Atlantic coast, from 
Baltimore to Philadelphia to Boston. It was trade," he says. "They grew on 
trade with Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 But now there are new directions. "On the West Coast, cities are growing on 
trade with the Pacific Rim and Latin America," Riley notes, "and there are four 
times as many people in Asia as in Europe." That's why KeyCorp is seeking to 
arrange new business relationships in California, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 A.P. Giannini, in his time, looked in the other direction, but the idea was 
the same. Vision endures.

NEW U.S. CAR LABELING LAW CRITICIZED AS BEING CONFUSING; AUTOS: CANADA IS 
COUNTED AS PART OF DOMESTIC MARKET. U.S. AUTO MAKERS INSIST DISCLOSURE IS FULL 
AND FAIR. 
</P>

<P>
 Looking for a new car and you want to buy American? 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers have long been confused about what actually constitutes an "American" 
car. Is a Pontiac Firebird made in Canada with a U.S.-built engine more 
American than a Nissan Altima made in Tennessee with an engine from Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions have only gotten harder to answer as the auto industry becomes 
more global, foreign auto makers move more production to the United States and 
trade tensions periodically erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the confusion is about to get even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Saturday, the federal government will require auto makers to state 
the total domestic content -- defined as U.S. and Canadian -- of a vehicle's 
parts and to identify foreign countries that supply significant amounts of 
those parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, known as the American Automobile Labeling Act, also requires car 
makers to reveal where the transmission and engine parts came from and the 
vehicle's point of final assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds simple enough. But critics -- foreign auto makers, dealers, some 
suppliers and consumer groups -- say the law is poorly crafted and deliberately 
skewed to favor Detroit. The content labels appearing on new vehicles this fall 
will be confusing, misleading and in some cases inaccurate, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to give a lot of misinformation to consumers," said Joan 
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Canadian parts are counted the same as U.S. parts, and identical 
cars made on the same line but badged differently -- such as General Motors' 
Geo Prizm and the Toyota Corolla -- could be credited with widely varying 
domestic content. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law takes effect as trade tensions between Japan and the United States 
are entering a sensitive phase. The Clinton Administration has threatened to 
impose trade sanctions on Japan by Friday0 unless it lowers trade barriers in 
key industries, including autos and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 It also comes as Japanese and European auto makers are moving more production 
to the United States and stepping up their purchase of U.S. auto parts. Still, 
Detroit argues that the vehicles made at so-called transplant factories are 
foreign, because many of their parts come from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to have a bit more truth in advertising," said Andrew Card, 
president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn., the Big Three's 
lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Olson, vice president of Toyota Motor Sales, said the law 
discriminates against Japanese manufacturers by discounting their U.S. 
manufacturing operations and U.S. parts-buying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lemon," he said of the labeling law. "It ought to be recalled." 
</P>
<P>
 While that is unlikely, the American International Automobile Dealers Assn. 
petitioned the government to rewrite the regulation and is threatening to 
challenge the law in court as "unconstitutionally vague and discriminatory." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law means auto makers must make three different domestic content 
calculations: one for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to comply with 
corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards; one for the U.S. Customs 
Service, used to set tariffs under the North America Free Trade Agreement, and 
one for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which oversees 
the labeling law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is government regulation run amok," said Barbara Nocera, Honda's manager 
of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The labeling law was born during the Buy American push in 1992, which began 
after President Bush and a delegation of the Big Three auto makers were rudely 
rebuffed in efforts to gain major trade concessions from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, pushed by the United Auto Workers union and reluctantly supported 
by the Big Three, passed as part of a highway appropriations bill without any 
committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it gives consumers important information," said Alan Reuther, UAW 
legislative director and nephew of the late Walter Reuther, the legendary UAW 
president. "The Japanese dislike it because it doesn't allow them to hide the 
fact that a large part of their parts still come from abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese auto makers, however, say the new law does not provide a true picture 
of the U.S. content of vehicles, and is designed to give the Big Three a 
competitive leg up by portraying them as having higher domestic content than 
their foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very title of the act is a misnomer," said Philip Hutchinson, president 
of the Assn. of International Automobile Manufacturers. "You will never know 
what the American content of a vehicle is from the law." 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that the label lumps parts made in the United States and Canada 
together. This was done to placate GM, Ford and Chrysler, all of whom have 
large parts operations in Canada, Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada is now the 51st state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Card said that CAFE already treats U.S.-Canadian operations equally and the 
U.S. and Canadian auto industries have been highly integrated since 1965, when 
the two countries forged a trade pact. 
</P>
<P>
 (The labeling law preceded the passage of NAFTA, so Mexico -- unlike Canada -- 
is treated as a foreign country in determining domestic content, though that 
may change as the Mexican auto and parts market becomes more integrated with 
the U.S. industry.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 M ore distressing to the Japa nese is the disparate treatment the labeling law 
applies to in-house and outside suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, if a manufacturer purchases a part from a wholly owned 
supplier, then the exact domestic content of the part counts toward the total 
domestic content of the vehicle. So if GM acquires a part from its AC Delco 
subsidiary with 85% U.S.-Canadian content, it is credited with that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the part is purchased from an outside supplier, the domestic content is 
treated differently. If the content is 70% or more U.S.-Canadian, then it is 
considered to be 100% domestic. If it is less than 70%, it is given no value. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is misleading information," said Nocera of Honda. "We think we should be 
able to count actual value regardless of who supplies the part." 
</P>
<P>
 The government noted that this so-called "roll-up and roll-down" provision 
could result in widely varying domestic content for identical vehicles made on 
the same line. In one hypothetical case, it said the domestic content of 
vehicles could vary from 53% to 11% depending on the relationship of the 
manufacturer to the supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota officials said that the Corolla will have a lower domestic content than 
its twin, the GM-made Prizm, even though both are made by the same workers on 
the same line using the same parts at a joint-venture plant in Fremont, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAMA said the reason for the different treatment of suppliers is that it 
is easier to get accurate information from in-house suppliers. Card said it is 
much more difficult to trace origin when dealing with outside suppliers, who 
are often reluctant to share pricing information. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism of the label is that it may not reflect a vehicle's real 
domestic content, because the law requires the data to be averaged for car 
lines. The domestic content of a model made in the United States is combined 
with an imported model, even if the two use different parts sources. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a Honda Accord made in Ohio will display a lower domestic content 
than it really has, and one imported from Japan will be have a higher content 
than it actually has. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government will, however, allow manufacturers to add a footnote at the 
bottom of the label stating the actual domestic content for U.S.-built 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The label also will carry a note that says: "Parts content does not include 
final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts costs." This is in response to 
Japanese criticism that domestic content improperly excludes the value of 
assembly labor as well as some key operations done in final assembly 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese said that the exclusion is designed to reduce the domestic 
content of their vehicles, many of which are assembled at U.S. plants, 
typically with non-union work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three counter that the law is designed to identify the origin of 
parts, not the whole car. "When I buy a can of soup, the label tells me the 
ingredients that went into it -- not where the can came from," Card said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, the label requires the manufacturers to state the city, 
state and country where the vehicle was assembled.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Gillis, spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America, said the 
labeling law is so complex that is likely to confuse and mislead most car 
shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort, though laudable, falls short of giving consumers the accurate 
information they need to make informed decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also may cost consumers a little as auto makers pass along the costs of 
administering the program. The government estimates auto makers will spend 
about $13 million to gather label information in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law was passed in 1992, the final rules were not published until 
July. As a result, NHTSA said it will accept "good faith" estimates of domestic 
content by the auto makers on labels until June 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 While Detroit's auto makers have pushed the label law, much of the onus for 
compliance falls on their suppliers, who must trace the value and origin of 
parts from a myriad of vendors and sub-assemblers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of consternation among suppliers," said Richard Fournier, a 
representative with the Automobile Industry Action Group, which works with 
suppliers and manufacturers to reduce regulatory costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lounsbery, vice president of Motor Wheel Corp., a Lansing, Mich.-based 
wheel and brake supplier, said his company views the labeling regulations as a 
cost of doing business. "But my personal opinion is I'm not sure it helps the 
consumer," he said. Dealers also are skeptical, fearing the labels will 
increase the cynicism of consumers about car sales practices. "This will only 
add confusion," said Fred Miller, a Van Nuys car dealer who sells both Japanese 
and domestic-brand vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry officials believe the labeling law could backfire on the Big 
Three, revealing to the public how many of their vehicles are built outside the 
United States and equipped with foreign parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM is so big and diverse that some of the objections the importers have will 
affect us the same way," said one GM official, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a short article on the labeling law in the September issue of Solidarity 
magazine, the UAW warned its members that looks can be deceiving in the auto 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The union notes that the Ford Aspire is made in South Korea by Kia Motors 
while the Toyota Corolla is built by UAW members in California. It also notes 
that foreign auto makers make cars with UAW workers in four U.S. locations, 
while GM, Ford and Chrysler all import cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The UAW, however, also notes that, in general, the domestic content of Big 
Three vehicles is "significantly greater" than that of transplants. And union 
officials are hoping that the labeling law will put pressure on the Japanese to 
increase American buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the labeling law will force them to buy more U.S. parts," said 
Reuther. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Japanese auto makers are doing just that. Recently, for instance, 
Toyota said it would expand its U.S. production and plans to increase 
procurement of U.S. parts from $4.65 billion in 1993 to $6.45 billion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's Olson said even without this initiative, his company did not oppose 
the idea of a labeling law. "We are for these kinds of labels if that is what 
the market wants," he said. "But make them fair, honest and direct." American 
Automobile Labeling Act 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 1, the federal government will require auto makers to disclose the 
domestic content -- defined as U.S. and Canadian -- of the parts of vehicles 
sold in the United States. Here is a sample of how the new label will look and 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts Content Information 
</P>
<P>
 For vehicles in the carline:  
</P>
<P>
 U.S./Canadian parts content: 50% 
</P>
<P>
 Major source of foreign parts content: 
</P>
<P>
 Japan 25% 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico 15% 
</P>
<P>
 For this vehicle: 
</P>
<P>
 Final assembly point: Detroit, Mich., U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Country of Origin: 
</P>
<P>
 Engine: United States 
</P>
<P>
 Transmission: Japan 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Parts content does not include final assmebly, distribution, or other 
non-parts costs. 
</P>
<P>
 This car line is assembled in the U.S. and Japan. The U.S./Canadian parts 
content for the portion of the carline assembled in the United States is 75%. 
The U.S./Canadian parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in 
Japan is 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 * PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation is supposed to provide information about the domestic content of 
parts in vehicles. Label is to be displayed on window of vehicle when offered 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * FOR VEHICLES IN THIS CARLINE 
</P>
<P>
 Carline is defined as models of the same vehicle regardless of where 
manufactured. Domestic content is averaged for all vehicles is a carline. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S./CANADIAN PARTS CONTENT 
</P>
<P>
 Includes the percentage of a vehicle's parts including all material and labor 
costs that original in U.S. or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * MAJOR SOURCE OF FOREIGN PARTS CONTENT 
</P>
<P>
 Lists the top two countries outside the United States and Canada that provide 
a vehicles parts that exceed 15%. Must include percentage of content from those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * FINAL ASSEMBLY POINT 
</P>
<P>
 Identifies the city, state and country where a vehicle was assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 * ENGINE and TRANSMISSION 
</P>
<P>
 Country of origin for the engine and transmission must be disclosed. The 
United States and Canada are considered separately here. 
</P>
<P>
 * NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Explains that the value of assemble labor, some final assembly operations, 
sales and marketing operations not included in calculations of domestic content 
for parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * VEHICLES ASSEMBLED IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 If a carline is manufactured in more than one country, the manufacturer has 
the option of including information at the bottom of the label that discloses 
U.S./Canadian parts content for models made in each country. If used, the 
U.S./Canadian parts content must be disclosed for models made in every country.

THE DEFENDERS; BEYOND THE GLITZ OF CELEBRITY TRIALS, CRIMINAL LAW IS A 
GUT-WRENCHING BUSINESS THAT THE PUBLIC DISDAINS. AND NOW, ECONOMICS ARE MAKING 
IT A DEAD-END CAREER FOR ALL BUT DEFENDERS OF THE RICH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They can trace their lives through a succession of grisly subtitles: the 
Hillside Strangler, the 54th Street Massacre, the Ninja Murders, the Halloween 
Ambush, the Chinatown Shoot-out. . . . They can recall, in anguished detail, 
each case they've lost, each time a client has been sentenced to life 
imprisonment or, God forbid, death. 
</P>
<P>
 They are criminal defense attorneys -- not the celebrity lawyers who squeeze 
past ogling camera lenses on the way to represent the likes of O.J. Simpson and 
Michael Jackson, but the everyday lawyers who champion the causes of anonymous 
men and women accused of heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 They've never been asked for an autograph, never posed for People magazine. 
They dine not at hoity-toity places but with the hoi polloi in a corner of a 
dingy courtroom cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 And even as their profession takes center stage this week in Simpson's trial 
on double-murder charges, they worry that the kind of high-stakes criminal law 
they practice is becoming a dead-end career for all except the few whose 
clients are the very, very rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers are not alone in their fears. The same sense of impending 
extinction is permeating the ranks of specialists and sole practitioners 
throughout the professions -- from medicine to accounting to architecture -- as 
economic and social realities corrode layers of tradition and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Private attorneys will always pick up drunk driving and misdemeanor cases. But 
for specialists in major felonies, "there's no future," laments Rickard 
Santwier, a criminal defense attorney for 25 years. "The only lawyers who will 
be private practitioners will be those who are hired by people with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Court appointments to represent clients who couldn't afford their own defense 
used to keep the private defense lawyers busy. But this year, Los Angeles 
County opened a second public defenders office -- as many municipalities have 
done -- and cut by more than half the number of cases spun off to outside 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just as significantly, the cost of a felony criminal case, especially a murder 
trial, has soared past middle-class affordability, further concentrating work 
in the hands of public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For private lawyers like myself doing murder cases, there are fewer and fewer 
cases," said defense attorney Michael Yamaki. "People just can't afford the 
kind of defense they need in such a case. . . . Everybody deserves the same 
kind of defense that O.J. is getting, but how many people are going to get it? 
That's the question." 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer cases coming their way -- and the realization that the economics 
will only get worse -- many of the region's best criminal defense attorneys, 
including those who have specialized in death-penalty cases, are putting their 
skills to work on white-collar crime cases, family law, environmental issues 
and even an occasional drunk-driving charge. Others are looking at retirement, 
calculating how much longer they can go on if they don't want to branch out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough choices, these are, for a breed of attorney that seems locked in the 
embrace of a grinding, gut-wrenching, all-consuming job. For the unlucky, 
murder trials and death-penalty cases can lay waste to physical health, deplete 
emotional reserves, sunder marriages and friendships and make a mockery of the 
most earnest of personal commitments. They're all unlucky sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Jones knows who and how, and rattles off a list of wrecks as easily as if 
he were reciting his own resume. This one is in a wheelchair, another is using 
a cane after a stroke, a third suddenly dropped dead. Jones knows from his 
inside out the toll a death-penalty trial can take on an attorney. He's been 
doing them for nearly three decades now, and colleagues say he's one of the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've frequently said I can't find any death-penalty trial lawyers over 65 
years old who are in good health. . . . Check around. You'll find people with 
vision problems, heart problems, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems we bury somebody every month or so. It's a killing profession. In 
trying to save lives, we're all killing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And for whom? Accused murderers, rapists, hate-crime perpetrators -- 
individuals whose names are more obscure than the where, when and how of the 
crime. Defendants feared and reviled by a public that is baffled, even 
appalled, when lawyers willingly take their cases. A public that's quick to cry 
"technicalities" if the defense is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 For this, courts typically pay attorneys $50 an hour -- $75 an hour in a 
capital case -- while colleagues in large law firms bill their corporate 
clients four or five times as much, senior partners charge $600 an hour and the 
biggest-name lawyers get $1,000 or even $2,500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county pays $300 or $400 an hour to a civil lawyer to handle a landslide 
or fight voter reapportionment. Then they pay us $75 an hour for a 
death-penalty case," Jones said. "We're only handling life and liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract with a panel of private attorneys, Los Angeles County now 
pays a flat rate for defending indigents in major felony cases. The rates are 
based on a number of factors, including the seriousness of the charge and 
complexity of the case, with four tiers of payment: $60,000, $90,000, $120,000 
and $200,000 and higher. High-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson, who collected 
$650,000 from the now-depleted estate of Jose and Kitty Menendez for defending 
their son Erik on murder charges, will be paid $125,000 a year by the county 
for Erik's retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 (Lawyers expect Simpson's defense to exhaust his net worth, estimated at about 
$10 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 From their fees, criminal defense attorneys -- who most often practice alone 
or with a small group of partners -- have to pay the office rent, utility bills 
and clerical salaries. And unlike public defenders, who make $42,500 to $96,800 
a year in Los Angeles County, they don't have paid benefits -- vacations, 
health insurance, retirement plans and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, criminal defense attorneys don't claim to be impoverished. Most say 
they live comfortable lives. But not lavish. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at the top make an OK living," said Charles Lindner, a defense 
attorney in Santa Monica and former president of the Criminal Courts Bar Assn. 
"But nobody who's really good does it for the money. Carl (Jones) is not rich, 
Leslie is not rich. I'm not rich. Our civil counterparts are probably making 
$800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I comfortable? Yes. I'm supposed to be," Lindner said. "I've been a lawyer 
for 20 years. To have a 2,000-square foot house on a decent lot on the Westside 
of town, that's comfortable. But what are you supposed to have after 20 years 
of work . . . and still pulling 60 hours a week?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the last six years, since leaving the Los Angeles public defender's office, 
Mark S. Kaiserman has spent most of his time on five or six death-penalty 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned more money in private practice. But not enough. This past week, 
Kaiserman went to work for the new second public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I was making more, substantially more," Kaiserman said. "But that 
doesn't mean I was happier. The quality of my life was not better. I was 
working harder during those years, with one death-penalty case after another." 
Harder even than having 30 or 40 cases to juggle at any one time in the public 
defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 While in private practice, Kaiserman skipped work on weekends only once or 
twice a year. "That's not the kind of life I wanted. Other things are important 
to me," he said. The other things are his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed my life more with what I was making as a public defender than with 
what I was making in the years of private practice," Kaiserman said. "I had 
more of a life and I felt better about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys who specialize in death-penalty cases know about not having 
a life, about having their lives consumed by the peril of another's, about 
being terrified to take any time for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just not you picking up a briefcase and coming to work," said 
attorney Yamaki, a former member of the Los Angeles Police Commission. "Your 
entire life is entrenched with the case. . . . People talk about the high costs 
(of) legal representation, but I think most lawyers are charging an amount that 
takes into consideration what this is going to take out of them by the time 
they finish the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a dilemma between having a personal life and really doing your best 
work. I don't really know if you can balance the two," Yamaki said. "I try to 
give as much commitment to my personal life as to a case, but while you're in 
trial, your trial becomes more important than your personal life at that time. 
It sounds sick, but when given the responsibility of defending someone's life, 
it . . . requires a full-time commitment. You can't be a part-time lawyer when 
you're doing a death-penalty trial." 
</P>
<P>
 This awful burden of someone else's life leaves defense attorneys with little 
energy for anything else. "You are it for your client," said Santa Monica 
defense attorney Michael V. White. "Your client has nobody else to rely on but 
you. You are the last stop. If you can't do your best for your client, if you 
can't save your client, the client's gone. That's a pretty awesome 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So they obsess on their cases. They choose an office because it's near the 
courthouse, then make it into a cocoon. They bark at their secretaries, skip 
meals and, after a 16-hour workday, wake up at 2 a.m. to scribble more notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every personal plan gets tossed aside, Yamaki said. "I would be hard to live 
with, if I went on vacation and didn't do that last bit of interviewing and it 
might have helped the case," he said. "In your mind, you think that everything 
you do might make or break the case, and you have so much fear that, even in 
questioning (witnesses), that you can blow your case, just by one wrong 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you make (clients) pay for," he said. "It's more than hours; it's 
the emotional toll. You never, ever recover. I can tell you every case that I 
lost, what I thought happened in the case, what I would have done differently. 
. . . You carry it with you." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Pasadena office, attorney Jones can shut out just about everything when 
he's working on a life-or-death case -- everything but the regrets of a loss. 
"You agonize, second-guess yourself, beat yourself up bad," he said. "You 
wonder, dammit, why did I go to that movie, take that afternoon off, go to 
lunch? Would it have been different if I had worked that weekend? It's 
horrible. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 25 years of practice, Santwier never has had a client sentenced to 
death. But whenever he takes on another capital case, he has to steel himself 
for that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 With each case, Santwier said, "I see a substantial change in me. Each time 
you try one of these cases, you give up a little bit of your person, your 
humanity. You try not to make the highs too high or the lows too low, else, how 
can you go on to the next case?" 
</P>
<P>
 Going on to the next case is becoming harder and harder for private defense 
lawyers. Santwier, who co-chairs the county panel of attorneys who take on 
indigent clients, said about 50% of his caseload now comes from court 
appointments. By next year, he figures, about 20% of his cases will be 
court-appointed; in two years, that will drop down to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the sad things about the law I'm practicing now is that I won't be 
practicing it in the future," Santwier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is 56, doesn't want to practice any other kind of law. "I'm 
watching the calendar until I can get the hell out of here," he said. "I'm 
going to retire. I'm going to finish the three cases I've got, and then I'm not 
taking any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "With people dropping dead and committing suicide, having heart attacks and 
strokes, I think it's the wise alternative," Jones said. "I want to retire. I 
want to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two-year-old H. Elizabeth Harris wants to go on practicing forever, she 
says. But she wants to stay off Jones' list of wretched lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She was headed there a few years ago, her blood pressure a barometer of her 
growing caseload. So she made some changes. She's a vegetarian now and fits a 
four-mile walk into each 12-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she took two months off and went to Africa. She knows now that "I 
have to take care of all parts of me," Harris said. After her current capital 
cases are finished, she is not likely to take on any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's hard for criminal defense attorneys to watch their practices 
metamorphose into civil law. The love of the fight -- the belief that they're 
making a difference -- burrows into their souls and stays there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times," said White, "when I have represented somebody who's 
never ever had anybody in their corner before. They see me fight with 
everything I've got and they know I care. Win or lose, they've at least found 
somebody who has been there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite everything, added Jones, "there is one saving grace to all of this: 
when the court clerk reads the verdict 'not guilty,' or, in a hopeless case, 
when the clerk instead of reading a verdict of death reads a verdict of life 
imprisonment. That's why we do it."

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: FITZGERALD WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED PERELMAN AND HIS PENDING 
PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, "There are no second acts in American lives," 
he hadn't run into Ronald Perelman. Perelman -- the billionaire who controls 
Revlon cosmetics, Marvel comics and a flock of TV stations, among other things 
-- is trying to prove Fitzgerald wrong by performing a second act in the 
savings & loan business. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a boffo success, at least for Perelman. By my count, Perelman 
made more than $1.2 billion buying failed S&Ls from the federal government in 
1988 and selling almost all his holdings last year. Now, Perelman is about to 
open Act II by buying most of a big troubled S&L, San Francisco-based First 
Nationwide, from Ford Motor Co. The show makes its debut Thursday, when the 
deal is supposed to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Act II equal Act I? Unlike the deal with the government, in which there 
was no way Perelman could not make a fortune, his deal with Ford carries 
serious risks. What's more, unlike his federal deal -- in which he had a naive 
seller and no meaningful competitors -- this time Perelman was dealing with a 
sophisticated seller and had to bid against two rivals: Golden West and Great 
Western, two of the best-regarded S&L companies in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a quick look at First Nationwide, it looks as if someone should have 
told Perelman to quit the S&L game while he was ahead. Although First 
Nationwide has $9.7 billion of deposits and operates in desirable markets such 
as California, Cleveland, New York City, Detroit, Miami and Chicago, it's 
plagued by high operating costs and riddled with bad loans. It's been a 
financial lemon for Ford since 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 The April deal called for Perelman to pay about $1.1 billion for First 
Nationwide, whose reported profits were barely enough to cover the interest 
cost on $1.1 billion. (Perelman, like all good billionaires, uses borrowed 
money to make acquisitions.) 
</P>
<P>
 But if you read the little-known documents that Perelman has filed in 
connection with his capital-raising for this deal, you find that he's working 
from a completely different script. Perelman, it turns out, is paying Ford only 
about $630 million in cash. So how is this a $1.1-billion deal? Because Ford 
will keep First Nationwide assets -- about two-thirds of which are troubled 
loans -- that it values at $444 million.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ford is giving Perelman $50 million to cover severance payments 
for First Nationwide employees. The fewer he fires, the more money he keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 So for Perelman, the purchase price isn't exactly what it seemed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, First Nationwide, although no prize, is now in better shape than 
its public financial statements suggest. That's because those statements don't 
include the benefit of unloading the $444 million in assets onto Ford or the 
full benefit of recent deals in which Ford gave First Nationwide $1 billion in 
cash in return for $1 billion in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjust for those items and for Perelman's planned sale of First Nationwide's 
Chicago deposits, as Perelman's filings do, and you've got an institution 
that's earning about $180 million before income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunch the numbers and you find that Perelman's annual cost of borrowing $685 
million to pay Ford and cover expenses will be a tad under $75 million. And his 
empire pays virtually no federal income tax, thanks to the $3.5 billion in tax 
benefits he has left over from Act I of our drama.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So on paper, Perelman is about $100 million a year ahead. How can a deal like 
that be risky? 
</P>
<P>
 In two words: Lousy loans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the acquisition is completed, Perelman has the right to make Ford buy 
another $500 million in bad loans from First Nationwide. Many people think 
First Nationwide has lots more bad loans than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to our second Ford: Gerald, no relation to the Ford Motor 
family or the former U.S. President, who runs Perelman's S&L show. Ford, an S&L 
expert, and Perelman, a deal-making expert, each probably accounted for about 
half of the $1.2 billion Perelman made in Act I. (I don't know how much Ford 
made.) Think of them as financial X-Men, super-heroes who use their mutant 
powers to make money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford says he could safely outbid Perelman's rivals because his troops spent 
2,700 person-days examining suspect loans and will keep them, whereas the 
rivals planned to have Wall Street package them for a quick profit. "We could 
bid as a holder to term, not to purchase and resell those loans tomorrow 
afternoon at 2 o'clock," Ford said.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll see. That said, Perelman already has made a deal to sell First 
Nationwide's $1.3 billion of Chicago deposits to another bank for a whopping 
$94 million; he says in his filings that he also may sell the other $6 billion 
of non-California deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the plot unfolding: Perelman sells non-California deposits at 
premium prices, sheltering the profits with the tax benefits from Act I. While 
selling those deposits dear, our hero will buy California deposits at current, 
depressed prices. He thus builds First Nationwide's California operation into 
an efficient, mighty power and brings down the house by selling at a huge 
profit.  
</P>
<P>
 "This ain't church," Gerald Ford said. "We're really in it for the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. This part, Fitzgerald would have understood perfectly. "Let me tell 
you about the very rich," he wrote. "They are different from you and me."  
</P>
<P>
 Hmm. Maybe F. Scott really did have Ron Perelman in mind after all.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: GLOBAL MANAGERS OFTEN STICK CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean-Marie Eveillard is a respected global-investment manager who runs the 
highly regarded, $1.9-billion SoGen International Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 You probably figure he spends most of his time shuttling around the world in 
search of the next hot stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, he works in New York and rarely leaves the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on the road maybe once a year," says Eveillard, a native of western 
France. "I might go somewhere for a couple of days and visit a few companies. 
That's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Managing an international fund from a base in the United States may seem as 
odd as running a farm from a high-rise on Wilshire Boulevard. But it's more 
common than you might think. And the manager's location doesn't affect the 
overall performance of foreign funds all that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen any evidence one way or another," says Anthony Cragg, a 
London native who manages the Strong International Stock and Strong Asia 
Pacific Funds from the unlikely locale of suburban Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are obvious advantages to being close to a foreign market's 
pulse, there are also drawbacks, one of which is the danger of getting swept up 
in the local herd mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investment managers, for example, have a reputation for mistiming 
their own market, lunging after stocks near market peaks and selling en masse 
near troughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreigners have consistently done better in that market than the Japanese," 
says Cragg, who worked in Asia for nine years, then in London for seven before 
joining Strong in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Eveillard tells of some New Zealand brokers who recommended that he not buy 
New Zealand bonds back in the mid-1980s, even though they were yielding more 
than 20% at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond market there had been so bad for so long that the locals were 
discouraged," says Eveillard, who made the investment anyway, and turned a big 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As outsiders, we could take a fresh look." 
</P>
<P>
 Another drawback to maintaining an office abroad is that you can only be in 
one place at a time anyway. Thus, there's no particular advantage to being 
headquartered in Europe, for example, if you're also buying Asian and Latin 
American stocks for your portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're based in the U.S., you can be much more objective on all the 
international areas, even if you are probably a bit biased in favor of the 
U.S.," says David Peebles, manager of the USAA Investment International Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 He has outperformed the average international fund in each of the last four 
calendar years from his base in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to innovations in communications, it's a lot easier to keep abreast 
of foreign companies and markets than it was even a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has changed a lot since the early 1960s, when Eveillard, as a young 
stock analyst, used to dart around the streets of Paris on a motor scooter, 
attending shareholder meetings and gathering annual reports in person as one of 
the few ways to pry information out of the tight-lipped French corporations of 
that era. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that some international fund managers don't spend most of 
their time far from American soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate globe-trotter in the fund business is Mark Mobius, an 
emerging-markets specialist for the Franklin/Templeton Group. Living in East 
Asia since 1965, Mobius estimates he travels about 100,000 miles a year on 
business. He maintains two offices -- one in Hong Kong and one in Singapore -- 
and speaks "bits and pieces" of six foreign tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobius says his grass-roots research efforts depend on extensive travel. 
</P>
<P>
 International fund managers who don't have Mobius' tolerance for airline food 
and hotel rooms tend to rely on analysts to do a lot of tire kicking on 
location. Eveillard, for example, works with three analysts, and Peebles with 
two. Analysts at both companies spend more time abroad than do the two 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cragg, however, spends six to seven weeks a year traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund managers also purchase research from brokerages specializing in various 
foreign markets, often paying for this service by throwing commission business 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, manager location doesn't seem to be a critical factor 
in predicting the success of an international fund. But it may be more 
important for certain types of funds, such as those run by value managers 
focusing on smaller foreign stocks and emerging markets that aren't being 
closely picked over. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're doing a lot of original research, it clearly helps to have people 
based around the world," says George Murnaghan, a spokesman for the T. Rowe 
Price fund group in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "But location isn't as important as other factors, such as the approach, style 
and experience of the people running a fund." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A former portfolio manager for GT Global in San Francisco has unveiled one of 
the first mutual funds to invest in Asian convertible bonds. The new Matthews 
Asian Convertible Securities Fund is the brainchild of Paul Matthews, former 
manager of GT Pacific Growth, and Carol Chuang, a Singapore native who has 
worked for several investment firms in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-load fund (800-789-ASIA) requires a $25,000 minimum investment and is 
headquartered in San Francisco. Convertibles are bonds that can be exchanged 
into stock assuming the underlying shares perform well. Small World 
</P>
<P>
 Most international mutual funds actually are run from offices in the United 
States by American-born managers. But some high profile portfolios, such as the 
ones listed below, either have foreign managers or are headquartered overseas: 
</P>
<P>
 * T. Rowe Price International ($6 billion in assets): Lead manager Martin 
Wade, an Englishman, works in London. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor International ($3 billion): Swede Hakan Castegren manages the fund 
from Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fidelity Emerging Markets ($2.2 billion): Englishman Richard Hazelwood runs 
the fund from Boston 
</P>
<P>
 * Templeton Developing Markets ($2.1 billion): New York-born portfolio manager 
Mark Mobius runs the fund from Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 * SoGen International ($1.9 billion): Manager Jean-Marie Eveillard, a native 
of France, is based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * Montgomery Emerging Markets ($930 million): Co-manager Josephine Jimenez of 
the Philippines works out of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fidelity Southeast Asia ($860 million): Allan Liu, a native of Macao, is 
headquartered in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch Developing Capital Markets ($430 million): Grace Pineda of the 
Philippines oversees the fund from Princeton, N.J.

 Consumers looking for financial advice continue to snap up advice manuals on 
everything from handling credit to investing. However, few people realize that 
there are rafts of smaller handbooks and pamphlets that do a solid job of 
explaining many of these same topics -- and they're free. 
</P>
<P>
 The free books, put out by consumer groups, investment companies and even the 
federal government are often partisan, containing subtle advertisements for the 
companies or industry groups that sponsor them. Nonetheless, many are 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a list of some of the better recent offerings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Consumer Information Center's new "Consumer Information Catalog" focuses 
on employment issues, including hiring an employment agency to help you find 
work. The catalogue, which also lists more than 200 free and low-cost federal 
publications on a wide array of subjects -- from banking to helping your kids 
cope with school -- can be ordered by writing to: Consumer Information Catalog, 
Pueblo, CO 81009. 
</P>
<P>
 * New York-based Citibank has a series of credit guides geared to different 
market segments. There's "Money Matters for Young Adults," "Money Matters for 
Women," "Money Matters for Newlyweds" and "Coping with a Credit Crisis." The

guides can be ordered by calling (800) 669-2635. 
</P>
<P>
 * Key Federal Savings Bank, in Havre de Grace, Md., specializes in offering 
secured credit cards to people with checkered payment records. Predictably, the 
bank's free books focus on that market.  
</P>
<P>
 "Managing Your Credit" is a 24-page booklet that provides an overview on 
responsible credit management. Order by calling (800) 228-5757. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Recover from a Bankruptcy . . . and Get a Credit Card" outlines steps 
to take to restore good credit after a personal bankruptcy. Call (800) 
228-3303. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's pocket-sized "rate finder" helps calculate and compare the total 
cost of a secured credit card. Call (800) 235-7285. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Consumers League published 11 new pamphlets and work sheets 
covering everything from budgeting and getting a second mortgage to avoiding 
financial scams. The nonprofit group doesn't charge for the booklets, but asks 
that consumers send $3 to defray the cost of postage. 
</P>
<P>
 The packet includes a budget booklet and work sheet titled "Three Steps to Put 
You in Control of Your Pocketbook;" several mortgage booklets; a pamphlet on 
avoiding credit repair scams, and "Denied Credit? The Credit Report Blues," 
which explains how to get, review and correct your credit report.

limits, rates, fees and qualifications for the various types of federally 
sponsored student loans. Write to: United Student Aid Funds Inc., P.O. Box 
6180, Indianapolis, IN. 46206-6180. Or phone (800) 562-6872. 
</P>
<P>
 * T. Rowe Price's "Personal Strategy Planner" gives basic investment 
information and tips on how to diversify your nest egg, set goals and determine 
your risk tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore mutual fund company also offers excellent kits that explain 
investment strategies for retirement. One, the "Retirement Planning Kit," is 
aimed at those who have several years -- if not decades -- before retirement.

interest rates started to rise last February, but Fidelity Investments' 
"Discovering Opportunities with Fixed Income Investments" is, nonetheless, 
recommended reading. The 40-page guide explains the difference between various 
types of fixed-income investments, ranging from Treasury issues to 
mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit. And it explains how 
these investments can fit into your portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity also offers several other fine informational brochures on investing, 
including "Common Sense Guide to Investing in International Stock Funds" and

market investments and evaluating risk. "Investing for College" explains how to 
set up a regular investment plan, how to diversify among investments and 
includes a work sheet to estimate future education costs.

<P>
 "Investing for Retirement" explains how to balance and maintain a retirement 
portfolio, how to use individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s to your best 
advantage, and work sheets to help estimate how much money you'll need.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOME SALE TAX BREAK: GET MOVING

 Q: My wife and I are building a new home that has taken longer than two years 
to complete. We sold our home in August, 1992, for $305,000 after expenses, and 
as of the end of August, 1994, we had spent about $201,000 on the new home. Our 
cost basis in the old home was $225,000. I am getting differing opinions from 
my attorney and accountant about my tax liability. One says I must have moved 
into the replacement home with 24 months of the sale of the original home; the 
other says the replacement home must have cost at least as much as the 
original. I am confused. -- D.L . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Both your accountant and your attorney are correct. To defer your entire 
tax obligation on profits realized from the sale of your principal residence, 
your replacement residence must cost at least as much as the one you sold -- 
and you must move into the replacement home within 24 months after the sale of 
the original home. (Taxpayers may still purchase a replacement house within 24 
months prior to the sale of their home, but they must move into the replacement 
residence within two years after the sale to qualify for the tax deferral.) 
</P>
<P>
 So far, you have neither invested as much as you received from your home sale 
nor moved into your replacement house. In fact, because you did not even spend 
an amount equal to the tax basis in your original home -- $225,000 -- within 24 
months of its sale, you are liable for taxes on the full amount of your gain, 
some $80,000. (This is computed by deducting your $225,000 tax basis from the 
$305,000 sales price.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you had spent more than $225,000, but less than $305,000, you would have 
been liable for taxes on the difference between the sales price and what you 
had reinvested in the home under construction within the 24-month period. 
401(k) Money: Touch It at Your Own Risk 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently left my job to start my own business. I received a check for 
$4,000 from my employer's 401(k) account. I would like to use the money for 
personal uses. Are there any penalties or special tax repercussions if I do not 
roll it into an individual retirement account? I will wait for an answer before 
I cash the check. -- R.R . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You bet there are repercussions -- and penalties, too!  
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers under age 59 1/2 who take disbursements from their 401(k) or IRA 
accounts face a 10% early withdrawal penalty on those funds. In addition, the 
money is subject to ordinary income taxes, just like your salary or other 
earnings. (Remember, 401(k) and IRA accounts were established to help you save 
for your retirement; hence the penalty for early withdrawal. And because most 
funds deposited into these accounts have not been taxed, any withdrawals of 
untaxed revenue are subject to ordinary income taxes.) The net effect is that 
you face losing $400 of your funds as a penalty and, depending on your tax 
bracket, at least another $700 to $1,400 in federal and state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, even if you decided not to spend any of your 401(k) money and 
intended to deposit it all into an IRA, you would still be subject to a 20% 
withholding tax on the $4,000. Why? Under rules that took effect in January, 
1993, taxpayers cashing out of their employer's 401(k) or other qualified 
pension plan are subject to a 20% withholding tax on the disbursement if they 
take possession of the money rather than rolling it directly into a qualified 
employer pension plan or individual retirement account. If you had wanted to 
roll your 401(k) account over into an IRA, you should have directed your 
employer to deposit the funds directly into that account. Never, never take 
possession of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you do now? If you don't mind the 10% penalty, go ahead and use the 
money as you wish. If you regret your decision, however, your choices are 
limited. Chances are your previous employer is powerless to cancel the check it 
has already issued and reissue a new one to an IRA account of your choice. 
According to employee benefits experts, 401(k) withdrawals are immediately 
reported to the IRS. It is highly unlikely that yours can be canceled. The best 
you can do is deposit the check in a rollover IRA and make up out of your own 
pocket any funds that were withheld as taxes on the disbursement. You can claim 
those taxes when you file your income tax next year. Rules Are Rigid on the 
$125,000 Exclusion 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We are eligible to use the $125,000 profit exclusion when we sell our home. 
However, we have not lived in the house for the last five years. Is there any 
way we can possibly use the exclusion now? If not, can we transfer it to the 
new house that we will buy? -- R.S.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: To use the $125,000 profit exclusion on a home sale, you must be at least 
age 55. (If you are a married couple, at least one of you must be at least 55.) 
In addition, the home being sold must be your principal residence, and you must 
have lived in it for at least three of the five years immediately preceding the 
home's sale. All three requirements must be met. No waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, despite what you think, you are not eligible to use the $125,000 exemption 
now because you clearly have not met the third requirement. And since you 
haven't lived in the house for five years, one might even wonder if it can 
still be considered your principal residence. But, not to worry. There is 
nothing preventing you from using your exemption when you sell the home into 
which you are moving now. Of course, if your new home costs less than what you 
are selling your old house for, you will be liable for taxes that you will not 
be able to offset with the exclusion. You would be better off purchasing a 
replacement home now that costs at least as much as the home you are selling 
and saving the exclusion for the time when you are ready to sell the 
replacement home.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE FORWARD THINKER; GREGORY BENFORD IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL 
SCIENTIST. NOR YOUR TYPICAL SCI-FI WRITER. TO HIM, THE FUTURE IS NOT A SCARY 
PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sporting a blue Hawaiian shirt, brown shorts and red thongs, Gregory Benford 
hardly looks the picture of academic decorum, let alone fits the stereotype of 
an internationally known astrophysicist. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bearded scientist, seated at a paper-strewn desk in his office in the 
physical science building at UC Irvine, can be excused his 
Moondoggie-Goes-to-the-Luau attire. Scientists, after all, are not 9-to-5ers. 
And even when classes are not in session, Benford often drives to the campus 
from his Laguna Beach home to do research. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, he's been studying the center of the galaxy, 
specifically the dozens of massive electrical discharges occurring within a few 
hundred light-years of the black hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I think they're a form of immense lightning," says Benford, who 
served on the Reagan Administration panel that advocated the futuristic defense 
technology known as Star Wars. He now advises NASA on space travel and acts as 
a consultant for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  
</P>
<P>
 But the academic setting in which Benford toils provides little clue to his 
double life. For the past quarter-century, he has parlayed his expertise of 
science fact into an award-winning career in science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Benford is a two-time winner of the Nebula Award, the highest honor bestowed 
by the Science Fiction Writers of America, for "If the Stars Are Gods," his 
1976 novel about the exploration of the solar system, and "Timescape," his 1980 
bestseller about a team of scientists who attempt to communicate back in time 
to prevent ecological disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timescape," still in print in 10 languages, was lauded by the Manchester 
Guardian as "quite probably the best novel about scientists yet written."  
</P>
<P>
 Benford's "accurate, telling accounts of scientists at work," as Kirkus 
Reviews once put it, are a hallmark of his novels. Said a Washington Post 
reviewer: "In the rapidly shrinking world of 'hard' SF, Benford is just about 
the best novelist now at work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard" science fiction, Benford says, is "that which is scientifically 
scrupulous. It's the real stuff -- fiction about science the way it really is, 
and the science in it is accurate. It's not willy-nilly garbage like the media 
SF of 'Stars Wars' and 'Star Trek' and all that trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Benford's latest book, "Furious Gulf," (Bantam Spectra) is about an expedition 
exploring the black hole at the center of the galaxy. It's the fifth in his 
"Galactic Center" series, which began in 1976 with "In the Ocean of the Night." 
 
</P>
<P>
 One of Benford's longtime fans is best-selling suspense author Dean Koontz, 
who in his 1981 book on how to write a bestseller cited Benford's "Timescape" 
as an example "of how good science fiction can be when it really tries." 
</P>
<P>
 Benford and Koontz, a Newport Beach resident, have since become good friends, 
with Benford and his wife, Joan, getting together frequently with Koontz and 
his wife, Gerda.  
</P>
<P>
 "We share an interest in good food and good wine and good conversation, so 
that means our relationship is largely conducted over dinners," Koontz says. He 
and Benford also talk frequently on the phone, "usually complaining about the 
publishing business. Writers love to complain to other writers about the 
publishing business. And, of course, in every instance we consider ourselves 
saints and everyone else in the business Philistines." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things he most likes about Benford, Koontz says, is "his unshakable 
sense of humor, which is generally based on human folly, and therefore there's 
plenty of material." Benford can also be self-deprecating, Koontz says with a 
chuckle. "If he's not, then I make fun of him. I always try to give him 
balance. It bothers me that he's a successful physicist and a successful 
writer, and therefore I try to humble him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home base for the Benfords is Laguna's Mystic Canyon. Their comfortable, 
custom-built house on Skyline Drive, which boasts lots of wood and windows and 
a deck with a sweeping view of the ocean, barely survived the firestorm last 
fall that wiped out scores of nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benfords, who have been married 27 years, moved here in 1972, shortly 
after Benford joined the UC Irvine faculty. A die-hard waterman, he heads down 
to the beach every other day in the summer to swim, surf or scuba dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's 23-year-old daughter, Alyson, is an artist in Portland, Ore. Son 
Mark, 21, spent part of the past school year traveling around the world with 
the University of Pittsburgh's Semester at Sea program and now attends Clark 
Honors College at the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Benford, who has worked as an outreach teacher for the Laguna Beach 
Museum of Art, met her husband in La Jolla in the mid '60s when he was working 
on his master's degree in physics and she was head of the art department at a 
private girls school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always interested in new ideas and new things," she says. "He has a 
lively intellect and an interest in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Settling into the carpeted conversation pit -- a favorite family hangout with 
its TV and fireplace -- Benford talks about two of his favorite subjects: 
science fiction and the future. There is, he acknowledges, an advantage to 
writing science fiction as a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, you know the landscape," he says. "It's the same advantage of being a 
lawyer and writing lawyer novels, or it's (ex-police officer) Joe Wambaugh's 
advantage in writing his fiction. It really helps if you know your subject 
matter immediately. I find that enormously useful because then you can 
concentrate on all the usual novelistic things -- the character, the plot and 
so forth -- and you don't have to spend an enormous amount of time learning 
another trade essentially." 
</P>
<P>
 The events portrayed in science fiction are based on imagination, he says, 
"but in true science fiction you are constrained by science, and that doesn't 
make it any easier because it's not the ordinary world that you're describing. 
You have to describe it in a plausible way so an educated person would believe 
it makes sense, and you also have to make it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Benford comes by his ability to tell an interesting story naturally, having 
soaked up a lot of them as a boy in Alabama. It also helped that his mother was 
a high school English teacher who instilled a love of reading in him. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1941 in Mobile -- "because that was the only hospital in southern 
Alabama" -- he grew up in Robertsdale, a small town on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Benford's birth, his father, an Army reservist who taught high 
school agriculture classes and oversaw agriculture education for southern 
Alabama, was called up for active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 During their early years, Benford and his identical twin, James, spent summers 
on their grandmother's farm. It was there, listening to his relatives, that he 
picked up the storytelling tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the 1940s; there was no television," he says. "It was a different 
age -- it was not swamped by media; it was swamped by reality, and storytelling 
was a very big art where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
 When Benford's father returned from the war, he went back to teaching high 
school. But a few years later, he accepted a commission as a regular Army 
officer. In 1949, he was assigned to Japan, and the family moved to Tokyo for 
three years, followed by three more in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Japan that Benford began reading science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really liked it," he says, "particularly people like Robert Heinlein, who 
depicted a future that was much more interesting than this present and also 
(depicted) what kind of skill would make it possible to live and work in that 
future to have an interesting life. In other words, the core thing was science. 
Science would lead you to a more interesting life than something else." 
</P>
<P>
 A major influence in Benford's decision to become a scientist was the 1957 
launch of Sputnik, the Soviet spacecraft that put new emphasis on science 
education in American classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sputnik, Benford recalls, captured everyone's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fulfilled the prophesies in the science fiction I had been reading," he 
says. "It convinced me that science fiction was worth writing more so than 
conventional fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science fiction not only predicted (space flight), it measurably made it 
happen. The people who built the space program -- both Soviet and U.S. -- were 
readers of science fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a bachelor's degree in physics at the University of Oklahoma, 
Benford moved to California in 1963 to work on his master's degree at UC San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a respite from constant studying, he began to write short stories for 
relaxation. To his "vast surprise," they began to sell. "It was a pleasant 
hobby, but I just wanted to get my research done and get out into the real 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a doctorate from UC San Diego in 1967, Benford went to work as a 
physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory but left after four years 
to join the Irvine faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted more freedom of movement so that I could work on whatever I wanted 
to," Benford says. Several years ago, he added a more down-to-earth subject to 
his research agenda: the increasing loss of species. "We're losing them at the 
rate of a roughly a dozen species a day," says Benford, who will chair a 
National Academy of Sciences workshop at UC Irvine next month that will examine 
conservation strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benford still views writing as a hobby to work on during evenings and 
weekends. This "slow and steady" approach has paid a high rate of literary 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, he has had 17 novels published, including "Beyond the Fall of 
Night," which he co-wrote with sci-fi master Arthur C. Clarke. Benford and 
Clarke, who lives in Sri Lanka, correspond regularly on scientific and literary 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperback edition of Benford's 1993 Orange County-set novel "Chiller" -- a 
suspense novel involving cryonics and written under the pseudonym Sterling 
Blake -- is due this month from Bantam. And the same publisher will put out his 
short story collection in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Benford just turned in the manuscript for the sixth and final volume in his 
"Galactic Center" series, and he's thinking about his next project: a 
nonfiction book about the implications of modern technologies on the far 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what he sees as a "anti-rational, anti-scientific" stance in 
contemporary American society -- "the standard plot structure in films and 
novels is 'secret government technology goes bad' " -- Benford maintains a 
positive view, a vision that is reflected in his novels. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the role of a science-fiction writer to provide solutions to 
problems, Benford says, "but by sketching a future you want to at least imply 
solutions, unless you're just going to write about a future in which everything 
breaks down and collapses." 
</P>
<P>
 The best science fiction, he says, "is scientifically accurate, stylistically 
adroit and also emotionally fulfilling as it looks at where we're going. I 
mean, the only thing we have control over is where we're going.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's changed in my time is that the fundamental moral questions of our 
society have come to be framed in terms of 'If this goes on, what then? ' That 
wasn't the cast of literature of 100 or even 50 years ago. Most literature is 
about, 'Hey, this happened.' Which is fun, but. . . ." Gregory Benford 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No; born in Mobile, Ala., lives in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to Joan Benford; two grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Swimming, surfing, scuba diving, backpacking, traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 On the appeal of writing of science fiction: "It's the chance to exercise 
imagination and to think beyond the ordinary. Conventional fiction is fine, but 
it doesn't stretch you. And often it's about the problems of the past, and the 
thing about the problems of the past is, you can be concerned about them, but 
you don't have to do anything. It's the literary equivalent of easy-listening 
music. It demands no effort on your part." 
</P>
<P>
 On the status of science education in schools: "State management of education 
enforces a mediocrity that militates against science education. That's the 
short answer. You have to pay science teachers more and state-run mechanisms 
won't, so they don't get very good teachers. Big surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 On achieving notoriety in his secondary career: "Any writer is better known 
than almost any scientist, but is that the measure? That makes movie stars the 
most prominent people in the world. I think they're kind of comparable careers. 
I certainly spend much more time on physics than I do on writing."

WHY MUST THERE BE RULES ON HOW GIRLS 'SHOULD' BE?; STEREOTYPES: WHEN SHE IS

<P>
 Rachel, Rebecca and Julia are girls. That's obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 They're 10 years old. Their dark hair is short, their legs muscular, their 
chests flat. They're soccer players, really good soccer players, and they dress 
the part -- running shorts, T-shirts, cleats. They're also smart, funny, 
exuberant and brimming with the self-esteem and camaraderie organized athletics 
has given them. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as they have recently learned, some people consider their profile and 
their gender to be mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 It began as one of those silly sideline rumors; the opposing (and losing) team 
was said to have complained that Rachel, Rebecca and Julia were not, in fact, 
girls but boys posing as girls. Their parents, teammates and coaches were, of 
course, incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel's mother, hoping to dismiss the rumor as just that, approached a man on 
the other side and inquired as to the existence of such a laughable claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's revolting," was all the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she thought the man might be referring to the absurdity of the 
gossip. But his gruff tone and huffy demeanor quickly set her straight. He was 
revolted by the sickening sight of those three transvestites -- those 
10-year-olds in drag! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Rachel happens to be my niece. And having changed her diaper on numerous 
occasions, I can attest to her femaleness. Moreover, having watched her first 
decade of growth, I can say that one of Rachel's many outstanding qualities is 
that she is who she is -- stubbornly, gloriously honest and individualistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many a time have I rejoiced in how miraculously immune she is to the insidious 
effects of stereotypes of any kind. She can be loud and tough and aggressive; 
she can be quiet and gentle and bookish. She is always herself. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also pretty insightful. Her summation of the charge against her: "It's 
so stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel's mother (my sister) and I have attempted to probe the nature of this 
stupidity. Does it mean that girls still must be frilly and physically inept to 
be "real" girls? Does it mean that if they are close-cropped and athletically 
skilled they must not be girls at all? 
</P>
<P>
 I keep thinking of Donald Trump's comment on the Native Americans whose 
business acumen is rapidly edging him out of the casino business: "They don't 
look like Indians," he fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: They don't look like the stock characters we've been conditioned 
to expect, and/or there's got to be some hidden and unscrupulous explanation 
for their astounding success. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's got kids in organized sports knows what a fascinating social 
laboratory the sidelines can be, parental competitiveness being one of the more 
explosive (and ugly) chemical reactions to routinely take place there. 
</P>
<P>
 But one heartening observation I've made during my many hours in the lab this 
spring is that there is, in fact, a burgeoning population of Rachels, Rebeccas 
and Julias -- girl athletes who do defy the traditional female profile. But 
they're too numerous and too well integrated into their social milieu to be 
tossed off as "tomboys" or any other eccentric subset. 
</P>
<P>
 The "revolted" man on the opposing team isn't the only one who has failed to 
come to terms with this phenomenon. Even my sister and I, who grew up when team 
sports were an exclusively male domain and we girls were consigned to cheering 
from the sidelines in our frosted lipstick, ran into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We found ourselves seeking to affirm Rachel's femaleness by pointing out that 
she had just enthusiastically selected a fancy bridesmaid dress and her first 
low-heeled pumps. And maybe, we added, if she'd been wearing her earrings 
(they're prohibited during play), this wouldn't have happened. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We were really starting to flail -- What does a 10-year-old girl look like, 
anyway? Does Rachel look like a boy? -- when my 17-year-old, an athlete 
himself, happened onto the conversation and with one breathtakingly spare 
observation put the matter firmly to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rachel," he said, "looks like a soccer player."

AUSTRALIA'S ULTIMATE ROAD TRIP; THE GREAT OCEAN ROAD IS A MEANDERING 
BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL DRIVE, THE DOWN UNDER VERSION OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAY 
1; THE THICK FOREST PREVENTED US FROM SEEING, THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY FROM 
HEARING, MANY ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STRAUSS, Strauss is television critic for the Asbury Park (N.J.) 
Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having been taught from early childhood the marvels of the "side road," I am 
immediately skeptical of any attraction too fabricated, too obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a friend suggested my family and I take something called the Great 
Ocean Road during our recent trip to Australia, I was immediately suspect. The 
first thing I learned was that the Great Ocean Road doesn't entirely run along 
an ocean -- and, then, that its 185-mile length of asphalt was built as a works 
project during Australia's Depression and opened in 1932 specifically as a 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 But then I looked at a map of Victoria, Australia's southeasternmost state. 
And I discovered the Great Ocean Road was indeed the side road between 
Melbourne and Adelaide 454 miles to the west, at least three other routes being 
quite faster, much straighter and far more trafficked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Ocean Road, I also learned, is a winding, two-lane byway meandering 
along the Bass Strait, which connects the Pacific and Southern oceans and 
separates Victoria from the island state of Tasmania. In its relatively short 
run, it slithers past small seaside-resort towns, up through the rain-forested 
Otway Ranges and back down along often wind-swept stone seawalls. And like its 
American cousin, Big Sur's Highway 1, it is one massively beautiful drive -- 
cliff-hugging hairpin turns and dreamlike vistas, with pounding surf on one 
side and majestic mountains on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts dispensed with, my wife, daughter and I set out from Melbourne, 
Australia's second-largest city, early on a weekday fall morning (April is 
early fall, the seasons being opposite in the Southern Hemisphere). 
</P>
<P>
 The road southwest from the city, along its industrial corridor, took us past 
trucks belching diesel fumes and factories apparently designed by architects 
too caught up with their T-squares. But as we passed Geelong, the last of the 
industrial suburbs about 60 miles from Melbourne, the road changed from four 
lanes to two and became like most Australian highways -- narrow and pastoral. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty miles farther, past what seemed like thousands of cud-crunching cows 
and sheep with wooly coats puffed up for the coming Australian winter, we 
reached the little resort town of Torquay, the opening note of the Great Ocean 
Road. Torquay is western Victoria's surfing capital; the action is especially 
strong at Bell's Beach, home of 20-foot-high waves and an Easter surfing 
championship. Though there were no surfers out when we reached Torquay, the 
waves were pounding heartily against the many coves surrounding the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Torquay is a scenic spot with a population of 5,000. It's a place that smacks 
a bit of the worn hippie look, where a generation ago muscled guys with 
battered surfboards searching for the perfect wave settled in for a spell and 
built a pre-New Age infrastructure. Accommodations are Spartan, but clean; 
whitewashed pre-World War II hotels mix with undistinguished camper-van parks 
and post-war motels. Eating tends to be beer garden, pizza and what appears to 
be the hip Australian cuisine of the 1990s, Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its beaches (most of which are prone to strong winds), Torquay, like 
most every small and large town in Australia, promotes its bush walks. The best 
bush-walking trail in Torquay is called the surf coast walk, which follows the 
coastline up and down grassy ridges for about 20 miles. Sea views (and the 
exercise getting them) are its prime attraction. With my 2-year-old daughter, 
Ella, in a backpack, I was not about to do the whole thing. But, we happily 
discovered, Australians don't expect you to. Bush walking is supposed to be a 
pleasure, not a competition, and the sooner we got the hang of not completing 
every last centimeter of a trail, the more we got to like doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those first 60 miles of the Great Ocean Road out of Torquay could take an hour 
and a half or the better part of two days, depending on your inclination to 
dawdle in the scenery. We split the difference and stopped every so often to 
dutifully breathe in the salt air. 
</P>
<P>
 We passed through two more seaside resorts about half the size of Torquay: 
Anglesea and Lorne. The air was crisp with a stiff breeze; tourists bounded 
jauntily in and out of small craft shops, delis and bakeries; the buildings 
themselves were bland but clean. We stopped in Lorne for a snack and watched 
some proper men, all dressed in white, bowling on a manicured lawn overlooking 
the ocean. Lawn bowling as a spectator sport usually falls somewhere between 
watching slugs slither and ragweed germinate, but the dramatic setting helped 
captivate us for nearly a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't do much bush walking in this first part of the Great Ocean Road, 
though we read of trails inland to pretty waterfalls and along the 
grass-and-rock outcroppings to scenic lookouts. We were saving our hiking legs 
for the part of the road that wound into the mountains. In the meantime, any 
seaside view we could get without clambering up rocks with little Ella was 
grand enough for us. 
</P>
<P>
 We stopped for the night at the point where the Great Ocean Road bends away 
from the sea toward the Otway Ranges. Here in Apollo Bay, a town of only 900 
year-round inhabitants that swells to at least four times that number in 
summer, the road becomes the main drag, the Esplanade.  
</P>
<P>
 After checking in at the $37-a-night Grandview Lodge, perhaps the only place 
in town without a view, we trundled down to the Esplanade for dinner at the 
Apollo Bay Hotel. ("Hotel" in Australia indicates a place with a liquor 
license, not necessarily one with rooms to let.) As we found all over 
Australia, restaurant meal portions range from immense to obscene. The Apollo's 
decor was more roadhouse than the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
 But our meal made up for it: A piece of gemfish, a basslike fish found in the 
Indian Ocean, flopped over the bow and stern of my plate. My wife and daughter 
shared a piece of roast lamb the size of a Kareem Abdul Jabbar sneaker, but 
still tender. With an unlimited salad bar of several different homemade 
offerings, an orange juice and four steins of beer, the feast came to only $21. 
</P>
<P>
 From Apollo Bay there were only 64 miles or so of the Great Ocean Road to go, 
but each turn seemed to promise something different. Turning away from the Bass 
Strait toward the mountains gave us a fine contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Otways are part of one of the world's few temperate rain forests, and most 
of the land along the 35-mile stretch is state nature preserve. You can stop 
and take any number of well-marked or self-made bush walks. There are no 
rangers or guides, but signage is good. We took our bush walk on the trail in 
Melba Gully State Park, where the prime draw along the two-mile hike is the 
world's largest great gum tree, 300 years old and 88 feet in diameter. A member 
of the eucalyptus family, it resides almost unobtrusively -- with only a small 
sign next to it and a little "don't touch" rope around -- among the many ferns, 
mosses and other eucalyptus trees in the dense, perpetually misty forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The thick forest prevented us from seeing, though not necessarily from 
hearing, many animals. But we did get a glimpse of several wallabies -- those 
small cousins of the kangaroo -- hidden in the ferns, and a number of small 
birds such as jays and sparrows. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime attraction of the Great Ocean Road, at least the one most often seen 
in tourist brochures, was still ahead as the highway turned back to the coast 
through Port Campbell National Park. Out of the mists of the Otways we glimpsed 
the outlines of spectacular sandstone outcroppings -- huge pillars rising 100 
feet or more up from the Bass Strait, their sides smoothed by years of pounding 
from wind and water, making them look like rooks or bishops from a 
Brancusi-like chessboard. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Twelve Apostles, a dozen majestic stone shafts separated from 
the cliffed coast through thousands of years of erosion. The creators of the 
Great Ocean Road knew a good natural attraction when they saw one, so they 
started naming each piece of carved-out stone along this 12-mile stretch of 
coast. We, like the small caravan of other tourists braving the fall winds, 
stopped at virtually every scenic vista along the way.  
</P>
<P>
 On down the road from the Twelve Apostles was Loch Ard Gorge, where we 
strolled the boardwalks and admired several magnificent blowholes as much as 
100 feet below us on the surf. Further on was London Bridge, a 200-yard 
bridgelike outcropping that caved in back in 1990, leaving visitors who'd 
walked out to the ocean end waiting, gape-mouthed, until an emergency 
helicopter came to rescue them. Finally, there was the Bay of Islands, a 
wonderful warren of eroded sandstone mounds 10 to 50 feet high, sitting in a 
quieter cove off the heavier surf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Ocean Road continues only a few more miles along the strait, but it 
would be a mistake to turn back toward Melbourne when the highway reaches its 
end in the town of Warrnambool. For the next 60 miles, we traveled on Victoria 
Highway 1 along the "Shipwreck Coast," where we were told more than 80 ships 
met their ends in the wind-swept waters of the Bass Strait from 1880 to 1930. 
We were intrigued by the whole shipwreck idea, but the Flagstaff Hill Maritime 
Village, a museum in Warrnambool, was closed the day we went by. Apparently, 
the Great Ocean Road saved even more ships from their doom, since cargo started 
coming in by highway almost exclusively after it was built, rather than over 
the rocky coast swells of the Bass Strait. 
</P>
<P>
 We were there a bit too early in the year to see the Southern Right whales, 
which have made a comeback in the nearby waters since the government started 
protecting them a generation ago. Southern Rights are cousins to the gray 
whales that migrate off California, but with a larger head and no dorsal fin. 
The whales visit during the Australian winter, from about May to October, and 
can be seen even from Warrnambool with standard binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our favorite stops along the entire road was Tower Hill State Game 
Reserve, a 15-minute drive past Warrnambool. A small park by Australian 
standards (about two square miles), Tower Hill is a treat -- not only for its 
animals, but for its landscape. We veered off the road and down the steep 
50-foot sides of a punch-bowl-like meteor crater whose landscape varied from 
scrub brush on the outer rims to eucalyptus forest and lakeside pines in the 
interior.  
</P>
<P>
 Walks are well marked and viewing spots are plentiful, as is the wildlife. The 
stars of Tower Hill are the koalas and emus. Thanks to a thick stand of 
eucalyptus, koalas were introduced there by state game officials. Koalas eat 
only leaves of certain eucalyptus and, with stands of those types being 
deforested in many parts of Australia, the need to transplant koalas to areas 
such as Tower Hill has become necessary. With Ella on my back and my sharp-eyed 
wife at my side, I trudged into the eucalyptus forest, certain of a good koala 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not disappointed. We spotted at least a dozen koalas, even though the 
nocturnal cuddlies tried to jam themselves into the crooks of the branches far 
up in the tallest trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Koalas would seem to be the ultimate little-kid animal -- shy, pug-nosed and 
furry. But then, you probably haven't seen a 2-year-old child flocked by emus. 
</P>
<P>
 The emu is the world's second-largest bird, smaller only than the African 
ostrich and, like the ostrich, flightless. They look a bit disheveled, with 
shaggy, brown feathers and off-white craggy heads. But they lope along on their 
skinny legs, undaunted by the humans around them. Their awkward gallops brought 
shrieks of delight from Ella, who viewed them as Big Bird incarnate. She chased 
them, and they chased back, and we could almost make out a grin on their beaks 
as they did. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the night in Port Fairy, 15 miles west of the Tower Hill Game 
Reserve. The fishing port of 2,500 residents claims to be the oldest 
continuously settled place on the Victoria coast, whalers having set up shop 
there from Tasmania in 1826. The town still has a lot of mid-19th-Century 
buildings, most of those on the main streets looking like the two-story 
quasi-Victorian structures familiar to Wild West movies. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some decent little eating places, mostly along Bank Street 
going away from the water. We stopped at the Portofino, a 
husband-chef/wife-hostess place where I had a local boar fish (similar to pike) 
baked in paprika; my wife, a spaghetti with shellfish in red garlic sauce; and 
Ella, a special-for-her-with-a-smile penne and cheese -- for only $24 the lot. 
Here, and in the rest of Australia, we never got the brush in a restaurant for 
having a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Australians we met said the country is no longer Crocodile-Dundee laid-back, 
but it seemed to us that no one was ever too rushed or aggravated to attend to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, we took a walk along the port, where a few dozen small, 
well-kept fishing boats were moored, and across a 100-yard causeway to 
Griffith's Island, where we and a half-dozen other tourists had heard that you 
could see some nesting mutton birds on the marshes just off a certain pier. 
None of us saw any, though it clearly would have been hard in the gloaming to 
see a mutton bird, since none of us knew anything about them save that they 
were a sooty gray with dark bills and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 We needed to get back to Melbourne for business, so we blitzed back from Port 
Fairy the next morning in five hours on the Princes Highway, one of Victoria's 
major roads. But we couldn't help wishing we'd had the time to meander back a 
bit more slowly -- along one of the world's finest "side roads," Victoria's 
Great Ocean Road. GUIDEBOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Winding Away From Melbourne 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Qantas and United have daily flights from Los Angeles to 
Melbourne; round-trip fares with 21-day advance-purchase start at $1,098. Most 
major car rental companies have offices in Melbourne; count on spending about 
$60 per day for a mid-size car. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The Lorne Hotel (Mountjoy Parade, Lorne; from the United 
States, telephone 011-61-52-89-1409, fax 011-61-52-89-2200) is an old-fashioned 
guest house; double rooms with baths, $48-$63 nightly. In Apollo Bay, we chose 
the unprepossessing Grandview Lodge, where two-bedroom suites with full 
kitchens cost $23-$51 per night, depending on the season, with highest rates 
charged Dec. 25 through January (1 McLennan St., Apollo Bay; tel. 
011-61-52-37-6461). In Port Fairy, we stayed at the Douglas-on-River Motel 
(Gipps Street, Port Fairy; tel. 011-61-55-68-1016) in a neat $33 room with 
views. There's also the handsome Dublin House Inn, an 1855 pub with the 
standards of a big-city hotel (57 Bank St., Port Fairy; tel. 011-61-55-68-1822; 
rates for a double room are $51-$83 per night). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: The Lorne serves a family bistro meal with counter service; 
Pacific Hotel (268 Mountjoy Parade, Lorne; local tel. 052-89-1609). Both offer 
local seafood and Australian beef and lamb; meals under $10. Huge, quality 
meals at the Apollo Bay Hotel (Great Ocean Road, Apollo Bay; tel. 052-37-6250); 
about $10 per person. Among several Bank Street restaurants, we chose Portofino 
(28 Bank Street, Port Fairy; tel. 055-68-1047); about $10 per person.

TRAVEL INSIDER: GETTING MORE AUSTRALIA OUT OF YOUR TRAVEL DOLLARS; AIR PASSES: 
THE BEST WAY TO SEE MANY COUNTRIES -- OR JUST HUGE ONES -- IS WITH DISCOUNTED 
TICKETS SOLD ONLY TO FOREIGN VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STRAUSS, Christopher Reynolds is on assignment.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rent a car in Lisbon, and you can see most of Portugal in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But rent a car in Sydney, and you and your car will be beat if you try to do 
all of Australia in a month. The continent measures 2,300 miles from east to 
west and 2,000 miles from north to south -- roughly the same size as the 
continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to sample the Land Down Under is to buy an airline pass, sold 
only to foreign visitors. For $484 each, my wife, daughter and I recently got 
to travel more than 4,000 miles on our Qantas Explorer Pass, from the wild rain 
forests of Tasmania, to Cairns on the Great Barrier Reef, to Sydney and 
Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Qantas and the other major Australian airline company, Ansett, offer 
passes that cost $484 for four flight segments; up to four additional flights 
are allowed at a cost of $121 each. The price goes up to $554 for four Qantas 
flights if any of your flights include the far western port of Perth, the Great 
Australian Desert sites of Alice Springs or Ayers Rock, or the Great Barrier 
Reef resort islands of Brampton, Dunk, Great Keppel or Lizard. On Ansett, the 
$554 fare includes Broome and Port Headlands in Western Australia, and Hayman 
Island on the Great Barrier Reef. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the higher tab is a bargain when you consider that you can go from 
Sydney to Perth to Alice Springs to the Great Barrier Reef and back to Sydney, 
nearly 6,000 air miles to some of the most amazing sites in the world, for the 
same price as a round-trip ticket between Sydney and Perth. 
</P>
<P>
 Qantas and Ansett require you to buy the passes before you leave the United 
States and ask that you set your itinerary before you embark on your first 
Australian flight. But you can change your schedule as often as you like at no 
extra charge, provided there's space on the plane. Qantas' Explorer Pass is 
valid to more than 100 cities within Australia; Ansett's Visit Australia 
Airpass is good to 24 Australian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of caveats: While we found Qantas personnel quite polite, they 
weren't always familiar with the air-pass concept. Getting confirmed seats for 
each flight often took a little cajoling with the agent over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of our Qantas air miles counted toward our American Airlines frequent 
flyer account (Qantas miles are also credited to Alaska and Continental's 
programs; Ansett miles are good on United's Mileage Plus program as long as you 
fly to Australia on a paid United ticket.) For some reason, though, American 
would not credit our miles in and out of Tasmania. Several calls to the airline 
produced different answers, most ending with, "That's just the way it is."  
</P>
<P>
 If your trip to the South Pacific includes time in New Zealand, you have 
several options. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Qantas and Ansett passes permit travel within New Zealand, as long as 
you've purchased an international ticket that includes travel between Australia 
and New Zealand. No more than two of the original four flight segments can be 
within New Zealand, and if your itinerary includes Queenstown, on New Zealand's 
South Island, you'll be charged $554 for the original four flights. Qantas' 
South Pacific Airpass allows travel to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic Air New Zealand Explorer Pass includes three flights and costs about 
$262 (actual price varies, depending on the rate of exchange); up to five 
additional flights can be purchased for about $88 each. The pass is valid for 
one year. Routing must be confirmed before arrival in New Zealand and cannot be 
changed, though dates can be changed without penalty. Mount Cook Airline's Kiwi 
Air Pass costs $548, starts in Auckland and allows one circular journey around 
New Zealand, stopping in each city once. The pass is good for 30 consecutive 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other foreign airlines have their own air passes, which must be purchased 
before you enter the country in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you buy a pass, figure out how much traveling you want to do and how 
much individual flights between those destinations would cost. You may spend 
less by adding those flights to the cost of your international ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a sampling of other air-pass possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina: Aerolineas Argentinas' Visit Argentina Pass costs $450 for four 
segments and $120 each for up to four more segments. The pass is valid for 30 
days; mid-trip itinerary changes are $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Caribbean: LIAT's Explorer pass, good for 21 days, costs $199 and allows three 
stops anywhere LIAT flies except Georgetown, Guyana and Caracas, Venezuela. A 
more extensive version, the Super Caribbean Explorer pass, allows one month of 
unlimited stops in one direction for $367.  
</P>
<P>
 Chile: Chile, which doesn't have roads along many Andean mountain stretches, 
also has an air pass offered by Lan Chile, the country's major airline. It 
costs $550 for unlimited flights within 21 days. If you only want to go south 
or north of Santiago, the pass costs $300. If you want to include the Pacific 
outpost of Easter Island (2,300 miles west of the South American mainland), the 
pass goes up to $1,080 for five flights.  
</P>
<P>
 Europe: The EuroFlyer Pass lets you buy coupons for flights to more than 100 
cities within Europe for $120 each, as long as you fly round trip from the U.S. 
to Paris on Air France, to Brussels on Sabena, or to Prague on CSA-Czechoslovak 
Airlines. You must buy at least three coupons and no more than nine. Before 
departure from the U.S., a cancellation fee of $120 applies; rerouting once 
travel begins costs $60 per flight segment. South Pacific: Qantas' Visit South 
Pacific Airpass allows travel between most of these countries: Australia, Cook 
Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, 
Tahiti, Tonga, Vanuatu, Wallis Islands, Futuna and Western Samoa. At least two 
flight segments must be purchased before arrival in the South Pacific. Cost per 
segment is $150-$300, depending on where you fly.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: GRIN AND BEAR IT IN MANITOBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canada's Hudson Bay -- 1,000 desolate miles north of Winnipeg, Manitoba -- has 
been called the polar bear capital of the world, and the time is approaching 
for the huge creatures to make their seasonal appearance there. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year from early October to mid-November, roughly 500 to 600 polar bears 
-- some weighing up to 1,200 pounds -- begin gathering on the outskirts of the 
tiny town of Churchill as they wait for the Hudson Bay ice pack to 
solidify.Once it's frozen, the bears move onto the ice to hunt seals through 
the winter. When spring arrives, they ride the ice pack south and during the 
summer, then wander along the shores of the Hudson Bay, slowly making their way 
back north to an area about 40 miles east of Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear watching makes for a unique wilderness adventure and every year thousands 
of tourists flock to the region. Many sign up for day tours aboard "tundra 
buggies," bus-like contraptions on huge tractor tires that provide the only way 
to reach the expanses outside of town where the bears roam. From the safety of 
the vehicles, tourists get a close-up look at the bears. The tours fill 
quickly; now is a good time to book for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Churchill is geared to tourism, its five motels also fill quickly and 
travelers are encouraged to book with a tour. Information on visiting Churchill 
is available from Travel Manitoba, 155 Carlton St., No. 7F, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
R3C 3H8; tel. (800) 665-0040.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: REVAMPING VISAS IN 4 COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visa policies are being revised in Turkey, Australia, Bhutan and Nepal, with 
the most significant change in Turkey, which for the first time is requiring 
Americans planning short-term trips to obtain visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Oct. 1, travelers to Turkey will have to plunk down $20 when they 
arrive at the airport or cruise port to get a visa that will be good for up to 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., said every effort is 
being made to streamline the process. "All that travelers need is a passport 
and the $20 fee. It will all be handled at a special desk and will only take 
minutes. We've been doing the same for British citizens for a couple of years 
and it's worked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey instituted the fees for administrative reasons. Travelers needing 
long-term and student visas should contact the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bhutan, tourists will not be allowed to obtain individual visas as of Jan. 
1, but must travel in groups of at least four. "Bhutan does not have the 
infrastructure to handle large numbers of individual tourists," said Brent 
Olson of InnerAsia Expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said tour operators usually make visa arrangements because Bhutan does 
not have a visa office in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal has done away with its single visa fee and replaced it with a tiered 
system. A 15-day, single-entry visa is now $15 and a 30-day single-entry is 
$25. Rates climb to $40 for a 30-day double-entry visa and $60 for a 60-day 
multiple entry visa. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia no longer requires photos on visa applications. New forms are 
available at the Australian Consulate General, 611 N. Larchmont Blvd., Los 
Angeles 90004; tel. (213) 469-4300.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: CONSUMER REPORTS' RATES ATLASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer Reports recently road tested six U.S. road atlases, rating Rand 
McNally the highest, based on accuracy, portability, completeness and ease of 
use. Next came AAA, Mobil, Gousha, American Map Corp. and Hammond, in that 
order. Some tips on road atlas buying: Look for the newest edition, and don't 
expect perfection -- all the atlases tested had some errors, alas.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: MAMMOTH; UPWARD BOUND; STEEP BIKE TRAILS, TREES TO DANGLE FROM 
. . . WHAT MORE CAN AN ADVENTUROUS FAMILY ASK FOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Sipchen writes for The Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing stops a tantrum like turning a bend in the trail and spotting your mom 
35 feet off the ground, fingernails sunk deep into lodgepole pine bark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A sappy grin swept our 4-year-old's tear-stained face. "Be careful, Mom!" 
Bobby called out, suddenly cheerful again. 
</P>
<P>
 My own smile was ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to keep money flowing when the snow pack melts, Mammoth Mountain, 
the vast Eastern Sierra ski resort, has cooked up an array of new . . . things 
to do -- some of which resemble activities that Marine recruits plead tearfully 
to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment our oldest daughter, Ashley, saw that the minimum age for the 
resort's new "adventure challenge course" was 10, she (10 by two weeks) had to 
give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 And someone had to do it with her. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'd been having so much fun lately . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Pam, fixed me with a peculiar, not entirely hateful stare, then 
stepped forward, forked over the money ($40 for her, $30 for Ashley) and began 
filling out the heap of liability waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, Pam faces life with equanimity. One fear to which she readily 
admits, though, is a fear of heights. Her only other phobia I can think of 
might be called "the fear of icky human potential movement numskullery." So, as 
I watched my wife and daughter disappear into the towering forest that morning, 
eyes closed, hands on strangers' shoulders in a sort of touchy-feely, 
trust-inducing conga line, I figured the vacation had taken a bad hop. 
</P>
<P>
 Our late August three-night stay had started more serenely. Before even 
reaching Mammoth, we pulled off California 395 at the Hot Creek Fish Hatchery 
just outside Mammoth and rumbled along the dirt road to the Mammoth Geothermal 
Area, where we immersed ourselves in California at its blissful best. 
Snow-encrusted Sierra peaks jabbed into blue sky to the west; the desolate 
Glass Mountains floated on the desert-dry eastern horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 With a blast-furnace wind huffing up Hot Creek, we slipped from currents cold 
enough to make trout shiver into pockets where magma-heated water grumbles up 
through the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lulled into tranquillity, we were ready for summertime Mammoth -- a much 
mellower place than Mammoth in winter, with its mad scramble of Angeleno skiers 
intent on maximizing their utilization of the facilities after massive 
recreational expenditures. The Mammoth Mountain Inn, part of the resort, offers 
a staggering range of lodging options and activities from approximately late 
May till mid-October. . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelmed by the choices, we simply rented a suite -- a cavernous 
one-bedroom condo with vaulted ceiling and Murphy bed -- for $99 a night. The 
complete kitchenette allowed us to subsist from dawn till dinner time on Cocoa 
Puffs and grilled cheese sandwiches, before venturing out to sample the 
resort's and the town's eclectic restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 A new, 36-foot-tall, rock-climbing monolith has become the inn's centerpiece. 
All day long, swarms of well-put-together parents barked encouragement as their 
little Biffs and Brees clambered for foot- and toeholds on the fiberglass wall 
($10 an hour, $30 for the day; the wall is open weekends only and closes in 
early October). 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it say about a people," I wondered as I stood there on the lawn, 
"when their lives are so free from real threat, so devoid of danger, that they 
crave ersatz adventure? And then transfer that lust to their kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 My reverie was interrupted by my 7-year-old daughter. "Belayer ready?" Emily 
asked. "Belay on," I said, hauling in climbing rope as she scrambled up the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropes and pseudo-rocks are fine, but the main draw at Mammoth in summer is the 
one most like skiing. So, on our second day, I rented two mountain bikes for 
the day ($35 each) and bought two passes to the mountain ($18 for a full-day 
adult pass, $9 for children). 
</P>
<P>
 First, Emily and I took off on a gentle, four-mile ride along a forested trail 
into town. We had lunch and a milkshake at Berger's, then loaded our bikes onto 
the resort's complimentary shuttle for the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley and I didn't do as well. Convinced that she could handle the 
intermediate trails, we loaded our bikes onto the gondola and got off at the 
halfway point. But Ashley had never ridden a mountain bike. Squeezing the 
brakes hurt her hands.  
</P>
<P>
 As we inched down a dusty zigzag trail, I had a full two hours to ponder an 
unpleasant truth: A ski resort without snow looks a lot like an open pit mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain does have its allure, though. On my own, I found the wind-rocked 
gondola ride to the 11,053-foot summit gloriously long and lonely, the peak 
like a lunar outpost. Exiting the gondola station -- unpeopled except for a 
couple of jumpsuit-attired operators -- I straddled my bike and tried to gain 
equilibrium. Wind gusted to 50 m.p.h., and the distant minarets looked more 
ominous than peaks within a taxpayer-supported national forest have any right 
to be.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tires skidding in pumice scree, I edged along the eastern brink of the whole 
Sierra Nevada, glimpsing a forlorn-looking farewell sign to my left as I 
rolled: 
</P>
<P>
 You are at the start of Kamikaze, the "West's most outrageous ride." You are 
riding at your own risk. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gripping the brakes almost constantly, I rode with what seemed like extreme 
caution, jaws jangling, legs absorbing the lurch of rocks that my tires spit 
out like bullets.  
</P>
<P>
 Peeling around a corner, I caught sight of a building. I marveled that I'd hit 
the halfway point so quickly. Then came a disorienting realization: I was ALL 
THE WAY DOWN. Even with several brief stops to gasp for air, the 3,100-foot 
vertical descent had taken only 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 My adrenal gland's most exhilarating workout, however, came in the afternoon 
when Bobby and I spied Pam, high in a tree on that "challenge course" -- a 
guided labyrinth of ropes, ladders and platforms designed to instill courage 
and self-confidence (in the off season open only to groups of six with advance 
reservations). We craned our necks as Pam shinnied from that first tree onto a 
quarter-inch-thick cable, and wobbled along it 40, then 50 feet off the ground. 
(Ashley was off trying to leap from a 25-foot pole to catch a swinging 
trapeze.) 
</P>
<P>
 Belayed by a total stranger, and encouraged by the shouts of her newfound 
comrades, Pam reached another tree and hoisted herself up a skittish rope 
ladder, then threw herself, upside down, onto a swaying wooden platform 
approximately six stories off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 What came next, she later said, was the scariest thing she's ever done. ("And 
the most fun, right? . . . Right?") 
</P>
<P>
 With Bobby and me watching, Pam clipped a carabiner attached to her climbing 
harness onto another cable -- a 400-foot "zip line" that cuts a harsh diagonal 
to the ground. For a long, long time, she stood staring into the treetops and 
shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she hurled herself off the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Children tend to take the super-hero status of mothers for granted. For Bobby, 
the sight of Mom sailing through the pine trees -- even with that endless, 
soul-chilling screech she let loose -- erased all doubts. Budget for Five

TRAVEL ADVISORY: MORE TAXI DRIVER ASSAULTS ON TOURISTS IN CHINA 
</P>

 Asia 
</P>
<P>
 China: Taxi drivers in the southern China city of Haikou frequently assault 
passengers to force more money out of them, and groups of drivers are involved 
in some cases, according to a Beijing newspaper report quoted by Reuters. 
Haikou, the capital of the island province of Hainan, has few buses, and many 
citizens are forced to use taxis, the paper said. Rone Tempest, The Times' 
Beijing correspondent, reports that crime against travelers is increasingly 
common throughout China. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippines: The revival of the death penalty last January for a range of 
offenses may have special meaning for five foreigners held in Philippine 
custody, according to the Reuters news service. An American arrested in the 
city of Angeles, north of Manila, is accused of carrying about two pounds of 
marijuana in his car, and a Briton is accused of transporting about 15 pounds 
of heroin. In a third case, three Australians have been charged with possession 
of 22 pounds of cannabis resin. 
</P>
<P>
 Conviction on any of these charges may carry the death penalty. There have 
been no executions so far under the revised law.  
</P>
<P>
 Briefly . . .

 Poland: After finding and detonating a large bomb in Krakow's tourist-popular 
Old Town, police launched a manhunt for a terrorist who has threatened to level 
the medieval city and demanded a ransom of more than $300,000, The Times' Dean 
E. Murphy reports from Warsaw. Police believe the bomber is a 50-year-old 
ex-convict and explosives expert. Hot spots: Citing demonstrations and 
violence, the State Department has added the southern African nation of Lesotho 
to its list of places where Americans are advised not to travel. Travel 
warnings are also in effect for Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Guatemala, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, 
Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Peru, Rwanda, Serbia, Somalia, Sudan and 
Tajikistan.

 Before his patients with asthma embark on any long-distance travel, Dr. 
Michael Kaplan has a suggestion: Check in with him about their itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the patient's travel plans, their health status and factors such as 
the climate and the season at the destination, Kaplan gives them a game plan. 
Sending off patients with written instructions is now commonly done by asthma 
specialists, says Kaplan, chief of allergy at Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The game plans are very specific, tailored to each patient. "If patients have 
had severe asthma that requires corticosteroid medications, we provide them 
with emergency medicine with specific instructions on when and how to take it," 
says Kaplan, who is also a UCLA associate clinical professor of pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who use a peak flow meter, an instrument to measure lung function, 
are advised to take it along on trips and, if the numbers fall below a certain 
point, to take specific medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 9 million to 12 million Americans have asthma, according to the 
Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, including at least 2.7 million 
children under age 18. It is the most common chronic childhood disease, 
according to the foundation. A lung disease, asthma is marked by shortness of 
breath, coughing, wheezing and tightness in the chest, reversible by 
medications. During an acute attack, the muscles around the bronchial tubes 
tighten. There is mucus production and swelling. 
</P>
<P>
 But for both children and adults with asthma, traveling has become somewhat 
easier in recent years due to a number of factors, Kaplan says. Newer 
medicines, including cromolyn sodium (Intal, Tilade) and corticosteroids such 
as beclomethasone (Vanceril, Beclovent) work to stabilize the asthma, 
decreasing the number of acute attacks. There has been increased patient 
education and physician education about the condition and the need to treat 
symptoms promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of a nebulizer, a medicine delivery system, can help stabilize asthma 
in young children and can be very helpful in managing acute attacks, Kaplan 
says. Whether powered by electricity or battery, the system works like a kind 
of electronic air compressor, making a mist out of liquid medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 While nebulizers have been widely available for the past 10 years, their use 
has become more widespread in the past five, Kaplan finds. (If taking a 
nebulizer overseas, Kaplan warns patients, be sure it will work on European 
current.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these advances, however, certain patients are not candidates for 
long-distance travel. Patients whose asthma is interfering with normal daily 
activities should postpone travel, he says. Those with significant asthma, even 
if it is under control, should not travel to remote areas, where medical care 
is not readily accessible, Kaplan added. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are cleared for travel should educate themselves before departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airplane travel is the hardest," Kaplan cautions his patients. "It's not so 
much the altitude as being in an enclosed space for a long period of time. It's 
often not well ventilated and the air is dry, which is not good for 
asthmatics."  
</P>
<P>
 Asthmatics who also have problems with allergies (about 50%-75% of children, 
fewer adults) should take into account allergens prevalent at the destination, 
says Sarah Kaluzny-Petroff, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Allergy & 
Immunology. To find out which allergens are active at specific locations, call 
the academy to order its pollen calendar (800-822-2762).  
</P>
<P>
 Among other ways that those with asthma can ensure a more healthful trip, 
suggested by Kaplan, the American Academy of Allergy & Immunology and the 
Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a nonsmoking hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring your own pillow if possible. Or bring a dustproof cover. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack extra medicines and inhalers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a list of the names (generic and brand) and doses of medicines taken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pack a portable air cleaner for smoky hotel rooms if no-smoking rooms aren't 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 * If traveling by auto, try to eliminate mold and mildew from the car's 
ventilating and air conditioning system before departure.  
</P>
<P>
 Travelers with other questions can call several toll-free telephone lines for 
information and referrals: the American Academy of Allergy & Immunology, (800) 
822-2762; the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, (800) 7-ASTHMA, and the 
Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America Los Angeles chapter, (800) 624-0044, 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.

DESTINATION: NEW ZEALAND; KIWI DECO; ON THE NORTH ISLAND, THE RESORT TOWN OF 
NAPIER IS A VIRTUAL MUSEUM OF ART DECO ARCHITECTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM ROMEO, Romeo is an Auckland-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a country with so many spectacular natural wonders, Napier is a man-made 
anomaly; it's the only New Zealand town that's ever tempted me to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread around a hilly bluff wedged into Hawke Bay, about a 5 1/2-hour drive 
southeast of Auckland, this warm and sunny city of 50,000 has been a popular 
New Zealand vacation spot for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lush vineyards, sheep stations and apple orchards stretch from the rugged 
Pacific coastline to the rolling foothills of the Ruahine and Kaweka mountains. 
Palm trees and Norfolk pines push cheerfully into sunny skies. Salty air drifts 
over a seaside promenade of formal, manicured gardens and fountains that earned 
the city the nickname "Nice of the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, Napier's biggest draws are the more than 100 American-influenced 
Art Deco and Spanish Mission buildings -- the styles in which nearly all of 
Napier's downtown structures were rebuilt after a 1931 earthquake ravaged the 
area. The quake killed 258 people and exposed more than 7,400 acres of land 
once covered by six feet of seawater. 
</P>
<P>
 I first visited Napier two years ago, more for the nearby wineries and coastal 
hiking than to view what one British architecture expert described as one of 
the most complete and significant groups of Art Deco buildings in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, architecture had never before lured me to a New Zealand 
destination. But two months ago, as I began the drive from my Auckland home, I 
was looking forward to rediscovering a unique city that reinvented itself at a 
time when the Great Depression had virtually shut down the rest of the building 
industry worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on a cold, rainy winter morning, downtown Napier seemed buoyant. Thanks 
to city grants and preservation efforts over the past 10 years, rows of newly 
painted, two-storied Art Deco facades cheerfully lined most downtown streets. 
Repairs and restorations seemed to occupy every block. Since my last visit, 
there were a few more Art Deco T-shirts and postcards available, a few more 
cobblestoned pedestrian malls where visitors can buy local arts and crafts such 
as pottery and hand-knit woolen sweaters, antiques and jars of jam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But this is far from Art Deco Miami -- no European fashion models posing for 
photographers, no roller-skaters or musclemen bopping to the latest salsa beat, 
no throngs of tourists chugging through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Napier is as stripped down as some of its Art Deco buildings -- 
simple, sunny and refreshingly solid. Below the stucco facades and suspended 
verandas, the commercial bustle of small-town New Zealand still reigns. 
Butchers lay slabs of beef and lamb chops in shop windows. Fish 'n' chip 
restaurants advertise fresh snapper and terakihi , a flaky white fish similar 
to grouper. In a local cafe, the talk focuses on the exploits of the national 
rugby team, the All-Blacks. Suited office workers and a few farmers in sweaters 
and gum boots choose among meat pies, buttered scones, Earl Grey tea and the 
worst cappuccino I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the town's popularity among New Zealand and overseas visitors pales in 
comparison with the country's biggest attractions -- Rotorua, Auckland and the 
Bay of Islands on the North Island, and Queenstown on the South Island. Napier 
draws about 60,000 overseas tourists a year, while each of the others attracts 
from 200,000 to 750,000. But tourism is establishing a greater foothold here, 
and the best barometer of that interest is the historic Desco Centre building 
on downtown's Tennyson Street. The former Napier Fire Station now houses the 
Art Deco Trust, which is both the local watchdog for preservation efforts and 
the Art Deco information center for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Deco Shop, in the same building, offers a short, informative and 
engrossing video on Art Deco elements and motifs, walking brochures, guided 
90-minute tours through about 15 blocks of the central business district and 
driving maps of Napier's Art Deco residences. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Feb. 3, 1931, when a massive earthquake and ensuing fire struck New 
Zealand's Hawke's Bay region, creating one of the country's worst natural 
disasters. To build a harmonious modern city from the ruins of a Victorian 
town, an association of local architects turned to America and the popular 
styles of the '30s for inspiration and discovered the perfect designs and 
technology for Napier's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating the new spirit of the 20th Century, Art Deco gave Napier a sense 
of hope and optimism. The reinforced concrete structures of these styles 
provided a cheap way to rebuild after the Great Depression. The simple and 
solid designs offered safety to a city where so many earthquake victims were 
killed by masonry falling from ornamental parapets and pediments. Decoration 
was retained as an essential element of Art Deco style, but as part of a 
building's structure or function, not an addition to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The guide for my Napier walking tour was Robert McGregor, the enthusiastic 
executive director of the Art Deco Trust. As we started our walk, the town's 
Art Deco charms came in snatches: a Mayan flower decoration; ziggurat and 
sunburst designs; leaded, stained-glass domes; a law office's elaborate floral 
motifs and interior doors and staircase; and the harmonious blend of Spanish 
Mission, stripped Classical and Art Nouveau styles. 
</P>
<P>
 But later, we stopped to marvel at several buildings. One of my favorites was 
the Municipal Theatre on Tennyson Street. The exterior of the 1938 building 
features two squat Egyptian pillars and three sets of double 
glass-and-stained-wood doors. Inside is a celebration of the Streamline Moderne 
style, which I recognized from the movies of the 1930s and 1940s: chrome speed 
lines, nautical light fittings, neon and tubular lamps and a curved 
walnut-veneered ticket box. The theater, which is now being upgraded, is 
scheduled to reopen for performances next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A few streets away is the vibrant, cream-and-terra-cotta Spanish Mission-style 
Criterion Hotel (now a bare-bones, backpackers accommodation). This is one of 
several Spanish Mission buildings in Napier and nearby Hastings. The similarity 
of climate between Napier and Southern California had prompted construction of 
both Spanish Mission and California Bungalow buildings in the area even before 
the earthquake. Inspired by news and photographs of Santa Barbara's successful 
post-earthquake rebuilding, some proposed embracing the same style of 
architecture -- but the idea was killed in favor of less expensive Art Deco 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Napier's ASB Bank, refurbished since my last visit here, offers the best 
integration of Maori art and European design I've seen anywhere in New Zealand. 
The lintel over the main entrance points out the similarity between the Art 
Deco zigzag and a kowhaiwhai pattern, a Maori fern frond design. As I stepped 
into the busy bank to escape the rain, I looked up at a ceiling of coffered 
skylights flanked by a Maori mask design and another red, black and white 
kowhaiwhai pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across from the ASB Bank, a promenade leads down to a rocky beach, past 
neat, well-tended gardens and several public structures -- a band shell and 
colonnade among them -- that also reflect the town's Art Deco theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Napier's best known and most photographed structure is the bold, rich-blue 
Rothmans Building, an irresistible masterpiece of simple form and luxurious 
decoration located a five-minute drive north of the city center, among a 
cluster of old warehouses and empty lots in the Ahuriri district. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1934 by the city's most famous architect, Louis Hay, the former 
National Tobacco Co. building's centerpiece is its arched entrance. The 
entryway is lavishly decorated with sculpted concrete roses and bulrush, 
sunbursts, polished wood, mosaic tiles and brass banisters. Inside, the 
building is no less extravagant with its polished marble, domed skylights and 
leaded stained-glass lights. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a driving-tour map, I spent part of the next two days 
cruising through neighborhoods of Art Deco homes and visiting the town's Park 
Island cemetery to see the Art Deco memorial at the mass grave for earthquake 
victims. Then I drove 12 miles south to the smaller (and considerably less 
charming) town of Hastings, which was also severely damaged in the earthquake 
and rebuilt with more of a Spanish Mission influence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all my time in Napier was spent admiring Egyptian-inspired pillars and 
plum-hued parapets. I stayed at Anleigh Heights, a bed-and-breakfast home with 
sweeping views of Napier and its coastline. At the recommendation of my hosts, 
Allan and Anne Tolley, I visited several wineries in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand's 
second-largest wine-growing area. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 20 wineries flung between the Pacific and the western river valleys, 
the most popular is Mission Vineyards, which was established in 1851 and is the 
country's oldest winery. But the ones I liked best were Sacred Hill, a 
converted chicken shed overlooking the Dartmoor River; Ngatarawa Wines, a 
refurbished 19th-Century stable in Hastings; and Te Mata Estate, the bold and 
stylish contemporary home to a pioneer of international-standard red winemaking 
in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad weather and high tides kept me from hiking five miles along the coast to 
view a colony of 15,000 gannets at nearby Cape Kidnappers. The site is the 
world's only known mainland nesting area for the birds, and the walk was one 
I'd wanted to make for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I started my return home to Auckland, my thoughts were on Art Deco 
Napier. The sun had broken through morning clouds, highlighting the clean, 
vibrant colors of the city's stucco facades. Even in its early morning 
emptiness, the city seemed alive, enticing and refreshingly unpretentious -- 
virtues that made me glad I'd returned. GUIDEBOOK

DESTINATION: AUSTRALIA; SYDNEY'S HIP SPOT; TO TAKE THE PULSE OF THE CONTINENT'S 
LARGEST CITY, HEAD TO THE TRENDY NEIGHBORHOOD OF PADDINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Any great city, no matter how large or imposing, is at heart a collection of 
neighborhoods. Discover the character of a single block, and the tenor of the 
entire city slowly begins to unfold -- or so my wife and I kept telling 
ourselves as we pulled into Sydney's main bus terminal, in the middle of a 
deluge, without hotel reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 We were on an extended shoestring honeymoon of uncertain duration, and our 
plan was simple: Attack the city like true adventurers, unencumbered by plans 
or commitments. Make a mad pass through Sydney and in the process discover the 
neighborhood we felt most typified the city. There we would make our home, 
ground zero in our quest to understand Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the damp bus terminal, we soon realized our plan was as wet as we 
were. We didn't have the energy to hail a taxi, much less explore a city of 17 
million people. So we did what countless would-be explorers before us have 
done: We turned to the guidebooks and relied upon the legwork of others. 
</P>
<P>
 The books described Darling Point, "home to badly parked Porsches and the 
Cruising Yacht Club" (too upscale to qualify as adventure, we decided); Kings 
Cross, "young junkies and prostitutes a la Times Square" (too depressing); 
Watsons Bay, "featuring Sydney's favorite suicide leap" (too risky, considering 
our tight budget); Glebe, "crammed with students" (too rowdy and too familiar); 
and the Rocks, "a Mecca for tourists" (no thank you). 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Paddington, or "Paddo" as the abbreviation-mad Aussies like 
to call it. It was billed as a "second Greenwich Village," "an artist's haven," 
"a yuppie haven" and "an antiquer's paradise." Culture with attitude and style. 
We'd found our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 With its huddled mass of Victorian houses, narrow streets sloping toward the 
harbor and innumerable private gardens, Paddington possessed an intimate charm. 
Just 2.5 miles south of the city center and Sydney's signature Opera House, and 
only three miles west of Bondi Beach with its topless bathers and its 
bottomless glasses of beer, Paddington was also blessed with the cosmopolitan 
advantage of "location." 
</P>
<P>
 We spurned Paddington's few hotels for a more homey (and cost-effective) house 
share. The chance to actually call one of these terraced, filigreed Victorian 
relics home struck us as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and a perusal of the 
Sydney Morning Herald classifieds helped us find a short-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Our landlord-housemate for the next two months turned out to be worth the trip 
to Australia. She was an impish seamstress whose medium she announced with a 
proud flourish was "lace, lace and lace again." So enamored was she with the 
fabric that when we asked her name, she insisted we simply call her "Miss 
Fairy" after the "heavenly material" by which she plied her trade.  
</P>
<P>
 We settled in quickly and, like many Paddington residents absorbed in a warm 
December summer, practically lived on our balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 These uniform grilled terraces located one story above street level serve as a 
permanent warm-weather domain for lounging, dining and drinking (in our case, 
bottles of very good and very inexpensive Australian Shiraz). And because the 
tiny lanes and back roads of Paddington are so narrow, the balconies flanking 
the street all but brush up against each other -- creating the sense of 
community one finds in such close-knit neighborhoods as New Orleans' French 
Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distinct architectural assets of Paddington, it was the people we 
noticed first. They were stunning, in that fashion-magazine, music-video sort 
of way. We figured the large number of hair salons and trendy clothing stores 
scattered about Paddington like modern temples of chic had something to do with 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Paddington wasn't always so revered by those wanting to see and be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons that still mystify die-hard urbanites, thousands of city dwellers 
decided shortly after World War II that life in the suburban hinterlands was 
the ticket to existential splendor. Thus, Paddington, like other neighborhoods 
in Sydney, was abandoned and basically left to rot like some plague-ridden city 
out of a Camus novel. (Literary references are not lost on the dwellers of 
Paddington. At last count there were six bookshops in a quarter-mile radius.)  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the 1960s that some discerning visionary (who also understood 
the value of cheap real estate) took a look at the 100-year-old crumbling 
Victorian structures with their classic features and choice locale and realized 
that restoration would bring money and people back to the city quicker than one 
could say, "I'm sick of commuting from the suburbs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Paddington (much like the Rocks) is a reclamation success story. Though 
there was no master plan to its renewal, the stellar results are a reflection 
of the original architects' attention to landscape and elegant use of iron and 
glass. Thus, while Sydney is the capital of New South Wales, Paddington is now 
for many the unofficial capital of Sydney. And like any proper capital, it has 
a respectable thoroughfare coursing through its center: Oxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Originating at the southern end of Hyde Park, Oxford Street changes character 
every half mile or so as it meanders through the neighborhood of Darlinghurst 
on its way to Bondi Junction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paddington, its disposition is decidedly commercial, though on a personal 
scale. Large chain stores and shopping malls are kept out like a wolf at the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops such as the Coo-ee Aboriginal Art Gallery offer indigenous ceramics, 
sand paintings, fine art and for that special someone: traditional tools and 
weapons. Galleries such as Strokes specialize in the work of native Australians 
-- it was here I bought what I've come to call the "one-throw" boomerang. I 
threw it once and never saw it again. And at Folkways, the offbeat music store, 
Bach and Buddhist chants share the shelves with my favorite, 19th-Century 
Australian convict songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any trendy neighborhood, Paddington is a breeding ground for trendy 
restaurants. Through trial and error, we quickly separated the winners from the 
wanna-bes. Our favorite downscale dive was the Thai Silver Spoon. This BYOB hot 
spot has a clientele as spicy as its menu, including a New Year's Eve drunk 
whose high-pitched Philippic against "gay lifestyle" brought about the only 
mutiny in a restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderately priced Darcy's is milder in every sense of the word and 
provided us with our first taste of true Aussie cuisine: We were suckers for 
the carpetbagger steak (stuffed with oysters) and Moreton Bay bugs 
(crustaceans, actually). 
</P>
<P>
 Deep-pocket diners can be found at Oasis Seros. The food is international; the 
setting defiant minimalism (we know because we peeked through the window on our 
way to the cheap Thai place). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the crumpet-and-conversation crowd, cafes and coffee shops are underfoot 
at every turn. My favorite was the New Edition Cafe with attached bookshop. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here that I found myself drafted into a rather heated round-table 
debate about the status of the Australian novel. Five minutes after joining the 
group, I was asked to excuse myself when the one Australian author I could 
name, Keri Hulme (author of "The Bone People"), turned out to be from New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 While downtown Sydney and the Rocks have organized "walking tours," in 
Paddington, one is left to discover the goodies on one's own. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the residents' general disdain for anything too organized or 
"official," this seems rather fitting -- particularly in the evening, when the 
shops and the galleries give way to the pubs and the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's at night that Paddington reveals its alter ego. 
</P>
<P>
 While the beautiful people are busying themselves in the cafes discussing the 
latest films (or viewing them at the Australian Film Institute Cinema located 
in Paddington's revamped Town Hall), the rest of us folk are out sampling a 
little of the national beverage: beer. In Paddington, as in the rest of 
Australia, it's served cold and often -- a fact that no doubt accounted for the 
50 drunken Elvises we saw one evening gyrating down Oxford Street in the 
direction of the London Tavern. Though this landmark pub and restaurant -- 
built in 1875 -- is a source of great pride in Paddington, it's not nearly 
gaudy enough to pass itself off as a Down-Under Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose the only thing worse than waking up to a Saturday morning hangover 
in an Elvis costume is to sleep through the Paddington Village Bazaar (in an 
Elvis costume). This giant market held every Saturday at the Uniting Church in 
east Paddington is famous citywide for its diverse selection of crafts, folk 
art, jewelry, clothing and kitsch. However, judging by the outbursts of 
applause and the general cries of enthusiasm, the real appeal seems to be for 
the frenetic street performers who converge on the market like minstrels at a 
Bard convention. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here that we watched "Zim," a "theme" juggler, threaten to juggle his 
infant twins. Fortunately, good sense and wet diapers got the best of that act. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big draw is the Victoria Barracks, a former army barracks and school 
of artillery and cavalry troops. This immense sandstone building, built in 1840 
by Canadian convicts, possesses a beautiful two-story veranda and is considered 
by many Sydney-siders to be the finest example of Georgian architecture in the 
city. The weekly changing of the guard, alas, was recently discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Centennial Park -- perfect for those Paddington dwellers who 
occasionally find that being hip and beautiful is just too much hard work. 
Sydney's largest park, Centennial borders Paddington to the south and is just 
big enough and just unglamorous enough to offer a soothing anonymity. Here, one 
can do very untrendy things such as fly a kite or go bird-watching. And while 
bikes and horses are available for hire, the distance they will take you from a 
boutique or gallery could be upsetting to some. 
</P>
<P>
 It took us an entire month of exploring the cultural and fashionable recesses 
of Paddington before we actually pulled ourselves away from the stylish 
goings-on and ventured into the park to assess what we had learned. It turns 
out that by moving into a neighborhood and doing as the natives do, we had, 
indeed, come to understand Sydney better. But after four weeks of living on the 
pulse, we also knew that it was time to move on.

BOOKS TO GO: PILGRIMS' PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OFF THE ROAD; A MODERN-DAY WALK DOWN THE PILGRIM'S ROUTE INTO SPAIN by Jack 
Hitt (Simon & Schuster, $22 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 Since the 9th Century, pilgrims -- Catholic and otherwise -- have trod a 
series of roads and pathways extending from various points in France (Paris, 
Vezelay, Le Puy and Arles are the traditional four) to the supposed tomb of St. 
James the apostle in the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela in the Spanish 
region of Galicia. In medieval times, thousands upon thousands of people made 
the trek each year, returning home with scallop shells pinned to their garments 
as proof that they'd reached the Galician coast. (The French call scallops 
"coquilles St. Jacques" or St. James' shells.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today, though their numbers are far fewer, pilgrims still make the trip; so do 
writers looking for a story. Irish novelist Colm Toibin did it for the Times' 
"Traveling in Style" magazine last year. And Harper's contributing editor Jack 
Hitt has done it, to wonderful effect, for this book. Many of his adventures 
are predictable (there's as much slogging along busy highways in the rain as 
strolling over mountain trails; colorful travelers of many nations are 
encountered along the road), but some are not. In any case, Hitt writes well, 
sometimes with a flair of macabre humor that seems particularly appropriate to 
his medieval-based subject matter. "Farther down the road," he notes at one 
point, "a grassy path seems up to no good. Upon approach, a pleasant looking 
tree has a rotting dog, wearing death's sinister smile, wedged into the crotch 
of two limbs . . . . The locals grow white asparagus . . . . In the bars they 
are delicious, but fields of them resemble rows of freshly filled mass graves."

 THE BEST OF HAWAII; THE BEST OF THE UNRECOGNIZED AND RECOGNIZED HAWAII, 
revised and updated edition, by Jocelyn K. Fujii (Crown, $16 paper); DRIVING & 
DISCOVERING OAHU by Richard Sullivan (Montgomery Ewing Publishers, $16.95 
paper); MAUI MADE AFFORDABLE by Jody van Aalst and Tom Spaulding (The 
Information Machine, $16.95 paper) and THE ULTIMATE KAUAI BOOK by Andrew 
Doughty & Harriett Friedman (Wizard Publications, $10.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii -- what a concept. Beaches, palm trees, rum drinks, pupu (hors 
d'oeuvres) platters, leis and, of course, several million beachfront mega 
resorts . . . . Well, yes. But also lunar landscapes, cattle ranches, 
historical and art museums, whale-watching, sophisticated cooking, B&Bs. 
There's certainly nothing wrong with the laid-back, do-nothing aspects of 
Hawaii, but there's plenty more to the islands than just lounging on the sand 
with a mai tai in hand. Jocelyn Fujii, a Hawaii-born travel and dining writer, 
does an admirable job of describing and assessing and (where necessary) 
demystifying the islands in this new edition of her thick Hawaii guidebook. She 
is particularly good on food and shopping.  
</P>
<P>
 "Driving and Discovering Oahu" is part road atlas, part picture book, part 
photographer's guide. (The book contains 258 color photos, each keyed to an 
accompanying map; it also contains occasional plugs for Eastman Kodak, which 
partially sponsored the work.) I'd be surprised if there is a hidden byway or a 
corner of beach or town that Sullivan has not discovered and revealed here -- 
even on the leeward shore of the island, which remains relatively unknown to 
visitors.  
</P>
<P>
 The title of "Maui Made Affordable" is a bit misleading. This isn't a bargain 
guide to the island at all. Rather, it's a shorthand-style guide to hotels, 
condominium rentals, golf courses, beaches and the like -- affordable and 
otherwise -- in chart form, with a great deal of very specific information.  
</P>
<P>
 Authors Andrew Doughty and Harriett Friedman cover Kauai thoroughly, with 
notes on hotels, restaurants, beaches, shopping, sacred Hawaiian sites and more 
-- accompanied by color photographs and rather overenthusiastic graphics.

HIKING: SIERRA NEVADA: BARHOPPING AT FOLSOM LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all California's large reservoir parks, Folsom Lake is closest to a 
metropolitan area. Situated in the Sierra Nevada foothills, just 25 miles from 
Sacramento, the lake attracts 4 million visitors a year and is popular with 
campers, water-skiers, boaters, swimmers and anglers. 
</P>
<P>
 The more isolated hiking is along the North Fork and the South Fork of the 
American River. One fine stretch of Western States Trail is between Rattlesnake 
Bar and Horseshoe Bar. The bars refer to wide turns in the river where miners 
often found gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 80 in Auburn, head south on 
Auburn-Folsom Road (which runs between its two namesake communities on the west 
side of the lake). Turn east on Rattlesnake Bar Road and follow to end at 
parking area for horse trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Before entering the woods, the path meanders in a meadowland and 
offers a curious sight: palm trees. On a humid day, imagine you're on a 
tropical isle. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail ascends into a woodland and crosses a wooden bridge over a creek 
flowing into the lake. Notice the tangles of wild grape hanging from the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 1 1/2 miles, the main trail (wider than a couple of confusing 
side paths along the way) rises and falls a few times, passing close to some 
fence lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail reaches a somewhat level area by the water. Western States Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Folsom Lake State Recreation Area near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: From Rattlesnake Bar to Horseshow Bar is 3 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Wooded, brushy lake shores. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Bird-watching, wooded section of lake. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy to moderate. 
</P>

<P>
 MOROCCO ( International Video Network, 53 minutes, 1993 ). 
</P>
<P>
 The distance between Europe and Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar is just 8 
1/2 miles. This proximity has created one of the most colorful and exotic areas 
in the world -- Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Woven into this tapestry are the cultures of the early Berbers, the Arabians 
who brought the Islamic religion and language, and the Portuguese, Spanish and 
French influences of more recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 The video begins with tours of some of its major cities: the busy port of 
Casablanca, the capital of Rabat, cosmopolitan Tangier and the Atlantic beach 
resort of Agadir. In each there are visits to ruins, mosques, minarets, old 
souks (market places), medinas (old towns) and Casbahs (fortresses). Tapes are 
available from International Video Network, 2246 Camino Ramon, San Ramon, 
Calif. 94583; telephone (800) 669-4486. Price: $29.95 (plus tax and postage). 
</P>
<P>
 WILDERNESS SURVIVAL (Wilderness Skills, 30 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 According to National Park Service personnel, there has been a significant 
increase in the number of vacation travelers who prefer the unstructured 
wilderness experience over the predictable, artificial resort stay. As a 
result, the number of search-and-rescue efforts has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The film demonstrates ways to find or create shelter from the heat or cold; 
how to improvise signals to contact rescuers; how to find water, which is a 
more immediate necessity than food, and how to start a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions: Carry a map, carry a cigarette lighter or waterproof matches, 
dress for the climate, stay on trails and let someone know where you plan to go 
and when you plan to return. 
</P>
<P>
 It is available from Wilderness Skills, P.O. Box 18105-9998, Reno, Nev. 89511; 
tel. (800) 909-9696. Price: $19.95 (plus tax and postage). 
</P>
<P>
 LAND OF ENCHANTMENT ( Santa Fe Video Collection, 45 minutes, 1993 ).  
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico's special qualities are its timeless beauty -- vast deserts, 
shimmering aspens, snowy mountain peaks -- and the mystique of the American 
Indian cultures woven in. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Peter Strauss discusses history and lore. Viewers visit Chaco Canyon and 
the Anasazi pueblos and ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Available from Ellis Productions, P.O. Box 2532, Toluca Lake, Calif. 91610;

PASSION FOR POSTCARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed "Collecting Postcards From the Heart" by Eileen Ogintz (Aug. 21) 
because I have been a collector for about 40 years.I buy photo albums for 
4-by-6-inch photos, remove the paper inserts and slide in the postcards, 
enabling both sides to be visible. Some cards depict worldwide travels and have 
fascinating stamps. The album is one of my treasures.

HAPPY IN HUATULCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Next Cancun?" by Christopher Reynolds (Aug. 28): 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, we flew to Huatulco, checked into the beautiful Sheraton 
resort and informed the concierge that we wanted to be married at their hotel. 
"Sorry senor, too much paperwork, not enough time," was the response, but we 
persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 With the enthusiastic help of the ladies at the Sheraton, the local judge (who 
spoke no English) and a sweet San Diego couple we met at the swim-up bar, we 
were treated to a beautiful wedding on the beach in front of the Sheraton! 
</P>
<P>
 We found the service great, the food what we hoped for, an enjoyable (and 
empty) golf course -- all in all a fabulous place for a marriage. We found none 
of the problems with our room that Mr. Reynolds mentioned; rather, every night 
the maids left flower petals across the bed, spelling felicidades . I have 
stayed at many Sheratons, but the service, people, and care we received in 
Huatulco was easily the best they could offer.

LUGGAGE LAMENT

<P>
 James Yenckel's "Packing: Is Your Luggage a Mess?" (Aug. 28) quotes Judith 
Gilford, author of "The Packing Book," who "advocates carrying everything 
aboard the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, folks! Ignore the airlines' so-called rules limiting carry-on 
baggage.Stuff your soon-to-defrost frozen fish above my head -- there's room 
because I checked my baggage. The ever-helpful flight attendant will search for 
an overhead spot to jam in your overstuffed two-ton duffel bag. 
</P>
<P>
 When are the airlines and irresponsible travel advisers going to regulate this 
unconscionable practice? Excessive turbulence and stalling (gulp!) can and do 
result in over-heads popping open. I prefer to be clobbered on the head with my 
folded soft jacket, not someone's wet fish or lethal heavy luggage.

THEATER NOTES; PASADENA CIVIC WANTS ROAD SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you think of the big Los Angeles County venues for touring Broadway 
shows, you think of the Shubert, the Pantages, the Ahmanson. But with the 
coming season, the people who run Pasadena Civic Auditorium want you to add 
their name to that list. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Civic has dropped the Kansas City-based Theater League -- the 
presenter of its musicals series last season -- and hired a new one, 
Baltimore-based Baci Management, with the goal of bringing in only national 
tours that have not previously played Los Angeles. The Theater League is now 
booking the new Thousand Oaks Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Civic Manager Rick Barr said he wants Broadway tours, not locally 
produced shows, while the Theater League wanted to produce two of its four 
shows as it did last season. Locally produced shows are priced lower and 
therefore have a lower gross potential, Barr said: "They didn't draw the crowds 
the Civic deserves. We're well-positioned to be one of the first-class touring 
houses" -- with the potential of $1-million-grossing weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Barr said, the locally produced shows just weren't as good as the 
Broadway tours. He especially recalled TV star Kevin Dobson's performance as 
the Baron in "The Sound of Music" last winter -- "when he was croaking 
'Edelweiss,' I was dying," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater League's Mark Edelman acknowledged a few "casting and physical 
production shortcomings" last season but said that he was trying to keep ticket 
prices "at a reasonable yet successful level." Raise prices, he said, and "at 
some point greed sets in. A $1-million gross is irrelevant. What should be 
important is how many people come and use this public building." Edelman said 
that all of his Pasadena shows ended up in the black (thanks to the fact that 
the two he produced also played in Phoenix). The two tours he imported set 
house records. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the competition from existing venues and the scarcity of product, 
Edelman said it wouldn't be easy to field an entire season of Broadway tours in 
Pasadena. He noted that only one title has been announced by Baci -- a "Jelly's 
Last Jam" booked months ago. But Barr said more announcements are expected 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 DAY OF THE WOMAN?: In case you didn't notice, female playwrights reached their 
zenith of visibility in Los Angeles last Sunday. On that day, the plays at L.A. 
County's three most prominent non-musical theaters -- the Mark Taper Forum, the 
Doolittle Theatre and Pasadena Playhouse -- were all written by women. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't last long. Mary Hanes' "The Crimson Thread" was opening at the 
Pasadena Playhouse just as Wendy Wasserstein's "The Sisters Rosensweig" was 
closing at the Doolittle. Meanwhile, Lisa Loomer's "The Waiting Room" continued 
on at the Mark Taper Forum, where it closes today. However brief, it was a 
landmark, considering that in most previous years it has been fairly unusual 
for any one of those theaters to present a play by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "FASHION," THE CD: Coming soon to a store near you: "Fashion," a cast 
recording of the musical that was so badly received last summer at the Alex 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely you remember "Fashion." In its wake, the over-extended Theatre Corp. of 
America, which produced it, retreated from the Alex, leaving the Glendale 
theater's board groping for two new shows for their subscribers. The city of 
Glendale, which helped finance "Fashion" after the Theatre Corp. pleaded 
poverty, later sued the Theatre Corp. At press time, the Alex board still 
hadn't found shows to substitute for the canceled Theatre Corp. programming. (A 
"Dreamgirls" booking was canceled when its producer couldn't get the rights.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, on the day after "Fashion" closed, the cast recorded the Don 
Pippin/Steve Brown score for Original Cast Records, Bruce Yeko's one-man 
Connecticut label that specializes in obscure shows. Yeko said he expects the 
initial 1,000 copies of the "Fashion" CD to be in selected Tower, Sam Goody and 
Camelot stores by November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will buy any cast album," Yeko said. That it was a notorious flop 
might even make it more of a collector's item. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeko saw "Fashion" in its initial New York production 20 years ago, but one 
week before he recorded it, he still had no idea that he was about to do so, he 
said. Then, on the Wednesday before the show closed, he received a call from 
composer Pippin pointing out how inexpensively it could be produced at the 
Hollywood musicians' union hall. On the final Sunday of the three-week run, 
Yeko saw both performances, and on Monday he recorded it. It cost about 
$10,000; Yeko said he financed it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were problems in the show," Yeko acknowledged, "but I knew there were 
some good songs. My aim is to preserve music I think is worth preserving." 
Besides the "Fashion" tunes, the recording will also feature four songs from 
two other Pippin shows. Furthermore, it led to another cast recording for Yeko. 
Frank Ferrante, who was in the "Fashion" cast, met Yeko and cemented a deal to 
record his "Groucho: A Life in Revue" (Pasadena Playhouse, 1989) at the same 
studio next week. 
</P>
<P>
 One wag suggested that the "Fashion" CD might make a great gag gift for Alex 
subscribers and board members. There were some 10,000 subscribers. So if the 
idea spreads, Yeko may have the last laugh.*

 Like novelists and football teams, operatic composers have good and bad 
seasons. Sometimes the commissions arrive and are fulfilled, only to be 
followed by fallow periods. From this vantage point in hopeful autumn, the 
1994-95 concert year looks promising, operatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently at San Francisco Opera, we had the much-heralded premiere of Conrad 
Susa's "The Dangerous Liaisons." Now, two more brand-new works for the lyric 
stage are set to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 In February and March, L.A. Music Center Opera will present, in nine 
performances at six venues, the premiere of Lee Holdridge's "Journey to 
Cordoba." The new opera, with libretto by Richard Sparks, will be staged by the 
award-winning film and stage director Jose Luis Valenzuela, with scenic designs 
by L.A. artist Gronk. 
</P>
<P>
 Holdridge, 50, for three decades a successful film and television composer, 
has written a number of concert works, including concertos, symphonic suites, 
chamber music and one previous opera. Sparks' writing credits include film, 
stage and television, including contributions to "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 "Journey to Cordoba" will be performed by four professional singers and a 
chorus of students from L.A. County High School for the Arts. The premiere is 
at the new Luckman Fine Arts Complex at Cal State L.A. Feb. 11, with 
performances at the University of Redlands Feb. 12, the Norris Theatre on Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Feb. 19, the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts Feb. 
26, Wadsworth Theater March 4 and Santa Barbara's Lobero Theatre March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center at Cal State 
Long Beach continues its inaugural season with the premiere of Martin Herman's 
opera based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter." Herman is an 
associate professor at CSLB. The librettist of "The Scarlet Letter," to be 
introduced Oct. 27-30, is Tom Curley. Stage direction will be by Philip 
Littell, librettist of Susa's recent "Dangerous Liaisons" in San Francisco. 
Brent McMunn will conduct.

IT'S HIP TO BE GRUNGY IN OCEAN BEACH, WHERE HIPPIEDOM REIGNS; SAN DIEGO: UNLIKE 
SUCH BEACH COMMUNITIES AS SANTA MONICA OR BELMONT SHORES, O.B. NEVER WENT 
YUPPIE. ONE RESIDENT SAYS IT'S NOT A PLACE, BUT AN ATTITUDE.

 Sitting in a circle with four friends on the sand at Ocean Beach, Mark 
Ragowski sips from a beer can wrapped in a brown paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 At his back, surfers bob on the rolling waves. A homeless man spouts 
unintelligible phrases from a dirty cement ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Ragowski sees it, this is the best of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more people to hang with here," he says, bleached-blond hair peeking 
out from a backwards baseball cap, wraparound shades shielding his eyes from 
the strong summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city better known for its political conservatism and military 
institutions, Ocean Beach is a pocket of nonconformity hanging out at the end 
of Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Beach -- O.B. to locals -- is where the twin cultures of music and 
surfing intersect. Where grungy skateboarders and laid-back Rastafarians 
converge on beat-up Schwinn bicycles. Where hippiedom still reigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie-dye is big here. So is the Grateful Dead. But don't chalk it up to the 
'70s revivalism sweeping the nation. Those things never left O.B. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.B. is not a place; it's an attitude," said San Diego police officer John 
Madigan, who still lives in this neighborhood, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 For the underemployed slackers and never-employed dropouts here, skateboards 
and bicycles are the prime modes of transportation. "You don't need a car to 
get around," said Monty Nolder, 26, who cooks at Hodad's hamburger joint. 
</P>
<P>
 And where else could you lie on the sidewalk in front of your house in your 
swimming trunks on a Tuesday morning, conducting business on a cellular phone, 
and still look normal? 
</P>
<P>
 Yvon Bordeaux, an actor-model-boat washer-construction worker-painter in his 
20s, does just that most days outside his tiny blue bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a quiet, peaceful community," said Bordeaux, the cellular phone and a 
pager resting next to his suntan lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Southern California beach communities such as Santa Monica or Belmont 
Shores in Long Beach, O.B. never went yuppie. It stayed scruffy. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearest Starbucks is miles away. Million-dollar mansions don't exist. 
Instead, tiny restaurants, bars and discount stores cluster along palm 
tree-lined Newport Avenue, next to The Black, a '60s-style tobacco shop that 
opened in 1970 and still sells a mind-numbing array of pipes, psychedelic 
posters and lava lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 O.B's history began modestly in the mid-1880s when developers laid out a few 
streets. Those days it was a two-hour drive to downtown San Diego, said local 
historian Ruth Held, whose family settled in Ocean Beach in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1909, streetcars came in and people could live in Ocean Beach conveniently 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many matchbox-sized parcels still remain in the flatlands closest to 
the beach. Worn-out cottages and bungalows provide cheap rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has theories about why the beach shacks still stand and the rents 
remain low: Its rundown reputation scares people; the noise from jets flying 
into Lindbergh Field keeps away prospective buyers; the lots are too small for 
sprawling houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.B. was always chopped up into little, tiny parcels owned by everybody," 
said Welton Jones, an architectural writer for the San Diego Union-Tribune. "It 
was hard to solidify." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s the neighborhood was a minor hub for counterculture types and drug 
dealing. And just like the love beads and old beach houses, O.B. has not shaken 
the druggy image. It's no secret the neighborhood is a hot spot for 
methamphetamine dealing, and gangs are creeping in. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeless encampment by the railroad tracks adds to the general aura of 
seediness. But crime is no worse here than anyplace else in town, Madigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as surfboard shaper Albert Elliott is concerned, you can search the 
world for paradise. But what's the point when you already live in Ocean Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott figures he has the perfect setup. From his vantage point at Rocky's 
Surf Shop, towering palm trees sway against a clear blue sky. He rides his 
tandem bicycle to work each morning, his 5-year-old daughter strapped in the 
back seat. He ducks out of his corner workshop anytime he wants to catch a 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a bunch of 'hey dude' dumbbells," Elliott said. "You've gotta be 
smart to live at the beach and not have a job."

LEARN AIMS TO INVOLVE PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Congratulations to teacher Adrienne Mack for her personal decision to vote 
for LEARN (Valley Commentary, Sept. 18). She correctly cited LEARN's objective 
as being that "individual schools be given the opportunity to develop their own 
educational programs, according to the needs of the community and the students 
they serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Mack's article, however, missed LEARN's emphasis on the importance of 
actively supporting the participation of interested parents in the education of 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Education Secretary William Riley recently announced his national 
initiative in family involvement. The Washington Post has editorially commended 
Riley for his new parent-involvement initiative, saying parents can best shape 
their children's ability to benefit from formal schooling. The independent, 
nonprofit Parent Knowledge Network, whose policy research and demonstration 
programs are cited by Riley, found significant improvement in student 
achievement where informed parents work with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN was an early pioneer in advocating parent involvement and fully supports 
the national education goal embodied in federal law: that by 2000 every school 
promote programs that increase the participation of parents in the social, 
emotional and academic growth of their children. LEARN's programs include 
materials to inform parents about what their children should be learning at 
each grade level and guidelines on how parents can help. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Mack also made reference to LEARN as possibly another "paper tiger" whose 
"faddish project" will soon pass. This will come as a surprise to those 
community volunteers who have invested many thousands of hours developing 
grass-roots plans and action steps that empower parents and teachers to 
participate directly in the reform of their schools. We hope teachers will work 
just as diligently in their volunteer and paid efforts on behalf of all 
children in the Los Angeles city schools.

BATTLE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS; STATE'S ELECTED OFFICIALS MUST PREPARE FOR NEW 
DEBATE ON BASE CLOSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent Times' story, "Air Battle Won Behind Closed Doors," carried an 
important dual meaning. Sure, reporter Jack Cheevers' account of the Benefield 
Anechoic Facility at Edwards Air Force Base was about a place where U.S. 
military aircraft can be tested for effectiveness without ever leaving the 
ground. But it also set the stage for a different battle, behind closed doors 
at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 We have already covered the fact that Edwards not only fared well in the most 
recent round of military base closings, but has expanded. The $200-million 
upgrade for the Benefield Anechoic Facility, a "sterile" electronic test 
environment that is the largest of its kind in the world, is another case in 
point. But it is also true that a new debate on base closings is scheduled for 
next year, and that the commission in charge of these discussions is expected 
to take a hard look at such test installations as Edwards AFB.  
</P>
<P>
 Few other bases around the nation are so specialized that direct competitors 
are immediately known. Edwards has the advantage of being that specialized, a 
point that should not be lost on the elected officials in Sacramento and 
Washington who are most concerned about its future. Its competitor figures to 
be the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pax River has been the site of electromagnetic pulse tests designed to 
simulate the effects of a nuclear blast. Like Edwards, it has a test pilot 
school. Among its most distinguished (and influential) alumni is former 
astronaut and U.S. Sen. John H. Glenn Jr. (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate 
Military Readiness and Defense Infrastructure committee. He'll be in office 
through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Pentagon-hired consultant suggested consolidating the military's 
electronic warfare testing at the Benefield facility at Edwards, and not at Pax 
River, its Maryland boosters forced a new study that came out against the 
consolidation. That's the kind of tug of war that will only escalate in 1995 
and beyond, and that elected officials in our region, and in California as a 
whole, must be prepared for.

A STIRRING PORTRAIT OF A GALLANT FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing to commend you for publishing Jon D. Markman's extraordinarily 
moving account of his memories of his father's death and life ("Yom Kippur 
Evokes Mournful Memory of a Courageous Father," Sept. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost too painful to read, yet the love behind the words was 
powerfully conveyed.What a terrible loss for the Markman family. What an 
immense comfort to them to have a son like Jon, to evoke so stirringly the good 
and gallant human being that his father was. 
</P>
<P>
 I lost my own father the day before my 17th birthday, and he has been gone now 
more than half my life. I never knew or understood him well. He was an aloof 
and troubled presence in the house I grew up in, yet I know my life was forever 
diminished by his loss, because I was denied the chance of ever reaching out to 
try to help him, to maybe vanquish the demons that tormented him. And, as I try 
to measure what small strides I have made in this world, I will never have the 
chance to see that glint of pride in my father's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fervently, urgently, I admonish my friends whose fathers are still living to 
appreciate them now, because a memory, however revered or exalted, to the human 
heart will not suffice. As Mr. Markman so eloquently wrote, "For even in pain, 
even at his worst, we felt he was better off alive with us than dead."

BURBANK AIRPORT STORY WAS NOT BALANCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There is hardly a fact wrong in your Sept. 6 story "Size at Heart of Airport 
Debate" on Burbank Airport. Yet the story lacks balance -- and worse yet 
fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, you noted opponents' criticism of former Airport Authority 
President Bob Garcin as "aloof" and R. C. (Chappy) Czapiewski's perception of a 
"damn the people" attitude. Yet there is no response from Garcin in the 
article, nor is there any mention that there was any attempt to reach him for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another glaring omission is your failure to identify groups or individuals 
favoring a new and larger terminal. Our group has identified itself as a strong 
supporter at most public gatherings, and we have been in fairly frequent 
communication with Times reporters assigned to airport news. 
</P>
<P>
 Another critical point not mentioned: the sharp reduction in land area 
affected by high levels of noise from 1970 to 1990. Land receiving 70 decibels 
and more of noise was cut from more than 400 acres to less than 25. 
</P>
<P>
 One minor factual point: You mentioned the acquisition of the airport in 1978 
"with taxpayers money." More accurately, the purchase was with revenue bonds 
issued by the airport authority and FAA funds specifically collected from 
airline passengers and used nationwide for airport improvements. I would have 
expected you to mention that until 1978, the airport paid local property taxes 
and received not one dime from the fund, even though its passengers had been 
paying into that fund for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the airport debate is not truly over such a simple matter as a new 
and larger terminal, as some of your sources appear to have told you. The real 
debate is over how and whether to accommodate the economic growth (translation: 
jobs) for the airport's service area which will benefit everyone over the 
decades to come.

RIORDAN RISKING LIVES BY NOT REPAIRING FIREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan should resign! 
</P>
<P>
 It has been more than eight months since the earthquake, yet Fire Station No. 
70 (Reseda and Lassen) still hasn't been repaired, leaving Northridge 
residents' lives and property in constant peril. However, supermarkets and 
freeways were open days after the quake! The Santa Monica Freeway opened ahead 
of schedule, and even the Coliseum is in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 My sources told me that Riordan knows that faulty construction, triggered by 
the quake, caused the fire station to be shut down -- this facility was built 
under the Bradley Administration -- but that investigation was completed months 
ago. It is unconscionable that the city, due to the mayor's lack of leadership, 
has not made every effort to reopen the station long before now. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has Riordan accomplished since he was last sighted in Northridge at 
the photo op with President Clinton after the quake? 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan allegedly provided more police officers in the budget by "mirrors" -- 
coercing the Department of Water and Power to pay for them. Are those funds in 
the city's treasury yet? No. Independent departments shouldn't have to fund the 
city's bloated budget, except to reimburse it for direct services. Also, our 
"great negotiator" botched the salary negotiations with DWP employees and the 
police, causing a strike and a "blue flu" -- thereby endangering our citizens, 
instead of allowing the city's professional negotiating staff to do its job. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Riordan has surrounded himself with an "elitist" staff that 
doesn't have the first clue how to administer one of the world's largest and 
important cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Los Angeles should know that the only purpose for a charter 
municipality to exist is to provide safety -- police and fire services. Any 
other services are secondary! Therefore, due to his lack of leadership 
concerning Los Angeles' -- and especially Northridge's -- requirement that 
public safety be the No. 1 priority, Mayor Riordan should resign immediately. 
Councilman Hal Bernson, who should know better, shouldn't even consider running 
for reelection, for the same reason.

LAWMAKERS MUST SHIELD STATE'S DEFENSE JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times is a welcome advocate for retaining California's military flight 
testing capability at Edwards Air Force Base. The real story is the continuing 
problem of California's legislative delegation NOT acting as a voting block to 
create new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to election-year rhetoric, California remains vulnerable to the 
integrated and united lobbying efforts of other states and special interest 
groups that are robbing California leaders and business of urgently needed 
assistance. Political and ideological egos must take a back seat to stop our 
manufacturing hemorrhage. If we want to save Edwards, we need to save military 
programs; if we want to convert defense manufacturing jobs to commercial 
applications, we have to save military programs long enough to convert; if we 
are committed to a market-driven, world-class manufacturing environment, we 
need creative job-creating legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for our legislators and media organizations to take off 
their white gloves and fight to save this critical economic force. The issue at 
Edwards Air Force Base just reinforces the fact that service jobs depend on 
manufacturing jobs. Forget putting their heads together, circle the damn wagons 
and protect our defense and manufacturing jobs.

WHO CARES WHAT RACE STUDENT ROLE MODEL IS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have just read the article concerning protests at CSUN by Black Student 
Union members concerning the hiring of a white teacher to teach remedial 
reading and writing skills in the Pan-African studies department. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Small believes that a white woman, Katherine Komis, should not be 
teaching reading and writing to black students -- only a black instructor 
should be doing so. Small feels these students need a "role model" while 
developing college reading and writing skills. (Why? Are they all growing up to 
be reading and writing instructors?) 
</P>
<P>
 I used to teach such classes in CSUN's English department (or perhaps we 
should call it the Euro-American studies department). Since in the name of 
empowerment blacks and Chicanos have been largely segregated at CSUN into 
Pan-African studies and Chicano studies writing programs that duplicate the 
English department's writing program, I had almost no students of color. 
</P>
<P>
 I now teach at Antelope Valley Community College, where all writing classes 
are the responsibility of the language arts department. My classes are now 
filled with a racial and cultural mix. This is how I thought our society was 
supposed to be. Silly me. I now realize I am probably damaging my black and 
Hispanic students because, as a white woman, I don't provide a role model for 
them. I mean they will probably be permanently damaged from having to learn 
about organization, detail and grammar from me, since I am not of their 
culture. In fact, who knows what psychic wounds I'm inflicting on my male 
students, regardless of color? The black male student who asked me to write a 
letter of recommendation for him clearly needs his consciousness raised. Wait, 
it's worse than I'm letting on: We have a Women in Literature class that is 
often taught by a white male colleague. Someone had better get outside his 
classroom with a bullhorn: He's a miserable role model for young women. How can 
they ever succeed if they learn about women's writing from a man? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody should tell Mr. Small to put his bullhorn away (it sure sounds like a 
male intimidating a female to me) and turn his attention to solving some of our 
society's real problems -- like the increasing racial and ethnic segregation 
that attitudes such as his are feeding, and the consequent hostility and 
misunderstanding it is creating among all races.

By ANTHONY C. BEILENSON, The Times has invited the two leading candidates in 
the hotly contested race for Congress in the 24th District, which includes the 
southwest San Fernando Valley, to write on several issues before the election. 
Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a congressman since 1977. 
Republican Rich Sybert was state director of planning and research from 1991 to 
1993. For this article they were asked: Do we have a national crisis in health 
care that must be addressed by Congress? What are the elements of an ideal, 
affordable system?

<P>
 This year's debate over health care reform has demonstrated how enormously 
complex and difficult it will be to slow the growth of our dangerously high 
health care costs and to ensure that all Americans have access to the health 
care they need. But despite the impasse we have reached for the time being, the 
very fact that a full national debate over this very serious issue has begun in 
earnest -- and it will continue -- means that health care reform has at last 
received the priority it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on health care has been rising at an unsustainable rate. As recently 
as 1965, we spent 6% of our gross domestic product on health care. We now spend 
14%, and, if current trends continue, that figure will rise to 18% or 19% by 
the year 2000 -- only six years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us feel these higher costs in the prices charged for insurance 
policies, in out-of-pocket deductibles and co-payments, in lower wages that 
result from companies' paying more for health benefits, and in federal, state 
and local taxes to support government-sponsored health insurance and health 
care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of Medicare and Medicaid (Medi-Cal), in particular, are growing at 
an alarming rate. Since 1980, federal spending for Medicare and Medicaid has 
grown by 113% -- after adjusting for inflation. In 13 years, these two programs 
have risen from 16% of the federal government's domestic budget to 22% this 
year and, unless changes are made, will rise to an astounding 35% five years 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
 These increasing costs are the major obstacle to eliminating federal budget 
deficits, and to reordering federal spending priorities so that more funds are 
available for other critical national needs. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason our health care costs are rising so rapidly is that the proportion 
of Americans over age 65 -- those with the greatest need for health care -- is 
growing each year. Another is that more treatments have been made possible by 
medical and technological advances. A third is extremely high administrative 
costs, accounting for fully one-quarter of all U.S. health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, we have too many hospital beds, a surplus of specialists and a 
shortage of primary-care physicians, a high rate of unnecessary procedures, 
high medical malpractice insurance costs, dependence on high-cost emergency 
room care by those who lack insurance and very high prices for many 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans have employer-provided health insurance. Almost everyone over 
65 is covered by Medicare, and about half the poor are covered by Medicaid. But 
nearly 40 million Americans -- 85% of whom are workers or their dependents -- 
have no health insurance at all. They rarely see a physician, waiting until a 
problem becomes acute. Then they resort to emergency room services, the most 
expensive care. Since the uninsured often are unable to pay their medical 
bills, hospitals and doctors shift the cost to patients with insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more worrisome, millions of additional Americans lose their insurance as 
they lose or change their jobs. And increasing numbers of workers avoid 
changing jobs, because of fear of losing valued health benefits. Even those who 
remain in their current jobs have no guarantee of continued coverage, and 
people who work for small businesses are especially at risk of losing their 
insurance. If only one employee of a small business becomes seriously ill, 
insurance companies usually raise rates to unaffordable levels or refuse to 
renew coverage. Even small businesses with low-risk employees often pay 30% to 
40% more than large companies, which negotiate discounts for insurance, for 
identical coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, about two-thirds of workers without health insurance are 
employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees. Many of those firms would like 
to provide insurance for their employees but simply cannot afford to. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do have insurance, benefit packages vary widely, and many are 
seriously underinsured. The most serious gap in coverage for those who are 
insured is for illnesses or disabilities that require long-term care, which is 
a special concern of older Americans since Medicare does not cover nursing or 
home care, and little private insurance is available. 
</P>
<P>
 We must act before these problems get worse, but we must move carefully. All 
the alternatives to the present health care system raise serious questions. But 
costs are rising faster than our ability to meet them; large numbers of 
Americans are experiencing personal crises because they cannot pay for the 
health care they need. And our capacity to compete in the global economy is 
seriously threatened by health care costs that are far higher than those of 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I am disappointed that we were not able to make more progress in 
solving these problems this year, I believe it would have been a mistake to 
have tried to develop and rush through Congress a major restructuring of our 
health care system in the waning days of this session. Congressional leaders 
have made the right decision to focus on passing, if anything, a bill which 
will serve as a modest first step in addressing the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this year's groundwork, Congress will return to the issue next year 
with a far better understanding than we had a year ago of how we might extend 
coverage and control costs, and how we can accomplish those goals without 
disrupting the health care of those who are satisfied with the benefits they 
currently receive. We will be able to respond more effectively to the needs and 
desires of Americans as individuals, as well as serve the best interests of our 
nation as a whole.

HOW CONGRESS SHOULD OPERATE ON HEALTH CARE SYSTEM; WE SHOULD ONLY FIX WHAT IS 
WRONG WITH HEALTH CARE, NOT RESTRUCTURE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AS THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS ATTEMPTING TO DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By RICH SYBERT, The Times has invited the two leading candidates in the hotly 
contested race for Congress in the 24th District, which includes the southwest 
San Fernando Valley, to write on several issues before the election. Incumbent 
Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a congressman since 1977. Republican Rich 
Sybert was state director of planning and research from 1991 to 1993. For this 
article they were asked: Do we have a national crisis in health care that must 
be addressed by Congress? What are the elements of an ideal, affordable system?

<TEXT>
<P>
 We should fix what's wrong with health care and leave the rest alone. 
President Clinton deserves credit for raising the need to examine problems in 
health care. However, we do not need and should not want a government-imposed, 
government-run system. Instead, we need to focus on the specific problem areas 
of most concern to most people:  
</P>
<P>
 * Catastrophic coverage -- Most Americans are rightly afraid that a sudden 
illness or injury will bankrupt them or cost them their home. To avoid this, we 
should standardize catastrophic coverages in private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Portability of benefits -- People should not have to fear losing their 
coverage if they lose their job. We should expand the present labor laws to 
provide for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deductibility of health care premiums -- Small business and individuals 
should have the same right as large corporations to deduct health care premiums 
from taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pre-existing conditions -- There should be some restrictions on insurance 
companies' ability to exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage. However, 
we should not subsidize unhealthy health habits or throw suburban residents in 
with the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Legal reform -- Conspicuously absent from the Administration's proposals is 
any suggestion of reform of the legal system. Coincidentally, trial lawyers 
were the single largest donors to Bill Clinton's campaign -- and to Anthony 
Beilenson's. As state planning director, I personally wrote comprehensive 
proposals for legal reform, and I will do the same in the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hippocratic Oath states, "First, do no harm." Unfortunately, much of what 
has been proposed would only make our health care system worse. It is an 
unwarranted leap of logic to suggest that these specific problems or others 
justify wholesale restructuring of a system with which 80% of Americans say 
they are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense it is hardly surprising that medical costs are increasing. As a 
society grows richer, people want to live longer and healthier lives. So they 
spend more on health care. We should maintain this patient choice and provider 
freedom and strengthen the doctor-patient relationship instead of inserting 
bureaucrats 3,000 miles away into personal decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Government-run (or government-imposed) health care will do what every other 
government social program has done: waste money, support bureaucrats, soak the 
middle class to subsidize the poor and reduce the level of choice and quality 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I challenge the notion that there should necessarily be a "national 
health care system" beyond the specialized systems we have already set up for 
the needy (Medicaid, Medi-Cal) and retired (Medicare). We live in a free 
society and a private-sector economy, and most decisions are and should be made 
by individuals, not the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the employer mandate proposed by the Administration is simply a 
disguised tax increase. It will come in the form of higher prices for goods and 
services, and lost jobs (especially entry-level jobs, the kind we most need to 
pull people out of poverty). 
</P>
<P>
 Third, proposals for a government-run health care system will inevitably hurt 
seniors, who have the greatest need. All government systems ration care, not by 
price but in two other ways: first, by making people wait for many procedures; 
and, second, by making other procedures not available at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, the Administration's price-control proposals will not work. You cannot 
repeal the laws of supply and demand by setting up a federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, everything proposed in the current Washington debate has been tried, 
implemented and found wanting somewhere else. Unfortunately, the health care 
debate has degenerated into a partisan political battle where the original aim 
of sound policy has been lost. Partisan Democrats are simply looking for a 
political victory for the President, regardless of whether it's a good result. 
Partisan Republicans are simply looking for a defeat. Both sides are misusing 
policy arguments for political goals. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, only about 3% of the U.S. population (not "37 million people"), 
most of whom are young or temporarily between jobs, are the hard-core medically 
uninsured. These are the people we need to reach, and we are already doing so 
through programs like Medi-Cal and Medicaid and emergency rooms of hospitals. 
These systems may be improved, but that is how the debate ought to be framed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is now trying to hide the fact by sending out taxpayer-paid 
campaign mail that he favors a "go-slow" approach, my opponent Mr. Beilenson is 
one of the co-sponsors of HR 1200, the legislation that would impose a 
full-blown, government-run "single payer" system like that in Canada. He says 
it works. Evidently he hasn't spoken to many Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 His sponsorship of what is essentially socialized medicine will punish the 
middle-class people of this district, just like his support for tax hikes and 
slashes in defense jobs, and his refusal to get tough on crime or pay more than 
lip service to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of "health care reform" the Administration wants appears to be dead, 
at least for this year. That's a good thing. Members of Congress ought to read 
1,400-page bills before voting on them. The even more radical "single payer" 
system proposed by Mr. Beilenson is also dead. Next year, I will be a voice in 
the Congress for sensible, cautious, incremental change that addresses real 
problems and otherwise leaves people alone.

WOULD-BE STAR OF STUDIO TOUR TELLS IT LIKE IT IS; UNIVERSAL CITY TV WRITER WAS 
DISILLUSIONED WHEN HE FOUND THAT VISITORS DON'T REALLY LEARN WHAT IT'S LIKE 
BEHIND THE SCENES. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS HE'D LIKE THEM TO KNOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL POMERANTZ, Earl Pomerantz is a television writer in Universal City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although I've worked at Universal Studios since 1987 devising ideas for 
comedies such as "Major Dad," I've never taken the Universal tour. Recently, a 
writer's curiosity, combined with an overpowering desire to avoid working, 
impelled me to seek answers to suddenly burning questions: What did they tell 
them on the tour? What backstage secrets did they reveal? Did they mention my 
name? 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving on, let's address the unusual situation of working at a place 
that has a tour running through it. I imagine many professionals might balk at 
such a distracting arrangement. Surgeons, for example, would be unlikely to 
permit a tour to come rolling through their operating theaters, led by a bubbly 
young guide chirping: "We're in luck today -- it's a transplant." 
</P>
<P>
 I actually enjoy working in a Tour Zone. And I take my involvement very 
seriously. When I'm on the back lot and a tram goes by, I realize I'm not just 
a writer anymore: I'm part of the tour. That's why I never venture out of my 
office without a pen, a yellow legal pad, and a distracted look on my face that 
says, "I'm thinking." (True story: One time I actually was thinking and walked 
right into the side of a tram. A guy taped it.) 
</P>
<P>
 I sensed the folks on the tour envied me; at least I hoped they did. But the 
only way to be certain was to take the tour myself, and sit in the Envy Seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get this out of the way first: the tour guide never mentioned my name 
once. And even if she had, it wouldn't have mattered, since except for my 
secretary who accompanied me, almost no one on my tram spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what's labeled the Universal tour is basically a first-rate Special 
Effects display, offering simulated reproductions of natural disasters: 
avalanche, earthquake, shark attack and a near-death experience, courtesy of a 
giant gorilla. It was all very impressive, especially the earthquake, which had 
me rattling around my seat going, "I remember this." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as witnessing actual movie making, at one point we were told they were 
filming a scene from "Murder, She Wrote" up ahead, and that Angela Lansbury 
herself was involved. Suddenly, dozens of video cameras swung into action, 
covering a cluster of far-away actors, though from where we were, you'd need 
the Mount Palomar telescope to see which, if any of them, was Angela Lansbury. 
</P>
<P>
 My fellow tramsters seemed really to enjoy themselves, but to me the tour was 
something of a disappointment. Though highly entertaining and immensely 
successful, the tour has nothing to do with the day-to-day workings of show 
business as I know it. I mean, isn't that what people want, to go behind the 
scenes and find out what it's really like? 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, I imagined what a real studio tour might include: 
</P>
<P>
 "SLEEPING BEAUTIES" -- A visit to the Writers' Building, creative hub of the 
studio, where you can actually observe blocked writers taking idea-inspiring 
naps. 
</P>
<P>
 "HIGH PRIORITIES" -- Overhear an ambitious, young, serious co-star telling the 
show's overworked producer: "It's not that I want more lines; it's just that 
for my character to be fully realized, he has to have more to say." Then follow 
the beleaguered producer as he handles an impassioned demand by the star of the 
show for a bigger Winnebago. 
</P>
<P>
 "TOUGH CHOICES" -- Sit in as high-level executives, hearing a production is 
running millions of dollars over budget, react decisively by drafting a memo 
requiring everyone on the lot to pay for their own bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Imagine going back home and astounding 
your friends with little-known insider facts, like "show business success is 
measured less by accomplishments than the length of the walk from your office 
to your car." Tell the truth -- isn't that more exciting than being sprayed 
with water by a mechanical fish?

ANALYSIS; CONGRESS MAY HOLD KEY TO IMPASSE

 More and more, owners are talking about using replacement players next spring 
if there's no agreement with striking major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one that's willing to play ball next year if that's what we have to do," 
Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said this week during the congressional 
hearing on baseball's antitrust exemption. "I don't want that, but I have 
responsibilities to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said the issue hasn't been addressed, but said 
Friday he will appoint a committee to think about how owners will proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other owners and officials already are talking about it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement players were used by baseball owners to break strikes early this 
century and by the NFL owners in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a difficult thing to do, but at last resort I think you'd have to 
consider it," Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't call it major league baseball, but you'd call it professional 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners believe current major leaguers will come back if they see replacements 
take their spots during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 And they believe that if they open the season with replacements, a large 
percentage of fans still will attend games and watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kansas City's going to have professional baseball next year if I have 
anything to do with it," Royals CEO David Glass said, adding that he thought 
general manager Herk Robinson would be able to recruit a team. "I know Mr. 
Robinson will take the best 25 players available to him from whatever source." 
</P>
<P>
 If owners do open camps with replacements, they face two tests: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will minor leaguers not on 40-man rosters break ranks and play? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will fans pay major league ticket prices to watch them? 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris said the Rockies wouldn't lower ticket prices, which will be as much 
as $26 when Coors Field opens next April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll field the best possible team we can and will give people fair value," 
McMorris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Major League Baseball Players Assn. said it is confident its members 
wouldn't return if owners open camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absent an agreement, they will not be playing major league baseball games on 
opening day," said Eugene Orza, the union's No. 2 official. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking major leaguers said there's no chance replacements could break the 
strike. They don't think replacements would attract many fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might go, but I don't think so," Carlos Baerga of the Cleveland Indians 
said Friday, "Their heroes will not be playing. They will be watching A-ball 
guys, double-A guys and triple-A guys." 
</P>
<P>
 All that could change, however, if Congress intervenes. The strike would end 
if the antitrust amendments proposed by Rep. Mike Snyar, D-Okla., and Sen. 
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, become law. There's little chance of that happening 
before Congress adjourns next month, but the lawmakers say there's plenty of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks, the Texas Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, 
made that clear at the end of Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would remind the parties that while the 103rd Congress may adjourn in the 
next several weeks, the 104th Congress is scheduled to return in January -- 
well before the 1995 spring training begins and well before the scheduled 
season opening on April 2," he said. "Don't think for a moment that Congress 
will forget the sorry spectacle we have witnessed in the summer of 1994."

FAULK GIVES COLTS LONG-RUNNING HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ATTNER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Got to start somewhere. With a philosophy, a player, a play -- something to 
build on and win with after so many years of frustration and ineptness. That is 
what Marshall Faulk and "off-tackle isolation" are all about. They are the 
foundation of a running game designed to bring dignity and respect to an 
Indianapolis Colts organization that has rarely had either since Robert Irsay 
plunked the team in America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 In those 10 tumultuous seasons since they pulled out of Baltimore, the Colts 
have measured success in thimble-full amounts. An American Football Conference 
Eastern Division title in 1987, a few winning seasons sprinkled among 
embarrassing debacles. John Elway wouldn't play for them; Eric Dickerson was 
brought in from Los Angeles as a ready-made hero, only to sour on the team and 
the city; hometown boy Jeff George could have owned the place but fought so 
many imagined demons that he gladly accepted a trade this past offseason to the 
Atlanta Falcons. First-round picks can't stay healthy. Fans once giddy over the 
Colts' arrival now stay away in large numbers from the RCA Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is Faulk and "off-tackle isolation." A simple play, this off-tackle 
jaunt. It probably shows up in one form or another in every National Football 
League playbook, save maybe for those run-and-shoot guys. But for the Colts, it 
could become the start of something big. In Faulk's hands, it could be a 
franchise savior. It is the basis of a philosophy espoused by Bill Tobin, the 
newly instituted director of football operations. In his mind, stability will 
come in the form of a solid, dependable running game; a solid, dependable rush 
defense; and solid, dependable special teams. The days when the Colts tried 
flash and dash to romp among the big boys are over. But for Tobin's way to work 
any better than the old methods, Faulk, the rookie rushing phenom with a resume 
that elicits comparisons to names such as Smith, Sanders, Thomas and even 
Payton, has to flourish. And that brings us to "off-tackle isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 Every successful running team needs one or two calls that become its signature 
plays. Plays that, under the most adverse circumstances, are likely to produce 
needed yardage. "We knew we were in trouble last year," center Kirk Lowdermilk 
says, "when we had to throw the ball on second-and-2." But this season, on 
second-and-2, the Colts most likely will call on off-tackle isolation, with 
Faulk doing the carrying honors. "We are still finding out what he does best, 
and that play may be the one," Coach Ted Marchibroda says. "You have to say it 
has worked well so far." The 13th time Faulk ran it in the regular-season 
opener against Houston he gained 56 yards. The next time another 11 and a 
touchdown. On 28 carries over three games, the play has accounted for 144 
yards. Faulk gained more than 100 yards in each of the first two contests, 
tying a Colts record, including 143 against the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 For a franchise convinced that luck hasn't been a friend for years, the 
addition of Faulk could be a godsend. If nothing else, the timing seems 
perfect. Tobin was hired in January by Irsay, who in effect removed his son, 
affable General Manager Jim Irsay, from direct influence over the club's 
personnel matters. And, in his typically classless way, the elder Irsay 
contacted Tobin without first informing Jim. Tobin last was in Chicago, where 
he learned under Jim Finks and then helped construct the Bears' mid-1980s 
powerhouse. Like Finks, Tobin believes fervently in the pluses generated by 
running the ball. But at Chicago, it was easy to talk that way with Payton in 
the lineup. In Indianapolis, Tobin inherited a club that had been last in the 
NFL in rushing the past three seasons; with Faulk, the Colts led in rushing 
after two weeks behind virtually the same line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good time to be bad, if there is such a thing," says Tobin about 
1993. The Colts, who finished 4-12, had the second pick in the draft. Although 
two prized quarterbacks, Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer, were available and 
George had used up his welcome, Tobin felt blessed that Faulk had decided to 
leave San Diego State after his junior season. Here was the running back who 
could do for the Colts what Payton did for Tobin's Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk used his three college years to accumulate more rushing yardage in that 
span than any player in NCAA history. At 5-foot-10 and 205 pounds, Faulk is 
another in a line of current elite NFL backs, all cut from the same chunky, 
bowling-ball mold. What separates him from most of his peers, however, is rare, 
raw speed. That is where he most resembles Barry Sanders. Most pro rushers 
can't run away from defensive backs; Faulk, given even a minor chance to burst 
into the secondary, can pull away from any opponent. Plus, few backs can get 
from point A to point B any faster. At his best, he is a blur.

 "Faulk is a great player already. An elite player," Washington Redskins 
General Manager Charley Casserly says. "Is he better than Sanders or Thomas or 
Smith? You can't say he isn't, but he is going to have to prove it. But he has 
that kind of ability." 
</P>
<P>
 "We lacked a big play guy on offense," says Marchibroda, who was given little 
choice but to rework his attack once Tobin arrived. "A guy who can become a 
pressure-point player who forces the defense to focus on him and stop him 
before they do anything else. Marshall is that kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a league that suddenly is overflowing with superior running backs, this guy 
is the best to come along since Emmitt Smith left Florida for the Dallas 
Cowboys. Most teams like to build around quarterbacks. But there are few elite 
players being produced anymore at that spot, so it makes sense to jump on a 
bandwagon drawn by the talents of a Faulk. At least the Colts can't do much 
worse than they already have trying this route. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to tell you I thought I could walk into this league and do this 
well right away," Faulk says. "You don't have strong doubts, but you always 
wonder, watching these guys on TV. They look so big and strong. Can you keep 
up?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins built Super Bowl successes around "counter trey." Dallas is 
committed to using Smith on "lead draw." Maybe "off-tackle isolation" will 
become Faulk's trademark. The play starts simply enough. Faulk lines up behind 
and to the right of fullback Roosevelt Potts. When the ball is snapped, they 
both run away from the tight-end side of the offense, to the weak side. Faulk 
takes a handoff from Jim Harbaugh and follows the lead of Potts, whose 
assignment is to isolate and block the outside linebacker. At the same time, 
the guard and tackle on that side are sealing off their opponents. It takes 
Faulk only a couple of strides to reach the line. That's when the guess work 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in training camp this past summer, Gene Huey, the Colts' running backs 
coach, had to yell at his students for spending too much time watching Faulk in 
practice. "I told them he wasn't any different than they are," Huey says 
laughing, "except he was earning more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Saviors come with big price tags these days. It cost the Colts $17.18 million 
spread over seven years to sign Faulk, including a $5.1 million bonus. Not bad 
for a kid from the projects of New Orleans who could have just as easily 
settled for a street life instead of a college education. He is 21 but acts, 
thinks and speaks like someone years older. "It's because I have older 
brothers," he says about his maturity, "and growing up in my situation, you 
have to grow up quick or die young. The environment I grew up in still helps me 
make critical decisions in my life, not only who to hang with but to know what 
is right or wrong, what I want to do, where I want to go, what road I want to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Irsay told Faulk and his representatives that if the young star went about 
things intelligently, he could own Indianapolis. "The fans are looking for 
something to latch onto," he says. "They are optimistic, but at the same time, 
they have a wait-and-see attitude." But what fan could resist Bambi? 
</P>
<P>
 If it takes the time to learn about Faulk, the town will like him. He can be a 
bit high-strung, and he unfortunately shows signs of becoming something less 
than a media darling. But his work habits so far have been impeccable. And his 
idea of a great time seems to be retreating to his home 15 minutes from the 
Colts' practice facility as quickly as possible to sleep or watch television, 
particularly televised football. If that's not possible, he will settle for 
tapes of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go home and kick back," he says. "That's what I feel like doing most 
times. You have the offseason to have a life. But in order to be successful, 
you have to dedicate yourself and your time during the season and before the 
season to being ready. You can't slack off. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I guess you could call me a football junky. I'll look at anything, Arena, 
World League, anything. I love it. I am a student of the game. I try to see 
what is new, what a team is trying to do to stop an offense. I pick up new 
things. I never get tired of it. I'd play for nothing; I did for years." 
</P>
<P>
 He is establishing foundations in New Orleans and Indianapolis to help abused 
children. It's his way of giving something back to the community. "You can't 
forget where you come from," he says seriously. Teammates say Faulk has a nice 
sense of humor, but he's also remarkably sober for someone so young and so 
very, very rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was smart," tackle Will Wolford says. "He came in here very quiet and 
didn't make any waves. He did it right. He knew everyone was looking at him, 
but he didn't have an inflated ego. We know he has confidence in his ability, 
but he's not arrogant. He's a pretty good little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Colts block "off-tackle isolation" correctly, Faulk claims he can find 
not one or two holes but -- count 'em -- three avenues of exploration. He 
starts by looking at what the guard's block has accomplished but he is also 
locating other possibilities. Then it's up to him to pick and choose. His 
coaches have been smart about handling him. They don't want to inhibit his 
instincts by limiting his options on runs or blur his vision, which Lowdermilk 
calls phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using that run-to-daylight approach," Marchibroda says. "You want to 
give him freedom, don't make him think, just let him go." For Faulk, the three 
choices on this play -- or any other that may become his trademark -- are 
critical to his long-term success in the NFL. "There is a 1-yard hole, a 5-yard 
hole and a 15-yard hole," he says. "The average back chooses the 1-yarder, the 
good back the 5-yarder and the great ones pick the 15. Then if you break one 
tackle in the secondary, that's when you have the long runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers gave Faulk and his teammates a stark lesson on 
how to control young phenoms and personnel-shy opponents. After staking the 
Colts to a 14-0 lead, Pittsburgh methodically carved out a 31-21 win in Three 
Rivers Stadium that included a 500-179 total-yardage advantage and 19 more 
minutes of possession. While Barry Foster overwhelmed an injury-riddled defense 
by rushing for 179 yards, Faulk could only wait on the sideline in frustration. 
His afternoon was limited to 15 carries for 61 yards and one catch for 11 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchibroda, still pinpointing the most appropriate ways to exploit this 
talent, wasted one first-half series splitting out Faulk three consecutive 
times but never throwing to him. Bad choice. The Steelers' defense accepted 
congratulations for keeping him under 100 yards for the first time in his brief 
pro career, but their offense deserved more credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the best in the NFL," Steelers Coach Bill Cowher says. "He kind 
of runs inside a bit like Emmitt, but he probably has better speed once he sees 
the crease. He has another gear. He can also get to the outside effectively. 
You aren't going to control him like this every day."

ANGELS IN THE END ZONE, AND DEVILS IN THE DIRT; PRO FOOTBALL: WIND, TURF AND 
GHOSTS MAKE IT EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS FOR THE VISITING TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We're talking special effects here. We're talking science fiction, 
fantasyland, haze and fog and Jimmy Hoffa buried under artificial turf. We're 
talking the ghost of Hoffa, the ultimate team(ster) player, phantasming up from 
the Jersey swamp, opening the door to the wind tunnel and blowing Brad 
Daluiso's 54-yard field goal through the uprights with 32 seconds left last 
Thanksgiving weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking Giants 19, Cardinals 17. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking angels in the end zone and devils in the dirt. We're talking 
optical illusions in Candlestick and shifting shadows in Chicago. We're talking 
heat strokes in Detroit and turf seams in Philadelphia. We're talking 
claustrophobia in Cleveland. We're talking wet spots in Dallas. We're talking 
airsick bags in Denver and warm, fuzzy colors in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking homefield advantages. Not the kind you get from sellouts; not 
the kind you get from noise. Not the kind you get from snow and cold; teams can 
prepare for those. We're talking about those other special little home-stadium 
effects that can give a team a break if the team is smart and knows what to do 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meadowlands has Hoffa, or so the story goes. Hot Teamster rumor, not, of 
course, confirmed: Hoffa is buried under Giants Stadium. They never found his 
body anywhere else, right? Hot NFL rumor: A Giants-friendly gate opens at one 
end of the stadium and creates wind at will to help or harm a field-goal 
attempt. If it isn't the ghost of Hoffa, it must be a Giants employee. 
Suspected, but not, of course, confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been an issue in a game I've been in up there, but I watched the 
one on Thanksgiving weekend last year," says Washington Coach Norv Turner, who 
was with Dallas at the time. "The guy kicked a 54-yard field goal, so I'm aware 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah. Word gets around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always hear about that," Redskins lineman Raleigh McKenzie says. "They 
can close it and they can open it up, depending on the wind and who's kicking. 
But I don't know. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking one of the legends of the game: The Giants operate a wind tunnel 
at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't verify it, but I've heard it," says Jim Lachey, McKenzie's Washington 
teammate and thus a once-a-year visitor to Giants Stadium. "I don't know if 
they've ever actually done it or not, but I've heard about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind in New Jersey. Wind in Buffalo. Wind in Chicago. Wind so hard in Chicago 
that the Giants' Sean Landeta whiffed a punt -- whiffed it altogether -- during 
a playoff game in '85. Bears punter Maury Buford didn't miss; Landeta did. Must 
have been the homefield advantage. When you play at home, you don't need a 
weatherman to know which way the wind blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody kicks off out of the end zone in Chicago," Bears kicker Kevin Butler 
says. "You try to get it done the best you can when winter sets in in Chicago. 
. . . If they want to make it harder on us (kickers), do away with domes. Let 
those guys come in here to Soldier Field." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind in San Francisco. Wind in Washington. You play there long enough, you 
learn the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a wind at RFK that people don't really know about," Redskins kicker 
Chip Lohmiller says. "It's up higher than the field at the one end where 
there's a Bud sign. You have to play it when you're kicking down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind in Foxboro. Wind so tricky in Foxboro that even the home team sometimes 
can't figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most difficult places to kick in the league," says Matt 
Bahr, whose NFL career started in the relative calm of Pittsburgh's Three 
Rivers Stadium but spiraled down from there into the wind hells of San 
Francisco, Cleveland and the Meadowlands before a brief stint at Philadelphia 
and finally New England. "You learn that you can't prepare for what direction 
it blows because it changes so often. You can't anticipate anything, but you've 
always got to expect to see bad weather because that's what you usually get." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind in Cleveland off Lake Erie. Wind and a short end zone in Cleveland that 
slopes right up into the Dawg Pound, that friendly little section of stands 
where the fans wear mutt masks and throw dog biscuits into the other team's 
post patterns. Once, late in a game at Cleveland Stadium, as Denver was driving 
toward a touchdown in the direction of the Dawg Pound, the hail of debris from 
the end-zone stands was so heavy that game officials stopped the clock and 
moved the action to the other end of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 That was supposed to even things up for the Broncos, except Denver's Sammy 
Winder fumbled and the Browns kicked the winning field goal -- with the wind at 
their backs, wind they would have been facing if the teams hadn't switched 
directions in mid-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind in Cleveland, the Dawg Pound in Cleveland, the visitors' locker room in 
Cleveland. When you visit Cleveland Stadium, you put on your shoulder pads in 
space approximating the back seat of a Volkswagen. It's a big, wide body of a 
stadium, but all its elbow room is built into the Browns' clubhouse, across the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to light a fire to that place. Burn it to the dadgum ground," 
Eagles defensive end William Fuller says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the size of my dorm room," 49ers tight end Brent Jones says. "That 
probably causes some frustration for some guys, because everybody's right next 
to each other and it drives them crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh has to visit once every season, thanks to its presence in the AFC 
Central Division. When Chuck Noll coached the Steelers, he included the 
visiting locker room in Cleveland as one of the road distractions his team had 
to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," says Tunch Ilkin, a former Pro Bowl tackle with the Steelers, 
"they even give you a nail to hang your clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
 An edge for the Browns? Maybe, but only if the effect you want is the 
opposition taking the field in as foul a disposition as possible. In Atlanta, 
the Georgia Dome's spacious visiting locker room is painted lavender, a nice 
pastel that reduces aggressiveness. Why would the Browns want to make the other 
team angry even before the opening kickoff? 
</P>
<P>
 "That dressing room can get to you," says Houston wide receiver Haywood 
Jeffires, another once-a-season visitor to Cleveland. "It's the worst in the 
league. It's small, and everybody is packed in like sardines. It can definitely 
get you in a bad mood, especially in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's something in the air that gives the home team the edge. In the 
Silverdome in Pontiac, it's heat, heat so hot the air gets heavy. The 
Silverdome is the hottest indoor stadium in the league, according to Bucs tight 
end Jackie Harris. It's a controlled environment, but the controls apparently 
have only one setting: canned heat. Heat hot enough that Harris and his 
teammates are ready to change jerseys even before the game starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there's heat, there's haze, "like at a rock concert," says Buccaneer 
Tony Mayberry, a center. "The lighting is real weird." 
</P>
<P>
 If you learn how to play the haze and the heat and the weird lighting, you're 
one up on the poor saps still gasping to get a breath. And if you're one up, 
you want to stay one up, which is why Lions wide receiver Herman Moore won't 
get any more specific than this about his one-upmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a 20-yard area in the Silverdome where you can never see the ball on 
an out route, but I'm not going to tell you where that is," Moore says. 
"(Opposing receivers) can find out for themselves. The ball goes into those 
lights in the corner of the stadium and it disappears. It's almost impossible 
to catch. We never run out routes there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad lighting in Chicago on a Monday night, especially on a Monday night when 
the fog comes in on its little cat feet, makes Soldier Field a chamber of 
horrors for some road teams. Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of the 
Bears? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's darker than most stadiums," Minnesota linebacker Greg Manusky says. 
"There are all kinds of shadows. If they figure out where the shadows are, it 
could be an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's nothing in the air that gives the home team the edge. In 
Denver, the nothing includes oxygen. That advantage may be more psychological 
than physical, but the Broncos don't mind using it. When visiting teams check 
into their locker room, the first thing they see is a sign that says, "Welcome 
to Mile High Stadium. Elevation 5,280 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, Denver is 62-18 in the thin air at Mile High, the best 
home record in the NFL over that time. When current Giants Coach Dan Reeves 
coached there, he played every altitude mind game in the book -- and most of 
them worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always mention how hard it is to breathe in Mile High," Reeves says. 
"Particularly if it was a key game." 
</P>
<P>
 The week before the 1987 American Football Conference Championship Game, the 
altitude factor had Cleveland Coach Marty Schottenheimer so spooked he took the 
Browns to Albuquerque, N.M., to practice, at least partly for its elevation. It 
might have helped a little, too, but Earnest Byner fumbled inside the Broncos' 
5-yard line at the end of the game and Denver won, 38-33. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably only seems this way to the opposition, but the altitude might even 
affect Denver's play selection at Mile High. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never prepare for the altitude up there," Chargers linebacker Junior 
Seau says. "You can be in the best shape here on the (West Coast) and go up 
there and feel like you're out of shape and haven't been working out for a 
couple of days. And if you feel like a couch potato here on the West Coast, who 
knows what you are in Mile High. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the Broncos run their offensive schemes up there, they throw a quick 
pass here and there. They make sure you feel it early. If you're young, you can 
have a mental breakdown, easy. That's one of the hardest stadiums to play in 
because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the high tides and green grass of San Francisco. The higher the 
tide in San Francisco Bay, the greener the grass in Candlestick Park. It's 
greener because of the seepage factor: The field gets soggier at high tide. And 
when it's soggier, it's slower. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have learned how to read the water level in the Bay for their 
homefield advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a high tide or a low tide, and you know pretty much what to expect," 
49ers defensive back Merton Hanks says. 
</P>
<P>
 How can a team from, say, Washington figure out the tides? It can't. So the 
Redskins do the next best thing. They watch the shoes the 49ers wear in pregame 
warmups. If the cleats are long, they change to long cleats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to thinking, 'Hell, I've got to wear some Jerry Rice shoes so I can 
get the same traction he gets,' " the Redskins' McKenzie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotta be the shoes. The 49ers keep playing those mind games, too, especially 
late in the season when the sod at Candlestick is so mangled that nothing is 
going to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, maybe, Kitty Litter, which is what they put on the field to help 
cushion the blows from the dirt in the baseball infield. Such pleasant working 
conditions in San Francisco: Bay water in the grass at one end, Kitty Litter in 
the dirt at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the wind right off the bay," says Saints kicker Morten Andersen, 
who has to play there every year. "And you've got grass that's different on one 
end of the field as opposed to the other end of the field. It's thicker and 
more waxy on one end, and shorter and more sandy on the other end. It's 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 So who makes a shoe that works in watered-down Kitty Litter? Wouldn't you like 
to see Deion Sanders in that commercial? "Neon" running through a tub o' soggy 
Kitty Litter? 
</P>
<P>
 At Veterans Stadium, field goals are kicked from what sometimes seems like the 
foothills of the Appalachians west of Philly. Hands down, the Vet wins the gold 
medal for worst artificial turf in the NFL. No need to award the silver or 
bronze. (New turf is on the way for the 1996 season.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other baseball/football groundskeepers find an acceptable way to make the 
transition from one sport to the next every autumn. They apparently haven't 
mastered it yet in Philadelphia, where the Eagles play in a venue Cardinals 
quarterback Steve Beuerlein less-than-affectionately refers to as "that 
rat-trap." 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing kicker Eddie Murray has been around the league as long as he has. 
He will need every bit of experience to figure out the Vet, now that he is 
kicking for Philly full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down where they have the baseball diamond, it's raised up a couple of 
inches," says Lohmiller about Veterans Stadium. "When you're trying to kick a 
field goal down there, you have to go up and down mounds to try to find the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just the part of the field where the Phillies' infielders play in the 
summer, either, that makes for interesting footing in the fall. Sometimes, 
pieces of artificial turf in the Vet act estranged from their next-door 
neighbor. They don't always care to be seen together. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives those Eagles who've played on it for a while an advantage, at least 
in knowing where to step lightly. That is, if their knees and ankles survive 
that long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing like it in all of the NFL," Philadelphia safety Rich Miano 
says. "There are different types of turf where they put second base and the 
pitchers mound and all that. You're dealing with different surfaces that your 
feet adjust to differently. You're dealing with big seams. You're talking about 
a dangerous surface." 
</P>
<P>
 That surface was the undoing of former Bear receiver Wendell Davis and could 
cost him his career. Last October at the Vet, he sustained ruptures of the 
patella tendon in each knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Footing can be an adventure in Texas Stadium, too, when it rains. The hole in 
the roof keeps part of the field dry, but sometimes it's hard to figure out 
which part. The Cowboys seem to know the slick spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "That turf can be amazingly slippery in places," says Turner, Dallas' 
offensive coordinator for three years before he defected to Washington and 
started sounding like a rival coach. "I think the Dallas players have an 
advantage down there, knowing the right type of shoes to wear." 
</P>

HARDLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME IN GOLF, FRESNO'S SPRINGER SETS HIS GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB GLOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen-month-old Haylee Springer toddles over to the glass table and grabs 
the computer printout of her father's PGA earnings, glances at it for a second, 
then tosses it on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's about as much respect as her dad, Mike Springer, gets from most 
golf fans. Even though he's the only American with two wins on the PGA Tour 
this year, he's hardly a household name. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Nick Price and Jose Maria Olazabal, Springer is the only golfer 
with more than one victory on the tour in 1994. He won the Greater Greensboro 
Open in April and the Greater Milwaukee Open earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he gets asked for an autograph now and then. And plenty of folks 
recognize him in Fresno. And, he says, sometimes "there are people trying to 
mob little ol' Mike Springer" as he completes a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite winning $710,717 on the tour this year, he still can only dream 
of being a superstar like Greg Norman, who has an entourage of fans and a 
private jet. Springer often has to wait a day for a convenient flight home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go back to my room (after a tournament) and I can't get out because I live 
in Fresno," he says. "I want to have my airplane to fly around like Norman." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer has already surpassed many of his goals for this season, his fourth 
on the tour. He got his first tour victory in Greensboro, a win that boosted 
him over $1 million in career earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has made the cut in almost all of the tournaments he's played this 
year, not bad for a guy whose inconsistency and mental exhaustion left him 
hoping to miss the cut at earlier times of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked exactly how many cuts he's missed this year in 22 tournaments, 
though, Springer is temporarily at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three," his wife, Crystol, says from the kitchen of their new house on the 
outskirts of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new home is almost triple the size of their previous one. Springer has 
it all planned out -- they'll have a second child while living in this house, 
then move to a still bigger home before having a third child. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, he's setting goals for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said I wanted to be No. 1 in the world by the time I was 30," says 
Springer, who turns 29 in November. "Obviously, I've got to get moving because 
I have less than two years left." 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Arizona product still has to learn how to play well even 
when he's tired of being on the tour. He usually starts the year strong and 
then succumbs to mental exhaustion by the fall, and this season he even 
struggled early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed the cut at the Bob Hope Crysler Classic in mid-February and withdrew 
after one poor round the following week in San Diego. Even though Crystol and 
Haylee accompany him on most trips, he gets tired of living in hotels and 
restaurants and often can't wait to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-week break, he came back refreshed and won the Greensboro event 
a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'How can you be burned out at the age of 28?' But I've been 
working at this since 1988, and working hard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He's currently in the midst of a five-week vaction. Other than a round with 
country singer Vince Gill and hitting a few buckets of balls just to avoid 
stiffness, he has not picked up a club on this vacation -- which ends in 
mid-October at the Texas Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals are to arrange his schedule to avoid burnout, and to better 
understand his game so he can become a consistent winner like Price and 
Olazabal.

FOR 49ERS, BEATING THE CAP IS A GAME WITHIN A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somehow, the San Francisco 49ers found room under the salary cap to add all 
the players they wanted -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this while dropping annual player costs a staggering $16 million from 
last year's $50 million peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the supposed restraints of the $34.6 million cap, the 49ers remade 
their defense and filled gaps on their offensive line to position themselves 
for a Super Bowl run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they have raised eyebrows, not to mention suspicions around 
the league. Club president Carmen Policy says no financial trickery was 
involved in assembling the team's all-star cast. It was simply a matter of 
dollars and sense, and players exercising their freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the complaints intensified after the Sept. 15 signing of cornerback 
Deion Sanders, who already reigns as the crown jewel among San Francisco's 
eight key free-agent acquisitions, six of whom have been to the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders agreed to a one-year, $1.1 million contract along with the chance for 
$750,000 in incentives. The 49ers also hold an option for next year but cap 
constraints would make it impossible for them to exercise it, thus guaranteeing 
Sanders unrestricted free agency in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders rejected more lucrative offers from New Orleans, Miami, Detroit, and 
his former team, the Atlanta Falcons, and both Saint owner Tom Benson and 
Falcon president Taylor Smith have questioned whether the 49ers were somehow 
fudging figures to stay under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy said every one of the 49ers' contracts passed muster with the NFL 
management council, which polices the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under surveillance 24 hours a day. The authorities in New York have us 
watched, they're following us. They probably have our phones tapped," Policy 
said. "So if we're going to commit a crime, this is not the most ideal 
circumstance under which to plot and commit it. So, I take a little offense at 
their suggestions. It's unfair besmirching." 
</P>
<P>
 Free agent cornerback Toi Cook, who left the Saints for a lower-paying job 
with the 49ers, said the complaints by Benson and other team executives are 
without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I talked to (the Saints), they didn't have any money," Cook said. "When 
Rickey (Jackson) talked to them, they didn't have any money. They made Eric 
Martin take a pay cut. But then they come up with a four-year, $17 million 
offer for Deion, so you tell me who's fudging figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business, OK? The 49ers have figured out how the cap works. You know, 
it's funny how all the people complain about the salary cap but then they come 
up with money when they need it, even the 49ers. I just think in a couple of 
years you might be seeing something like collusion because, hey, you're now 
finding out teams do have the money and can afford to spend it. It's all in how 
you run your business." 
</P>
<P>
 Count Dallas owner Jerry Jones among those who don't like the 49ers' way of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't think the 49ers are cheating. He just thinks they're being 
short-sighted by giving some players incentive-laden contracts with low base 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has said the 49ers have sacrificed long-term stability for short-term 
gain. He says once those incentives start kicking in next year there's no way 
of keeping the team together. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculous, Policy shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you there are at least 10 and probably 12 teams in the NFL that 
have deferred more money into the future than the 49ers," he said. "So, if 
we're mortgaging the future, we're in the middle of the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what have the 49ers done to rankle their competitors? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, two days before signing Sanders, the 49ers were $21,000 under the cap. 
Earlier, Policy dropped out of the running for Sanders, saying cap constraints 
made it impossible to compete for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy said San Francisco did an about face when Sanders dropped his 
insistence on a multiyear package and agreed to take a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, San Francisco had to field a respectable offer so they gained $1.3 
million under the cap by restructuring the contracts of linebackers Gary 
Plummer and Ken Norton and strong safety Tim McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers also waived second-year players Artie Smith and Adrian Hardy, giving 
them enough money to sign both Sanders and Charles Mann, another former Pro 
Bowler released by the Washington Redskins earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The working of the salary cap and aggressive free-agency plunge really had its 
roots in the free-agency loss of defensive tackle Pierce Holt to Atlanta 
following the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a serious, serious lesson, one that we'll never forget," Policy 
said. "When we lost Pierce Holt, that set us reeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Policy determined that the 49ers could, as it were, beat the cap by signing 
the team's key players before they could become free agents and before 
implementation of the cap this season. 
</P>
<P>
 So, last fall Policy went to club owner Eddie DeBartolo and told him he needed 
another $10 million. DeBartolo forked over the dough and the signings began in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's payroll swelled to over $50 million but the club kept its 
top-ranked offense together, re-signing such players Jerry Rice and John 
Taylor, tight end Brent Jones, tackles Harris Barton and Steve Wallace, and 
guards Jesse Sapolu and Ralph Tamm. Steve Young was signed to a five-year, $26 
million deal prior to the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 To cushion the impact of those signings, the 49ers front-loaded those 
contracts, raising the players' 1993 salaries and lowering their pay in cap 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tactics gave the 49ers maneuvering room to bid on free agents and in 
effect prevented other teams from raiding their roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who were they going to go after?" Policy asked. "We were able to protect 
ourselves during our most vulnerable year." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the 49ers went shopping, picking up Plummer, Norton, Richard Dent, 
then Bart Oates, Rickey Jackson, Cook and finally Mann and Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 They also drafted and signed a pair of first rounders in defensive tackle 
Bryant Young and fullback William Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the 49ers bumped up against the cap, they would tinker with contract 
clauses to get back under. San Francisco put together the five-player practice 
squad only after Jerry Rice, Ricky Watters and McDonald agreed to either forgo 
or revise incentive clauses worth $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what we did wouldn't have been possible without the cooperation of 
the players," Policy said, estimating the club has in one way or another 
adjusted the contracts of 16 of the club's 22 starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has the ability to do what we did," club owner Eddie DeBartolo 
said. "But maybe they're satisfied with their rosters." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say this," added Policy. "There are absolutely no more rabbits left in 
the hat. What you see out there on the field is what you get."

COMMENTARY; MESSIER MESS PUTS DAMPER ON RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last act of a magnificent sports drama will be played out at Madison 
Square Garden on Monday night, Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers will open their home season and the Stanley Cup banner will be 
raised to the top of the place, and only then will last season really end. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then can we close the books on Game 7 of the Rangers-Canucks series. Only 
then do we finally end the night of June 14, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot hold a ceremony like that, at the top of the hockey world, without 
Mark Messier in uniform, without Messier in the Garden and on the ice. This 
problem with Messier's new contract has gone on long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier was on the phone last week from Hilton Head, S.C. He was in Hilton 
Head when he should have been in Los Angeles getting ready to play against his 
old teammate and old friend Wayne Gretkzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier was on his way into his own gym and on his way to go fishing after 
that when he should have been in a rink, getting ready to do something he knows 
everything about: Defend a Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing more fun than winning the Cup is defending the Cup," Messier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked what it would be like for him on Oct. 3 if he is still in Hilton 
Head and has to watch on television as the banner is raised, if he is not on 
stage with his teammates for the last act of one of the most theatrical shows 
New York, or any city, will ever see. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm not there it will be one of the great disappointments of my career," 
Messier said. "The raising of the banner is the ritual that solidifies 
everything. It's like you're engraving the whole achievement somehow, up there 
for everybody to see." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be happy for my teammates," Messier continued. "But I'd feel sick inside, 
there's no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
 For a few weeks last spring, even as the Knicks were trying to win the NBA 
championship, the Rangers and hockey were more important than they have ever 
been in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers had gone 54 years without winning the Stanley Cup and they nearly 
lost the whole thing when they fell behind the Devils three games to two in the 
Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Messier guaranteed victory in Game 6 and scored a hat trick to bring the 
Rangers from behind in the third period of Game 6. He was Namath that night, 
and throw in Reggie Jackson, too, because Messier hit three. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was June 14 and Game 7 against the Canucks. Messier scored one 
more goal and the Rangers won and there was Messier holding the Cup in the air 
and fireworks went off in the Garden. He had made a hockey night at the Garden 
feel like it had ended with Bobby Thomson's home run. Nothing quite like this 
will ever happen again. ITT / Cablevision, the new owners of the Garden, were 
not around for the night of June 14, but must pick up the tab anyway. You buy 
the Garden, you buy everything inside it, including terrible curses and 
glorious memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans don't care that the Garden has been sold. They have stopped caring 
very much that Mike Keenan is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The hysteria about Bob Gutkowski leaving is just media silliness; it became 
difficult to tell the other day if Gutkowski had just been Garden president or 
the skipper of PT 109. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans just know that Mark Messier delivered in a way few athletes have ever 
delivered for a New York team, and they want him in uniform in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to sell Messier to Dave Checketts, the new president of the 
Garden. He is smart enough to understand the importance of stars. Gutkowski 
wasn't the only one on 33rd Street able to figure out something like that, or 
to close a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Jaffe, who was Gutkowski's boss when Paramount still ran the Garden, 
knew all about stars after a career in Hollywood, even if he does not get one 
ounce of credit for saying yes to Pat Riley's deal and yes to Neil Smith's 
trade for Messier, and to Messier's original contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaffe, always a real hero at the Garden behind the scenes, is gone. So it 
is Checketts' job now to make Charles Dolan of Cablevision and Rand Araskog of 
ITT understand that you have to pay Messier for three more years even if 
they're not convinced he has three more years left in him. I believe Checketts 
will do that, and then Neil Smith will go make a deal for Messier by the 
beginning of next week. Because nothing else makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 If Messier is not there to raise the banner on Oct. 3, then don't bother 
putting the thing up there. Maybe there is some New York symbolism to the fact 
that Oct. 3 was the date when Thomson hit his home run for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm being unfair," Messier said. "I don't think I came in and 
high-balled anybody (asking for about $19 million over the next three seasons). 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of respect for Wayne (Gretzky), I did not ask for a number that would 
make me the highest-paid player in the game." There was a pause and Mark 
Messier said, "But I believe I should be second." 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to be Gretzky's sideman with the Oilers when they were winning 
four Stanley Cups in the 1980s. But Messier turned out to be more. Gretzky left 
for Los Angeles. Messier won again in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he left for New York, knowing he was taking on an immense challenge here, 
with a franchise that had not won the Stanley Cup since 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 And last spring he delivered the goods. He was no one's side-man here. He was 
the star, doing a full star turn in last spring's playoffs. He turns out to be 
one of the great winners of his generation. He delivered the goods in New York 
the way Reggie did, after Reggie had won plenty with the A's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play three more years and win three more Cups," Messier said 
yesterday. "But if I'm going to do that, I better get started." 
</P>
<P>
 He addressed a crazy rumor that he might be traded to the Blues for Brett 
Hull. "I've said this before. This is my last stop. I'd think about hanging (my 
skates) up before I'd get traded again." 
</P>
<P>
 Messier was asked if he is angry that writing a new contract has taken as long 
as it has, put everybody this close to the beginning of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel anxious," he said. "It's the time of year when I should be playing 
hockey and I feel a strong desire to be playing. I know I've put myself in this 
situation. But I'm supposed to be in a rink." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, sports is about memory and it is about hope. Messier is both for 
the Rangers. It is why he is worth the money he is asking. The Garden really 
should pay him before the weekend is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier knows as much about defending the Cup as he does about winning the 
Cup. It is time to get on with all that. But first Messier must raise a banner, 
and ring down the curtain on June 14 once and for all.

GOOD TIMES ROLL ALONG FOR DON LARSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the telephone rings and the voice says, "Let the good times roll, baby 
doll," it's the distinctive calling card of Don Larsen, an uncomplicated, 
gentle man who has never made the mistake of being impressed with himself or 
the notoriety he achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and only perfect game in the history of the World Series, truly an 
epic baseball achievement, is the sole property of this refreshingly, 
honest-to-a-fault individual who never let a team curfew stand in the way of a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen is visiting in Baltimore with one of his best friends, Frank Ferrari, a 
man he got to know when he was pitching for the Baltimore Orioles after the 
city re-joined the American League in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they met, as Larsen, an inveterate pinball player, rang up the 
machine in an establishment, no longer in existence, known as the Bandbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Larsen authored his impeccable performance for the New York 
Yankees when he put away 27 straight Brooklyn Dodgers, striking out Dale 
Mitchell for the final out. Umpire Babe Pinelli made the call as Mitchell tried 
to check his swing and 64,519 witnesses in Yankee Stadium couldn't believe the 
reality of the scene that had unfolded in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On his return to Baltimore, Larsen, Ferrari and another compadre, Joe Wells, 
once a quality pitching prospect from Georgetown who signed with the Detroit 
Tigers, unlimbered their elbows and reveled in an round of story-telling at a 
leisurely spot called Woody's Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, the Yankees were paying Larsen a salary of $12,000 as he helped pitch 
them to the pennant by delivering three straight four-hitters and a 
three-hitter. He was strong, athletic, a fast runner and respected batter who 
frequently would get the call to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
 While an Oriole, with a record of 3-21 for a team that lost 100 games, he 
twice beat the Yankees, which is why they were receptive to trading for him in 
a deal involving a record 15 players. Larsen habitually stayed out late and the 
Orioles, for what is believed to be the only time in the 40 years of the 
franchise, assigned a detective to trail a player. But the report was rather 
innocuous. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Arthur Ehlers learned Don's routine was to visit a piano bar, 
listen to the music, refresh himself and then battle the nearest pinball 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have saved the Orioles' money," said Larsen. "They only had to ask. 
I'd have told them what I was doing. I couldn't sit in a room. I had to be out 
in the city with the bright lights." 
</P>
<P>
 You know, "Let the good times roll, baby doll." 
</P>
<P>
 The night before his World Series masterpiece, he went to dinner in New York 
at Billy Taylor's restaurant with sports writer Art Richman, now a Yankee 
official, and was in bed before midnight. He also gave Richman, while sharing a 
taxi, a donation for his synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, in facing the Dodgers, utilized an unconventional no-windup delivery 
he had first used in a late-season game against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Yogi Berra was hardly in a crouch before the ball was there," 
Larsen recalled. "It even surprised the umpire. The only one who knew about it 
was coach Jim Turner. He told me to do what made me comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series performance created such excitement that Larsen was in demand 
for public appearances. His top payday was $7,500 for being in a skit on the 
Bob Hope Show. Larsen, though, quickly tired of the demands on his time and 
went home to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He now lives amid what is generally agreed to be one of the most scenic 
panoramas in all of America, the town of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. "We moved there 
because my wife liked the name," he jokes. "Our place overlooks Hayden Lake. If 
you like natural beauty, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to baseball conversation, the game's tradition dictates that after a 
no-hitter the club awards the pitcher a $1,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yankees said they'd 'take care of me later' but never did," he recalls. 
"I guess they felt the World Series share was enough. The 1957 contract they 
sent had a $1,500 raise but I finally got them to up the salary to $16,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen decided he wanted to do something to mark the "perfect occasion" and, 
with Richman preparing a fitting inscription, went to the personal expense of 
having silver-plated plaques made for teammates, manager, coaches, trainers, 
equipment handlers, front office officials, umpires, league presidents and the 
commissioner to commemorate the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for occasionally coming home when the "birds were singing," he says 
experience taught him the second day, rather than the day after, is when the 
result of overindulgence may exact a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Baltimore, Larsen asked about such ex-teammates with the Orioles and 
St. Louis Browns such as Billy Hunter, Dick Hall, Lou Sleater, Pete Taylor and 
General Manager Hank Peters.

 There was never anything petty or malicious to Don Larsen, which made him easy 
to like and admire. For right now, it's a glass of buttermilk for the road and, 
of course, "Let the good times roll, baby doll." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen doesn't put it into words but realizes Dame Fortune inexplicably put 
her fickle arms around him for an embrace that translated into illustrious 
immortality.

WALTRIP EVOLVES FROM BRASH TO BUSINESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, he was Darrell the Brash, a fast-talking and somewhat boastful young 
charger, roundly booed but unwilling to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Darrell the Great, whose 1981-82 run through the NASCAR Winston Cup 
circuit produced 24 victories, a two-year total unmatched in the modern era of 
stock-car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Darrell the Revered, a dedicated family man with a growing 
reputation for friendship to fans and fellow drivers. He became one of the most 
popular figures in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's "Old D.W.," the clown prince of racing, owner-driver, race 
analyst, car dealer, TV pitchman extraordinaire. Run right down to your local 
auto parts store for a fan belt, brake pads . . . you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to thank Western Auto . . . AC Delco . . . Havoline . . . Chevrolet 
. . . everybody," precedes "Well, we had 'em covered today" as his first 
obligation in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Waltrip is no longer a race driver. Like an increasing number of his 
brethren, he's a businessman who drives a race car, a man whose worth runs to 
eight figures, who learned his finances the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into NASCAR racing because I thought I could do some things, make some 
money. I thought I had it all. I was outspoken, articulate, and I had a sense 
of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was an anti-establishment type. I saw some things I didn't like in 
NASCAR, and had some things to say. I fought the wall, and the wall won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great product, but I was a bad salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Racing fans once wore shirts reading "Anyboby but Waltrip." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't see the other side of him. Once, he stood in the rain for three 
hours signing autographs at a department store. The next day he crashed, and 
the fans cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I said those people should come see me at Kmart," he recalled. "Well, it 
came out sounding like I was challenging them to come down to Kmart for a 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he won so often and was so visible in the racing community that his 
message was delivered by others. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Neil Bonnett, a teammate during Waltrip's dominance of the circuit, 
once spoke of a time he was 30 minutes late for a fan club function. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got there they were having a great time," Bonnett said. "Darrell came 
by and found out I was late and just stepped in talked to all the fans and took 
care of everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip was the darling of the media from the start. Later, when he "became 
more conservative and learned to keep my mouth shut," he was cast in the role 
of revered elder statesman of the track. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when he ended 17 years of frustration by winning the Daytona 500, 
there was cheering in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, on national TV, he jumped around and carried on like a child 
who'd just received the pony he always wanted. He did the Icky Shuffle -- 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, a new corn star was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, a new, albeit terribly unconventional, car owner came along. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain delays at races were like the breakaway segments in pro wrestling. Old 
D.W. would stop by, first as the stern-looking driver annoyed with the car 
owner. Then the hat went askew and out came the cheek in a suggestion it was 
filled with chewing tobacco. Naturally, the car owner was threatening to fire 
the driver. High drama stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he said with a laugh, "we have to wear a lot of hats in this 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Few wear as many as the 47-year-old Waltrip, who admits it has reduced his 
time with the race car. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is not a sport," he said. "It's a business." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's treating it that way. A losing streak that has reached two years 
caused him to make changes in key spots on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so bad that I told them at the shop that if I was just a driver, if I 
didn't own the car, I'd just park it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several strong showings since have given birth to subtle memories of Darrell 
the Great, winner of 84 races, three Winston Cup titles and more than $13 
million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest occurred when Waltrip powered to the front Sunday in the SplitFire 
500. A crowd of 94,000 was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some people working for me who set me back a year and a half," Waltrip 
said of fired crew chief Barry Dodson and engine builder Lou LaRosa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever hear of Pete Peterson?" Waltrip asked. "Did you ever hear of 
Claude Queen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Waltrip pulled them from oblivion to head his race team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've given me a great car to drive," he said of crew chief Peterson and 
engine builder Queen. "I can't do all the things I could when I was 25. I can't 
carry a bad car anymore. But you give me a good race car and I can still drive 
the wheels off it."

WALTERS HAS A FIELD DAY AS USC WINS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TAILBACK RUSHES FOR 207 
YARDS, THREE TOUCHDOWNS; JOHNSON PASSES FOR 364 YARDS AS TROJANS HOLD OFF 
BAYLOR, 37-27. 
</P>

<P>
 The way Rob Johnson and his USC offense moved the ball up and down the field 
Saturday night, you'd have thought they were gunning for a Nebraska-like score 
-- 60 or 70 points, say. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite gaining almost 600 yards in total offense, more than 350 of them 
on Johnson passes, the Trojans won, 37-27, over a Baylor team that didn't go 
down for the count until the final four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night the Trojans (2-1) couldn't put Baylor (3-1) away early, USC needed 
every one of Cole Ford's three field goals. In fact, the Trojans could have 
used the two he missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Walters, the Trojans' 225-pound power runner at tailback, had a career 
game on a night the Trojans' needed his best. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, a sophomore from Arlington, Tex., carried 31 times for 207 yards, the 
most by a Trojan since Marcus Allen gained 219 against UCLA in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had announced Friday that a question over freshman tailback Delon 
Washington's eligibility had forced the Trojans to hold him out of Saturday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 That forced Coach John Robinson to turn Walters into the Trojan workhorse. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who had been battling a sore lower back in his first two games and 
had had a meager offensive output, was back on track Saturday, before 45,762 at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 27 of 39 passes for 364 yards and one touchdown before bowing out 
late in the game in favor of sophomore Brad Otton. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor made it a game with easily the most electrifying play of the night -- a 
98-yard, third-quarter kickoff return by Ben Bronson that cut USC's lead to 
24-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans had just gone ahead, 24-13, on a 25-yard field goal by Ford and 
seemed ready to pull away from Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronson simply blew through the Trojans' kickoff coverage team, with Scott 
Fields and Ryan Tyiska missing Bronson early in the runback. 
</P>
<P>
 USC increased its advantage to 27-20 on another Ford field goal, this one a 
34-yarder, with 6:25 to go in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost incredibly, however, USC still was in danger of losing after three 
quarters, despite having 497 yards in total offense, including 337 passing 
yards by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 USC wasted a chance to put Baylor away early in the final quarter, when the 
Trojans had Baylor operating out of its end zone, on second down at the Bears' 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Watson, Baylor's pudgy-looking, slow-footed freshman quarterback, 
connected with Brad Lewis on a 42-yard play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' bailed themselves out two plays later when senior linebacker Jeff 
Kopp made the first interception of his career and returned it 41 yards to the 
Baylor 21. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Walters gained five yards, Johnson hit tight end John Allred at 
the eight. He missed Keyshawn Johnson in the end zone and Walters lost a yard. 
The drive had run out of steam, and USC needed Ford's third field goal, a 
26-yarder, for a 30-20 lead with 10:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 USC never really seemed safely in command until its Nigerian linebacker, 
Israel Ifeanyi, a transfer from Orange Coast College, intercepted a pass by 
Watson with 9:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Rob Johnson drove the ball easily on Baylor, reaching the two-yard line 
on a six-yard run by freshman Rodney Sermons. Terry Barnum, who started at 
fullback, reached the one. 
</P>
<P>
 And from there, USC finally put the game away. Walters, with 5:32 to play, 
scored his third touchdown and Ford's conversion made it 37-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, throwing comfortably behind his untroubled offensive line, had passed 
USC to a 21-13 halftime lead. And when he wasn't dissecting Baylor with his 
accurate short- and medium-range passes, Walters was having a career game in 
one half. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with two touchdowns, Walters had 127 yards in 17 carries by the half. He 
finished the half with a 39-yard run down the USC sideline, diving across the 
goal line with 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Walters were so productive in the first half that the Trojans' 
point production seemed feeble by comparison. Ford missed two field-goal 
attempts, of 47 and 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other drive on which the Trojans' failed to score ended with a 
Walters fumble when USC had a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson had taken Baylor to a 3-0 record and looked sharp in the team's first 
possession. He took the Bears 80 yards in six plays, including a 36-yard pass 
play, 23 yards on a keeper and a 22-yard pass to the Trojan one. 
</P>
<P>
 USC tied the score on its first drive, moving 76 yards in nine plays. Included 
were a a 44-yard pass-run to H-back Johnny McWilliams and a 14-yarder to Ken 
Grace. From the Baylor 17, Walters got the call four straight times, finally 
scoring untouched from the eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor regained the lead, 10-7, on a 25-yard Jarvis Van Dyke field goal, but a 
big second-and-nine pass play from Johnson to Barnum covering 52 yards put the 
Trojans at Baylor's 22 late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Grace made made a sliding catch of a Johnson pass in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, with USC leading 14-10, Johnson was six of six for 132 yards. 
He didn't throw an incomplete pass until 12:40 remained in the second quarter, 
and that was a block. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was 13 for 17 at the break, for 221 yards, and the Trojans had 354 
total yards.

BRUINS HURT BY BOO-BOOS IN 21-0 LOSS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON STATE SACKS 
COOK SEVEN TIMES. EVEN BRIEF RETURN OF STOKES DOESN'T HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Cook has joined a club that includes Jay Schroeder, Dieter Brock and Jim 
Everett, quarterbacks who have been booed off a Southern California football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook stood with Pat Haden, with Marc Wilson, with, for that matter, Norm Van 
Brocklin and Bob Waterford in area lore after 42,877 at the Rose Bowl on 
Saturday had judged him guilty for UCLA's 21-0 loss to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing only 11 of 25 passes for 90 yards and an interception, Cook had 
little ammunition to fire back, nor was he inclined. After being sacked seven 
times for losses totaling 22 yards, he didn't have the energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess. . . . Nothing was working," said Cook. "I wasn't getting time 
to throw. A couple of times, I remember looking downfield and not seeing 
anybody open. Then you get sacked, and it's probably not the line's fault that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you get a guy that is going to be open and you get sacked, and it is the 
line's fault or a back's fault. Then another time . . . we all screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Except the defense. On a day in which the teams combined for 20 punts, the 
Bruins surrendered only 249 yards, and two of the three Washington State 
touchdowns came on drives of one and two plays after UCLA turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the Bruins (2-2) were shut out for the first time since the Arizona 
State game of 1992 and for only the second time in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or four years ago we came in here with a young team and UCLA scored 44 
points on us," Cougar Coach Mike Price said, referring to the Bruins' 44-3 
victory in 1991. "With the athletic talent UCLA has and the veteran quarterback 
like Cook and good coaching, I was surprised they did not score on us." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't for a lack of opportunity. Three times UCLA started drives in 
Washington State territory, resulting in a punt, interception and fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't for a lack of weapons. Sharmon Shah rushed 15 times for 71 yards 
against a defense that had given up an average of only 22 inches per rush all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver J.J. Stokes, missing since the Tennessee season-opener, played 
part of the first half, caught one pass for 13 yards and had a couple of others 
thrown his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his leg injury stiffened, and he was through for the day. Down 14-0 at 
the time, so were the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State (3-0) had scored on an 85-yard drive that included two 
mix-ups in the UCLA secondary. Those resulted in Chad Davis completions of 27 
yards to Albert Kennedy and 41 yards to Kearney Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Hicks carried the last three yards for a lead that remained 6-0 when 
Johnny Nansen's run for the extra points failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead became 14-0 when Hicks scored from the one on the play after Terrell 
Henderson had blocked Darren Schager's punt. Henderson took an inside rush past 
Aaron Rocque and got the ball cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the center's hands," said Henderson, referring to UCLA long snapper 
Chris Kennedy. "He flinched his knuckles before snapping the ball, so I knew he 
was going to snap it. I got a good jump on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the protection is two weeks old. "The blocked punt came from 
the position Carl Greenwood played," Coach Terry Donahue said. "When Carl 
Greenwood played, that was not a problem, but we had a punt tipped last week 
and one blocked this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown came with 1:06 to play in the first half, but the booing had 
started earlier. The Bruins had gotten nothing from their first four 
possessions, and the fifth was aborted when Cook overthrew Kevin Jordan on 
third and seven from the Washington State 19 and Bjorn Merten missed a 36-yard 
field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
 The derision intensified in the third quarter after an interception by Chris 
Hayes, who picked off a screen pass intended for Shah. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook saw him, but also saw a chance to get the ball to Shah. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a guy over there and he kind of hesitated, so I just threw it over 
his head," Cook said. "I'd say it was 50-50 whether it should have been caught. 
It was a tipped ball, and tipped balls will get you every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes returned it 63 yards to the UCLA 13. A Bruin possession that had begun 
on Washington State's 30 had ended in a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they stopped, Davis found Frank Madu with a short pass, and he followed 
blocks by Clay Reis and Chad Carpenter into the end zone for a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was plain that it was not going to be Cook's day, nor UCLA's. Ryan Fien 
began warming up and was ready to come in, but the Bruins got the ball on the 
Washington 42 after Jay Dumas fumbled a punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue decided to give Cook one more try, but on second down, he was sacked 
by DeWayne Patterson and fumbled, with Dwayne Sanders recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook was through, and Fien was applauded when he came on the field with 10:17 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fien heard both the boos and cheers. "That's wrong," he said. "Quarterbacks 
are going to have their tough times, and I just hope when I'm the man they 
stick with me through the tough times." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins turned the ball over on downs on all three of his series. He 
completed seven of 20 passes for 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At game's end, there was little to analyze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously Washington State dominated the game from every angle and every 
aspect," Donahue said. "We just could not get anything generated offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just whipped us real good, embarrassed us." 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to comment on the scorn heaped upon Cook, who was not so reticent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts," Cook said. "I got yanked from a game. I got booed. It's never 
happened to me before, and it hurts. I'm not going to lie to you. I'm a tough 
guy. I'm not going to mope about it. The hell with everybody. They can think 
what they want to think. I'm going to come back and I'm going to play my . . . 
off next week. That's just the way I'm going to go about it." 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of blame to go around, but the quarterback is generally a 
target in such situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not fair," guard Matt Soenksen said. "I got irritated by the fans, and 
I was hoping that the boos were directed at all of our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't. They never are.

UCLA GETS TAKEN TO THE BLANK; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON STATE HOLDS UCLA TO 
226 YARDS IN 21-0 VICTORY AT ROSE BOWL. STOKES HAS ONE CATCH. 
</P>

<P>
 Washington State's defense showed why it's one of the nation's best Saturday 
as the 22nd-ranked Cougars shut out No. 18 UCLA, 21-0, at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewayne Patterson had four sacks and Kevin Hicks ran for two touchdowns as 
Washington State (3-0) handed UCLA (2-2) only its second shutout in 23 years. 
The Cougars limited the Bruins to 226 yards in the Pacific-10 opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's top defensive team against the rush, the Cougars held UCLA to 69 
yards in 31 rushes. Washington State had given up an average of 19.5 yards 
rushing in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, ranked ninth nationally in total defense, sacked Bruin 
quarterback Wayne Cook six times, and held him to 90 yards passing. Cook was 11 
of 25 with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA came into the game averaging 432.3 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' defense set up the third touchdown, when Chris Hayes intercepted 
a tipped pass by Cook at the Washington State 16 in the third quarter and 
returned it to the UCLA 13. After a penalty, Chad Davis threw a screen pass in 
the right flat that Frank Madu turned into a 17-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored the second time they had the ball, marching 85 yards to a 
three-yard touchdown run by Hicks. Davis completed passes of 27 yards to Albert 
Kennedy and 41 yards to Kearney Adams during the seven-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After UCLA missed its only serious scoring threat, a 36-yard field goal by 
Bjorn Merten that was wide left midway through the second quarter, Terrell 
Henderson blocked Darren Schager's punt to give the Cougars the ball on the 
Bruins 1. Hicks ran it in on the first play to make it 14-0 just before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a sophomore who became the starter this year, completed 13 of 20 for 
166 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He had been intercepted four 
times in the Cougars' two earlier victories. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA receiver J.J. Stokes, an All-American last season, played for the first 
time since bruising his left thigh in the Bruins' opener on Sept. 3. He caught 
one pass for 13 yards but left the game in the third quarter because the thigh 
had stiffened up. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time UCLA was shut out was in 1992, when the Bruins lost, 20-0, to 
Arizona State. Prior to that, they hadn't been blanked since a 38-0 defeat by 
Michigan in 1971.

COLORADO RIDES ON STEWART'S ROCKET; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: A 64-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS

 His right arm had unleashed the most important pass in the history of Colorado 
football, a pass that will grow in length and height around Boulder as the 
story is handed down through the years, and all Kordell Stewart was hearing 
were questions about his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he see who caught it? 
</P>
<P>
 Did he see who tipped it? 
</P>

 Had he ever in his life seen anything like it? 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, still dazed by the last-second chain of events that enabled Colorado 
to stagger out of Michigan Stadium Saturday evening with a 27-26 victory, 
blinked hard at that last one. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that guy's name?" Stewart asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flutie? 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who threw that one for Boston College?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flutie, that would be correct. Doug Flutie. Little guy. Not much bigger than 
the Heisman Trophy he won in 1984. Had this huge throw to beat Miami with no 
time on the clock that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Assured he was on the right track, Stewart nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it," Stewart said, "on 'The Best Plays of Recent College Football.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that one, but who would ever say, 'I'm going to go in there and do it 
myself someday?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, however, has the evidence, recorded forever on videotape and in 
future Wolverine nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock will glow "0:00" with Stewart bouncing up and down on his 26-yard 
line, arm dangling, waiting and hoping for someone in a gold helmet to reach 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball will travel more than 70 yards toward a tangled mess of Michigan 
defensive backs and Colorado receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, before the ball hits the turf, Colorado's Michael Westbrook will 
dive and grab it and roll over before winding up at the bottom of a delirious 
victorious dog pile. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the play will go down as a 64-yard touchdown pass, Stewart to 
Westbrook,although at least one other player, wide receiver Blake Anderson, got 
a hand on it, and the ball carried 74 yards in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And, no, Stewart never saw it or saw who tipped it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know it was a touchdown," he said. "I could only tell by the way the 
crowd was reacting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball popped up in there and all of a sudden, it looks like a big truck 
dumped this load of people in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The play, which saved the Buffaloes from a 26-21 defeat, is nothing special in 
itself. "Jets Formation, Rocket Left" is how it is known in the Colorado 
playbook. Other teams have called it "Hail Mary" or "Big Ben." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the label, the concept is universal -- a fling and prayer, reserved 
for only the most desperate circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something every team in the country practices -- 'Two seconds on the 
clock, here goes,' " Stewart said. "Who is going to say, 'I'm going to do it, 
in my last season, on the road, against Michigan?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than half an hour after the fact and Stewart was still having trouble 
believing it, which explains the unique choice of touchdown celebrations he 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 While teammates somersaulted around him in the end zone, Stewart took off his 
helmet, gotdown on all fours and kissed the second yellow "I" in "MICHIGAN." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kissed the end zone, I licked the grass, I kissed my teammates on the lips, 
I was going to kiss anyone who came close to me," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Stewart got that close to that end zone, he fumbled. Five 
minutes before launching "the Rocket," with Colorado trailing Michigan, 26-14, 
Stewart kept the ball on first and goal from the Wolverine four, gained three 
yards and lunged for the goal line -- only to lose his grip in the air, sending 
the ball rolling into the arms of Michigan safetyClarence Thompson for a 
touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 The fumble appeared destined to be Stewart's primary topic of postgame 
conversation, especially after the Buffaloes (3-0) pulled to within 26-21 when 
tailback Rashaan Salaam scored on a two-yard run with 2:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colorado got the ball back with 14 seconds to play, enough time for two 
passes, maybethree. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart completed one, to Westbrook for a 15-yard gain, with eight seconds 
left, then spiked the ball with six seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for one more play. "Jets Formation, Rocket Left." 
</P>
<P>
 As the play is designed, according to Anderson, "I'm supposed to go down the 
flank and Michael and the other receivers are supposed to get behind me. My job 
is to tip it, to hopefully get it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the team practices the play once a week. "Three times, on 
Thursday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And how often does it work? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't," Anderson said with a shrug. "Basically, we're just going through 
the motions when we practice it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart called it "a miracle, a big-time miracle" and acknowledged that he was 
"scared" when he cranked up to set it in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous," he said. "I was scared. I had confidence I could do it, but 
it was buried deep, deep down inside, behind the arteries and all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan Coach Gary Moeller, who had been prepared to talk about what a great 
day this had been for Wolverine football, with tailback Tyrone Wheatley (17 
carries, 50 yards, one touchdown) back in the fold, could only shake his head 
after his team fell to 2-1 and say, "We work against that play all of the time. 
It's not a miracle. Everybody did everything right, the ball bounced up and 
they caught it." 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook said he had never caught a pass anything like it "except in my 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has shared the same vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed it," Stewart said, smiling, "and it dropped from out of the skies."

MIAMI'S STREAK IS ENDED; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON SURGES FOR 38-20 VICTORY, 
THE HURRICANES' FIRST LOSS AT ORANGE BOWL IN 59 GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Washington Huskies did something Saturday that no team had done since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 They beat the Miami Hurricanes in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington scored 22 points in the first five minutes of the second half and 
rolled past Miami, 38-20, ending the Hurricanes' NCAA record 58-game winning 
streak at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you grow up, you recognize UM as one of the finest programs in the 
country," Washington fullback Richard Thomas said. "If you don't dream about 
playing here, you dream about beating them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies' onslaught began when Thomas caught a screen pass and turned it 
into a 75-yard score. Touchdowns on Russell Hairston's 34-yard interception 
return and Robert Sapp's fumble recovery quickly followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sequence, which stunned a crowd of 62,663, erased Miami's 14-3 halftime 
lead and left the Huskies in command, 25-14. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Hurricanes fell behind, they faded. Washington outscored them, 35-6, 
in the second half and finished with a 12-minute advantage in time of 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sort of sick," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. "I've never been 
around a game like that, what happened in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the half, I thought we had control of the game. In the second 
half they dominated the game physically." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Washington, a two-touchdown underdog in the matchup of 1991 co-national 
champions, improved to 2-1. No. 6 Miami is also 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "How big of a win? Just huge," Washington Coach Jim Lambright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great now, but I'm sure that 10 years from now I'll feel even better," 
said Washington's Damon Huard, who passed for 217 yards. "It's something I'll 
remember for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes' loss was their first game at home since Sept. 7, 1985, when 
Florida beat them, 35-23. Current and former players involved in the streak 
maintain a close relationship, and former Miami defensive lineman Mark Caesar 
was crying on the sideline after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ashamed," Miami receiver Chris T. Jones said. "I'll have to look the 
former 'Canes and coaches in the eye and know that my class is known as the 
class that lost the streak. I'll have to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's final victory in the streak -- against Georgia Southern three weeks 
ago -- broke the record of 57 home victories set by Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess everything can't go on forever," said Miami's Frank Costa, who passed 
for 261 yards but also threw two interceptions. "I hate to be the team to lose 
it. I didn't want to be here when it ended. It really hurts a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami lost despite holding running back Napoleon Kaufman in check. The 
Huskies' senior tailback gained 80 yards in 28 carries and broke Joe Steele's 
school record for career rushing yards with 3,094. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking," Kaufman said of the Hurricanes. "They were saying, 
'You're not going to get the Heisman against us.' But that's not what it's all 
about. We won." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami gave up no touchdowns in the first 2 1/2 games of the season before 
Washington struck three times in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second play of the third quarter, Thomas took a screen pass from Huard, 
broke one tackle and went up the middle of the field to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a swimmer out there," Thomas said. "Every third stroke, I was 
looking back." 
</P>
<P>
 Huard passed to Dave Janoski for a two-point conversion, trimming Miami's lead 
to 14-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington went ahead, 18-14, three plays later on cornerback Hairston's 
34-yard interception return. Costa's third-down pass was intended for Jammi 
German, who slipped and fell before the ball arrived, and Hairston -- burned 
earlier for Miami's touchdown -- went untouched down the sideline to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was in the air when Jammi fell," Costa said. "There's nobody to 
blame. It's a funny game. Anybody can beat anybody with plays like that." 
</P>
<P>
 German fumbled the ensuing kickoff when hit by Tony Parrish, and Washington's 
Jerry Jensen recovered. Six plays later, Huard fumbled at the two on third 
down, but the ball rolled into the end zone and Sapp -- a 280-pound tackle -- 
recovered for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong," Erickson said. "It seemed 
like everything was snowballing." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 4:45 had elapsed in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes mounted two long drives in a bid to come back but had to settle 
for field goals. Dane Prewitt hit from 19, 38, 38 and 25 yards for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's John Wales made field goals of 47, 29 and 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Huard dived into the end zone to score the clincher on a seven-yard run with 
three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the icing on the cake," Huard said. "I could have laid there 
forever. Dig a grave. It's the greatest feeling I've ever had in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lambright: "We got stronger and stronger. The wonderful thing is that we 
were playing a team of this caliber, and it didn't come down to the last 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies blitzed Costa relentlessly, and he burned the gambling defense for 
a big play only once. That was a 51-yard scoring pass play to Yatil Green with 
13 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa then went to German for a two-point conversion to give Miami its 14-3 
lead.

U.S. DOUBLES TEAM CAN'T GET IT DONE; TENNIS: APELL AND BJORKMAN KEEP SWEDEN 
ALIVE IN DAVIS CUP. SAMPRAS WILL GET FIRST CHANCE TO CLINCH TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the U.S. Davis Cup team holding a 2-0 lead after the first day of singles 
competition against Sweden, the American doubles team had a chance to clinch 
the semifinal and send the United States to the Davis Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 But doubles is seldom the place to look for glamour or heroes. Unless they are 
Swedish. The team of Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman easily handled Jared Palmer 
and Jonathan Stark of the United States on Saturday in front of 3,451 at the 
Scandinavium arena. The 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 victory kept Sweden alive in the 
best-of-five competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the game," said Jahon-Anders Sjogren, Sweden's captain. "We 
have a chance to win, and we will take it. We have to find a way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras plays Stefan Edberg today, followed by Todd Martin against Magnus 
Larsson. If the U.S. team wins either match, it will play host to Russia for 
the Davis Cup final in December. Russia would be the host if Sweden wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish doubles team got 71% of its first serves in and, under that 
pressure, the U.S. players did not start points well. Because the Swedes 
returned serve so well, the American players were left looking for shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got jumped on," U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said. "I don't think either 
of those two (Swedish players) could have played better." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorkman's performance was no surprise. The 22-year-old lost to Michael Stich 
in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open, and many here had expected him to be 
named as a singles player for Sweden, ahead of Larsson. He said his play was 
not inspired by a desire to prove he should have played singles, but few 
believed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, he joined his regular doubles partner, Apell, and their fluency as a 
pair provided a marked contrast to the U.S. "team" and its hesitancy and 
indecisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark and Palmer were doubles partners at Stanford, but they have different 
partners on the tour. Aside from a mini-camp in Florida after the U.S. Open, 
their week of practice here has been the extent of their familiarization 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it was Stark's first Davis Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Stark's first match and I think he felt the pressure," Apell said. 
"I felt the pressure when we played against Denmark. I'm glad we had two 
matches before this." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark did not play badly, nor did Palmer. The Swedes simply were a step ahead 
all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, in particular, telegraphed his intention to move away from the alley 
when Stark was receiving, and the Swedes exploited the lines all day. It was 
part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about that before the match," Bjorkman said. "We know that they 
take a step in to get the volley. That's why we tried to go down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorkman's backhand down the line was the final shot of the match and served 
well enough as its symbol. Neither U.S. player saw a problem with their 
positioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good doubles team is trying to cut off the middle," Palmer said. "It's 
difficult when you are trying to cover the middle, which is the percentage 
play. They did a good job of rifling it down the line. They did exploit that. I 
don't know if it's (a problem for) Jonathan and myself or just sound doubles 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two sets were fairly routine. Something sparked for the Americans in 
the third set and they began to return better. They took Bjorkman to three 
break points before finishing him off to break in the fourth game. It was 
enough to give the U.S. team the set, but it was also the Americans' last 
flicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorkman feasted on Stark's serve, as he had when the two met in the first 
round of the U.S. Open and Bjorkman won in straight sets. It was the third game 
of the second set before Stark put together a service game that did not contain 
a break point. The U.S. team was broken four times in the match, three off 
Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was deja vu , just like the Open," Stark said. "I don't know what to do 
when I'm serving to Jonas. I've never played anybody who was able to hit a 
return that hard. He must really like my serve." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of returns off my backhand and normally I don't," Bjorkman said. 
"I was kind of surprised they didn't change something." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Gullikson suggested that both players stay back on the return, 
taking the pressure off the returner, and try to get the ball in play rather 
than attempt a spectacular return. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the percentages were, but we were having to deal with an 
awful lot of first serves," Stark said.

 HURRICANES LOSE STEAM, AGGIES NEW KINGS AT HOME 
</P>
<P>
 Washington stormed into Miami and ended the Hurricanes' NCAA record 58-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miami is forced to start over, Texas A&M becomes the new owner of the 
nation's longest home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies defeated Southern Mississippi, 41-17, winning their 22nd in a row 
at College Station, Tex. MCNAIR TAKES TO AIR AGAIN, BUT HE MIGHT BE GROUNDED 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn State's Steve (Air) McNair lived up to his nickname again on Saturday, 
completing 33 of 56 passes for 395 yards and two touchdowns in a 48-23 loss to 
Sam Houston State. 
</P>
<P>
 But McNair's bid to become the first Division I-AA player to win the Heisman 
Trophy might have suffered a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback suffered a slightly separated shoulder during Saturday's game 
and left with his throwing arm in a sling with about 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know exactly when it happened," McNair said. "I took a lot of hits . 
. . some that I thought were unnecessary shots." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known if or for for how long McNair might be sidelined. 
THE FIX WAS DEFINITELY IN -- THREE TIMES IN FIRST HALF 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Fix returned three punts for touchdowns in the first half, setting an 
NCAA Division I record and helping Canisius to a 28-7 victory over Siena. 
</P>
<P>
 The three returns broke the Division I-A and I-AA records of two set by many 
players. The last time it was accomplished at the I-AA level was in 1985 by 
Sebron Spivey of Southern Illinois in a game against Southeast Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
 Fix finished with 200 yards in punt returns, an interception for 18 yards and 
a kickoff return for 27 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He also set a Division I-AA mark for average yards per punt return with 40. 
The old record of 30.9 yards was set by Gary Harrell of Howard University 
against Morgan State in 1990. EVEN WITH WATER BOY, THEY COULD HAVE POURED IT ON 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska's goal was not to run up the score against Pacific, but to play as 
many people as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers accomplished that goal. Included were backup quarterbacks Adam 
Kucera, who started fall camp as a team trainer, and Ryan Held, a freshman 
split end who was switched to quarterback about 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got them all in today," Osborne said. "Should be about 110 
players. We'll never have more play than we did today."

 The Division I-AA Blazers are scheduled to join Division I-A in 1996, and they

 How times have changed at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who five years ago averaged 54 points a game with Heisman Trophy 
winner Andre Ware at quarterback, have scored 20 or fewer points in four losses 
this season while giving up 135 points.

<P>
 Ohio State got more than one-third of those points Saturday while routing the 
Cougars, 52-0.

 Houston was shut out for the second game in a row for the first time since 
1965. It was the most lopsided shutout by Ohio State since a 63-0 victory over 
Northwestern in 1980.

 Hardly. The Ducks took advantage of several Iowa mistakes and won, 40-18.

<P>
 Since coming to Iowa in 1979, Fry is 3-7 against the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the losses was a 44-6 setback to the Ducks, in Iowa, five years ago. His

</P>
<P>
 Not only did ABC give Los Angeles a dog of a game in Arizona-Stanford, the 
network also deprived this market of seeing the incredible finish of Colorado's 
27-26 victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing prevented ABC from switching off Arizona-Stanford to either 
Colorado-Michigan or Washington-Miami, according to ABC spokesman Mark Mandell. 
But ABC stuck with Arizona-Stanford until it ended at about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a judgment call," Mandell said. "We've had success with our regional 
coverage, and we try not to leave a game in progress. When the Arizona-Stanford 
game ended, Michigan had a 12-point lead, so we went to local programming."

 LOSS LEAVES THEM SORT OF AT A LOSS 
</P>
<P>
 After being thoroughly dominated by the Huskies in the second half, some of 
the Hurricanes described their feelings after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sort of sick," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. "I've never been 
around a game like that, what happened in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the half, I thought we had control of the game. In the second 
half they dominated the game physically." 
</P>
<P>
 Said receiver Chris T. Jones: "I'm ashamed. I'll have to look the former 
'Canes and coaches in the eye and know that my class is known as the class that 
lost the streak. I'll have to live with that." ONE MAN TRAVELIN' 'BAMA BAND 
STILL A HIT 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Williams continues to be the Alabama offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went over the 100-yard mark for the fourth consecutive game, rushing 
for a career-high 191 yards as the otherwise lackluster Crimson Tide edged 
Tulane, 20-10.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams carried the ball 31 times and accounted for nearly half of the team's 
389 yards. The week before, against Arkansas, the senior tailback was 
responsible for 234 of Alabama's 276 yards. MCNAIR GOES TO AIR, BUT WILL HE BE 
GROUNDED?

<P>
 Alcorn State's Steve (Air) McNair lived up to his nickname again on Saturday, 
completing 33 of 56 passes for 395 yards and two touchdowns in a 48-23 loss to 
Sam Houston State. 
</P>
<P>
 But McNair's bid to become the first Division I-AA player to win the Heisman 
Trophy may have suffered a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback reportedly suffered a seperated shoulder during Saturday's 
game and left with his throwing arm in a sling with about 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know exactly when it happened," McNair said. "I took a lot of hits . 
. . some that I thought were unnecessary shots." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known if or for for how long McNair might be sidelined.

 Chad May threw three touchdown passes as Kansas State routed mistake-prone 
Minnesota, 35-0, Saturday night in a nonconference game at Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Smith, who set a school record against Rice last week with 301 
all-purpose yards, rushed for 137 yards for Kansas (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 May, the Cal State Fullerton transfer who was the Big Eight's leading passer, 
completed 17 of 27 passes for 157 yards before retiring in the fourth quarter. 
In his last seven games, the 6-foot-2 senior has 12 touchdown passes and only 
one interception in 205 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State 17, Tulsa 10 -- Freshman Andre Richardson scored on a 20-yard 
run early in the fourth quarter and the Cowboys (2-1) held on to win at 
Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa (1-3) had two chances to tie or win the game in the final five minutes. 
On the first, linebacker Eric Hobbs stopped receiver Wes Caswell for a 
five-yard gain on a fourth-and-six play. On the second, Michael Kedzior was 
ruled out of bounds after catching a pass in the back corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 72, Alabama Birmingham 0 -- Ashaundi Smith returned the second-half 
kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown and Dorian Brew added an 81-yard punt return 
for a score as the Jayhawks (3-1) beat the Division I-AA Blazers (3-1) at 
Lawrence, Kan.

PACIFIC NO MATCH FOR NEBRASKA; NONCONFERENCE: FRAZIER GETS EARLY REST AS BACKUP 
BERRINGER LEADS 70-21 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The plan was to rest Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, and since the 
Cornhuskers' opponent Saturday was Pacific, it didn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Tom) Osborne told me they didn't want to play me very much," Frazier 
said after No. 2 Nebraska romped to a 70-21 victory. "I guess 14 points was 
enough. That's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier suffered a leg bruise in last week's 49-21 victory over UCLA and sat 
out a day of practice early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier didn't complain about not playing. "It might hurt my stats but we've 
got enough tough games on the schedule I can prove myself," he said. "I'm not 
worried about that. There's a long time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne pulled many of his front-line players after the Huskers (4-0) scored 
quickly in their first two possessions against the outmanned Tigers (2-2). 
Frazier's backup, junior Brook Berringer, handled things after that, and 
Nebraska scored on its next five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer passed for three touchdowns and ran for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very confident," Berringer said after completing eight of 15 passes for 
120 yards and rushing six times for 32 yards. "I wanted to go out and show the 
coaches good poise. I think they do know I have that. And they trust me to go 
out and play with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer's 120 yards passing was the best throwing effort by a Nebraska 
quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing the ball is probably his best suit," Nebraska quarterback coach 
Turner Gill said. "But he runs the option well too." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Berringer: "I felt pretty good and feel I played well. I had a couple of 
throws that I wish I had back but overall I felt good. The big key is no 
turnovers. I was conscious of that and I managed to take care of the ball."

BIG EIGHT; RETURNS ARE IN AS KANSAS ROLLS, 72-0

 Ashaundi Smith returned the second-half kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown and 
Dorian Brew added an 81-yard punt return for a score as Kansas beat 
Alabama-Birmingham, 72-0, at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas scored on a kickoff and a punt for the first time in the same game 
since 1966 while rolling to 28 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham, playing its first game ever against a Division I-A team, 
was able to move the ball at times, but committed three turnovers in the first 
half that Kansas (3-1) converted into touchdowns and a 24-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith then returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown and the rout was 
on as Kansas put up its biggest margin since beating South Dakota State, 86-6, 
in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers, trying to make the transition to major college football since 
playing as a club sport as recently as 1989, were shut out for the first time 
in 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas scheduled the game because Alabama Birmingham (1-3) didn't demand a 
visit by the Jayhawks in return. Kansas wanted to play Saturday because it has 
an open date next weekend before a Thursday-game against rival Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice 28, Iowa State 18 -- Byron Coston's 87-yard run set up a touchdown and 
Josh LaRocca passed for two scores as the Owls won a battle of winless teams at 
Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice (1-2) won for the first time under Coach Ken Hatfield and sent Iowa State 
to its first 0-4 start since 1987. Iowa State made it respectable only by 
scoring two late touchdowns after trailing 28-3 early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State, which has lost six straight dating back to last season, tried to 
shake up its sluggish triple-option offense by running more I-formation plays. 
But the Cyclones continued to struggle in a steady rain and had only 129 yards 
after three quarters.

LATE TOUCHDOWN RUNS HELP CAL TO FIRST VICTORY; PAC-10: EDWARDS SCORES TWICE IN 
LAST 7:29 AS BEARS RALLY TO DEFEAT ARIZONA STATE, 25-21.

<P>
 For Tyrone Edwards, one scoring run led to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Edwards' touchdowns came in the fourth quarter Saturday as California 
rallied to defeat Arizona State, 25-21, for its first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal, 1-2 overall and 1-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference, trailed, 21-11, before 
moving within striking distance on Edwards' one-yard touchdown run with 7:29 to 
play. The Golden Bears took the lead on Edwards' eight-yard sweep with 2:03 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that first touchdown, you could just tell we could run the ball," 
Edwards said. "When the defense got the ball back for us, we all said, 'We 
could do this again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 James Stallworth set up Cal's winning drive with his interception of a pass by 
Jake Plummer, returning it two yards to the Cal 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Barr took over from there, leading the Bears 60 yards in seven plays. His 
30-yard completion to Sean Bullard advanced the ball to the 18, and two plays 
later, Edwards took a pitchout and swept around the right side for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned the corner and there was nothing but daylight. I had to get in," 
Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barr: "This win means everything. I can't imagine what another week would 
have been like if we would have lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (1-3, 1-1) got the ball back with two minutes to play, but its 
last-ditch drive ended in Brandon Whiting's fourth-down sack of Plummer. Regan 
Upshaw had sacked Plummer on the previous play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We guaranteed (the Cal offense) if they scored after the interception we'd 
stop them," Stallworth said. "Everyone lived up to their word." 
</P>
<P>
 Barr completed 27 of 34 passes for 254 yards and a touchdown, with one 
interception. Edwards had 71 yards in 15 carries.

OREGON TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IOWA'S MISTAKES, 40-18 
</P>

<P>
 Oregon's football players believed their last two losses were gifts to the 
opposition. On Saturday, the Ducks were on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's Ricky Whittle rushed for three touchdowns in the first half and the 
Ducks took advantage of repeated mistakes by Iowa to defeat the Hawkeyes, 
40-18, in the first visit by a Big Ten team to Eugene since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made far too many mistakes, especially early in the game," Iowa Coach 
Hayden Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks (2-2) outscored Iowa, 20-0, in the second quarter to take a 27-12 
halftime lead, then had long touchdown drives on their first two possessions of 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Hawkeyes (2-2), coming off a 61-21 loss to Penn State, had a 421-279 
advantage in yardage but their turnovers, penalties and dropped passes helped 
Oregon end a five-game losing streak against Division I-A opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited about playing the Big Ten," Oregon's Dino Philyaw said. "As far 
as I'm concerned, the Pac-10 is still the best conference, no matter what 
anybody says." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon took some heat after successive mistake-filled losses to Hawaii and 
Utah. But the Ducks had no turnovers against the Hawkeyes.

IRISH DON'T MISS BECTON IN ROMP OVER PURDUE; NONCONFERENCE: NOTRE DAME RUSHES 
FOR 428 YARDS IN 39-21 VICTORY.

<P>
 With leading rusher Lee Becton sidelined because of an injury, ninth-ranked 
Notre Dame merely handed the ball to others. 
</P>
<P>
 With a groin injury sidelining Becton for at least four weeks, Randy Kinder 
gained a career-high 122 yards in the first half and finished with 143 and two 
touchdowns Saturday as the Irish defeated Purdue, 39-21. Ray Zellars had 156 
yards in 14 carries, including a 62-yard touchdown run. They led a ground game 
that accumulated 428 yards in 54 carries -- the most by an Irish team since it 
gained 467 against Purdue two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our backs ran well," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said. "He (Zellars) is an 
excellent fullback. Last week, he blocked extremely well, and this week he ran 
extremely well. He is a lot like those who played here before him who are now 
playing on Sunday (in the NFL)." 
</P>
<P>
 The run by Zellars put Notre Dame (3-1) ahead, 32-7, late in the third 
quarter. Purdue (2-1) fell behind, 39-7, before driving for two touchdowns by 
Corey Rogers in the final minutes on a one-yard run and a five-yard pass 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last eight minutes just put a bad taste in your mouth," Holtz said. 
"Those first 52 minutes of the football game we played very well, with the 
exception of our goal-line offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinder, making his first start of the season, scored on a three-yard run as 
the Irish opened a 19-7 halftime advantage. The sophomore, whose previous 
single-game best was 108 yards last season, also scored on a one-yard run in 
the second half as the Irish defeated the Boilermakers for the ninth 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the field things were just rolling, and it was a good feeling," Kinder 
said. "The way the line was blocking, I was glad to be in there. Ray had that 
awesome run and everyone was able to really contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Purdue Coach Jim Colleto: "We didn't tackle very well at all."

NO. 16 WISCONSIN WHIPS INDIANA, 62-13; BIG 10: BEVELL HAS PERFECT FIRST HALF AS 
BADGERS BOLT TO 41-0 LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Darrell Bevell, who had four passes intercepted during the first half of a 
38-point loss to Colorado last week, made amends Saturday in leading No. 16 
Wisconsin to a 62-13 victory over No. 25 Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sellout crowd of 77,745 at Camp Randall Stadium, Bevell completed all 
13 of his first-half passes for 184 yards and three touchdowns as the Badgers 
raced to a 41-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he'd snap back just like he did last year," said Indiana Coach Bill 
Mallory, who suffered the worst loss in his 11 seasons with the Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Bevell had five passes intercepted at Minnesota in Wisconsin's 
only loss of the season. A week later, he led the Badgers to a 13-10 upset of 
Michigan, then went on to become the only quarterback in school history to 
direct a Rose Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell said he wasn't thinking about last year or even last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really use that to help me for this week," Bevell said. "I just know 
I'm the quarterback of this team and I know what I've done for this team in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin (2-1, 1-0) opened defense of its Big Ten co-championship by scoring 
more points than it ever had in a Big Ten game. The Badgers scored on their 
first seven possessions and forced the Hoosiers (3-1, 0-1) to punt the first 10 
times they had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot one can say after that," Mallory said. "That was a 
nightmare to say the least. We just got ourselves beat good. We got a 
rump-kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell's first eight passes went to eight receivers, including a three-yard 
touchdown toss to tight end Michael Roan and a 38-yarder to redshirt freshman 
wideout Tony Simmons in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevell, who finished 13 of 17 with no interceptions, also hit Roan wide open 
in the end zone from five yards out with 3:24 left in the first half for the 
41-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41 first-half points marked the biggest half in Wisconsin's 103-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers' 632 total yards bested their old mark of 630 against Wyoming in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin tailback Terrell Fletcher, who rushed for 146 yards and two 
touchdowns in 10 carries, broke free for a 56-yard touchdown run on the first 
play of the second quarter for a 27-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher followed a block by left tackle Mike Verstegen and slipped away from 
an ankle tackle by linebacker Alfonzo Thurman for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Brent Moss rushed 25 times for 110 yards, the 14th consecutive game 
in which he has run for more than 100 yards. He scored first-half touchdowns on 
runs of one and five yards.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; PENN STATE ROLLS ON DESPITE SOME LAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Penn State's offense continued to look unstoppable in a 55-27 victory 
over Rutgers on Saturday at State College, Pa., the Scarlet Knights found some 
weaknesses in the Nittany Lions' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State (4-0) had used a suffocating defense to outscore USC, Minnesota and 
Iowa by a combined 155-38. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half of Saturday's game, Rutgers (2-2) moved the ball easily 
against the fifth-ranked Nittany Lions, amassing 301 yards and three times 
driving 80 yards for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State was able to outscore Rutgers with a balanced offense, getting three 
touchdown runs from Ki-Jana Carter, two from Jon Witman and two touchdown 
passes from Kerry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers Coach Doug Graber said he wasn't content with a good showing against 
the highly favored Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost the game," he said. "I'm not interested in a contest. I'm interested 
in winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers quarterback Ray Lucas kept the larger, slower Penn State defenders 
guessing with a variety of misdirection plays, rollout passes and fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had problems with containment," linebacker Willie Smith said. "They did 
some things we haven't seen a whole lot of. We haven't seen a quarterback as 
athletic as Lucas." 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:07 to play in the half, Lucas threw a short pass to Reggie Funderburk, 
who spun away from defensive back Cliff Dingle and sprinted to the end zone to 
complete a 46-yard play that brought Rutgers within 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played them well," Lucas said. "We showed them the best they have had so 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't good enough. Penn State came right back, as Collins engineered 
an eight-play, 80-yard drive culminated by Witman's five-yard touchdown run 
with five seconds to play in the half to make the score 34-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that took a lot of wind out of their sails," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Ohio State 52, Houston 0 -- Eddie George and Jermon Jackson sandwiched 
touchdown runs around a safety as the Buckeyes scored 16 points in a two-minute 
span of the first quarter at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 George finished with 105 yards in 11 carries, his fourth consecutive game with 
more than 100 yards rushing, and Jackson scored the first three touchdowns of 
his college career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for the young guys to get the experience . . . guys like me, who 
are one snap away from playing," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston (0-4) was shut out in consecutive games for the first time since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who averaged 54 points a game five years ago with Heisman Trophy 
winner Andre Ware at quarterback, have scored 20 points this season while 
giving up 135. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out and tried to smack them pretty good and our defense held up as 
good as possible until they just wore us down," Houston Coach Kim Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (3-1) substituted freely beginning in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Bob Hoying and wide receiver Joey Galloway, the latter 
returning from an NCAA-mandated two-game suspension for accepting $200 from a 
financial adviser, did not play in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoying completed nine of 13 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns. Galloway 
had four catches for 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston is not the best team we're going to play this year," Hoying said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State 45, Miami of Ohio 10 -- Tony Banks passed for touchdowns of 10 
and 38 yards as the Spartans (1-2) romped at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven players scored for Michigan State, including Brian Echols, who returned 
a blocked punt 25 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami of Ohio (0-3-1) held the Spartans to only three points in the first 
quarter, a 37-yard field goal by Chris Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that was as good as it got for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State racked up 28 points in the second quarter as it rolled to a 
31-7 halftime lead.

ATLANTIC COAST ROUNDUP; DUKE DUMPS GEORGIA TECH BEHIND BALDWIN'S RUNNING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Baldwin rushed for 162 yards and three touchdowns Saturday as Duke, off 
to its best start since 1988, took advantage of six turnovers to defeat Georgia 
Tech, 27-12, at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, the Atlantic Coast Conference's leading rusher, scored on runs of 
one, two and six yards and Duke, 4-0 overall and 2-0 in the ACC, added Tom 
Cochran's field goals of 28 and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (1-2, 0-1) scored on a 42-yard touchdown pass from Tommy 
Luginbill to Charlie Simmons to cut Duke's lead to 17-6 with 3:07 to play in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellowjackets, however, bobbled the snap on the extra point and Duke, 
which won its first five games in 1988, added 10 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 North Carolina State 38, Western Carolina 13 -- Brian Fitzgerald rushed 
for 114 yards and two first-quarter touchdowns to lead the Wolfpack at Raleigh, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, who carried 18 times in the first 100-yard game of his career, 
scored on runs of four and two yards as North Carolina State (3-0) grabbed a 
14-0 lead 12 minutes into the game. Then, the Wolfpack let its nationally 
ranked defense take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Carolina (2-2) came into the game averaging 247 yards per game on the 
ground, but was limited to five yards in 13 carries in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 31, Wake Forest 7 -- Kevin Foley passed for two touchdowns and 
deposed starter Scott Milanovich passed for one at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (2-2, 1-2) built a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter, then kept 
Wake Forest at bay by forcing four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins, who defeated West Virginia last week, hadn't won consecutive 
games since defeating Wake Forest and Duke in October, 1990.

AUBURN TAKES IT EASY, RUNS ITS STREAK TO 15; NONCONFERENCE: TIGERS ROLL OVER 
DIVISION I-AA EAST TENNESSEE STATE, 38-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 East Tennessee State's Brian Edwards motioned to the crowd to bring on the 
noise. The arm-waving and hand-clapping summoned loud cheers from the Auburn 
crowd, but they lasted only about two plays.Crowds don't make much of a fuss in 
38-0 wipeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last week, when 10th-ranked Auburn (4-0) needed a furious defensive 
rally in the fourth quarter to defeat Louisiana State, the Tigers cruised 
Saturday in extending the nation's longest Division I winning streak to 15 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn Coach Terry Bowden thought it was a great idea to play a I-AA team 
before a Thursday night game against Southeastern Conference opponent Kentucky. 
His counterpart, Buccaneer Coach Mike Cavan, wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to getting ready for the Southern Conference," said 
Cavan, a former Georgia assistant. "I've seen about enough of the SEC to last 
me the rest of the year, and hopefully the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn's attack was led by Stephen Davis, who rebounded from a subpar game 
against LSU to rush for 120 yards and two touchdowns. Frank Sanders caught a 
career-high eight passes in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden insisted that playing a team from a weaker class was useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get upset when we play a team like that," he said. "But we played 
hard, and there were no letdowns, no taking it easy. We won the game, and you 
never get hurt by it when you win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' invitation for the crowd of 76,341 to get into the game set the tone 
for a spirited effort by East Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come in thinking we couldn't win," Cavan said. "But I think we were 
realistic about it."

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; LATE TOUCHDOWN PASS LIFTS MISSISSIPPI STATE OVER 
TENNESSEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kendall Watkins caught the game-winning touchdown pass and Eric Moulds caught 
a lot of the credit Saturday for Mississippi State's 24-21 victory over 
Tennessee at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds caught three passes from Derrick Taite during the game-winning 11-play, 
52-yard drive, including a leaping 22-yard grab on fourth and 12 to the eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taite came back across the middle to me," Moulds said. "He said he was going 
to hang it up a little bit and give me a chance to catch it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mississippi State Coach Jackie Sherrill: "Eric made some big, big 
catches. There were two plays he made that probably won the game for us." On 
fourth down from the two, Taite combined with Watkins for the touchdown with 36 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs' winning drive started after Aaron Hayden fumbled, the fourth 
consecutive Tennessee possession ended by a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State, 2-1 overall and 1-1 in the Southeastern Conference, was 
outgained, 464 yards to 294, but still left 23rd-ranked Tennessee (1-3, 1-2) 
with three September losses for the first time since 1988, when the Volunteers 
lost their first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee freshman Peyton Manning, playing in the state where his father, 
Archie Manning, starred for Mississippi in the 1960s, passed for two 
touchdowns. Replacing injured starter Todd Helton, Manning completed 14 of 23 
passes for 256 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Alabama 20, Tulane 10 -- Sherman Williams rushed for a career-high 191 
yards to lead the Crimson Tide at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams continued to be a one-man show on offense for Alabama (4-0), carrying 
the ball 31 times and accounting for nearly half of his team's 389 yards. The 
week before against Arkansas, the senior tailback was responsible for 234 of 
Alabama's 276 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little sore," Williams said. "It feels like 31 carries. But last week 
felt like 33 (against Arkansas), so I think I'll be all right. I will be ready 
for next week's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane (1-3) was coming off a 49-0 loss to North Carolina, but the Green Wave 
held the Alabama offense without a touchdown until a 16-yard run by Brian 
Steger broke a 10-10 tie with 2:29 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama's other touchdown was scored on a 24-yard fumble return by Dameian 
Jeffries in the second quarter, erasing a 10-3 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis 16, Arkansas 15 -- Shannon Sidney was called for offensive pass 
interference on a two-point conversion play with 98 seconds to play, enabling 
Memphis to hang on at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (1-3) trailed, 16-9, before Barry Lunney and James Perry connected on 
a 14-yard touchdown pass. Memphis was called for roughing Lunney on the play, 
leaving Arkansas only 1 1/2 yards from the end zone on the conversion play 
instead of the usual three. 
</P>
<P>
 But the advantage was wasted when Sidney was called for interference as Lunney 
lofted a pass into the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Holliday rushed for 171 yards and a touchdown and Luis Tejeda kicked 
three field goals for Memphis (2-2), the last from 30 yards with 2:58 remaining 
to give the Tigers a 16-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina 23, Kentucky 9 -- Steve Taneyhill connected on two touchdown 
passes to Monty Means at Lexington, Ky., including a 52-yarder with 3:38 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning drive came after Kentucky (1-3, 0-2) was penalized 15 yards for 
roughing punter Derwin Jeffcoat on fourth and six at the South Carolina 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Taneyhill lofted the ball to Means racing down the left 
side to give South Carolina its decisive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Taneyhill completed 25 of 38 passes for 254 yards as the Gamecocks (3-1, 1-1) 
rolled up 475 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 17, Mississippi 14 -- Eric Zeier passed for 257 yards and two 
touchdowns to lift the Bulldogs (3-1, 2-1) at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier's scoring passes covered four yards to Brice Hunter in the second 
quarter and five yards to Larry Bowie in the third. Zeier completed 24 of 44 
passes, with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of victory was provided by Kanon Parkmans, whose 34-yard field goal 
broke a 7-7 tie less than three minutes into the third quarter after Greg Brice 
recovered Josh Nelson's fumbled snap on the Rebel 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson led scoring drives of 91 yards in the first quarter and 72 yards in the 
third, but Mississippi fell to 2-2 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 After Zeier's touchdown pass to Bowie gave the Bulldogs a 17-7 lead, Nelson 
capped Mississippi's second scoring drive by connecting with Roell Preston on a 
38-yard touchdown pass play.

FLORIDA STATE LETS UP AFTER BUILDING LEAD; ACC: SEMINOLES' 31-18 VICTORY OVER 
NORTH CAROLINA IS 20TH IN A ROW AGAINST CONFERENCE FOES.

<P>
 Bobby Bowden was getting ready to sit on a stool and nurse his sore back, but 
North Carolina kept him on his toes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us fits," the Florida State coach said Saturday night after a 31-18 
victory over the Tar Heels. "I had the stool ready and was thinking we'd get 
one more score and I could sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was over," said Bowden, who is under doctor's orders to rest his 
back following surgery in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Seminoles seemed to have things in hand with a 31-7 lead 
midway through the third quarter, but No. 13 North Carolina had momentum when 
the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might be a darned great ballclub," Bowden said. "If they're not, we're 
not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Florida State's closest Atlantic Coast Conference game since a 13-3 
victory at Virginia in October, 1992. The Seminoles, 4-0 overall and in the 
ACC, are within a game of matching Maryland's conference mark of 21 consecutive 
victories set in the mid 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (2-1, 0-1) pulled to within 31-18 early in the fourth quarter 
and had good field position on two other possessions, but lost fumbles on 
successive drives, including one at the Florida State 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Tripp Pignetti's 42-yard field goal with 12:15 to play brought the Tar Heels 
to within 31-18. North Carolina had cut its deficit to 31-15 late in the third 
quarter on Malcolm Marshall's one-yard touchdown run and Curtis Johnson's sweep 
around end for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to play that option any more," Bowden said. "It drives you 
crazy. We simply could not stop that quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Stanicek completed 17 of 29 passes for 178 yards and kept the Seminoles 
on their heels for much of the second half, but three fumbles ruined North 
Carolina's upset hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not into moral victories," North Carolina Coach Mack Brown said. "We 
can be a really good football team if we stop making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina started four times in Florida State territory in the first 
half, but managed only one score. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell passed for three touchdowns and Warrick Dunn ran for 121 yards 
for Florida State, which is off next week before going into the Orange Bowl 
Oct. 8 against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell's 31-yard touchdown pass to Kez McCorvey gave Florida State a 31-7 lead 
with 6:56 to play in the third quarter before the North Carolina defense took 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little discouraging to come out and really jump on them and then kind 
of let up and finish the way we did," Kanell said. "We got a little 
complacent." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Cooper, who caught a 27-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, set up 
Florida State's first score of the second half with a leaping catch at the 
North Carolina one. Zack Crockett scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell's five-yard touchdown pass to Melvin Pearsall ended a 79-yard drive on 
the game's first possession and the first of Scott Bentley's four conversion 
kicks gave the Seminoles a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, who carried five times for 44 yards during the opening drive, had 105 
yards rushing at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The defenses took over the rest of the half.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; TENNESSEE SURPRISED BY MISSISSIPPI STATE 
</P>

 Kendall Watkins caught the game-winning touchdown pass and Eric Moulds caught 
a lot of the credit Saturday for Mississippi State's 24-21 victory over 
23rd-ranked Tennessee at Starkville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulds caught three passes from Derrick Taite during the game-winning 11-play, 
52-yard drive, including a leaping 22-yard grab on fourth and 12 to the eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taite came back across the middle to me," Moulds said. "He said he was going 
to hang it up a little bit and give me a chance to catch it. . . . That's what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mississippi State Coach Jackie Sherrill: "Eric made some big, big 
catches. There were two plays he made that probably won the game for us." On 
fourth down from the two, Taite combined with Watkins for the touchdown with 36 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs' winning drive started after Aaron Hayden fumbled, the fourth 
consecutive Tennessee possession ended by a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State, 2-1 overall and 1-1 in the Southeastern Conference, was 
outgained, 464 yards to 294, but still left Tennessee (1-3, 1-2) with three 
September losses for the first time since 1988, when the Volunteers lost their 
first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously struggling right now," Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said. 
"We made enough mistakes in this game to lose two games." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, Fulmer had lost only two games since replacing Johnny 
Majors midway through 1992. He has now lost two in a row, including a 31-0 loss 
to top-ranked Florida last week at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee freshman Peyton Manning, playing in the state where his father, 
Archie Manning, starred for Mississippi in the 1960s, passed for two 
touchdowns. Replacing injured starter Todd Helton, Manning completed 14 of 23 
passes for 256 yards, with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Alabama 20, Tulane 10 -- Sherman Williams rushed for a career-high 191 
yards to lead the Crimson Tide at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams continued to be a one-man show on offense for Alabama (4-0), carrying 
the ball 31 times and accounting for nearly half of his team's 389 yards. The 
week before against Arkansas, the senior tailback was responsible for 234 of 
Alabama's 276 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane (1-3) was coming off a 49-0 rout by North Carolina, but the Green Wave 
held the Alabama offense without a touchdown until a 16-yard run by Brian 
Steger broke a 10-10 tie with 2:29 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama's other touchdown was scored on a 24-yard fumble return by Dameian 
Jeffries in the second quarter, erasing a 10-3 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams stood out in a lackluster game with his fourth consecutive 100-yard 
effort, eclipsing his previous career high of 153 yards established in the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 17, Mississippi 14 -- Eric Zeier passed for 257 yards and two 
touchdowns to lift the Bulldogs (3-1, 2-1) at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier's scoring passes covered four yards to Brice Hunter in the second 
quarter and five yards to Larry Bowie in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier, a senior, completed 24 of 44 passes, with a career-high three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of victory was provided by Kanon Parkmans, whose 34-yard field goal 
broke a 7-7 tie less than three minutes into the third quarter after Greg Brice 
recovered Josh Nelson's fumbled snap on the Rebel 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson led scoring drives of 91 yards in the first quarter and 72 yards in the 
third, but Mississippi fell to 2-2 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 After Zeier's touchdown pass to Bowie gave the Bulldogs a 17-7 lead, Nelson 
capped Mississippi's second scoring drive by connecting with Roell Preston on a 
38-yard touchdown pass play.

 Robert Baldwin rushed for 162 yards and three touchdowns Saturday as Duke, off 
to its best start since 1988, took advantage of six turnovers to defeat Georgia 
Tech, 27-12, at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, the Atlantic Coast Conference's leading rusher, scored on runs of 
one, two and six yards and Duke, 4-0 overall and 2-0 in the ACC, added Tom 
Cochran's field goals of 28 and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (1-2, 0-1) scored on a 42-yard touchdown pass from Tommy 
Luginbill to Charlie Simmons to cut Duke's lead to 17-6 with 3:07 to play in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellowjackets, however, bobbled the snap on the extra point and Duke, 
which won its first five games in 1988, added 10 fourth-quarter points on 
Baldwin's six-yard touchdown run and Cochran's 21-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both scores were set up by interceptions. The first was by Billy Granville, 
who also recovered a first-quarter fumble, and the other by John Zuanich. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 31, Wake Forest 7 -- Kevin Foley passed for two touchdowns and 
deposed starter Scott Milanovich had one at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland (2-2, 1-2) built a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter, then kept 
Wake Forest at bay by forcing four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins, who defeated West Virginia last week, hadn't won consecutive 
games since defeating Wake Forest and Duke in October 1990. This is the first 
time Maryland has been at .500 since Coach Mark Duffner took over before the 
1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest (1-3, 0-2) had four turnovers, matching the number of giveaways 
the Demon Deacons had in their first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, making his first college start, completed 12 of 18 passes for 149 
yards. Milanovich, who lost the starting job last week, completed 10 of 12 for 
121 yards.

 Jamal Willis ran for 204 yards and two touchdowns as Brigham Young's passing 
attack took a rare back seat to give Coach LaVell Edwards his 200th victory, a 
49-47 triumph over New Mexico in a Western Athletic Assn. game Saturday at 
Provo, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards improved to 200-74-3 in his 23rd season with BYU. He is the 13th 
Division I-A coach to win 200 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss to BYU (3-1, 3-1) ruined a school record-setting passing effort by 
New Mexico's Stoney Case, who threw for six touchdowns and completed 25 of 43 
passes for 375 yards for the Lobos (0-4, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force 47, Texas El Paso 7 -- Jake Campbell rushed for 109 yards and scored

right with 1:25 remaining. UNLV led, 23-7, going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. O'Laughlin completed 25 of 46 passes for 358 yards and two touchdowns but 
Cal State Northridge (1-2) had minus-31 yards rushing and lost to Southwest 
Texas State, 28-23, at San Marcos, Tex. . . . Matt Young kicked a 27-yard field 
goal with 3:09 left, lifting the University of San Diego (2-2) to a 29-24

 Kevin Mason scored twice in directing Syracuse's option to three long-distance 
scoring drives, but the Orangemen (3-1) still needed clutch defense in the 
closing minutes to beat East Carolina, 21-18, at Greenville, N.C. East Carolina 
(1-2) got within 21-18 after Marcus Crandell connected with tight end Scott 
Richards on a 20-yard touchdown pass with 5:25 left and Junior Smith ran for 
the two-point conversion. . . . Scott Mutryn passed for a touchdown and set up 
another in about two minutes in the first half and the Boston College defense 
did the rest in a 21-9 Big East victory at Pittsburgh. David Green gained 186

 Defending Ivy League champion Pennsylvania (2-0, 1-0) almost lost for the

WEIRD AZTEC TOUCHDOWN FIRES UP COLORADO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado State, aroused by a ruling that awarded San Diego State a touchdown 
on a bizarre punt return, rallied for 13 points late in the third quarter en 
route to a 19-17 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthoney Hill ran for one touchdown and passed for another, and the unbeaten 
Rams converted two turnovers into two scores in that decisive third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State, 4-0 overall and 3-0 in the Western Athletic Conference, has 
won seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The disputed play gave San Diego (2-2, 0-1) a 10-6 lead. Matt McDougal's punt 
was partially blocked by Freddie Edwards, and the Rams' Steve Standifer 
appeared to be downing the ball when teammate Prentice Davis slid into it. The 
ball squirted out and, as Colorado State players eased up thinking the play was 
over, San Diego State's Ray Peterson scooped it up and dashed 37 yards for the 
score with 9:51 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram running back E.J. Watson, who rushed for 136 yards, said he and his 
teammates were "really ticked off. Our player downed the ball, and he picked it 
up and ran. I don't see how a referee could let that happen. It's 
unprofessional." 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Jack Baker said the ball wasn't downed. "Touching it and walking away 
is not considered downing the ball," he said.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; TEXAS PREPARES FOR COLORADO WITH VICTORY

<P>
 Lovell Pinkney returned from a two-game suspension and made a spectacular 
touchdown catch, igniting No. 15 Texas to a 34-18 victory over Texas Christian 
on Saturday night in a Southwestern Conference game at Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The favored Longhorns, 3-0 overall and 1-0 in the SWC, took no chances in 
their conference opener against the Horned Frogs (2-2, 0-1), who upset them, 
23-14, in Amon Carter Stadium two years ago when Texas was No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas' victory sets up a battle of unbeatens next Saturday at Austin featuring 
Texas and No. 7 Colorado, which beat Michigan, 27-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea Morenz was 16 of 28 for 169 yards and two touchdowns and Priest Anthony 
Holmes scored on two short runs as the Longhorns overpowered the Frogs to 
continue their best start since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas jumped ahead, 14-0, behind two quick touchdowns late in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkney, who had been suspended for improper use of a rental car and missed a 
game while being investigated for a flight he took to Los Angeles, scored the 
first one by outjumping two Horned Frogs defenders to catch a 24-yard touchdown 
pass from Morenz. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing kickoff, TCU's Matt Moore had trouble handling a bouncing ball 
and Taje Allen of Texas recovered at the 21. A pass-interference call set up a 
one-yard touchdown run by Holmes, who also scored on a one-yard run in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas led at halftime, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas lost wide receiver Mike Adams with a knee injury in the third period. 
Trainers said they thought it was a sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 44,821, third-largest in Amon Carter history, attended what could 
be the last TCU-Texas game in the stadium. The Frogs join the Western Athletic 
Conference in 1996 and Texas goes to the Big 12 that season. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Texas A&M 41, Southern Mississippi 17 -- Leeland McElroy highlighted a 
game of big plays with a 100-yard touchdown return of the opening kickoff as 
the Aggies (3-0) won at College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Aggies' 22nd victory in a row at Kyle Field, the nation's longest 
current home winning streak after Washington defeated Miami, 38-20, at the 
Orange Bowl on Saturday, ending the Hurricanes' record run at 58 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M jumped to a 27-10 halftime lead over the Golden Eagles (2-2) behind 
such big plays as McElroy's run, a 57-yard touchdown pass from Corey Pullig to 
Ryan Mathews on a fake end-around and a 61-yard field goal by freshman Kyle 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Mississippi's touchdowns came on a 26-yard touchdown pass, Tommy 
Waters to Fred Brock, and on a five-yard run by Ronald Jones with 8:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies got a scare near the end of the first half when quarterback Corey 
Pullig suffered a twisted right knee and left the game. He returned in the 
third quarter and completed a 40-yard pass to Mathews that set up Thomas' 
second touchdown, a one-yard dive with 2:40 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech 35, Southern Methodist 7 -- Zebbie Lethridge passed for two 
touchdowns and ran for another score to lead the Red Raiders (2-2, 1-0) to an 
SWC victory at Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU (1-3, 0-1) was hampered by injuries, the worst being the pulled hamstring 
that sidelined quarterback Ramon Flanigan in the second quarter. Flanigan, who 
led the SWC with 271 yards of offense per game, accounted for only 47 before 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Lethridge, a redshirt freshman, rushed for 73 yards in his first collegiate 
start and completed 14 of 26 passes for 148 yards.

 East Carolina (1-2) got within 21-18 after Marcus Crandell connected with 
tight end Scott Richards on a fourth-and-10, 20-yard touchdown pass with 5:25 
left and Junior Smith ran for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates got the ball back at their 30 with two minutes left, but at 
midfield Crandell was sacked for a 10-yard loss and a fourth-and-11 pass gained 
only nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College 21, Pittsburgh 9 -- Scott Mutryn, a freshman making his first 
start, passed for a touchdown and set up another in just over two minutes in 
the first half and the Eagles' defense did the rest in a Big East game at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 David Green had 186 yards in 30 carries for Eagles (1-3, 0-1) in their first

Webb scored on two short runs and Brock Harvey hit Marc Ross on a 27-yard 
touchdown pass play as Princeton (1-1) scored on four of its first five 
second-half possessions to record a 29-3 victory over Colgate (1-2) at 
Princeton, N.J. . . . Rich Owens blocked the potential game-winning extra point 
with 12 seconds remaining, spoiling a dramatic bid for victory by Columbia and 
preserving a 28-28 tie for Lehigh (2-0-1) at Bethlehem, Pa. Columbia 
quarterback Jamie Schwalbe had drawn the Lions (0-2) even by completing a 
26-yard touchdown pass to Justin Fossbender on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Warden's 28-yard field goal with four seconds remaining gave Brown (1-1) a 
32-29 victory over Rhode Island at Kingston, R.I. Warden's field goal came 
after Rhode Island (2-2) rallied from a 15-point deficit. . . . Rob Glus passed 
for five touchdowns and Rich Lemon had his seventh consecutive 100-yard game, 
both school records, as Bucknell (2-1) recorded a 42-23 victory over Harvard 
(1-1) at Boston. The defeat spoiled the home debut of Tim Murphy, the 30th 
coach in 121 years for Harvard. . . . Bob Nelson ran for 117 yards, with 64 
coming on a touchdown run, and Yale (2-0) scored its most points in 71 games in 
beating Holy Cross, 47-22, at New Haven, Conn. Yale hadn't been as productive 
on offense since a 47-0 shutout against Columbia in October of 1986. The 
Crusaders fell to 0-3. . . . John Wagner of Cornell recovered a fumble by 
Fordham quarterback John Pohlman on first and goal at the one-yard line with 58 
seconds remaining, allowing the Big Red to hold on for a 13-6 victory at New 
York. Cornell is now 2-0, Fordham 0-4.

Willis scored from of two and 39 yards and Hema Heimuli had scoring runs of 
four and seven yards to go with a 31-yard touchdown reception for BYU (3-1, 
3-1). Edwards improved to 200-74-3 in his 23rd season with BYU. He is the 13th 
Division I-A coach to win 200 games. The loss ruined a school record-setting 
passing performance by New Mexico quarterback Stoney Case, who threw for six 
touchdowns while completing 25 of 43 passes for 375 yards. The Lobos fell to 
0-4, 0-1.

<P>
 BIG WEST 
</P>
<P>
 Marcellus Chrishon ran for 185 yards and Mike Maxwell threw for two touchdowns 
to lead Nevada (3-1) to a 34-22 victory over Northeast Louisiana (0-4) at Reno. 
Maxwell completed 18 of 32 passes for 228 yards with one interception. His 
favorite target, Alex Van Dyke, caught eight passes for 108 yards. Northeast 
Louisiana, which has been defeated by lopsided scores in its first three games 
in Division 1-A this season, closed to 28-22 in the fourth quarter on a 73-yard 
drive with Eric Foster scoring from six yards out.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; KICKOFF RETURN GETS TEXAS A&M GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leeland McElroy highlighted a game of big plays with a 100-yard touchdown 
return of the opening kickoff, leading No. 12 Texas A&M to a 41-17 victory over 
Southern Mississippi Saturday at College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (3-0) won their 22nd straight at Kyle Field, the nation's longest 
current home winning streak after Washington beat Miami, 38-20, at the Orange 
Bowl on Saturday, ending the Hurricanes' record run at 58 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M jumped to a 27-10 halftime lead over the Golden Eagles (2-2) behind 
such big plays as McElroy's run, a 57-yard tuchdown pass from Corey Pullig to 
Ryan Mathews on a fake end-around and a 61-yard field goal by freshman Kyle 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy got it started when he took the opening kickoff and headed straight up 
field, darting right and getting past kicker Chris Pierce to race into the end 
zone. It was his fourth career touchdown on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy helped set up a second-quarter three-yard touchdown run by Rodney 
Thomas with a 47-yard run that went for five more yards when he fumbled and 
teammate Chris Sanders recovered it upfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, who kicked a 30-yard field goal with 3:53 to go in the half, missed a 
56-yarder but got another chance from 61 yards because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Bryant's kick took off low but was dead center and barely eased 
over the crossbar. He's the first Aggie freshman to start his kicking career 
with eight consecutive successful kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's 61-yarder was the second-longest since the NCAA banned the used of 
kicking tees in 1989. Jason Hansen of Washington State had a 62-yarder against 
Nevada Las Vegas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Mississippi tried to match the big-play flavor of the game, but it 
was outmanned from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, subbing for regular kicker Johnny Lomoro, kicked a 30-yard field goal, 
the first of his career, in the first quarter and Tommy Waters threw a 26-yard 
touchdown pass to wide receiver Fred Brock in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock made a diving one-handed catch in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Jones scored Southern Mississippi's final points on a five-yard run 
with 8:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies got a scare near the end of the first half when quarterback Corey 
Pullig twisted his right knee and left the game. He returned in the third 
quarter and completed a 40-yard pass to Mathews that set up Thomas' second 
touchdown, a one-yard dive with 2:40 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy added his second score on a three-yard run with 14:25 left in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas finished with 90 yards in 23 carries. McElroy had two kickoff returns 
for 121 yards and rushed for 85 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech 35, Southern Methodist 7 -- Zebbie Lethridge passed for two 
touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Red Raiders (2-2, 1-0) to a SWC 
victory at Lubbock, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 SMU (1-3, 0-1) was hampered by injuries, the worst being the pulled hamstring 
that sidelined quarterback Ramon Flanigan in the second quarter. Flanigan, who 
led the SWC with 271 yards of a offense per game, accounted for just 47 before 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Lethridge, a redshirt freshman, rushed for 73 yards in his first collegiate 
start and completed 14 of 26 passes for 148 yards.

IT'S EARLY, BUT THINGS ARE GETTING SCARY FOR BRUINS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COOK, 
UCLA DRAW BOOS FROM ROSE BOWL CROWD DURING EMBARRASSING LOSS TO WASHINGTON 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, that wasn't "Coooop," or "Loooou" or "Moooose" that they were shouting at 
the UCLA football team Saturday afternoon at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, those were boos, all right, and they were directed at Wayne Cook and the 
Bruins. It's pretty obvious this isn't really what you want to hear when you 
play your Pacific 10 Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're not talking the Halloween kind of boos, either, you understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, maybe we are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins sure looked like ghosts of their former selves, the team that 
defeated Tennessee right here on this very same Rose Bowl grass only three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA team that is supposed to beat Arizona and USC and Cal lost to 
Washington State, 21-0, and got booed doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook got booed the most, and Coach Terry Donahue removed him from the fourth 
quarter to save him further embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook was blunt in his assessment of his play: "I stunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacked seven times, it wasn't all Cook's fault. Afterward, Cook said Donahue 
told the players it is important to stick together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said it's not time to start pointing fingers," Cook said. "The offense 
can't say the defense isn't playing good and the defense can't say the offense 
isn't playing good." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes they can. But they probably won't, in the interest of team unity, you 
understand. And remember, just because the Bruins lost their conference opener, 
it's not the end of the world for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, this is the fourth consecutive year that UCLA has dropped its 
Pac-10 opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is?" linebacker Donnie Edwards said. "We just put rocks on ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a heavy burden, to be sure. There must be some explanation for this to 
keep happening. 
</P>
<P>
 These reasons probably are as good as any. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- The players don't realize it's the Pac-10 opener. They think they're 
playing San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- They don't play well against teams in red. Washington State wears red, 
just like Nebraska (you haven't forgotten that game, have you?) 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- They have come to realize that the Rose Bowl actually is for soccer, not 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Troy Aikman graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- They get too distracted wondering why Chancellor Charles Young always is 
standing there on the sidelines, right behind Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- They enjoy the challenge of trying to come from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- There is secret competition among the players to be the first to cause 
ulcers among the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Donahue is undercoaching. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Donahue is overcoaching. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- They're just trying their darndest to avoid another Rose Bowl ticket 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Edwards described the Bruins' plight in graphic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nebraska and now this one, a couple of butt-kickings," he said. "Actually, 
Nebraska was a butt-kicking, this probably falls just short of a butt-kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does UCLA have to do now? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to face up to adversity and give it a butt-kicking," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably a good idea not to walk in front of Donnie Edwards today. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said Washington State, which beat UCLA by 21 points, has a more 
physical defensive team than Nebraska, which beat UCLA by 28 points. This may 
be of small consolation to the Bruins, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Next weekend, the Bruins will be in Seattle, where they must play the 
Washington Huskies, and all they did Saturday was end Miami's 58-game home 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, UCLA plays at California and after that . . . well, better not 
look too far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue was reminded that even though UCLA lost its Pac-10 opener last year, 
the Bruins still got to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a long way from the Rose Bowl," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time, we have to try to become a decent football team, which 
we are having a hard time doing."

 Kevin Kelley retained his World Boxing Council featherweight title Saturday 
with a second-round knockout of Jose Vida Ramos in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley, who boxed cautiously in the opening round, floored Ramos with a left 
cross and right hook midway through the second. After Ramos got up, Kelley 
dropped him again with a leaping left cross. Referee Tony Perez halted the 
scheduled 12-round bout at 1:58 of the second and did not issue a count when 
Ramos went down a second time. 
</P>

 Kelley, 27, of Flushing, N.Y., is 40-0 with 28 knockouts. Ramos, 27, of the

GOLF ROUNDUP; PERRY BIRDIES LAST HOLE TO CATCH MCCUMBER

<P>
 Kenny Perry made a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole Saturday for a share 
of the third-round lead with Mark McCumber in the rain-soaked Hardees Classic 
in Coal Valley, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and McCumber shot five-under-par 65s for 12-under 198 totals. Curt Byrum 
was a stroke back after a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 First-day leader Robert Wrenn was tied for the lead going into the 18th hole 
but had a double bogey after hitting his tee shot off the fairway and following 
with a poor pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrenn's disappointing finish and a 67 left him at 10 under, tied with Mike 
Donald at two shots back. Donald shot a 64. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the round was delayed 3 hours 12 minutes by heavy rain. Split 
tees and threesomes were used to speed up play at waterlogged Oakwood Country 
Club, which has been hit by bad weather since the tournament started Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The low round Saturday went to Michael Bradley, who had an eight-under 62 to 
move within three shots of the lead. His round was one shot off the tournament 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-round leader Neal Lancaster, without a bogey in the first two rounds, 
finally made one on the eighth hole. He had another at 14 and fell three shots 
off the pace. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Larry Gilbert birdied six holes in a row on the back nine to tie Jim Dent for 
the second-round lead of the Brickyard Crossing Golf Championship in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Both shot seven-under 65s, tying the course record in the senior PGA event. 
</P>
<P>
 Five players -- Tom Wargo, Simon Hobday, Mike Hill, Graham Marsh and Isao Aoki 
-- are a stroke back at 66. 
</P>
<P>
 J.C. Snead is the only player at 67. Six players shot 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's first round was washed out by rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's play was played under "winter rules," with players allowed to lift 
and clean balls in fairway lies, contributing to the low scores.

 Tabasco Cat set a slow pace on a muddy track and scored a two-length victory 
in the inaugural $400,000 Kentucky Cup Classic on Saturday at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth Of It All pressed the pace for six furlongs, putting a head in front of 
Tabasco Cat on the second turn. As Tabasco Cat regained the lead, Mighty Avanti 
surged by on the outside at the quarter pole, and Pat Day went to the whip on 
Tabasco Cat, who pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Avanti was second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of Best Pal. The race was run 
in a slow 1:50 1/5 for 1 1/8 miles, compared with Hansel's track record of 1:46 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat paid $4.60, $4 and $2.40. Mighty Avanti returned $13.40 and $4 and 
Best Pal paid $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal's third-place winnings of $32,000 were enough to put him over $5 
million, making the all-time California-bred leader only the third thoroughbred 
to reach that level. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas will send Tabasco Cat to the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 
8 at Belmont and the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs in an effort to 
upstage Holy Bull for horse of the year. Holy Bull's season ended last week 
with a victory in the Woodward Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Cup was the feature of Turfway's first Kentucky Cup Day of 
Champions. Two graded stakes were part of program. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennyhill Park, trained by Roger Attfield, won the $200,000 Turfway Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup and returned $14.60, $4.40 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejano Run, trained by Kenneth McPeek, won the $100,000 Kentucky Cup Juvenile 
by three lengths over Gold Miner. The winner paid $8.80, $4.20 and $3.40. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlia's Dreamer led all of the way in scoring a 13-length victory in the 
$200,000 Flower Bowl Invitational on turf at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlia's Dreamer covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:05 1/5 over the soft inner 
course. Dahlia's Dreamer returned $27.40, $13.40 and $10.40. Alywow paid $8.20 
and $6.60 and Danish returned $14.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off two narrow defeats at Belmont, the 5-year-old mare earned $120,000 
for owner Madeleine Paulson.

</P>
<P>
 Shining Light won the $150,000 Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes over a 
sloppy track at Arlington International race course. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Juvenal L. Diaz in the one-mile race for 2-year-old fillies, Shining 
Light won by a neck in a very slow 1:41 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Alltheway Bertie, the even money favorite who was unbeaten in four starts, 
including three stakes, finished a dismal third, 18 1/2 lengths behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Shining Light paid $13.40, $5.40 and $2.80. She's A Lively One returned $6.20 
and $3. Alltheway Bertie paid $2.20. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Arlington will close its graded stakes program today with the renewal of the 
$200,000 Futurity, a Grade II race for 2-year-olds at one mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland-based Mr Purple is unbeaten in two races, including the Hollywood 
Juvenile Championship, and is the morning-line favorite. Locally based 
Evansville Slew is undefeated in three starts.

FAIRPLEX; DERBY TRIAL COMES UP ALL ROSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Fernando Valenzuela never believed he would be singing the praises of A 
Treek For Roses, a 3-year-old who ran in a $16,000 claimer as recently as last 
summer at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valenzuela turned into a believer Saturday at Fairplex Park, where he rode 
the son of Mogambo to a two-length victory over Sir Cutter Slew in the $50,000 
Derby Trial Stakes, a 1 1/16-mile race for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (trainer Vladimir Cerin) kept telling me this horse would win a stakes 
some day, but I didn't believe him," Valenzuela said. "But now, I think he 
could become better than Boyo." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyo was the horse Valenzuela rode to victory in this race a year ago, then 
came back and finished second to I Like To Win in the Pomona Derby a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although A Treek For Roses broke his maiden in a $32,000 claimer, Cerin 
pointed out that he had raced against some good horses such as Soul Of The 
Matter, Valiant Nature and Wekiva Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't competitive, but he was in there," Cerin said. "If he comes out of 
this race well, we'll give Flying Sensation a shot in the (Pomona) Derby. His 
last two races were on turf, and horses who have been running on grass have 
been running well here." 
</P>
<P>
 The only horse that Cerin was worried about was Sir Cutter Slew, so he told 
Valenzuela to settle in behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly how Valenzuela rode him, which put him in position to make his 
move at the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Creston, the second choice in the five-horse race, finished third, another 
three lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
 R Magic Moment, ridden by Joe Badilla, was the wire-to-wire winner of the 
$15,000 Classy Lassy Stakes for fillies and mares, 3-years-old and up. The 
winning time for the four-furlong Appaloosa race was 46 3/5 seconds. J.J. 
Precious finished second, two lengths back and New Recruit was third. . . . 
Prospect For Four, who was unbeaten in four races at Fairplex Park until his 
second-place finish to Nancys French Fry in the Phil D. Shepherd Stakes last 
Saturday, has been retired because of a broken sesmoid in his left front leg, 
according to trainer Caesar Dominguez. The 5-year-old gelded son of Native 
Prospector won eight races in 31 starts and earned $360,095. 
</P>
<P>
 TC Tomtyr, who has won three races in a row, is the even-money morning line 
favorite in today's $7,500 Pomona Arabian Invitational Handicap. . . . Trainer 
Roger Stein says that Southern Truce, the 4-5 favorite who finished second in 
the E.B. Johnston Stakes, came out of the race in good shape and will probably 
run in the $100,000 Las Madrinas Handicap on Friday. . . . The next race for 
Diane's Halo, winner of Friday's CTBA Marian Stakes, will be in the Linda Vista 
Breeders' Cup Handicap during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita on Nov. 2 
before she goes to Keeneland for the Princess Elizabeth Stakes, according to 
trainer David Cross.

LEETCH'S TWO GOALS POWER RANGERS PAST KINGS, 6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Leetch scored two goals Saturday night, leading the New York Rangers to 
a 6-1 exhibition victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top players from both teams were not in the lineup.Among those who 
missed the game for the Kings were Wayne Gretzky, Rick Tocchet, Pat Conacher, 
Jari Kurri, Tony Granato and Marty McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the Rangers' lineup were Mark Messier, who's involved in a contract 
dispute; Sergei Nemchinov, Sergei Zubov and Kevin Lowe. The crowd of 8,851 
booed loudly as each of the scratches was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Leetch scored at 18:11 of the first period to tie the score, 1-1, then gave 
the Rangers the lead when he beat goalie Kelly Hrudey on a rebound at 8:59 of 
the second period. He also assisted on Petr Nedved's third-period power-play 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gilbert extended New York's lead with a goal at 17:52 of the second 
period. Nick Kypreos put the Rangers ahead, 4-1, when he redirected Darren 
Langdon's shot past Jamie Storr at 5:26 of the third period. Ed Olczyk capped 
the scoring with a power-play goal at 14:25. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Brown scored the Kings' goal at 5:03 of the first period.

TENNIS / JULIE CART; ABSENT COURIER SOUND OF BODY, BUT HIS MIND LETS HIM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem is one of too little time off. U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom 
Gullikson was saying that's what is keeping top tennis players off the court. 
And potential Davis Cup players out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion grew out of a simple question: Where was Jim Courier? Courier 
is one top American player who always is ready to play Davis Cup, who always 
makes room in his schedule to represent his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson's point was interesting -- Courier has been betrayed by his body. 
Because Courier is big and strong and fit, he's rarely injured. That means he 
never takes time off the tour. That means he's physically fit but mentally a 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these guys take time off when their body cries out, 'Help me, I need 
it,' " Gullikson said. "That's how they end up taking time off. These guys 
don't schedule rest into their schedule. They are either playing tournaments or 
exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Courier helped the United States pull out the Davis Cup quarterfinal against 
the Netherlands, but Gullikson understood when Courier declined an offer to 
play in this week's semifinal against Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little burned out right now," Gullikson said. "He needs some time to 
rest and recharge his batteries. Jim's done a great job this year with Davis 
Cup. He got the winning point against Holland. He just needed some time off. 
Jim's a very intense player, and to play well he needs to be focused and 
energetic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Martin is not injured. He merely looks that way. He takes the court with 
most major joints encased in blue neoprene. His knee looks like a sausage and 
there are untold yards of wrapping under his shorts to deal with a groin 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Collins of the Boston Globe remarked that Martin looked like an extra from 
the cast of "The Mummy's Curse," but Martin called the gear precautionary . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just bumps and bruises I have to take care of," Martin said. "I'm 
certainly not in 100% tip-top shape. But as long as the stuff doesn't bother me 
on the court, and it might prevent something, I'm going to wear it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was not among those surprised to learn that Russia's Davis Cup team had 
gone 2-0 against the Germans on the first day of that semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis people have always known that the Russians are dangerous," Martin 
said. "(Yevgeny) Kafelnikov is probably one of the best young players coming 
up. It's just a matter of time before he gets into the top 10. The thing about 
the Russians is that they go after every shot. That makes them dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Their doubles victory on Saturday gave the Russians an insurmountable lead and 
means they will play the winner of today's Sweden-U.S. semifinal. If the U.S. 
team wins, the final will be played in the United States, with indoor arenas in 
four cites as possible sites: Detroit, Kansas City, Cincinnati and Phoenix. 
Detroit is the expected venue. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A small women's tournament in Zurich this week will be full of symbolism when 
three of the game's hottest topics converge. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio: Martina Navratilova, making her last swing through Europe before 
retirement at the end of the year; Jennifer Capriati, returning to the circuit 
after her arrest on drug charges and a subsequent brief stay at a drug rehab 
center; Martina Hingis, who will be making her professional debut a few days 
after turning 14. 
</P>
<P>
 There are cautionary tales aplenty in the scenario, if only the establishment 
of women's tennis would chose to notice. Navratilova's retirement will leave 
the game with a bigger personality gap than most insiders care to admit.  
</P>
<P>
 The state of things: Monica Seles still is absent from the tour and some doubt 
she will ever return, Steffi Graf is growing more moody and introspective -- 
and is now injured; Arantxa Sanchez Vicario won the U.S. Open but has failed to 
make a discernible imprint on worldwide tennis psyches, Mary Pierce is tinged 
with controversy that manages to push aside the game and gain the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's contribution to the game will be fully realized only when she 
retires. Any female tennis players who lift weights or pay attention to their 
fitness can thank Navratilova. They will have longer careers because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Any young player who chooses to have a voice in how the game is managed (are 
there any?) is following Navratilova's lead. Any player who gives any 
indication that she's having fun on a tennis court (again, who?) knows what 
Navratilova knows -- fans enjoy watching people who give evidence they are 
doing something they enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's name might have been inserted in the preceding paragraph had she 
not been sent off to work as the family breadwinner at a time when she should 
have been making bulk purchases of Clearasil. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who remark that Capriati's tangle with drugs is a normal part of growing 
up don't hear themselves. There is nothing normal about the way Capriati grew 
up -- indeed, it can be argued that she has not grown up at all. When normal 
teen-agers enter drug rehab, they admit their problem and, if they are very 
lucky, begin to think about going back to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati checked in long enough to realize this was going to be tougher than 
anything she had ever faced on the court. Viewed from the inside of a rehab 
center, the pressure and demands of the professional tennis tour look pretty 
appealing. So, at 18, Capriati is throwing herself back into it, with the 
safety net of a family that desperately depends on her for its next gourmet 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hingis is an engaging young Czech prodigy who, thanks to the greed of the WTA 
Tour, is allowed to play professionally. With example after example of burnout 
and stress-related retirements, the tour this summer addressed the issue of age 
eligibility. It was a confusing interlude. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing rules allow a 14-year-old to turn pro and limit the player to 12 
appearances in her first year. The Women's Tennis Council -- which governs the 
game -- commissioned a study of the question. The opinion was emphatic -- 97% 
of those polled responded that 14 is too young. 
</P>
<P>
 What did the WTC decide? It agreed that 14 is too young, but won't implement 
new rules barring 14-year-olds until the 1996 season. What about the 13- and 
14-year-olds in the pipeline now? Isn't the WTC saying it's awful for them to 
play professionally, then sanctioning it?

RUSSIA'S VICTORY IN DOUBLES CLINCHES FIRST BERTH IN FINAL

<P>
 Russia reached the Davis Cup final for the first time when Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
and Andrei Olhovskiy won Saturday's doubles to give their team an unbeatable 
3-0 lead over defending champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians defeated the team of Michael Stich and Karsten Braasch, 6-4, 7-6 
(7-1), 3-6, 6-7 (7-3), 10-8, ending the hopes of three-time champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafelnikov and Olhovskiy wasted a match point in the fourth set and saved 
three in the fifth before winning in 3 hours 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia had not advanced past the first round of the Davis Cup since it joined 
the 94-year-old competition in 1962, then as the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany lost at home for the first time since a 3-2 defeat by Sweden in the 
1985 final. 
</P>
<P>
 In December's final, Russia will meet the winner of the other semifinal 
between the United States and Sweden. The United States leads that match, 2-1, 
after Sweden won Saturday's doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can even win the cup," Russian captain Vadim Borisov said.

CHAPMAN COOKS AT HOME, 31-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chapman football team took care of one of its last major milestones -- its 
first home game in 62 years -- easily defeating Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 34-14, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 4,194 jammed into a stadium that was thought to hold 2,500 and 
watched the Panthers dominate Claremont. It was an enthusiastic gathering. 
Chapman fans cheered everything from pregame calisthenics to the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Between, they were treated to some fine running by Chapman's Darnell Morgan 
and plenty of outstanding Panther defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chapman starting quarterback Curtis Robinson on the sideline because of a 
separated shoulder, local favorite Todd Gragnano got the start. Gragnano's last 
start was for Los Alamitos High in the 1989 Southern Section playoffs, so the 
game plan was to keep it mostly on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan took care of that part, rushing for 200 yards and two touchdowns in 31 
carries. His final touchdown with 11 minutes 44 seconds left to play gave the 
Panthers (2-0) their final margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano had a few shaky moments. His first pass was intercepted, in one 
series he mishandled the snap on consecutive plays and on another his fumble 
was recovered by Claremont. Gragnano, who received a scholarship at Nebraska 
and saw some mop-up action for the Huskers in 1991, completed only six of 16 
passes for 63 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chapman Coach Ken Visser was satisfied with Gragnano's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was proud of Todd Gragnano today because that man hasn't really played for 
three years," Visser said. "All week he knew that our game plan was to run and 
he came in and did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano was helped early by his defense and special teams. Linebacker Michael 
Simmons intercepted a pass by John Shipp on Claremont's first drive, leading to 
a 20-yard field goal by Bill Hamlin. On the kickoff, Eric Huerta stripped Chris 
Rattay and Cody Verdugo picked up the fumble and ran 18 yards for a 10-0 
Chapman lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, who passed for a Division III-high 377 yards last week in a loss to Cal 
Lutheran, cut the lead to 10-7 with a 78-yard touchdown pass to Burnell Roques. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' Darnell Rubin returned the kickoff 52 yards and Gragnano handed 
the ball off once to Aaron Meschuk and four times to Morgan on the 38-yard 
drive. Morgan finished it off with an 11-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 17-7 with 4:26 left in the first quarter, and from there with one 
exception, Chapman's defense shut down the Stags (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, who passed for 289 yards, completed a 38-yard touchdown pass to Michael 
Cook as time expired in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Panther defense was harassing him at every turn, physically and 
orally. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman sacked him 10 times, eight in the first half, and never gave him much 
time to find his receivers. Defensive lineman James Grove got to him three 
times and wasn't shy about letting the Claremont quarterback know it. Toney 
Eggleston also had three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was sacking Shipp, I kept telling him that his ship was sunk," Grove 
said. "He was getting mad and saying some things I don't think you want to 
print." 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, a senior who played at Golden West College and Westminster High, 
completed 14 of 33 passes but never was in sync after the half. Much of that 
was because of the Panther defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's great about our offensive line is they keep coming and 
coming -- they have great tenacity," Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Panthers kept a wary eye on Shipp, who completed 11 passes for 
179 yards to Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, I'm glad we don't have to play that guy anymore," Visser said.

 Ferrari's Gerhard Berger of Austria claimed the pole for today's Portuguese 
Grand Prix in Estoril after a determined effort by Damon Hill of Great Britain 
fell just short Saturday. 
</P>

 Hill, needing a victory today to close to within a point of suspended Formula 
One leader Michael Schumacher of Germany, drove his Williams-Renault to a speed 
of 121.462 m.p.h. But his clocking of 1 minute 20.766 seconds at the 2.725-mile 
Fernando Pires da Silva circuit was 1.58 seconds slower than that of the 
Austrian, who averaged 121.700 m.p.h. in preliminary qualifying 24 hours 
earlier.

 Starting third Sunday will be Hill's teammate and fellow Briton David 
Coulthard. Fourth on the grid will be the McLaren-Peugeot of Finn Mika

 With their regular-season opener in doubt, the Mighty Ducks play their final 
exhibition game at 5 p.m. today against the Pittsburgh Penguins at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, 2-3-2 in exhibitions, are scheduled to play Saturday at Dallas, but 
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman says the season will not start until a new 
collective-bargaining agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a concern right now for all the players," center Stephan Lebeau said. 
"We know it's going to be difficult to reach an agreement by Oct. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson said he is able to put the situation out of his mind during 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly I'm not standing on the bench thinking about what Gary Bettman said 
or what Bob Goodenow (NHL Players Assn. executive director) said in response," 
he said. "I dwell on that during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille, whom Pittsburgh obtained from the Kings this summer, did not 
play against his former team Friday because of a tender ankle, but might return 
to the ice today. ROBYN NORWOOD

WESTERN STOPS RANCHO ALAMITOS; FOOTBALL: PIONEERS SHUT DOWN VAQUEROS, WHO WERE 
AVERAGING 30 POINTS PER GAME, 10-0. 
</P>

<P>
 The last thing Western Coach Jim Howell said he expected from his team was a 
shutout in Saturday night's nonleague game against Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos came in averaging 30 points per game, but the Pioneers' 
defense silenced the Vaqueros with a 10-0 victory at Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Western (3-0) gave up 221 yards to Rancho Alamitos, but never allowed the 
Vaqueros inside its 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to shut them out, but I'll take it," Howell said. "They ran 
the ball on us, but our defense is like that old adage -- we bend, but we 
wouldn't break." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing fancy about Western's offense, which was led by running back 
Matt Frembling. Frembling, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound senior, rushed 15 times for 87 
yards, including 59 yards in the first half. David Bell kicked a 45-yard field 
goal on Western's first possession, and it held for a 3-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams played a scoreless third quarter, then Western's Justin Starkey took 
over in the fourth. On the second play of the quarter, he caught a pass from 
quarterback Dean Chambers at midfield, bounced off two tacklers and ran the 
rest of the way for a 60-yard touchdown and a 10-0 lead with 10 minutes 23 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos (2-1) drove to Western's 43 on its next possession, but 
Starkey intercepted a Kevin Frank pass and returned it to the Vaqueros' 49, 
sealing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Young led Rancho Alamitos with 91 yards in 20 carries. Kevin Allen, who 
scored four touchdowns in his first two games, added 83 in 15 carries, all in 
the second half. Vaquero quarterback Kevin Frank, who injured his right ankle 
in the third quarter, completed four of 12 passes for 47 yards and threw one 
interception.

ROUNDUP; CORONA DEL MAR WINS TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Corona del Mar's cast of characters played their roles to perfection as the 
Sea King water polo team edged Long Beach Wilson, 10-9, in the finals of the 
South Coast tournament on Saturday at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thad Buzolich and Adam McFarland used their strong defensive skills to stop 
Wilson's interior offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Hueston fed one teammate after another with accurate, intelligent passes 
and James Palda made the big plays when the Sea Kings needed a shot in the arm 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was goalkeeper Doug Jetton who really stood out, holding the 
high-powered Wilson offense to two goals in the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great goalkeeper, one of the top goalkeepers in CIF," Coach John 
Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson jumped to a 3-1 lead with 2 minutes 31 seconds left in the first 
quarter, but was virtually silenced until a late run put pressure on the Sea 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hueston opened the fourth quarter with a penalty-shot goal to give 
Corona del Mar a 9-5 lead, Wilson cut the lead to 9-7 with 2:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Palda made the first of two important plays, freeing himself in 
close and beating goalkeeper Nick Hill for a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Cochran then took a feed from Adam Wright and cut the Sea Kings' lead to 
two and when Cochran forced a steal on the other end, it appeared as if Wilson 
had regained its momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Palda stole the ball back with a minute left and the Sea Kings held 
on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Palda led Corona del Mar with three goals and Kevin Tucker and Buzolich scored 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, which took over the top spot in Division I after the Sea Kings lost to 
Foothill in its season-opener nine days ago, only got one goal from Wright as 
he was effectively defended in the three-meter position. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games: 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 10, Esperanza 8 -- James Comfort, Robert Grayeli and Steve Popov 
each scored three goals and Justin Taylor had 18 saves for Costa Mesa (6-3) in 
the consolation round. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 10, Marina 8 -- Mike Stanley scored four goals and Jason Mericle and 
John Zinn each added two to lead Esperanza (5-4) in the consolation round. Erik 
Larson returned from the hospital after being poked in the eye in an earlier 
game, and scored four goals for Marina (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship of the Rowland Heights Rowland tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 La Serna 9, Brea Olinda 7 -- La Serna (9-1), the top-ranked team in Division 
III, defeated Brea-Olinda (7-1) in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats were led by the strong play of Tim Bischel, who had 14 saves and 
a total of 31 in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinal, Eric Matthews and Tad Murphy each scored three goals as 
Brea-Olinda (7-0) defeated Rowland Heights Rowland, 9-6.

FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; FULLERTON MAKES MISTAKES, BUT BEATS MAGNOLIA 
</P>

<P>
 Fullerton, plagued by 10 penalties and four turnovers, held off a late 
Magnolia rally and defeated the Sentinels, 14-12, in a nonleague game Saturday 
at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Young, Fullerton's 165-pound running back, rushed for 109 yards in 
20 carries, including a second-quarter touchdown run that gave the Indians the 
lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Fullerton (2-1) survived three turnovers and five 
penalties, one of which negated a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by 
Young.  
</P>
<P>
 After the touchdown was called back, the ball was placed at the Fullerton 
41-yard line, where the Indians fumbled on their next play. When Magnolia took 
possession after the fumble, a Robert Nicols pass was intercepted by Rudy 
Vejar, but the play was negated on a roughing-the-passer penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicols, who completed 16 of 35 passes for 265 yards, found wide receiver John 
Redding on a nine-yard scoring pass for the quarter's only score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, however, responded with an 11-play, 72-yard drive that consumed 
nearly five minutes of the second quarter. Young capped the drive with a 
10-yard touchdown to give the Indians a 7-6 lead. COREY LYONS

CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; EL TORO GIRLS CONTINUE TO PROVE THERE'S STRENGTH IN 
THEIR NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive week, the El Toro girls' cross-country team used 
depth to outlast the competition, stealing the show Saturday at the Dana Hills 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, ranked second in the county, edged top-ranked Irvine, 63-73, to 
win the Division I junior/senior girls' race on the Dana Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Vaquero runners finished among the top four. Jessica Corbin (18 minutes 
12 seconds), Anna Kaisa-Niemi (18:16) and Erin Livermore (18:22) cruised to a 
1-2-4 finish, with only Ocean View senior Taryn Lawson (18:18) breaking up the 
trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Roberson led the Chargers, whose team leader, Briana Frigo, skipped the 
race to rest sore shins. Roberson was El Toro's top finisher, running 18:29 for 
fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 What separated the two was the Chargers' ability to place each of its next 
five runners among the top 20. Only five Vaqueros finished among the race's top 
49. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran easy on Thursday (a 20-43 Sea View League victory over Newport Harbor) 
because we knew this was a big meet," Charger Coach Diane Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've got a gigantic race this Thursday (when the Chargers duel Irvine)." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's time was the fastest of the Division I competition, with Santa Ana 
Valley's Eliaser Estrada posting the fastest overall time of the afternoon in 
17:49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that I wasn't even going to run because my knee has been hurting," 
Estrada said. "But once I started running, it was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar emerged victorious in the Division III girls' race, led by 
senior Tracy Clark, who ran away from the competition to win in 17:54. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most exciting individual battle came early in the meet, when 
Capistrano Valley senior Adalberto Sanchez held a slight lead over Vista's 
Trevor Sybert entering the race's final 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez lost the lead down the backstretch of the track facility, where the 
race concluded, then regained on the final turn, 120 meters from the finish. 
But for the 5-foot-2 Sanchez it was not to be, as the taller San Diegan 
outdueled him to the finish line. Both finished in 14:37, the fastest time of 
the day for the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor edged Santa Ana Valley, 75-89, to win the Division II boys' 
team title. Joel Orozco (15:10) finished second for the Falcons. Newport 
Harbor's Shahram DeZahd (15:18) finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sonora Invitational: 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove, led by Mike Balderas, who was first in a time of 15:18, finished 
in the top spot in the Division I boys' race. Buena Park's Jarrod Garritson 
finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's Ryan Emanaker finished second (14:54) and Amos Zach was third 
(14:55) to lead the Vanguards to first place in the Division II boys' race. 
Anaheim finished second and Troy finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's Remigio Garcia took first (15:04) in the Division II-A boys' race, 
helping the Knights to a second-place finish behind Covina Northview. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Nelson's third-place finish (19:54) helped Garden Grove take first in the 
Division I girls' race. Heather Garritson took first place (17:39), leading 
Buena Park to a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena, led by Jessica Dahlberg's run of 18:13 and Tara Whitfield's 18:14, 
captured first in the Division II girls' race. Troy's Elizabeth Sinclair 
finished first (18:03), leading the Warriors to a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division II-A girls' race, Fullerton, led by Melissa Mendoza's run 
(20:00), won the team competition. Sonora was second.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN; EMOTIONAL WAVE HITS HUENEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emotions are running high at the Cobbs-Jenkins household in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Jenkins rushed for a Hueneme High-record 356 yards Friday night, 
leading the resurgent Vikings past Camarillo, 47-29. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family's joy in that performance is tinged with melancholy. James 
Jenkins, Ronnie's brother, is leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he departs for Great Lakes, Ill., and Navy boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy for Ronnie," said Jean Cobbs, the grandmother who has raised both 
boys in a family of five. "At the same time, though, it's hard to let James 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie's break-out against Camarillo, which included touchdown runs of 90, 65 
and 48 yards, could not have come at a better time. He dedicated the game to 
his brother, who endured the last four seasons as a Hueneme football player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings won two games during James' career, a total Hueneme already has 
matched this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Jenkins scorched Camarillo for 294 yards in the first half alone as his 
family watched from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the men sitting by us asked me, 'How did Ronnie learn to run like 
that?' " Jean Cobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tongue-in-cheek reply: "Ronnie's been ducking from his grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blast from the past: Hueneme's Larry Miller is a rookie head coach, but he is 
no stranger to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was Channel League player of the year in 1969 when, as a running back, 
he helped carry the Vikings to an undefeated regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, this year's motto: Hueneme football -- the pride is back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings boasted a topnotch football program from Miller's playing days 
through the early 1980s, but Hueneme has rarely enjoyed a winning season since. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has surrounded himself with coaches from the school's glory years. 
Assistants Joe Davis and Steve Henry are Hueneme graduates from the '70s. In 
all, 13 of the 20 coaches in the program played football for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all have Hueneme in their hearts," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leader of the pack: Jenkins' rushing total is the highest of any player in the 
region this season, four yards better than the total Di-Onte Smith of Grant 
established last week against Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins can only hope for a better follow-up than Smith had. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was held to 36 yards in 13 carries in a 16-0 loss to Hoover, a team that 
had lost its previous 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever works: So Hart wins a game with defense and ball-control. What's next 
-- Buddy Ryan bribing players with ice cream and jelly beans? 
</P>
<P>
 At Hart, slowing down long enough to form a huddle is considered ball control. 
No wonder Dean Herrington, the Indians' offensive coordinator, was pacing the 
sidelines during the game against Westlake as if his earphones were strapped 
several notches too tight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart threw 10 passes in a 20-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dean was going through withdrawal," quipped his brother Mike, Hart's head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He was kidding, of course. Wasn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anything but left out: When the Herrington brothers say Ted Iacenda can "do it 
all" they're not exaggerating by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's junior tailback gained 115 yards and scored two touchdowns in 29 
carries. And if Westlake didn't get enough of him on offense, he played 
defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda doesn't usually play defense, but against high-powered Westlake he was 
inserted at end. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays everywhere except for defensive tackle," Mike Herrington said. "He's 
a great athlete, and we're going to play him on defense whenever we need him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those cardiac kids: Littlerock football games are not for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos (1-0-2) have taken each game to the finish. Littlerock preserved a 
14-14 tie with Serrano by recovering a goal-line fumble with three seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos beat Oxnard, 12-10, when Bruce Johnson hit Hoa Le with a 17-yard 
desperation pass with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Littlerock spotted Barstow four touchdowns, then roared back 
for a 28-28 tie that Mike Kieffer preserved with a sack on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dose of perspective: Buena Coach Rick Scott took no special pleasure in ending 
Newbury Park's 16-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a former Newbury Park assistant, said he is close with Panther Coach 
George Hurley and several members of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Scott pointed out, "Keith Smith and Leodes (Van Buren) put that 
streak together. Keith wasn't here tonight -- thank goodness."

CSUN SERVES UP BLUE-PLATE SPECIAL; TRAVIS HALL: TIGHT END REGAINS HIS POSITION 
AND LEADS TEAM IN RECEPTIONS AND YARDAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travis Hall is shocked, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at around this time, he was summarily yanked from the Cal State 
Northridge lineup. Even worse, the team basically eliminated his position, 
tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about absorbing a body blow. He was erased without a trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Has it only been 12 months? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected this," said Hall, a junior from Chaminade High. "It's a 
great feeling to know they have confidence in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, they were holding their breath when I was in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches still hold their breath. But now it's the staff on the other sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall continued what has become a storybook start with seven more receptions 
for 95 yards in Saturday night's 28-23 loss to Southwest Texas State. 
</P>
<P>
 This from a guy who was being converted to safety two months ago. Now the team 
can't get him the ball often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Southwest Texas, he caught passes four times on third-and-a-mile and 
rolled up sufficient first-down yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 He is too fast for linebackers to cover, a fact that seems to have escaped the 
notice of defensive coordinators at Boise State, UC Davis and Southwest Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good tight end with great speed," Northridge Coach Bob Burt said. "It 
makes sense to get him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall leads the pass-happy Matadors in receptions (18) and receiving yardage 
(246). 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy who last year was asked if playing safety might be a 
more-realistic way of cracking the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hall (6-foot-2, 220 pounds) was playing at 200 pounds and was 
getting pushed around by defensive linemen who outweighed him by as much as 100 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He added some bulk as he prepared to switch to safety. A broken finger over 
the summer essentially ended the defensive experiment because Hall wasn't 
getting enough practice time. 
</P>
<P>
 So Burt asked him if he wanted to try his hand at tight end. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come back," Hall said. "I was yanked halfway through last season, 
and they had every right to do it. I wasn't doing the job. But it hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 At Chaminade High, he was a quarterback. Northridge recruited him as a safety. 
Ever since the only constant has been his state of flux, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to find a position," Hall said. "I wish it hadn't taken so long."

BAKERSFIELD PASSES ITS HISTORY TEST; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: STEVE WOFFORD RUSHES 
FOR 165 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS DRILLERS FOIL ANTELOPE VALLEY'S BID FOR 
AN UPSET, 35-13.

<P>
 Over the years, Antelope Valley High has been able to play the spoiler's role. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Antelopes upset touted Bishop Amat in the playoffs. Antelope 
Valley also ended Canyon High's record 46-game winning streak in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's game against Bakersfield, the No. 3-ranked team in the state 
by Cal-Hi Sports, was an opportunity to add another impressive victory to the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 But All-American running back Steve Wofford would have none of that. Wofford 
rushed for 165 yards in 26 carries and three touchdowns, leading Bakersfield to 
a 35-13 nonleague victory over the Antelopes -- ranked No. 16 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford capped Bakersfield's opening drive by scoring on a one-yard run, 
snapping Antelope Valley's string of shutouts at two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wofford is an excellent player and he's everything they say he is," Antelope 
Valley Coach Brent Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wofford, the Central Section's all-time leading rusher, would add touchdown 
runs of 13 and 21 yards before the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley was on the verge of being blown out until its defense forced 
two turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes converted both of them into scores. Chad Murphy went 44 yards on 
a screen pass and Ken Nelson added a one-yard run, bringing the Antelopes to 
within 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield scored two quick touchdowns in the third quarter to put the game 
out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield receiver Joel Morales caught a 53-yard pass that set up a 
seven-yard touchdown run by James Wofford, Steve's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 On Antelope Valley's ensuing possession, the Drillers blocked Chad Shrout's 
punt and recovered it in the end zone to cap the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley running back Jermaine Lewis, who rushed for 247 yards against 
Bakersfield last season, was held in check, gaining only 29 yards on 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were keying on him all week," Bakersfield Coach Pat Preston said. "We 
needed to corral him and not let him run wild." 
</P>
<P>
 The Drillers have a date next week with Bishop Amat at Bakersfield College. 
Bishop Amat is ranked No. 1 in the state poll and No. 1 in the nation by USA 
Today.

 There's offense, there's defense, and there's that other in-between thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Special teams are supposed to be the transition for a simple change of 
possession. For Cal State Northridge on Saturday night, it was an undeniable 
bridge to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge blunders on special teams led to a pair of scores and Southwest 
Texas State held on to beat the Matadors, 28-23, in a nonconference game before 
8,916 at Bobcat Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 While Northridge's special teams blocked a punt that led to a touchdown, they 
also snapped two balls over the punter's head, allowed a field-goal attempt to 
be blocked and had a punt bounce off the backside of a return-team blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm thinking is that the best team didn't win the football game," CSUN 
Coach Bob Burt said. "You can't keep putting your defense in a world of hurt 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Painful as it was in the overall sense, the ending was worse. Despite its 
largess on special teams, Northridge (1-2) had a shot at victory in the final 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 26 seconds remaining, the Matadors took over at their 20-yard 
line. Quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin, who passed for a career-high 358 yards, took 
the helm and was poised to ruin things for the home folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt great," said O'Laughlin, who completed 25 of 46 passes and tossed two 
touchdowns. "It didn't work out. . . . I'm speechless." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the final possession, O'Laughlin connected with David 
Romines for a 20-yard gain to the 40. After an incomplete pass, O'Laughlin's 
pass to receiver Duc Ngo was intercepted by linebacker Joe O'Haver. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only interception thrown by O'Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Texas (2-2) held a 22-17 lead when the game started to slip through 
the Matadors' fingers. More specifically, through the fingers of punter Darren 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second play of the fourth quarter, Northridge was stalled at its 
39-yard line when long-snapper Andrew Rose hiked the ball over the head and off 
the fingertips of McMahon, who was mauled at the nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, tailback Claude Mathis scored from two yards for a 28-17 
lead. Earlier, a bad snap by Rose led to a Southwest Texas field goal in the 
final minute of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ask your defense to play inside its 10-yard line over and over," 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt may want to stop asking O'Laughlin to carry the team with his arm, too. 
The ground game, sputtering all season, was again mired in the muck. Factor in 
the 63 yards thrown away by the bad snaps on punts and Northridge finished with 
minus-31 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge defense played creditably, allowing 319 yards, and twice 
stopped Southwest Texas in the fourth quarter to give the offense a chance to 
pull out the victory. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Donald Wilkerson, built like a pit bull at 5-foot-7 and 190 
pounds, was the big dog in the Southwest Texas offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran like Marshall Faulk," said Northridge lineman Oscar Wilson. "He uses 
his blockers real well. He uses everybody. He uses defensive players (for 
interference) if you're not looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkerson rushed for 187 yards and a touchdown in 36 carries. Mathis chipped 
in 55 and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge moved to within 28-23 with 9:43 left in the game on a six-yard run 
by tailback Mark Harper -- who was held to 33 yards in 11 carries -- but 
couldn't cash in on its final two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Texas moved in front for good on its first possession of the second 
half when Wilkerson banged in from 11 yards on a draw play for a 22-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the second half had gone as well as the first portion of the second 
quarter, during which the Matadors scored 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 With Southwest Texas holding a 13-10 lead, freshman DeWayne Johnson bolted 
through the middle of the line and blocked a punt by Jeff Brandes at the Bobcat 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't much of a night for Rose. A holding penalty nullified his 20-yard 
return of the block for a touchdown, but this time it didn't matter much. 
O'Laughlin threw a 25-yard strike to Romines (seven catches for 143 yards) on 
the next play to give Northridge a 17-13 lead with 3:20 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had a shot at inflicting serious pain on the Bobcats in the closing 
moments of the half, but shifted into reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:38 left, Northridge took over at its 45-yard line, having scored on its 
previous three possessions. Things were heading in the right direction, but not 
for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays went nowhere and on fourth down, Rose hiked the ball well over the 
head of McMahon, who after a 33-yard loss was tackled by half the folks in the 
stadium at the 17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Whitehead kicked a 27-yard field goal with 10 seconds left to pare the 
Northridge lead to 17-16.

VALLEY TAKES BREAK FROM TRADITION IN 20-0 WSC VICTORY OVER GLENDALE

<P>
 Every time the Glendale and Valley college football teams met in recent years, 
the games had been well-played and close. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was surprising to see Valley shut out the Vaqueros, 20-0, in 
Saturday's Western State Conference game at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like Valley (3-0, 3-0) played great. Glendale's performance was 
sloppy throughout the contest.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (1-1, 0-1) fumbled five times and had two passes intercepted while 
failing to generate any kind of threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the Vaqueros came close to scoring, they committed a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley scored less than a minute into the game. Glendale's Darren Jenkins 
fumbled the opening kickoff and Marcel Desir recovered at the Glendale 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Valley quarterback Jim Arellanes connected with Jason Leonard 
for a 31-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the quarter, the Monarchs drove 69 yards in 14 plays and scored with 
2:26 left in the quarter on Derick Charles' one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale appeared to be driving toward a score midway through the third 
quarter. The Vaqueros moved 61 yards in nine plays, but on first and 10 from 
the Valley 19, quarterback Eddie Michel threw a pass right into the hands of 
Valley's Doug Socha. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale did not threaten after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes completed 12 of 25 passes for 147 yards. His second touchdown pass 
came on a 35-yard play to Cameron Perry with 9:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Delmatoff completed four of six passes for 13 yards for Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale quarterback Tony Delgado completed 13 of 16 passes for 103 yards. 
Michel completed six of 12 passes for 68 yards.

FOR THE RECORD, CAL LUTHERAN LOSES 18-POINT LEAD, GAME

 Records? Who needs records? 
</P>
<P>
 After Cal Lutheran tailback Terrence Thomas gained 224 yardsto set a school 
record, he said: "I didn't even know anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 His concern, however, was the Kingsmen's 29-24 loss to the University of San 
Diego in a nonconference game Saturday night at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego kicker Matt Young made a 27-yard field goal with 3 minutes 59 
seconds left to play to give the Toreros the deciding score. 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal capped a 12-play, 5-minute, 59-second drive that started just 
after Cal Lutheran had tied the game, 24-24. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (2-2) sealed the victory when Cal Lutheran quarterback Ryan Huisenga 
was called for intentional grounding in the end zone with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (1-1) had a chance to come back in the previous series, but that 
drive stalled at the San Diego 48, when defensive lineman Thomas Rodriguez 
batted down a Huisenga fourth-and-three pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas eclipsed the school record of 183 yards in game, set by Dave Nankivell 
in 1974 and equaled by Cassidy O'Sullivan in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas finished the first half with 134 yards, most of which came on two long 
touchdown runs. He broke a 44-yard scoring run to give Cal Lutheran a 7-0 lead 
with 4 minutes 3 seconds to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 On his next carry, just after San Diego had fumbled at Cal Lutheran's 38, 
Thomas broke down the right sideline for a 62-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 He added a one-yard scoring run with 2:30 to go in the half, giving Cal 
Lutheran what appeared to be a commanding 21-3 lead. But it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 A poor pass defense has contributed to blown leads in the last two games for 
Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cal Lutheran took a 21-3 lead in the second quarter, San Diego 
quarterback Vince Moiso completed 13 of his next 16 passes for 157 yards, 
engineering touchdown drives on three consecutive possessions to give the 
Toreros a 24-21 lead with 4:47 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had guys double covered and they still caught balls," Cal Lutheran Coach 
Joe Harper said. "We've got some work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen came back with a 27-yard field goal by Dan Leffler, tying the 
game, 24-24, with 9:58 remaining.

 Garden Grove 28, Sonora 24 -- Ruben Reyna rushed for 123 yards and two 
touchdowns, including the game-winner, in a nonleague game.  
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove's first victory of the season offset a strong performance by 
Sonora's Mark Gonzalez.The 6-4 senior tight end caught nine passes for 171 
yards, including a 65-yard touchdown that gave the Raiders (1-2) a 14-7 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third of six lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove trailed, 17-7, with 4:55 left in the first half, when Reyna 
struck for his first score, darting 49 yards down the sideline. The Argonauts 
(1-2) moved ahead with 34 seconds remaining in the half, when Troy Haller 
completed his second touchdown pass to Brian Jones, this for two yards. 
Earlier, they hooked up on Garden Grove's first score, a 63-yard pass. Jones 
caught four of Haller's seven completions for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora drove 46 yards on a last-gasp drive, but the Raiders could not convert 
on a fourth-and-5 play from the Garden Grove 30 with 1:15 left. AHMED ORTIZ

 Whittier Christian 21, Los Angeles Murphy 18 -- Whittier Christian running 
back Nick Valdez rushed for 143 yards in 28 carries and scored two touchdowns 
to give the Heralds a comfortable 21-0 lead after three quarters at Whittier 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Murphy quarterback Danny Ragsdale threw for 270 yards, 175 in the second 
half, and three fourth-quarter touchdowns, but Whittier Christian (3-0) hung 
on. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian increased its lead to 21-0 when Kaipo Takahashi made a 
leaping catch of a Andrei Roudenko 18-yard touchdown pass.

44 seconds left in the game.

RESERVE BACKS PROVIDE SPARK FOR MOORPARK, 39-0

 Behind a well-oiled offense and the running of Reginald Wilkes and Fred 
Polito, who replaced injured starter Cory Bowen, Moorpark College buried West 
Los Angeles, 39-0, Saturday night in a Western State Conference, 
interdivisional game. 
</P>
<P>
 Polito ran for 70 yards and two touchdowns and Wilkes tacked on 63 yards and a 
touchdown as the Raiders (1-1 overall, 1-0 in conference play) took advantage 
of consistently superb field position. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. (0-3, 0-3) was shut out for the second time in three weeks and has 
lost six in a row dating to last season. The Oilers could muster only 48 yards 
of total offense against a swarming Moorpark defense that recorded five sacks 
and had one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Steve Sabbe opened the floodgates with a 34-yard field goal 10 
minutes into the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkes scored on a 12-yard run, quarterback Damian Delfino threw a 54-yard 
scoring pass to Gary Clemons and Sabe added a 26-yard field goal to make the 
score 18-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After the intermission, Isaiah Mustafa hauled in a 49-yard touchdown pass from 
Jeremie Watkins and Polito rumbled for scores on two- and 11-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino completed seven of 10 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown, and 
understudy Watkins was five of eight for 92 yards and a touchdown. Mustafa, a 
track decathlete, caught 10 passes for 184 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A.'s best numbers on a bad night came from tailback Michael Black who, 
after sitting out the first half for fighting in last week's game against 
Valley, gained 44 yards in six carries, all in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler wide receiver Ron Peebles caught four passes for 20 yards and starting 
quarterback Ennis Powell could complete only three passes in six attempts for 
16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. committed 11 penalties for 81 yards.

VENTURA POSTS ANOTHER SHUTOUT

<P>
 Ivan McCrae and John Patton combined for 136 yards rushing to propel Ventura 
College to its third consecutive victory in a 31-0 rout of L.A. Southwest 
College on Saturday night at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutout was the second in three games for Ventura this season and improved 
the resurgent Pirates to 2-0 in Western State Conference play. The victory 
marked the first time since 1990 that Ventura has won three games in a row. The 
Pirates were 0-10 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrae (81 yards and a touchdown in 13 carries) and Patton (55 yards in seven 
carries) sparked a balanced offense guided by quarterback Aaron Triana (seven 
of 13 for 122 yards and one touchdown.) Triana threw one interception.

TOP-RANKED BAKERSFIELD BEATS PIERCE FOR 18TH STRAIGHT WSC WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 When it works, the run-and-shoot makes for exciting football. When it doesn't, 
it degenerates into what Pierce College showed Saturday night at home. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only shooting the Brahmas did was at their feet, dropping a 49-12 
decision to Bakersfield in a Western State Conference interdivisional game. 
Bakersfield (3-0, 2-0 in conference play), the top-ranked team in the state, 
had 463 yards and collected 35 first downs to win its 18th consecutive 
conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce (0-2, 0-1) had 206 yards, only 30 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Brahmas passed, which was on virtually every play, the 
Bakersfield defense stopped them. Pierce quarterback David Muir completed 17 of 
39 passes for 164 yards and completed only five passes for 10 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield running back George Jones gained 136 yards in 21 carries and 
scored two touchdowns. The sophomore entered the game with a conference-leading 
301 yards rushing. One of his backfield partners in the Renegades' option 
attack, Tommy Criner, rushed for 112 yards in 13 carries and scored once. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renegades held a 35-0 lead early in the fourth quarter before Pierce 
scored back-to-back touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce crossed the goal line on a four-yard run by Muir with 14 minutes 39 
seconds left, and again with 10:15 remaining on a two-yard run by Ron McKelvey. 
Muir's touchdown was set up by an 86-yard kickoff return by Rodney Williams to 
the Bakersfield four. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bakersfield, apparently believing that Pierce had gotten close enough, 
scored two more times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came on a four-yard run by Criner with 6:15 to play, the second on a 
two-yard run by Matthew Johnson on his only carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield wasted little time getting on the board. The Renegades marched 90 
yards in nine plays and scored on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Deon Price to 
tight end Shannon Crabtree. 
</P>
<P>
 They added two more touchdowns on runs of six and two yards by George Jones in 
the second quarter for a 21-0 lead at the half. The touchdowns, both over left 
tackle, gave Jones 10 on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce wasted its best chance to score in the first half early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas drove to the Bakersfield seven, where they faced a third-and-five. 
But Muir was tackled by linebacker Chaundee Brown on an option-run around left 
end for a three-yard loss. Pierce then faked a 27-yard field-goal attempt and 
came away empty-handed when holder Williams was hammered by several defenders.

 Montclair Prep running back Akil Anderson, who incurred a knee injury during 
Friday night's 7-0 victory over Kern Valley, said he will undergo a magnetic 
resonance imaging test Tuesday and expects to miss Friday's game against 
Kilpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Darrell Dent were injured in the first half and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a 6-foot, 185-pound junior who gained 73 yards in 10 carries, was 
hurt on the first play of the second quarter and had to be helped off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planted my left foot to cut right and got hit with a helmet on the inside 
of my (left) knee," said Anderson, who rushed for five touchdowns against 
Horizon of San Diego a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent, a receiver/safety and one of the top baseball prospects in the area, 
suffered a concussion minutes after Anderson's injury. PAIGE A. LEECH

BELL-JEFF CROSS-COUNTRY INVITATIONAL; THOUSAND OAKS GIRLS' AND BOYS' TEAMS 
PROGRAMMED FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High girls' cross-country team was in peak form Saturday. 
The Lancer boys were trying to regain the form of their 1993 State Division I 
championship season. Both teams ran to victory in the seeded races of the 
Bell-Jeff Invitational at Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' girls, paced by junior Kim Mortensen's victory in 17 minutes 24 
seconds over the 2.9-mile course, placed five runners among the top 11 for 33 
points. Palos Verdes Peninsula and Los Alamitos were second and third with 59 
and 68 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' boys, bolstered by the season debuts of seniors Jeff Fischer 
and Kevin Marsden who have been sidelined because of illness and a back injury, 
squeaked by Peninsula, 69-71. Hart, which had defeated Thousand Oaks in the 
Seaside Invitational on Sept. 10, was third with 76 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I see is us getting better every week in the boys," Thousand Oaks Coach 
Jack Farrell said. "Our girls are very healthy and I'd like us to sustain that 
level. Improvement there is going to come a little bit at a time because they 
are running very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks boys, the No. 2 team in the Harrier magazine's national 
preseason poll, must improve over the next week if they are to challenge 
Kingwood, Tex., the nation's top-ranked team, in the Southwestern University 
Invitational on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks senior Keith O'Doherty placed second in 14:29, 10 seconds behind 
Brett Strahan of Hart, who ran the second-fastest time in the meet's 21-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Todd Disney was eighth (14:57) and Fischer was 14th (15:19) for 
Thousand Oaks. But the Lancers' Nos. 4 and 5 runners, Josh Carolan and Marsden, 
finished in 15:45 for 22nd and 23rd place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team isn't going to be at full strength until late in the season," 
Fischer said. "I wasn't even going to try be up there with our top guys. I just 
wanted to get a feeling of what it's like to be in a race again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to run well enough for our team to win. We did, but it was 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen overtook Los Alamitos' Kim Bates with a little more than a mile to 
go on the course's longest hill and cruised to a 33-second victory over 
Peninsula's Molly Mehlberg in the meet's seventh-fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Marsden finished fifth (18:46), Bridget Roy seventh (18:48), Katie 
Scherrei ninth (19:00) and Alison Feinstein 11th (19:21) for Thousand Oaks.

SARKISIAN PASSES FOR 409 YARDS; EL CAMINO WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, Fullerton's defense had a great deal of trouble stopping El 
Camino in a Mission Conference game Saturday night at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Sarkisian threw for 409 yards and four touchdowns as El 
Camino won, 28-10. The Warriors are ranked 15th in the nation by the J.C. 
Grid-Wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise was how much trouble Fullerton had scoring against the El Camino 
defense. The Hornets were coming off a 39-39 tie against Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc O'Brien, the Hornet quarterback, was solid, passing for 249 yards (20 of 
35) but none for touchdowns. He also was sacked four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's touchdown came on a two-yard run by Michael Jacot with 49 seconds 
left. Jacot, a reserve, led the Hornets with 49 yards in four carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (0-1-1) trailed at the half, 21-3, but with a little better 
performance inside the 20, it might have been much closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets' first drive reached the El Camino five before stalling. Then a 
bad snap led to a missed 23-yard field-goal attempt by Joel Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez missed a 39-yard attempt on the Hornets' next drive as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's next two possessions ended in punts. Then the Hornets turned the 
ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez kicked a 39-yard field goal with 40 seconds left in the first half to 
cut the El Camino lead to 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (2-0) had much more success on offense, mainly because of Sarkisian. 
He completed a 69-yard touchdown pass to Russell Shaw with 11 minutes 15 
seconds left in the half to put the Warriors ahead, 21-0. Shaw ran a deep 
pattern in the middle of the field and got behind Fullerton defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino's Morell Ollis caught an 86-yard touchdown pass with 14:49 left in 
the second quarter to put El Camino ahead, 14-0. He also got behind the 
Fullerton secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian's performance was expected by Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy. Last 
week, he said if his team failed to apply pressure, Sarkisian would dominate, 
as he did last season when he passed for 367 yards in a 31-30 loss to 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he was 24 of 33 for 408 yards. Two passes were intercepted and four 
were dropped. Kevin Shoup and Peter Burton had the interceptions for the 
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian did most of his damage in the first half, going 13 of 16 for 292 
yards and three touchdowns.

ROUNDUP; MILLER LEADS CSUN WOMEN TO RIVERSIDE INVITATIONAL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lori Miller's sixth-place finish led the Cal State Northridge women's 
cross-country team to its first NCAA Division I invitational victory Saturday 
at the Riverside Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a junior from Bakersfield, covered the 5-kilometer course at UC 
Riverside in 18 minutes 54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Karen Hecox -- the defending NCAA 3,000-meters champion -- won the 
title with a 17:45 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Don Strametz attributed his team's showing to team unity and a different 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said at the beginning of the season that this was our best women's team 
since we went Division I four years ago," Strametz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I told them not to go out hard the first mile, but to lay back. It 
seemed to work well for Lori Miller, although we may still have to experiment 
with different strategies for a few of our people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good bond with this group, and I think they will continue to 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished with 81 points, 39 points ahead of second-place USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Jamie Whitmore was 13th in 19:32, senior Jennifer Andrews was 19th in 
19:38, senior Cheri Lee-Segal placed 37th in 20:10 and junior Karla Sanford was 
42nd in 20:22. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Andrea Bruins finished 52nd at 20:75 and freshman Andrea Barfield was 
57th at 20:46. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's squad placed 13th out of 19 teams with 342 points.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; WITH PHIPPS FORCED OUT, BLANKENSHIP COMES IN FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dave Blankenship has seen enough of Dave Phipps the past few years, finishing 
second in the Grand American Modified division to the Simi Valley resident each 
of the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 So when an unlikely mistake forced Phipps out of running for the season's 
biggest payday, Blankenship had reason to rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Reseda resident took the checkered flag -- and a check for 
$1,000 -- in the 50-lap feature race as part of the year-ending Fall 
Spectacular at Saugus Speedway Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time since I've won a main event," said Blankenship, who 
failed to win a feature race this season. "It was a little different without 
Dave in there. He's always there and you can never count him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps' night ended early when he forgot to tighten his gas cap and it fell 
off while he was warming up prior to the start of the feature race. He returned 
to the track, but the car still leaked fuel because of a missing gasket, 
forcing the four-time Grand American Modified champion to the pits for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much I can say," said Phipps, who also won three Sportsman points 
titles. "I just set the cap on top. . . . I'm really disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50-lap Sportsman main event, Sal Rose of Van Nuys claimed the victory 
after pole-sitter Sean Monroe of Los Angeles was slowed by engine trouble on 
Lap 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Schrader of Santa Clarita won the 50-lap figure-8 main event when he 
moved past Pine Mountain Club resident Gerrit Cromsigt on the 48th lap.

STATEWIDE STUDY FINDS VENTURA COUNTY CHILDREN FARE WELL; REPORT: AN ADVOCACY 
GROUP INDICATES HEALTH, EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT ARE BETTER THAN 
AVERAGE. BUT IN ONE CATEGORY -- CHILD ABUSE -- STATISTICS TELL A DIFFERENT 
STORY AND ALSO SHOW AN INCREASE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County treats its children better than most other counties in 
California, but it should be doing more, says a study released last week by a 
statewide children's advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now's 1994 report on California's children shows that children in 
Ventura County get better education, health care and financial support than the 
average California child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County does do better than the state average in many critical 
respects," said Lois Salisbury, executive director of the Oakland-based 
Children Now. "But when you look at the numbers, there's no county that can 
afford to be complacent. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can be satisfied when we have nearly 20% of (Ventura County) 
fourth-graders who can't understand a basic reading assignment," Salisbury 
said, referring to CLAS test scores. "I don't think anyone's going to be happy 
with the dropout rate of 11% or 12%. Every one of the figures . . . has room 
for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet child abuse was the only issue studied by Children Now in which Ventura 
County children fared worse than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County children are being abused in numbers that are rising 
alarmingly, Children Now's annual studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, abuse or neglect reports were filed on 77 out of every 1,000 Ventura 
County children, the study says. The 1992 California average was 76.6 reports 
per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County rate increased from 64.2 per 1,000 in 1991 and 51.6 per 
1,000 in 1990, according to previous Children Now studies. Child abuse reports 
are probably increasing in Ventura County as they are statewide because people 
are more aware of the problem and willing to accuse the abusers, a county 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot more information available about child abuse and neglect, and a 
lot more education in the community," said Sally Allen, who oversees emergency 
response and adoptions for Ventura County Child Protective Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic pressures such as layoffs and pay cuts may also be pushing some 
already stressed parents to the point where they hurt their children, Allen 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents' money woes may also be denying Ventura County children access to 
medical care, good food and higher education, Allen pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an expensive county to live in, so if you don't have a job or you 
don't have a well-paying job, it's a little more difficult to make ends meet," 
Allen said. "Sometimes that means the family may not have money to pay for 
child care." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the 192,595 children younger than 18 in Ventura County fared better 
than those in many other California counties, according to Children Now's 
annual review of state, county and local statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 As reflected in the number, traditional families appear stronger in Ventura 
County than in many other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10% of Ventura County's infants were born to teen-age mothers, compared 
to a rate of 12.1% in neighboring Los Angeles County, 11.5% in Santa Barbara 
County and a statewide average of 11.7%.  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other counties, Ventura County recorded the third-lowest number of 
children born out of wedlock -- 20.5% -- and the 15th-lowest number of babies 
born to women with late or no prenatal care -- 4.7%, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 5.2% of all Ventura County infants weighed less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces 
at birth, while 5.8% of all babies in California were born abnormally small. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura County infants died at birth at a rate of 6.8 per 1,000, compared 
with a statewide mortality rate of 7.5 per 1,000 and rates of 6.4 in Santa 
Barbara County and 7.7 in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Good doctors and early child care should be praised for Ventura County's 
better-than-average health rankings in the Children Now study, said Dr. Gary 
Feldman, county medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key issue is our infant mortality," Feldman said last week. "I think that 
that says a lot about the fact that we have, I think, very good pediatrics, 
with excellent nursery care." 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings "probably reflect more than anything the overall wealth and 
education of people in the county," he said. "The fact that people are paying 
attention to children's health is extremely helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County earned its highest ranking from Children Now for its 
immunization rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The county ranked second in the state for immunizing 61% of its children by 
age 2, following San Mateo County's top-ranked 67% immunization rate, the study 
says. Only 40% were immunized in Los Angeles County, and 56% received a full 
battery of vaccinations in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he hopes to expand Ventura County's aggressive vaccination 
program to include a computerized system for tracking childhood immunization 
records across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I'm putting a lot of effort into seeing that the figures go nowhere 
but up." 
</P>
<P>
 In education, Ventura County children also fared somewhat better than children 
in many other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, fewer fourth-graders scored poorly on CLAS tests than in many other 
California counties. Only 18% of them scored a substandard 1 or 2 out of a 
possible 6 on the reading-based test, while 29% of fourth-graders in Los 
Angeles County scored low and 19% scored low in Santa Barbara County. The 
statewide average was 24% for substandard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-graders scored higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 15% of Ventura County eighth-graders scored a low 1 or 2 on writing-based 
CLAS tests in 1993. In contrast, 26% of eighth-graders scored low in Los 
Angeles County and 17% did poorly in Santa Barbara County. Statewide, 20% of 
eighth-graders scored poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Liu, director of policy for Children Now, said that he was troubled 
that nearly one in five students in the fourth grade could not handle a reading 
assignment and about one in seven eighth-graders cannot write a simple essay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is, in fact, better than most other counties in the state," Liu said. "But 
I find that troubling. And most parents would say, 'My goodness, what's going 
on in our schools? What can we do better?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at least one Ventura County educator saw the improvement between fourth- 
and eighth-grade CLAS scores as a positive sign that the 18.2% of children here 
with limited English skills are learning something in the county's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that may suggest is that the students with limited proficiency in 
English are transitioning into their second language," said Chuck Weis, Ventura 
County superintendent of schools. "If I gave you a test in English when that 
was your second language, how well would you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Weis echoed Liu's dismay that about one-sixth of fourth- and 
eighth-graders in Ventura County cannot handle a basic literacy test. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is not to have 15% of our kids performing at that low level," Weis 
said. "We will look for ways for kids to become better at their writing . . .. 
Every child should score 3, 4, 5 or 6." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once in high school, 11.7% of Ventura County's class of 1993 dropped out, 
leaving the county ranked 26th among 57 studied by Children Now. In 55th-ranked 
Los Angeles County, 20.4% dropped out, while 9.6% dropped out in 17th-ranked 
Santa Barbara County. The state dropout rate was 15.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 And 36.7% of Ventura County's high school graduates were prepared for college, 
compared with a statewide average of only 32.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great," Weis said. But he said he has seen statistics showing that 
Ventura County grads go to four-year colleges at a lower-than-average rate, 
largely because the county lacks such a college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs so much more to go off to UCLA or Cal Poly or (Cal State) 
Northridge," he said. "That's why we're pushing so hard to get a four-year 
university here." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are children who do not fare well, as reflected in Children Now's 
study of arrests and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 With five children under age 18 killed by guns in 1992, Ventura County ranked 
only 41st in the state compared to myriad tiny rural counties such as Mariposa 
and Mono where none was killed with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Ventura County rate was far lower than in second-worst San Bernardino, 
where bullets killed 55 children, and the worst -- Los Angeles County, where 
432 children died in gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County performed far better on felony arrests, ranking 15th with a 
rate of 1,907 arrests per 100,000 children aged 10 to 17, and performing better 
than many smaller, rural counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County was ranked 33rd with a rate of 2,813 felony arrests per 
100,000, while Los Angeles County was ranked 38th, with a rate of 3,228 arrests 
per 100,000. The statewide average was 2,820 felony arrests per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrest statistics can often reflect a family's failure to heed some of the 
other issues tracked by Children Now, said Ventura County Juvenile Court Judge 
Steven Z. Perren. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Children with neglectful or abusive parents, poor school performance and drug 
habits are far more likely to break the law repeatedly as minors, Perren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are real storm warnings that I've got someone who's going to be a 
long-term ward in court," Perren said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Far too often, juvenile offenders are dropped off to face the judge alone, and 
without that support of parents, they may take court less seriously, Perren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And their numbers are growing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an alligators and swamps problem," he said. "It's up to eye level 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important factors in keeping a child straight are solid support from 
parents and educational goals, Perren said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I see that reading deficit (on a child's report) I get real scared," he 
said. "The kid is not occupying his time. He is embarrassed as often as 
unwilling to go to school, and it is true the devil will make work for those 
idle hands." 
</P>
<P>
 California pays in other ways for not caring for its children, said Salisbury, 
Children Now's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who grow into healthy, well-educated jobholders will support the 
Social Security system and the tax base; those who do not become a burden on 
tax-funded social services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't take care of kids, everything that you care about is going to 
crumble," Salisbury said. "Even if you think there's no humane reason to care 
about a child, there's every practical, self-interested reason to care about 
children because children are little people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County residents can help by voting for children's funding, such as 
education and health care, and they must get involved personally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That includes picking up the phone and getting in on a talk show discussing 
kids' issues, or calling a candidate's campaign headquarters and saying, 'Here 
are some questions on kids' issues, where does the candidate stand?' " 
Salisbury urged. "We've got to raise the noise level, which is practically 
silent in this electoral campaign, for kids." Ventura County's Children 
</P>
<P>
 A new study has found that children in Ventura County fared better than many 
of their peers in other parts of California on issues of health, welfare and 
education. Here is a look at some important indicators:

SURVIVORS BATTLE BREAST CANCER WITH AWARENESS; HEALTH: WOMEN WHO HAVE LIVED 
THROUGH THE DISEASE STRESS EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS AS THE KEYS IN LOCAL 
RALLIES.

 Dolly Montalvo will always remember her 45th birthday -- it was the day she 
was told she had breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a nice birthday present," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, 420 women in Ventura County find out they have breast cancer. The 
American Cancer Society estimates 100 of those women will die from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers may be depressing, but the survival rate is much higher now than 
it was 10 years ago, said Dr. Ann Kelley, chief of medicine at Ventura County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 After marching Saturday with a small group from the Futurecare Cancer 
Treatment Center in Oxnard to the Esplanade Mall, Kelley joined Montalvo and 
about 50 other people at a rally in the mall to inform women about breast 
cancer and announce that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar event was held Saturday in the east county, where participants 
marched from the Westlake Comprehensive Cancer Center to rally at a nearby park 
in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers chose the theme "Break the Silence" for the event. Despite their 
efforts to talk to women in the mall Saturday afternoon, many didn't want to 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 While children stared at the pink balloons and carnations, most women ignored 
the information booths and pushed strollers past the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared to talk about this," said Rita Mendoza, a 57-year-old 
cancer survivor from Oxnard. "It's too real for them." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mendoza and Montalvo, both members of the Oxnard-based Latina Breast Cancer 
Survivors, left the booth and shoved leaflets into the hands of shoppers who 
were walking past the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo, who found a cancerous lump while examining herself in the shower, 
said people still think of a cancer diagnosis as a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But she's proof that it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a six-year survivor, going on seven," said Montalvo, now 52, an 
office-skills instructor at Oxnard College. "When I told my family, they were 
devastated. It's just like when someone dies, people don't know what to say. 
Cancer is synonymous with death, but it doesn't have to be any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she uses her sense of humor to educate others. 
</P>
<P>
 While tending a prosthesis booth Saturday, Montalvo told a small group of 
customers, "The only thing you can't do after surgery is be a topless dancer or 
nurse a child." 
</P>
<P>
 While humor helps Montalvo talk about breast cancer, some women are reluctant 
to discuss it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women find a lump and they are too scared to go to the doctor," said 
Karen Wright, an administrator at Futurecare Cancer Treatment Center. "We're 
trying to create a sense of urgency, a sense of hope for women so they will do 
self-examinations that will lead to early diagnosis and to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley said misinformation is as dangerous as the silence that has always 
surrounded cancer, especially breast cancer. While she advocates a good diet 
and exercise for all patients, she said studies are divided on whether those 
factors alone can prevent cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 And other medical breakthroughs, such as the recent discovery of a breast 
cancer gene, raise new problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracking of the gene will benefit women with a family history of the 
disease," she said, "but insurance companies could also use gene testing to 
deny coverage to some women. There's a lot of questions that will need to be 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley advocates using gene testing to give "psychological relief" to women 
with a history of cancer in their families. But she emphasized that the only 
way a cure for cancer will be found is through research, which she called 
"tragically underfunded." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fast enough and it's not good enough, but we're working on it," she 
said. "Women should know that treatment is there and it's getting better all of 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo, who has had two biopsies, a mastectomy and six months of 
chemotherapy, said a supportive family may be the most important factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need them just to be there to hug you when you need a hug, or to mop up 
the buckets of tears," she said. "My husband loves me for me, not for my body 
parts. I hate to say this, but some husbands just can't handle it and I worry 
about those women. I think my scar is beautiful."

 It's just like starting over. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) describes it when asked 
what it's like to be running for a new public office in a new and more 
conservative district. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years in the Assembly, O'Connell has decided to run for the seat 
being vacated by retiring state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). Hart's 
18th state Senate District covers Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and all of Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, 43, faces Republican Steve MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo 
County supervisor and state coastal commissioner, in the Nov. 8 general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support in his Assembly 
district, which covers western Ventura County and most of Santa Barbara County. 
He has never lost an election. 
</P>
<P>
 But MacElvaine, 50, said it won't be so easy for O'Connell in the state Senate 
race. The reason, MacElvaine said, is because 1990 reapportionment shoved the 
district into conservative San Luis Obispo County, his home turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've crossed those mountains, you're in conservative territory," 
MacElvaine said. "And Jack O'Connell is not a conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of MacElvaine's campaign is to paint O'Connell as a liberal, career 
politician, one who stood by and watched as California's economy took a nose 
dive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to be the No. 2 man in the state Assembly and not be part of 
the problem," MacElvaine said, referring to O'Connell's job as speaker pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said he is proud of his record, noting that he has supported and in 
some cases authored legislation to protect the environment, extend education 
programs for gifted and developmentally disabled students, and to increase 
penalties for drunk drivers and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the election will come down to one central question: "Have I 
represented my (Assembly) district in a thoughtful and responsible manner? If 
people believe that I have, they will vote for me. If they don't, they won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite O'Connell's confidence that he has served his constituents well, the 
18th state Senate District has long been coveted by Republicans. Hart has held 
the seat since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Reapportionment narrowed the voter registration gap, leaving Democrats a 
slight edge with 44.7% of the registration, compared to 40.1% Republican. Yet, 
officials with both parties consider the district a tossup because Republicans 
traditionally go to the polls in larger numbers than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say right now (the race) is about even," said Bob Larkin, chairman of 
the Ventura County Republican Central Committee. "A lot depends on the voter 
turnout. If it's a low turnout, I think MacElvaine wins it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic officials point out that the better-known and better-financed 
O'Connell is a tireless campaigner, one who doesn't take his constituency for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't run as a sure bet, no way," said Paul Chatman, chairman of Democrats 
United, the fund-raising arm of the Ventura County Democratic Party. "He's 
going to (campaign) like he's the new kid on the block." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their different political backgrounds, both O'Connell and MacElvaine 
share the same views on a number of issues. Both support the death penalty and 
abortion rights. And both are opposed to Proposition 187, a statewide ballot 
initiative that would ban health and education benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they hold far different views on other issues, in particular the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said his extensive business background is what sets him apart from 
O'Connell in this area. The owner and operator of a cattle ranch and mobile 
home park, MacElvaine said he believes too much regulation and high taxes and 
fees have driven businesses out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "By hurting business, you're driving out the money that comes into the state's 
pocket," MacElvaine said. "We can't continue to do that. If we do, businesses 
will continue to leave, and as their revenues leave, there will be less money 
for schools, law enforcement and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Connell acknowledges his voting record has received low marks from 
business organizations in the past, the lawmaker said he has worked hard in 
recent years to focus more attention on business leaders' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell points to his support of workers' compensation reform and tax 
incentives for expanding businesses as steps to boost the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, he said he has played a key role in securing funding to 
establish and promote a commercial satellite launch facility at Vandenberg Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell is also credited with helping to provide tax breaks for companies 
that want to use the facility, which will see its first commercial launch at 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to give all the kudos I can to Jack," said Donald Smith, executive 
director of the Western Commercial Space Center, the private nonprofit 
organization that operates the launch site. "He's not known for helping 
business. That's not his bag. But he has done a tremendous amount to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said companies are already lining up to use the spaceport, which he said 
would create hundreds of aerospace jobs locally and thousands of manufacturing 
jobs throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're building the (equivalent of) LAX" for the space business, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue the candidates differ on is offshore drilling along the 
district's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said he favors a moratorium on offshore drilling. But he stops 
short of supporting an O'Connell bill that would ban drilling within three 
miles of the coast, except in the event of a national emergency. The bill 
passed the Legislature and awaits Gov. Wilson's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine wants to preserve options for tapping the state's offshore oil 
fields. He points out how Mobil Oil is developing onshore oil rigs that use 
special "slant-drills" to tap into oil deposits offshore without exposing 
oil-carrying pipes to water. He said if the new technology proves to be 
environmentally safe, it could help generate hundreds of millions of dollars in 
revenues for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the new technology," MacElvaine said. "But I do not support any 
more (oil drilling) projects at this time. I would like to see how well it 
works first." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said he believed the oil ban would actually help the local economy 
by protecting tourism and commercial fishing industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will also save government's money that they would spend in the event of a 
spill," he said, adding that most of the state's coastline is already protected 
from oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's television commercials have slammed MacElvaine for voting in 
support of offshore oil drilling while serving as a member of the California 
Coastal Commission between 1983 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said he had supported some drilling, "but I don't recall ever 
seeing Jack come down to our meetings to protest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both candidates are doing their best to canvass the 
8,000-square-mile district, which stretches from western Ventura County to the 
southern Monterey County line. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, a licensed pilot, said he has been campaigning since April, 1993, 
often using his Cessna 182 to hopscotch around the tri-county district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one advantage," MacElvaine said. "But then Jack is better known." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, who keeps a pair of Nike tennis shoes in the trunk of his car, said 
he has been walking precincts, particularly in San Luis Obispo County, since 
July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy it," O'Connell said. "That's a hallmark of our success." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are also mounting media campaigns, running television and radio 
spots as well as newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, who had less than $3,000 in his campaign account after the June 
primary, has been getting help from the Republican Party to subsidize his media 
campaign. He would not disclose how much he has received. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't ever have as much as Jack, but we'll have enough," said MacElvaine, 
who has dipped into his own pocket to loan his campaign $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, O'Connell had more than $247,018 in his bank account during the 
last campaign finance reporting period. But O'Connell said that money will not 
be the deciding factor in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a battle of the airwaves, a battle in print, a battle on 
the radio and battle in the mail," he said. "But I think the difference will be 
our grass-roots operation." State Senate Candidates

<P>
 Time for math, and teacher Mary Elsenbaumer tells her fifth-grade class at 
Ventura's Lincoln School that today they will calculate the size of an average 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 But to do that, she says, they need to define "family" and find each student's 
family size. 
</P>
<P>
 Hands shoot up and voices rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we count stepbrothers and stepsisters?" one boy asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the people that live in your house?" another boy questions. When the 
teacher says yes, even if they live there only sometimes, he starts counting. 
"Let's see, I have two moms, one stepmother . . .." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a girl near the front says softly, "My mom and dad never married." Is her 
father part of her family? 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the classroom of Mrs. Elsenbaumer, known to her students as Mrs. E. 
Here, lessons are drawn from life and a seemingly straightforward math problem 
can touch on a matter of national debate: What is a family? 
</P>
<P>
 But as Elsenbaumer frequently says to her 9-, 10- and 11-year-old students: "I 
think you can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Something shifts in children between fourth and fifth grade, Elsenbaumer says. 
In their last year of elementary school, the boys and girls who come to her 
class are suddenly able to grasp abstract ideas, to relate concepts to reality, 
to reason. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they learn, they squirm. Even at their quietest, these children are 
constantly moving: twirling pencils under their nostrils, drumming fingers on 
classroom tables and sliding around in their chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsenbaumer's job this year is to help her 27 students not only learn but 
practice self-control, to prepare for the perilous transition from the 
cloistered world of elementary school to the more freewheeling universe of 
middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep them from being lost in the crowd," she said. "I fear for the 
kids who are going to get lost in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 By June, the children in Elsenbaumer's class should have mastered division, 
although some have not learned multiplication. They should be able to write a 
short essay, even though a few now have trouble composing a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And they should be comfortable with scientific reasoning, from estimating the 
number of raisins in a box to calculating the size of an average family. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth grade is not all drudgery. Every year, Lincoln's two fifth-grade classes 
take a four-day field trip to Catalina Island to study marine ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is made each April, but in the first week of school the cry was 
already resounding through Elsenbaumer's classroom: "When do we go to 
Catalina?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even the trip to Catalina, however, fits into Mrs. E's overall scheme: to help 
children learn to think and work independently. And this goal has special 
urgency during students' last year in the homey, tightknit atmosphere of 
Lincoln School. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a cozy, old white-and-blue building on Santa Clara Avenue, Lincoln 
School draws its students from a wide and diverse section of the city -- from 
the poorer neighborhoods near Ventura Avenue to the upscale hillside homes 
above downtown. But the school is small, with only 280 children and nine 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 To many students, it feels like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Flack, Dillon McCarthy, Diego Rivera and many other children in 
Elsenbaumer's class this year have gone to Lincoln School since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsenbaumer has taught some of her students' brothers and sisters. She has met 
their mothers and fathers. She knows or has heard whether the parents are 
together or divorced, working or jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justin, Dillon, Diego and other fifth-graders will leave Lincoln at the 
end of this school year to attend either Cabrillo or DeAnza middle schools, 
which each have 2 1/2 times as many students as Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 The children will go from being the oldest and biggest students at school to 
the youngest and smallest, and from staying in one classroom most of the day to 
traveling from one room to another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some children have the independence and confidence to make the transition 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Coenen, a pony-tailed 10-year-old who makes nearly all A's, is quiet 
and attentive in class. 
</P>
<P>
 But her spirit bursts forth on the school playground, where Alicia, an avid 
player on youth soccer leagues, runs so fast during a game of sharks and 
minnows that she tears past all the boys. "She's the fastest girl at the 
school," Elsenbaumer observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's mother, Kay Coenen, said she has no fears about her daughter's 
upcoming move to middle school. "She's a pretty well-adjusted kid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other children may have more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hale, a small, freckle-faced 10-year-old, reads below grade level. "I'm 
not into reading," he said genially. "It makes my eyes hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to catch up, Chris said, but sometimes his round blue eyes wander 
around the classroom while other children are bent over their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the boy's academic difficulties, Chris' mother said she worries his 
small size may make it harder for him to fit in at middle school. "Chris is 
going to be a little tiny person next year," Kari Hale said. "And he's scared 
of eighth-graders." 
</P>
<P>
 In elementary school, teachers take care of children, Elsenbaumer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Frank," she added, referring to her student Frank Caro, a quiet, 
sweet-tempered boy who struggles academically but who calls so little attention 
to himself that he could go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year he's a number," Elsenbaumer said. "No one will know him as Frankie. 
He's got to be more independent." 
</P>
<P>
 To foster such independence, Elsenbaumer gives her young charges a degree of 
freedom that would give more conventional teachers the willies. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-versed in educational philosophy, Elsenbaumer calls her classroom 
environment "structured freedom." But some may label it controlled chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. E teaches without textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 She arranges students' desks in groups instead of straight rows, deliberately 
seating the brightest children next to those in danger of failing. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in Mrs. E's class work with each other as often as with the teacher 
and the more capable students serve as models to their less confident peers, 
Elsenbaumer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students working in groups make noise, sometimes becoming downright loud. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Mrs. E's manner of keeping discipline is unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers use the first day of school to dispense a list of classroom 
rules: No gum. No speaking out of turn. No getting up to sharpen a pencil 
without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. E gives no such list. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as soon as students had settled in their assigned seats this year the 
teacher walked to the front of the room, picked up a two-foot-long hollow stick 
resembling a tree branch and turned to face the class. 
</P>
<P>
 As she slowly twirled the stick, its contents rolled from side to side, 
pattering softly. One by one, children ceased chatting and turned toward the 
strange noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're really quiet, you can hear this," Elsenbaumer said in a hushed 
voice. "What does it sound like?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain," a few students called out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain," Elsenbaumer said to the now-quiet class. "I always start my year with 
a rain stick." 
</P>
<P>
 She uses the rain stick, Mrs. E continued quietly, to signal that the class is 
too noisy. When they see her twirl the stick, she said, they should get quiet 
enough to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Mrs. E taught the children another signal to get quiet and 
give her their attention -- when they hear her say the three simple words "eyes 
on me." 
</P>
<P>
 And by the end of the first week, Mrs. E had established a third routine for 
restoring classroom calm -- clapping. Not a loud, angry smacking together of 
hands, but a rhythmic tapping that students can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Clap, clap . . . clap, clap, clap, sounds the teacher. Faces turn to the front 
and pencils drop to the tables as students hurry to jump in: Clap, clap . . . 
clap, clap, clap, they respond. And suddenly the room is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," Mrs. E says, and moves the class on to their next lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Mrs. E tells students who are having trouble with their work or 
bothering a classmate to move to a front table. At other times, she pulls 
misbehaving children aside to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But she occasionally responds to disruptive behavior by refusing to confront 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day of school, a boy came to class wearing a T-shirt that bore a 
joke advertisement for "Saddam's Condoms." Although Mrs. E said nothing to the 
boy, she informed Principal Paul Jablonowski -- known as Mr. J to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after lunch, Mrs. E sent the boy to Mr. J. Later the boy returned 
to class wearing his T-shirt inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between Elsenbaumer's disciplinary style and that of some other 
teachers was starkly apparent one day during the second week of school when she 
had to miss school to teach a workshop and the class got a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Things did not go well. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the afternoon, the substitute got upset when the children 
called out greetings to an adult visitor coming into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Class!" the teacher yelled. "If you can't act like fifth-graders, put your 
heads on your desks and act like first-graders!" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hale, Alicia Coenen and all the other students followed the directions. 
Unaccustomed to such treatment, however, they did not keep their heads bowed 
for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bored," Sandra Jenkins called out to no one in particular. "I want to go 
to the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that afternoon, the substitute allegedly tried to gain control of the 
class by touching students in a threatening way, according to students. One 
parent called the principal after school to complain that the teacher had put a 
hand over a student's mouth. Another parent said the substitute had placed her 
palm on a child's cheek in a mock slap. 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonowski said he reported the incidents to the school district office and 
requested that the substitute not be assigned again to Lincoln School. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children who are starved for attention do things they know are wrong to 
get noticed, Elsenbaumer said. But she tries to pay attention only to what they 
do right. Problems that call for punishing a child or notifying parents she 
often refers to Jablonowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is getting that rapport across and setting the 
climate" in the classroom, Elsenbaumer said. "I feel I'm very non-threatening. 
It's very intentional. I want this to be a place that they look forward to 
coming to every day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As she told students the first day: "I'm not a policeman. I'm not a classroom 
discipline monitor. That's not what I'm here for." 
</P>
<P>
 What she is there for is to teach. And teaching, for Elsenbaumer, has less to 
do with lectures and drills than stimulating children's natural curiosity so 
that they pursue knowledge on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting students in noisy groups rather than quiet rows, drawing lessons from 
life instead of textbooks and emphasizing hands-on classroom projects instead 
of rote learning are all goals of the state and national school reform 
movement. Lincoln School as a whole has a reputation for a nontraditional 
approach to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mrs. E goes further with these techniques than many of her colleagues, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a key to her success, they said, is her ability to capture and hold 
children's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a great deal of energy and enthusiasm," Ventura Assistant Supt. Pat 
Chandler said. "This is infectious for children. If your teacher is excited 
about learning, you're more apt to be." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kari Hale said: "She teaches kids in a real fun way." 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of Elsenbaumer's classroom, she has taped a blown-up aerial 
photo of Ventura with a sign inviting children to pinpoint where they live. 
Across the room, three plump rats scurry in a large wire cage and a worn 
recliner beckons students to curl up to read or to play with the pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teachers may consider wriggling rats or comfortable chairs as dangerous 
distractions from the business of learning. But Elsenbaumer is less concerned 
about children becoming distracted than getting bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are normally really happy to be in here and I think it's because of the 
creature comforts," Elsenbaumer said. "I have to compete with their every 
sense. I'm competing with MTV and cable television to captivate their minds. If 
they're bored, I don't have them. I have to reach them." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsenbaumer knows firsthand about the consequences of failing to reach a 
child. It happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
 At school in her native Oklahoma City, Elsenbaumer performed poorly, she said. 
Although she was creative and had a natural aptitude for science, she 
nevertheless felt unnoticed and unappreciated by teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while attending Oklahoma State University, Elsenbaumer at first majored 
in biology. 
</P>
<P>
 But she switched to education after spending a summer working with children at 
a Catalina Island marine institute, the same one where she now makes a yearly 
trip with students. She moved to California after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her sixth year teaching, the 32-year-old Elsenbaumer has her master's 
in education from Cal Lutheran University and is one of the Ventura Unified 
School District's three science mentor teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mentor teacher, Elsenbaumer receives a $4,000 yearly stipend on top of 
her $31,594 salary to show other teachers new ways to teach science. 
</P>
<P>
 She is married to Bill Elsenbaumer, a plumbing contractor. Their daughter, 
Tawney, is now a third-grader at Lincoln School in the classroom next to 
Elsenbaumer's. Son Teddy is 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanned and pretty, with a quick smile and long, wavy hair streaked blond by 
the sun, she has a penchant for wearing dangling earrings and flowing skirts 
and for sometimes going barefoot in her classroom when the children are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 And her exuberance often seems to match that of her students. "I still relate 
to what they're going through," she said.

ELECTIONS / SIMI VALLEY CITY COUNCIL; 7 COMPETE FOR THE SPOTLIGHT IN QUEST FOR 
2 SEATS; CAMPAIGN: ONE INCUMBENT AND SIX CHALLENGERS ARE CONCOCTING CREATIVE 
WAYS TO GRAB ATTENTION IN A RACE WHERE ALL HOLD SIMILAR POSITIONS ON THE MAJOR 
ISSUES.

<P>
 Most days, Simi Valley's former police chief trots through quiet city streets 
on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Chamber of Commerce president wanders around neighborhoods, ringing 
door bells of perfect strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 And a planning commissioner is handing out thousands of POGs imprinted with 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalk it all up to politics, as seven candidates compete for two seats on the 
Simi Valley City Council. One incumbent and six challengers are concocting 
creative ways to grab public attention in a race among candidates holding 
similar positions on the major issues facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues are pretty clear, and people are pretty happy with the way the 
city is being run," said Mayor Greg Stratton, who is running unopposed for a 
fifth term, except for a teen-age write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to each council candidate's campaign platform are continuation of Simi 
Valley's status as one of the safest cities of its size in the nation, 
construction of a bigger, better police station and aggressive efforts to bring 
new businesses and jobs to town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, people just want us to continue in the direction we've been 
going," Stratton said. "That seems to be what most of the candidates have in 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, ever so mindful of their similar perspectives on the issues, the 
council contenders are focusing on the benefits their own personal experience 
would bring to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Webb, a political novice when first elected to the council four years 
ago, says she has gained valuable lessons that will make her a more effective 
lawmaker in a second term. Webb, the only elected Libertarian in Ventura 
County, is also the only woman running for council. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller promises he'll bring an insider's 
expertise to the job, while insurance consultant and Planning Commissioner Dean 
F. Kunicki boasts of his hundreds of hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. McCaffrey, an insurance underwriter and former Simi Valley Chamber 
of Commerce president, says he has an inside line on the needs of businesses 
that will help him attract corporations and tax dollars to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Using the opposite approach, Ernest W. Federer, an administrator at a 
psychiatric hospital, is running as an outsider. He said his lack of connection 
to the city's political and business communities makes him the perfect person 
to represent the average Simi Valley resident.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Vesalga, who recently ran for mayor of Los Angeles, views himself as 
an expert on what Simi Valley should not do, if it wants to avoid becoming 
another San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And salesman Douglas R. Dubin, the youngest candidate for council, at age 27, 
promises to make his youthfulness an asset by urging the city to become more 
accessible to younger residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Republican activist Steve Frank and others involved in local politics 
believe that without a burning issue the candidates will have a tough time 
capturing the voters' interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big yawner," said Frank, who unsuccessfully challenged Stratton for 
mayor two years ago. "There's nothing really interesting going on, so people 
have turned their attention elsewhere. There may be a hundred people, total, 
who are paying attention to this race." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels, who opted to run for county supervisor instead of 
seeking a second term on the council, sympathized with the challenge facing 
those candidates trying to take her place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is in a position where luckily there aren't many issues," Mikels 
said. "But that makes it difficult to separate yourself from the pack. It's 
easier when there's some big issue you can take hold of and oppose or support." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, development has been a major issue, with candidates staking out 
positions on an acceptable rate of growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the candidates are paying little attention to the issue this election 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth is not a big issue because the economy is down and there isn't much 
development going on," Stratton said. "That's the issue that usually pops up 
during elections. But there's so little happening right now that it's just not 
an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor have the candidates done much opponent-bashing, another device popular in 
past city elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers may have learned from the 1992 election that attacking incumbents 
is not a winning strategy, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, voters reelected Stratton mayor over four challengers. They also 
chose to fill two open council seats with incumbent Councilman Bill Davis and 
newcomer Barbara Williamson, who ran on a pro-council platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows the public is pretty happy with what the council is doing," Stratton 
said. "Also having an open seat makes it easier not to be critical. You don't 
have to attack anybody on the council to have a shot at getting elected." 
</P>
<P>
 The only negative campaigning has come from the Police Officer's Assn., which 
is endorsing Webb and McCaffrey and urging voters not to support Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ron Lompart, vice president of the association, said the union takes 
issue with Miller's "safe city" campaign slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Miller is taking credit for Simi Valley's status as a safe city, and 
that is false," Lompart said. "Credit cannot be applied to a single 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller defended his campaign, saying he is not taking full credit for the 
city's low-crime record, but only pledging to work to keep it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing their campaigns lack political spice, the candidates are plotting 
attention-getting tactics to perk up voter interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunning the traditional political buttons and bumper stickers, Kunicki is 
handing out campaign POGs, hoping youngsters will take the cardboard milk caps 
home and leave them in their parents' view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have all these kids following me around, it's unbelievable," Kunicki said. 
"I feel like the Pied Piper." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has churned out a steady flow of news releases touting his campaign 
happenings, including a third-place prize at Simi Valley Days for his "safe 
city" chili. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the former Chief Miller began trotting through the city's Bridle 
Path neighborhood on horseback, old-fashioned police style, handing out lawn 
signs and brochures to residents observing the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Federer wanted to take the horse theme one step further, with a bucking bronco 
ride in the Simi Valley Days rodeo. But cooler heads prevailed. "I was really 
bummed," he said. "They said you need to be a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesalga, who had hoped to spend many hours canvassing door-to-door, recently 
suffered a cracked rib after he tackled a graffiti vandal who was 
spray-painting a fence near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really slowed me down," he said. "It sort of makes you wonder how safe 
this city really is." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, who grabbed headlines in her first campaign by canvassing precincts on 
roller skates, won't be repeating the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendinitis of the heel will slow her down during the campaign. She plans 
instead to plant herself at a booth in front of the city's Target and K mart 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I covered a lot of ground on skates," Webb said. "Now people know me, so they 
may be more willing to come up and talk to me than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said she plans to run commercials on cable television, a strategy many 
say helped her win the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 After financing the 1990 race largely with her own money, Webb has pledged to 
hold enough fund-raisers and sell enough $10 T-shirts that she won't be forced 
to dip into her personal bank account to pay for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve that goal, Webb is pressing her supporters to give generously. She 
and Mikels, who has endorsed her, have joined together to host a cocktail 
party, charging $250 a head and splitting the take. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaffrey hopes to match Webb's money-raising success with a $125-per-person 
reception at the Clarion Hotel on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the reality is it costs money to get your message out to the 
voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kunicki, who said he plans to spend as much as $35,000, is planning a series 
of Monday night football fund-raisers and an afternoon reception on Oct. 8 
sponsored by Councilman Bill Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum, Miller threw a $20-per-plate barbecue and 
barn dance and is planning several other low-priced events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in jacking up the price real high and getting a few people," 
Miller said. "I'd rather keep the cost down and get a lot of people to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the candidates scoff at the notion of any sort of fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesalga, who says voters are angry with politicians who spend big bucks to run 
for office, plans to keep his campaign budget under $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin says he will fuel his campaign almost entirely with volunteers. He 
expects to spend only about $500 from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have raised none and we expect to raise none," Dubin said. "We don't think 
spending large quantities of other people's money is in the best interests of 
the community." Simi Valley City Council 
</P>
<P>
 Seven candidates, including one incumbent, are running for two council seats. 
Safety and the economy top the list of concerns, with most candidates favoring 
plans for a new police station and increased efforts to lure new businesses to 
town.  
</P>

four-year resident of Simi Valley's Wood Ranch housing tract, Dubin helped 
launch a newsletter for the Village on the Green Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: As the youngest candidate, Dubin is appealing to voters under 35 with 
a promise of bringing a fresh perspective to City Hall. He wants to speed up 
repairs on buildings and roads damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake and persuade 
businesses to redevelop abandoned commercial space before building new 
developments. Dubin also opposes any mixed-use construction projects until all 
existing buildings are occupied.

down and improve services. He served as a Marine Corps intelligence specialist 
during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Federer calls for tougher penalties for juvenile curfew offenders and 
paramedic training for county firefighters. He also wants to extend the city's 
growth-control ordinance. He vehemently opposes low-income housing and 
mixed-use developments. Federer is also against most development on the 
hillsides above the city, although he is undecided on plans for a regional mall 
in the hills on the north side of the city.

the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, the Cultural Arts Committee and 
the Simi Valley Education Foundation. He has also served on two neighborhood 
councils, founded a Neighborhood Watch program and helped draft laws on drug 
paraphernalia and the city's water rate structure. Kunicki ran for council once 
before, in 1982, coming in ninth out of 17 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Kunicki wants to improve Simi Valley's economy by luring commercial 
and industrial development to the city. Instead of relying on city staff to woo 
businesses, Kunicki would contact corporations and urge them to move to Simi 
Valley. He wants to expand the role of the city's four neighborhood councils in 
developing city policy.

 Occupation: self-employed insurance underwriter 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in political science from Cal State Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A 10-year Simi Valley resident, McCaffrey served a year as 
president of the city's Chamber of Commerce. He has also served on a 
neighborhood council, city transportation planning agency and the Simi Valley 
Historical Society. During college, McCaffrey worked as an intern for 
then-Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel), known for his advocacy of high-technology 
jobs and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: McCaffrey wants to boost the city's image with an aggressive marketing 
campaign. His main goal is to attract more high-tech industry to Simi Valley to 
boost the city's tax base and its population of young professionals. McCaffrey 
is willing to consider mixed-use projects if they receive widespread community 
support. He also wants to improve the city's Police Department and its schools.

</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in religion from UCLA, attended classes at 
California Baptist Theological Seminary, master's degree in public 
communication from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Miller served as chief of the Simi Valley Police Department for 12 
years. During his tenure, the city was rated four years in a row as one of the 
safest of its size in the country. Miller is widely recognized as helping turn 
the Police Department from a troubled agency mired in lawsuits and allegations 
of brutality into a highly respected police force. Before coming to Simi 
Valley, Miller briefly studied to become a Presbyterian minister and then 
switched careers, serving for 20 years as an officer in the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Miller's campaign platform focuses on public safety. An outspoken 
supporter of a proposed new police station, Miller would establish a new 
volunteer-driven crime prevention program. Miller opposes mixed-use 
development, which he considers a beacon for crime and other urban problems. 
Miller says his experience as a head of one of the city's four major 
departments helps him understand the complexities of running a city.

</P>
<P>
 Background: Vesalga has worked as a short-order cook, house painter, 
electrician and mechanic. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 
1992, before moving to Simi Valley. He serves on a neighborhood council and is 
an alternate to the Ventura County Arts Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Vesalga supports construction of a new police station and the hiring 
of more police officers. He thinks the city should work to attract a developer 
to build a regional mall in the hills above the city. He also wants the city to 
make a big push to attract non-polluting businesses like health care agencies 
and insurance companies.

 Sandi Webb  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 46

<P>
 Occupation: councilwoman, owner of a building design and drafting service 
</P>
<P>
 Education: associate of arts degree from San Bernardino Valley College 
</P>
<P>
 Background: In an upset win, Webb was elected to the council in 1990 with 
virtually no political experience. Webb is a member of the Libertarian Party. A 
member of the National Rifle Assn., Webb has worked hard to gain approval for a 
controversial gun range. She has pressed her peers to support funding and 
construction of a new police station without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Webb continues to support construction of a new police station. 
Concerned about the bumps and cracks on some of the city's streets, Webb says 
she wants to look for ways to get more funding for road repairs. She also hopes 
to ease the application process for businesses seeking permits for construction 
and expansion.

HOUSE OF WORSHIP CAUSES BACK-YARD RIFT IN OAK PARK; JUDAISM: ORTHODOX CHABAD OF 
THE CONEJO ANGERS SOME RESIDENTS, WHO SAY ISSUE IS LAND USE. ZONING LAW IS ON 
THEIR SIDE, LEADERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The house is simple: single-story, beige stucco with brown trim and a 
well-watered lawn. From Conifer Street, it looks just like any other 
comfortable suburban home in Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors watch it as suspiciously as if it were the haunt of drug 
dealers, counting the cars parked in front, the visitors coming and going. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house, members of Chabad of the Conejo, an orthodox Jewish group, 
are equally uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Their neighbors do not want them there. They say they have nothing against 
Jews, but they do not welcome a house of worship in their residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions have risen on both sides, escalating to the point of physical 
confrontations between Chabad members and neighbors on two occasions last week. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no end in sight to the conflict: The residents, with the tenacity 
typical in the Oak Park community, are threatening to take Chabad to court if 
necessary to oust it from Conifer Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried very hard from the beginning to make it clear this is a land 
use issue," said Howard Fox, the attorney retained by the Medea Creek 
Neighborhood Assn. "We don't want Chabad out of the neighborhood. We just don't 
want them in that house." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the matter, Fox said, is that he and other neighbors think 
traffic in and out of the house is excessive for the quiet street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want 70 people coming and going from that house," he added. "It's 
like living next to a neighbor who has a party every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 But members of Chabad are just as adamant. One of the tenets of their religion 
is that they live within walking distance of their place of worship. They say 
there is nowhere else to go in the neighborhood, and a relocation would involve 
uprooting 25 families. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is on their side, members of Chabad say, and they believe they will be 
allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally feel that people should welcome churches and synagogues into 
their community," said Rabbi Moshe Bryski, Chabad's leader. "The zoning laws 
make that exception for residential neighborhoods. Why in the world would that 
exception be made? Because this is where they belong." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bryski hopes eventually to restore cordial relations with Chabad's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be happy until I'm friends with my neighbors," Bryski said. "It's 
over with when I shake hands with my neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But handshakes are a distant hope at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad bought the house on Conifer Street more than a year ago, and has been 
holding services there since then, without a conditional use permit from the 
county. For six years Chabad held services in a rented space on Kanan Road and 
Sunnycrest Drive, but when the group lost their lease they moved to Conifer 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chabad members wanted to expand the house, giving it a more 
synagogue-like appearance and adding a second story, they applied to Ventura 
County planners for permits. They were told the expansion violated the basic 
residential feel of the neighborhood, and later came back with scaled back 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conditional use permit application asks that the group be allowed to 
hold services for up to 70 people in the house three times a week, and to have 
Bible study classes at night, Sunday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Planning Commission did not approve the request at its Sept. 8 
meeting. The vote was 2 to 1 in favor, and staff had recommended approval. But 
with two members absent, a majority was lacking and the commission could not 
issue the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad has appealed to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, which will 
hear the case in late October. In the interim, county planners are allowing 
Chabad to hold services. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, the neighbors have made their objections clear, circulating 
petitions and attending contentious community meetings to complain about the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 A core group of two dozen neighbors have hired a lawyer and are preparing for 
a lawsuit if the permit is approved. They say they have the support of as many 
as 400 other residents in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors say they mistrust Chabad. They do not believe Bryski's emphatic 
statements that the planned expansion is designed only to make the 
congregation's current 60 members more comfortable, not to allow for future 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They worry about having more cars parked on their streets -- some members of 
Chabad do drive to services -- they worry about noise from the group, and they 
worry about loss of privacy, particularly when Chabad breaks for refreshments 
in the back yard of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "My privacy has been completely shot to hell," said Martha Helton, a resident 
whose back yard is kitty-cornered to Chabad's house. "I lay out by my pool in a 
bikini and all these little heads pop over the fence and look at me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at me," Helton said, gesturing to her lightly tanned arm. "I've quit 
laying out. We're talking having 70 holy people look at me in a little bikini. 
That's embarrassing. My choice is being denied." 
</P>
<P>
 The culture clash extends beyond bikinis. When Chabad erected a plywood succah 
-- a small outdoor hut needed to celebrate the harvest festival Succot, which 
took place last week -- the neighbors were horrified at its appearance, and 
angry over how it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the top of the succah is covered with palm fronds. Last Sunday, 
members of the congregation went across Conifer Street to gather the palm 
fronds from a stand of trees at the headquarters of the Oak Park Unified School 
District headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children roller-blading observed bearded men wearing yarmulkes who were 
sawing off palm fronds. The children reported back to their father, Jim Fox, a 
nearby resident and Chabad opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox took his camera and drove up to school district headquarters, eager to 
capture any wrong-doing by Chabad members on film. Two men were stacking palm 
leaves in the back of a car when he arrived. He began to take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the younger guy this is school property and you have no business 
cutting these palms," Fox said. "Then the older gentleman came out from behind 
the car with a saw in his hand. He started yelling and running at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped in my Suburban and he physically opened my passenger door and tried 
to grab at me," Fox said. Fox said he hit the gas and sped away from the 
parking lot, pushing the man aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came home and I was shaking," Fox added. He said he called police and 
reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 No members of Chabad were available to comment on the incident, but Oak Park's 
assistant superintendent of schools, Stanley Mantooth, confirmed that he 
received an apologetic phone call from a member of Chabad, saying they had not 
known the palms were considered private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of Chabad said they have been the victims of anti-Semitic 
actions in recent weeks. Cars have screeched down Conifer, their occupants 
shouting out "Heil Hitler" and ethnic slurs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their answering machine has been filled with messages suggesting that Oak Park 
is not the place for orthodox Jews. Bryski had to dodge an object thrown from a 
car last week while he was leading a religious procession down Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi said he does not blame his neighbors for the mounting anti-Semitism. 
He believes the examples of bigotry he has seen are coming from outside the 
immediate neighborhood, spurred on by publicity about Chabad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not coming from my neighbors," he said. "But as much as my neighbors 
want to keep this a land use issue, it has brought out anti-Semitic feelings in 
others. It has brought out the worst in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 It has also brought out fears in Oak Park's Jewish community, which extends 
beyond Chabad membership, including many residents who worship elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On a ridge in Oak Park last Sunday, a group of eight residents, including some 
Chabad members, confronted Ken Kegler, of Thousand Oaks, and Dane Vannett, of 
Moorpark, while they were flying model replicas of German World War II 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, carrying a sword, a crossbow and hatchet, demanded to know if 
Kegler and Vannett were Nazi sympathizers, according to the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied to learn the men were merely aviation enthusiasts, the group left. 
But Kegler and Vannett called the police, concerned that they might be accused 
of a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesman said the department was 
satisfied that no crime had occurred and that the incident is no longer under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryski said he knew a few members of his congregation were involved in the 
altercation, but that he knew nothing about weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be concerned about someone looking up and seeing a swastika 
flying overhead," Bryski said. "But when they talked to the men, they were 
convinced that there was no malice in their hearts or their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryski said he would have recommended calling the police when the swastika was 
first spotted. "But as it turns out there was nothing and that was good." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the conflict over the Chabad worship center was not 
related to the incident over the model airplanes. But he acknowledged that fear 
of anti-Semitism has put everyone in the community on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the most vocal opponents of Chabad said they believe the group is 
over-inflating the issue of anti-Semitism to blur what they consider a land use 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're using it as a point in their favor," said Louis Fishstein, whose 
property faces the back of Chabad. "It's not Chabad that anyone is opposing, 
it's strictly a land use issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishstein points out that he and his wife, Arlene, are Jewish and have 
attended services at Chabad from time to time. But when they look over the 
fence in their neat back yard, they want to see a traditional family at play, 
not a group of people celebrating a religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been happy here for 17 years," Fishstein said. "Don't we have a right 
to keep this a residential neighborhood?"

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; MARITIME DAYS FESTIVAL OFFERS FUN BY THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scattered among the old fishhooks and used deep-sea diving equipment lay the 
remnants of a maritime past: a 1934 wooden deck chair from the Queen Mary, 
brass spyglasses and an assortment of wood-carved helms. 
</P>
<P>
 For the seaman selling the peculiar objets d'art Saturday, the seaside swap 
meet was an opportunity to unload some old junk. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the dozens of visitors attending the sixth annual Maritime Days 
festival at the Channel Islands Harbor, the nautical tidbits were a brush with 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the swap meet, Saturday's events featured arts and crafts, a 
sand-sculpture contest and live entertainment at Fisherman's Wharf. Sponsored 
by local businesses, the three-day festival concludes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is simply to draw attention to the harbor by facilitating 
waterside activities," Coast Chandlery owner Fred Buenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people in Ventura County who have never been to the 
harbor," he said. "We would like to introduce it to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gesturing to a late 19th-Century brass chest at the swap meet, Roger -- a 
hawker who declined to give his last name -- explained the box's historical 
significance to a couple strolling the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to build these for English people to hold the coal," the sailor 
from Cabo San Lucas said. "It's worth $2,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Chandlery sponsored a fishing derby which drew about 25 to 30 children 
Saturday morning. Youngsters were awarded prizes for the heaviest, longest and 
ugliest fish. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the sand sculpture contest on Hollywood Beach, Susan and Tom O'Brien of 
Port Hueneme joined their son Patrick, 4, in molding a 12-foot-long shark out 
of damp sand at the ocean's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the shark you would catch off the coast of the Channel Islands -- 
hopefully on a hook, not a surfboard," Susan said, patting the sand creature's 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 "His name is Jaws," Patrick piped up, while he and his dad carved a sand 
surfer's leg entering the great white's gaping mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Oxnard youths Billy Peet, 14, and Thomas Buenger, debated what kind of 
sculpture to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought, 'Hey, we'll build the Monterey Bay Aquarium,' " Thomas said. "But 
we couldn't do the underground tunnel for the sharks. Then we decided just to 
do a castle." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GIRL, 16, INJURED IN BACKCOUNTRY FALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Search and Rescue team was sent into the backcountry near the 
"Narrows" in Santa Paula Canyon late Saturday to carry out a 16-year-old 
Camarillo girl, who slipped and fell into a narrow gorge, injuring her head and 
leg, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Doud was listed in fair condition at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital after 
suffering head injuries, a twisted ankle and cuts from the fall, hospital 
spokeswoman said.Two of the teen-ager's companions stayed by her side while 
another friend hiked the hourlong route back to St. Thomas Aquinas College, 
where he called rescue personnel who arrived just before 5 p.m., said Capt. 
Norman Plott of the Ventura County Fire Department's Summit Station. 
</P>
<P>
 A helicopter rescue unit and Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue team from 
Ojai responded, Plott said. The helicopter was not able to land in the steep 
gorge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had to carry the teen-ager out in a stretcher down Santa Paula Creek 
for nearly a mile until members reached level ground where the helicopter could 
land, Plott said. It took the rescue personnel nearly an hour before reaching 
the helicopter landing area. The girl was taken to Santa Paula Memorial 
Hospital at about 7 p.m. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2 MEN ROBBED IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
</P>

<P>
 Two men were robbed at gunpoint in separate incidents in Simi Valley and 
Moorpark, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley incident, John Huecker, 29, was struck on the head as he 
slept and was then kidnaped from his home in the 3300 block of Felix Avenue 
about 2 a.m. Friday, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two assailants, both armed with handguns, ordered Huecker to drive them to 
the Box Canyon area of Simi Valley, where they handcuffed him to an abandoned 
trash truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking Huecker's boots, wallet with about $400 in cash and the keys to 
his house and car, the men left in Huecker's car, authorities said. One of the 
men fired the gun toward the handcuffed Huecker but missed him, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huecker was able to free himself at daylight and then walked to a nearby 
residence. He was not injured during the incident, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, Emilio Espinoza Anaya was robbed about noon Friday, Moorpark 
deputies said. Anaya was walking on Pointdexter Avenue when he was approached 
by a woman who said she was in pain and needed help. A man who deputies said 
was posing as a priest approached from across the street and offered to assist 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest and the woman led Anaya toward an isolated area, where two men 
suddenly approached from behind and forced Anaya to the ground, authorities 
said. While the men held a gun to Anaya, the man posing as a priest took 
Anaya's money and jewelry, estimated at about $500, authorities said. TRACY

STATE ETHICS BOARD CUTS TIES WITH LOS ANGELES PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of the state agency that investigates political corruption has 
accused his counterpart at the Los Angeles Ethics Commission of a series of 
ethical lapses -- problems so severe that he said he has cut off interaction 
between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission Executive Director Ben Bycel leaked confidential 
information, threatened attorneys and botched sensitive negotiations by 
shifting his positions, according to a letter by Wayne Ordos, executive 
director of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel called the letter -- delivered last week to state and city ethics 
commissioners -- a "vicious personal attack." He said he believed the 
complaints about him were rooted in the state agency's jealousy that the 
upstart city Ethics Commission helped launch a series of high-profile 
investigations into political money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 At the regular city Ethics Commission meeting Thursday morning, members voiced 
support for Bycel. "It's a very unfair attack on Ben, and we have full 
confidence in him," Commissioner Ed Guthman said. Commission President Dennis 
Curtis said Bycel is doing a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission and Fair Political Practices Commission collaborated on 
several investigations, in large part because the city agency has a small staff 
and no in-house attorneys to investigate corruption. For example, city ethics 
officials uncovered a money laundering scheme by Evergreen America Corp., a 
giant shipping firm. State agency lawyers and investigators helped prove the 
allegations, resulting in a record $895,000 fine and Evergreen's admission that 
it funneled $172,000 in campaign contributions through third parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the public was being told of cooperative efforts to blot out 
corruption, tensions were quietly simmering between the state agency and Bycel, 
Ordos acknowledged in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-page letter depicts Bycel as a publicity-hungry zealot who could not 
keep private discussions about pending cases to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordos accused Bycel of telling the press of the Evergreen settlement before it 
was to be announced at a public Ethics Commission meeting. He also accused 
Bycel of asking to time the announcement of another significant case to a major 
sporting event to get more publicity. (No further explanation was given in the 
letter.) And Ordos noted that a Superior Court judge ordered Bycel to drop out 
of another investigation earlier this year after the judge found that Bycel had 
shown bias toward the subjects of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter investigation involved relatives and associates of Arthur Snyder, a 
former city councilman and influential City Hall lobbyist. Snyder has not been 
accused of any campaign violations and denies wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission and political practices commission have also been 
investigating political contributions by employees and associates of the Los 
Angeles Marathon. No one has been accused of wrongdoing in that case, and that 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how the rift between the two agencies will affect those 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have long been concerned about your apparent inability to disengage your 
personal feelings and biases from our cases," Ordos said in the letter. "My 
staff has reported a number of instances in which you have asked them to focus 
on 'getting' one person or another even though the facts were not yet in place 
to warrant such a prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordos also concluded that after an initial tip from the Ethics Commission, 
"virtually everything done" to settle the watershed Evergreen case was the 
result of the state agency's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel hotly contested that assertion and most others in Ordos' letter, saying 
that the Ethics Commission had carried at least half the burden by exposing the 
money laundering by the shipping firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel also denied that he had leaked information to the news media or others. 
He declined to discuss most other specifics in Ordos' letter but said 
"philosophical differences about what the public expects from an enforcement 
agency" are at the heart of the dispute.

BODY FOUND AT PLANT IDENTIFIED AS INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a man found in a 55-gallon steel drum at a meat rendering plant in 
South-Central has been identified as an escaped inmate from a state prison in 
Norco, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Corrales, 47, an inmate serving a 10-year drug sentence at the 
California Rehabilitation Center, was discovered dead inside the drum Thursday 
morning by workers at the Darling Delaware Co., which recycles inedible meat 
parts and grease for use in products such as pet food. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials, the drum containing meat scraps was picked up Thursday 
from the prison's culinary facility by a refrigerated truck. Preliminary 
findings of the Riverside Sheriff's Department indicate Corrales was attempting 
to escape from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Riverside County coroner said an autopsy will be conducted 
Monday.

BEAR LIKELY TO HAVE HOME WITHIN WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samson the pool-hopping black bear should have a permanent home within a week, 
according to state wildlife officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Several zoos and wildlife organizations, including the Orange County Zoo, have 
made serious offers offered to permanently house the 400-pound bear, Department 
of Fish and Game spokesman Jeff Weir said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Samson was captured in Monrovia on Sept. 18 and was to have been killed until 
he won a last-minute stay of execution from Gov. Pete Wilson after the 
neighborhood in which the bear had frolicked all summer mobilized to save him. 
He is staying at a Rancho Cordova state facility until officials can find a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Zoo curator Forrest De Spain said he is trying to obtain funding 
from the Orange County Board of Supervisors to build a large, $100,000 exhibit 
-- complete with logs, rocks, a waterfall, and a pool -- to house the 
now-famous animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir said the department is looking for a facility that would provide Samson 
with at least 800 square feet of space, and use the bear as part of an 
educational program. The Orange County Zoo is a serious contender, he said.

DETECTIVES INVESTIGATING 16 COMPLAINTS AT WILMINGTON CEMETERY; SCANDAL: A 
FORMER CARETAKER IS THE CENTER OF A PROBE OF THE GRAVEYARD, WHICH IS PLAGUED BY 
ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER BURIALS AND LACK OF DEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Betty Shanklin kneels beside the grave of her father in Wilmington 
Cemetery, the anguish over his death last December is heightened by months of 
frustrating dealings with the cemetery's operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The grave of Cleophos Gordon, who died at the age of 89 after living in the 
harbor area for 50 years, remains unmarked despite the $250 Shanklin paid for a 
headstone that was supposed to be erected by May 5. Shanklin is not even sure 
that her father's body is buried legally because she still has not received a 
deed for the plots sold to her nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about respect," she said. "It's taken everything out of me. My father 
worked too long and hard to say he can't have a headstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin is not the only person despairing over burials at the publicly owned, 
137-year-old Wilmington Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division is investigating 16 
complaints that a caretaker at the cemetery accepted money from grieving 
families in exchange for plots and headstones that do not exist or have not 
been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have yet been filed against the caretaker, Je-Rome Poland, who was 
fired this summer after nearly three years at the facility, officials of the 
Wilmington Cemetery District said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detective Robert Contreras said the case will be turned over to county 
prosecutors next month for consideration of grand theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade Albright, the cemetery district's president, said Poland was contracted 
in October, 1991, to do landscaping and handle burials at the cemetery. But he 
soon expanded his role -- without the board's knowledge -- to sell plots and 
headstones from an office at the cemetery and later from an office on Avalon 
Boulevard, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were asking questions and we started checking it out," he said. "We 
dismissed his services in July." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland, who is working in the Pomona area, said he has been in recent contact 
with the LAPD and the cemetery board. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention is to work with the board and resolve who owns what, and to work 
with the families to resolve the matters, whatever they are, as soon as 
possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said new complaints are being received by police almost every day. 
"Some of (the victims) are out $300, some are out thousands of dollars," the 
detective said. He declined to specify how much Poland had received, but 
estimated the sum at tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Cemetery Board, which oversees maintenance funds and audits the 
trusts of California's crematories and nearly 200 privately owned cemeteries, 
has no jurisdiction over the public Wilmington Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board is about to hand over to prosecutors the results of its own 
investigation into similar complaints about Poland at the Sunnyside Cemetery in 
Long Beach, according to Executive Director Raymond Giunta. Poland owned that 
cemetery for a few days in June before selling it to the state when he could 
not meet license requirements for a financial plan, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmington Cemetery has been at the center of controversy at least since 1991, 
when 12 families filed suits against the cemetery district, the board of 
trustees and a former caretaker, alleging improper burials. The case is 
scheduled to go to trial Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland was also a defendant in the civil action for allegedly reinterring 
bodies without relatives' written consent, but that part of the case was 
recently settled, according to Scott E. Schutzman, the attorney representing 11 
of the families. 
</P>
<P>
 Schutzman said Poland discovered that 190 caskets were buried only inches deep 
by the previous caretaker, so he had them reburied deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We settled with Je-Rome because whatever acts he did go back to the cemetery 
district," he said. "They told him what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Albright said the cemetery district will not accept responsibility for 
Poland's actions because he was an independent contractor. The board has filed 
its own complaint with police over the former caretaker's practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin, who bought four plots for $1,450, said she now believes only one 
grave exists -- and laments her decision to bury her father at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland came to my home and he picked up the cashier's check. I had it made 
out to Wilmington Cemetery, but he said the check had to be to Down to Earth 
Maintenance (Poland's company)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never suspect that someone would be doing that to you when you're 
going through (a death)."

Children organization to be used to modify the juvenile division's victim 
interview rooms at the Police Department's Parker Center headquarters. The

Los Angeles Aging Service Agencies to fund recovery services for senior 
citizens affected by the Jan. 17 earthquake. The bulk of the $2.2 million from

<P>
 In an effort to dispel the notion that the compositions of Alberto Ginastera 
or Aaron Copland (pictured) belong to an elite listening corps, the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Orchestra is coming to South Gate's Municipal Auditorium this week 
for a free performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled at the opportunity of having such talent come to our 
community," said Dodie Mosby, the head of the Department of Parks and 
Recreation."Classical music holds universal appeal, and we expect a large 
turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Gershon will conduct the evening's show, which will feature 
mezzo-soprano Carmella Jones. The evening's program will feature Latin music 
and composers, including Manuel de Falla's "Siete Canciones Populares 
Espanoles" and Copland's "Three Latin-American Sketches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic's neighborhood concerts are made possible by a grant from 
Target stores and additional funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, 
the California Arts Council, the County Board of Supervisors, the County Music 
and Performing Arts Commission and the city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>

VOICES: YOUTHS DELIVER MESSAGE OF UNITY IN NEW MAGAZINE; STAFF WRITER SHALONDA 
DARTIS, 19, SAYS 'READY OR NOT, WE'RE HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shalonda Dartis graduated with honors from Washington Prep High School. She 
was handpicked from her magnet English class by Unity L.A. magazine publisher 
Shelly Miller to be one of its founding staff writers. Unity L.A. is a 
nonprofit corporation founded by Miller to help improve the lives of teen-agers 
and young adults in Los Angeles mainly through the magazine, which is written, 
illustrated and produced by a staff of nearly 40 youths drawn from area high 
schools and through Unity's affiliation with the nonprofit Latina Teens 
Project. The magazine, which concentrates on cultural and social issues and 
featured actress Rosie Perez on its first cover, has begun circulating 
throughout the Los Angeles area. Dartis, a student at Los Angeles City College 
where she is preparing to pursue a degree in journalism, celebrated her 19th 
birthday with the recent release of Unity's premiere issue. She was interviewed 
by Jaymi Goldberg. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to cut the bull. And ready or not, we're here to tell the truth. 
That's what Unity magazine is all about. We are a bunch of young people who 
have come together to try to make a difference. We feel like this is our time, 
and if we don't do something soon, the next generation will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes me sad that some young kids are learning terrible things in their 
home, because that's where it all begins. That's where racism gets started. I 
can't understand how parents could teach their children to be racists. What you 
learn at home is the basis for everything else. But if we can get to a point 
where the majority of people think the way we do, we can make racists the 
minority -- then maybe they'll come home one day and wonder why everyone thinks 
differently than they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they'll say, "Momma, why do you say that black people are wrong?" Maybe 
they'll see more and more interracial relationships and wonder why they've been 
taught that that is wrong. Maybe they'll start listening to other people's 
ideas and question what they've been taught, and make up their own minds. Once 
they figure out that their opinions are in the minority, they might be able to 
see our point of view.  
</P>
<P>
 We know that to get that point across we have to say it loud, and that means 
we have to be controversial. Unity isn't all about controversy -- it's about 
unity, and people putting their differences aside and working together to break 
racism. But the first issue is controversial. It has to be, or no one hears the 
message. We can't just walk around and ask nicely, "Hi. Please don't be racist 
anymore" and expect that anything will change.  
</P>
<P>
 Unity is powerful, particularly the section I wrote with Robert Wright, my 
partner in "He Said, She Said." When we first started writing "He Said, She 
Said," I wrote down a lot of ideas, and we decided to write our first article 
on racism. His point of view on racism and how it got started was different 
than mine, but I still saw his point of view. That's the way I think it should 
be in life. We all have different opinions, but that doesn't mean we can't all 
try to understand each other.  
</P>
<P>
 All of us at the magazine are from different races. We all have different 
opinions. But we have one main thing in common: We're all young adults who 
aren't holding anything back, and who don't want to go on like this anymore. I 
think we just need to put our heads together and stop being so ignorant -- all 
people -- and we can end it. Whatever happened in the past to cause racism and 
to make people hate each other the way they do over color is in the past. And 
if we can't leave the past in the past, we have no future. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel a little pain inside because of what my ancestors may have gone 
through, but am I going to hate every white person I meet today because of 
that? No, I'm not. It would be ridiculous for me to decide to hate a 
15-year-old white person I see walking down the street because her ancestors 
may or may not have beaten one of my ancestors. I am from a mixed family 
myself. My mom is half black and half white, and my dad is black. How can I 
hate white people when that is a part of me? 
</P>
<P>
 It's all about knowledge. That's the first step to breaking the color lines 
and bringing us peace. Society is based on what the "big man" -- whatever that 
means to each individual person -- wants us to see, and we can't overcome that 
without knowledge. I live in South-Central, and all you hear and see about 
South-Central is gangs, drugs and prostitutes. But that's not all there is 
here. There are people here -- hard-working people, students, honor students, 
who are trying to make a better life for themselves. It isn't all society says 
it is.  
</P>
<P>
 My job is to get the facts out there, and that's a big responsibility. If all 
I'm doing is speaking from the heart about what I've done and what I've seen, 
how can I go wrong? It's all coming from my heart, and I may not have a lot of 
writing experience, except for poems and essays in junior high, but you can't 
teach heart.  
</P>
<P>
 I want to make a difference here. I hope to make people understand other 
people. I want my articles to hit everyone -- the people who agree with me and 
also the people who live every day without thinking that racism is a problem. I 
want racists to read it. I want to let them know that we're not scared. We're 
tired of this -- all of us. We're tired of being labeled, we're tired of 
talking about this, we're tired of trying to convince people that this is a 
problem. The problem is there. It's right in your face, and so are we -- trying 
to put an end to it. Racism isn't getting us anywhere.

GAME OF THE WEEK; LOYOLA FINDS IT BETTER TO RECEIVE THAN GIVE, 23-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saugus High had the third-stingiest defense among Southern Section teams in 
the Valley. Loyola had allowed only 14 points in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Something had to give when the two unbeaten teams met Thursday at Canyon High. 
The Saugus defensive backfield gave--generously--in a 23-0 rout by the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola quarterback Kyle Spielbuhler threw three long touchdown passes against 
a Centurion defense that was short-handed in the secondary without injured 
cornerbacks Mark Beatty and Jeff D'Amico. 
</P>
<P>
 The three touchdowns, plus a safety, all came in the first half. The 
Centurions, despite holding the Cubs to 100 yards rushing in 30 attempts (22 
yards in the first half), couldn't stop Spielbuhler and his receiving corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola quarterback completed 11 of 13 passes for 194 yards. Midway through 
the first quarter, Spielbuhler hit Dan Farmer on a fade pattern. Farmer, 
6-feet-4, 200 pounds, blew past 5-8, 156-pound cornerback Pat Rafter for a 
36-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs made it 9-0 when Brandon Alvarado's punt was blocked in the end zone 
by Loyola's Soren Solari. 
</P>
<P>
 After the free kick, Loyola marched 66 yards in five plays, scoring on a 
42-yard pass play from Spielbuhler to Patrick Klein for a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer, who had five catches for 104 yards and two touchdowns, scored again 
when Loyola surprised the Centurions on a 46-yard pass play with 15 seconds 
left in the first half after lining up without a huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Antelope Valley at Loyola.

NOTEBOOK; REED TO TOIL FOR MANUAL ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travis Reed is only a sophomore, but he's attending his third high school, 
Manual Arts, this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was the only freshman on Crenshaw High's state champion basketball team 
in March. After the season, the 6-foot-5 left-handed guard-forward moved to 
Fontana and played on A.B. Miller High's summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently moved back to Los Angeles and enrolled at Manual Arts. Reed will 
join a Toiler team that finished 20-5 last season and reached the City Section 
4-A quarterfinals. Manual Arts was 17-3 this summer and won the Sports World 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a pretty successful summer, but we didn't have a dominant go-to guy," 
Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said. "Travis is multitalented. He's a 
utility man who can play on the perimeter or post up. We'll play him wherever 
he is needed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches' corner: If anyone is familiar with the Marshall High football 
program, it's Jim Beattie, the first-year coach at Northern Conference rival 
Eagle Rock. Beattie coached Marshall to the 1982 City 2-A title and has been a 
teacher at the school for the last 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie, 59, who has coached either football, basketball, track or 
cross-country at Marshall since 1973, replaced Gary Kuniyuki, who resigned at 
Eagle Rock shortly before the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Belmont High boys' cross-country team is seeking its 11th City title. 
Coach Alex Carmona and assistant coaches Everaldo Silva and Jorge Marquez ran 
on the Sentinels' first City champion team in 1983. . . . 
</P>

 Soccer update: The Cal State Los Angeles soccer team is eighth in the NCAA 
Division II rankings. Senior midfielder Jesus Gonzalez, who leads the team with 
six goals and 12 points, was named most valuable player of the Cal State 
Bakersfield tournament after leading Cal State L.A. (7-0-1) to the tournament 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders Dario Gomez, Oscar Legaspi, midfielders Luis Hernandez and Juan 
Carlos Elizarraraz, and forward Mike Martinez also return for Cal State L.A., 
which is trying for its second California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in 
three years. The Golden Eagles open CCAA play Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. College is led by midfielder Sergio Vasquez, an All-South Coast 
Conference selection who scored 15 goals and helped the Huskies to a 20-2-2 
record and reach the Southern California regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Jorge Flores was a member of the United States World Cup national 
teams for ages 20-and-under and 17-and-under and was recruited by UCLA and Old 
Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also includes Flavio Rodriguez, Eddie Ferrer and Ernesto Serrano of 
Bell, Martin Castillo of Bell Gardens, Ricardo Saucedo of Garfield High and 
Arturo Lopez of Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College Football: Although UCLA was beaten by Nebraska last week, 49-21, there 
were a few shining moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman wide receiver Jim McElroy, an All-City selection from Washington High 
last season, provided a couple when he made two receptions for 32 yards in his 
first college game. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have gone unnoticed since top receivers Kevin Jordan and All-American 
J.J. Stokes get all the attention, but Stokes did not play and UCLA was getting 
blown out at the time. Their regulars were taken out and the 6-0, 170-pound 
McElroy had his chance and made the most of it.

FOOTBALL; SOUTH GATE COMES UP SHORT AGAINST BANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LATEEL FRIERSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was supposed to be a bye week for South Gate, but the Rams took the field 
against City Section powerhouse Banning and lost a nonconference game, 21-7, at 
Banning High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see what we had," South Gate Coach Gary Cordray said."I think we 
showed a lot of people we could play against anybody. It was a good ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 14-7, South Gate had a chance to tie the score late in the fourth 
quarter, but Pilots cornerback Kareem O'Neal intercepted a pass from 
quarterback Juan Vasquez, stopping a Rams drive on the Pilots' 28-yard line. 
Banning drove 72 yards to increase the lead to 21-7 on a one-yard sneak by Ira 
McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the interception took the momentum away from us and that cost us the 
ballgame," Cordray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez had eight completions in 15 attempts for 99 yards and one 
interception. Linebacker Anthony Limon had two sacks for South Gate.  
</P>
<P>
 Rams junior tackle Marcus Almanza left the game in the fourth quarter with 
torn ligaments in his left knee, which might end his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his game-saving steal, O'Neal caught three passes for 62 yards, 
including a 30-yard touchdown reception. Banning quarterback Ira McKenna threw 
for two touchdowns and ran for another. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Llamas scored South Gate's only touchdown on an eight-yard reverse to 
complete a 70-yard drive and tie the score, 7-7 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week: Huntington Park at South Gate.

 Bell Gardens 49, Lincoln 0--David York rushed for three touchdown to lead the 
Lancers to a nonconference rout of the Tigers at Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 York put Bell Gardens ahead 7-0 with a two-yard run to cap a 10-play, 60-yard 
scoring drive on Bell Gardens' first possession and start a game-long pattern 
for the Lancers.York scored on a 24-yard run on the Lancers' next possession to 
make it 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Bell Gardens kept the rout going 
with 21 second-quarter points on runs by Adam Solorzano and York and a 51-yard 
interception return by Rolando Terrazas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens kept its starters in through the third quarter, scoring twice 
more. Quarterback Eddie Negrete completed 11 of 18 passes for 169 yards, 
including a 28-yard scoring pass to Tadeo Gonzales. David Villegas capped the 
scoring with a 13-yard run.  
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln gained only 82 total yards against Bell Gardens' well-drilled defense.

 Thousand Oaks 28, Franklin 21--Sophomore running back Oscar Canela scored on a 
four-yard run with 8:28 left to bring the visiting Panthers to within seven of 
Thousand Oaks, but the Lancers' one-two running punch of Brandon Jackson and 
Mike Thomas was too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Down 21-7 in the third quarter, Jeff Deno scored on a one-yard quarterback 
sneak for Franklin and then threw a six-yard scoring pass to senior wide 
receiver Johnnie Sanders, who had seven catches for 128 yards. Deno went 
17-for-34 for 197 yards.

 Two blocked punts in the last 10 minutes resulted in a safety and a touchdown 
for Los Angeles and a 30-21 win over Wilson in a nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wesley Watson blocked a punt, Buster Bradley recovered the loose ball 
for the Mules but was tackled by Los Angeles linebacker Dipo Akinmurela in the 
end zone for a safety.On its next possession, Wilson tried another punt, which 
was blocked by Randy Simmons and recovered by Travon Kitchen for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson held a 21-6 lead after a touchdown by Bradley on a 27-yard pass from 
Eddie Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles scored 24 unanswered points beginning with Ray Adams' 27-yard 
touchdown reception from Patrick Regan. Watson then scored on a three-yard run 
in the third quarter to bring the Romans to 21-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez completed 15 of 28 passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns with one 
interception. Regan was nine-of-18 for 165 yards and a touchdown with one

 Roosevelt 24, Jordan 13--The Roughriders dominated the second half of a 
Central League game at Jordan in handing the Bulldogs their 29th consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan scored on a 43-yard pass from Termel Goss to Mitch Friend to open a

<P>
 Junior running back John Pineda scored two touchdowns in the last eight 
minutes for Roosevelt, on runs of three and 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, winless since 1991, had two spectacular touchdown plays nullified by 
penalties. A 72-yard pass from Goss to Friend in the second quarter and a 
91-yard run by Kevin Harris in the third were called back. Goss completed eight

 Washington 14, Manual Arts 7--Penalty flags flew all night long but Washington 
High's Dennis Northcutt was too busy running to worry about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about the referees, I think about the game," said Northcutt 
after he rushed for 127 yards and a touchdown in 17 carries to lead the 
Generals to a nonconference victory over host Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was marred by 19 penalties, 13 of them against Manual Arts, one of 
which negated a possible tying touchdown. Perhaps the costliest penalty came 
when Manual Arts had the ball fourth and 14 at Washington's 27-yard line with 
11 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Willie Laffitte was called 
for an illegal forward pass after he connected with receiver Timothy Boykins 
for an apparent 27-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams opened with impressive scoring drives. Manual Arts mounted a 
six-play, 80-yard march that was capped by a 21-yard pass from Laffitte to 
Boykins. Washington countered with a 68-yard drive that ended with Northcutt 
scoring on a five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest play came with less than two minutes remaining. After running back 
Brian Beckum caught a 20-yard pass to put the Toilers inside the Washington 20, 
he fumbled on the one-yard line on his next carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Laffitte completed seven of 13 passes for 132 yards, but he was also sacked 
four times for a loss of 29 yards.

 Verbum Dei 9, Belmont 2--Quarterback Corey Redeaux scored on a three-yard run 
in the second quarter in a nonleague game at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 The undefeated Eagles shut down the Sentinels' air game. Jason Steen, who 
tackled Belmont's Ismael Lopez for a safety, led the Eagles' defense, which 
forced four turnovers. Belmont, which was awarded a safety when a snap sailed 
through the end zone on a Verbum Dei punt attempt, did not help its cause with 
10 penalties for 90 yards.

 Bell 17, Jefferson 0--Vern Benard rushed for 215 yards in 26 carries to lead 
the Eagles in a Southeastern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 7-0 early in the fourth quarter, Bell had the ball at its eight-yard 
line when Benard ran 74 yards on a sweep to the Jefferson 26.Two plays later, 
quarterback Gus Valenzuela hit Gary Guerrero for a 27-yard touchdown pass to 
increase Bell's lead to 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson's only threat came in the third quarter when the Democrats drove to 
Bell's 25-yard line. But the Eagles forced a fumble in the Jefferson backfield 
and recovered the ball at its 37-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell defensive back Dulio Orellano had three interceptions, returning one 48 
yards. Jefferson's top runner, Isaac Hatley, was held to 14 yards in eight 
carries.

DANA PARSONS: HOW MUCH BULLETS ACTUALLY HURT ISN'T THE ONLY SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would have bet money that I knew exactly where Dr. William Rand Hardy was 
going with his argument. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the director of the trauma unit at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. That 
means he's seen more than his share of people lying on gurneys, their bodies 
decorated with bullet holes in search of vital organs. Many times, the victims 
are teen-agers who have caught slugs from other teen-agers as a result of the 
county's relentless gang warfare. What often gets Hardy's attention after 
talking to the victims is how unmoved they seem to be by the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there aren't some common themes. "They seem genuinely 
surprised by how much it hurts," Hardy said, "which I find fascinating. They're 
always amazed at how much it hurts to be shot. But I don't see any sort of 
battle fatigue. . . . The concept of wounding other people or them being 
wounded by other people just doesn't seem to register at all." 
</P>
<P>
 I interrupted Hardy's workday last week to ask him about gun control, this 
just a few days after a group of med students from UC Irvine picketed a shop 
that manufactures handguns. The shop is one of several in the area that spit 
out the cheap guns that often end up supplying Hardy with his customers on the 
gurneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy's trauma unit sees between 80 and 100 people a month, he says, with as 
many as 35% to 40% there because of a wound as opposed to, say, a traffic 
accident. Of that percentage, the majority have been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Like I said, I knew where he was headed as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's no question that in the 15 years I've been doing this, the 
injuries have become much more severe as the overall weaponry has increased 
from the old days. In the old days, if gang-type people were going to fight, 
more often than not it was with a knife, and the wounds could be devastating 
but fairly easy to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so today, he said. Now, people have guns and seem to enjoy shooting them. 
"So we see a lot more senseless injuries and they're more severe because a 
bullet does more damage than a knife blade or a fist." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly, I thought. Hardy went on to say it's rather obvious that, if guns 
were harder to get, "the number of gun-related injuries would decrease." It 
would also follow, he said, that there would be a decrease in the severity of 
the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 So, doctor, you'd be a soul mate with the pickets last week? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have strong feelings about gun control one way or the other," the 
doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are problems when a society or government tries to control arms," he 
said. "It's difficult for a few people to have power in a society, which the 
bearing of arms is, without it being abused. I'm a right-to-bear-arms advocate. 
I think it's an important part of the democratic process, and I think it's 
wrong for government to absolutely control guns." 
</P>
<P>
 He was quick to note, however, that he has no philosophical problem with 
banning military-type weapons whose only purpose is "to maim and kill people." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him I once did an informal survey among 10 or so apartment residents, 
shortly after someone with a gun killed a tenant. The residents split down the 
middle on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think among physicians you'd see the same bell-shaped curve," Hardy said.  
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that Hardy has no solution to the violence. He just isn't 
sure society is prepared to do the long-range planning and committing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy deplores what he believes is the country's misguided glorification of 
athletes. "If we focused on education and if teachers were the heroes in our 
society, I don't think we'd have gang violence at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The young victims he sees, he said, seem "incredibly closed off and incapable 
of understanding what's happened to them. They really have no insight as to how 
they came to get shot. They really look upon it as you would look at getting 
struck by lightning on a golf course. There's no sense that there's a remedy 
for it or any understanding that any good could come out of the process of 
getting shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy sees these troubled youngsters shut off educationally, emotionally and 
in almost every other important way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see kids that are very young," he said, "say 12 to 15, that are essentially 
unable to verbalize and are so unskilled educationally that, essentially, it's 
over for them. They can't re-enter the system because they're too far behind 
already. It's absolutely tragic to see someone with a minor wound who's very 
young, who you feel has no alternative but to go back into the system that shot 
them. That's a very frightening thing, to talk to a 13-year-old and find out 
they have no interests, nothing to say and basically kind of already (are) so 
socially stunted that it's going to be very difficult to recover and go on." 
</P>
<P>
 I would have guessed a trauma surgeon would be a gun-control supporter. That 
someone like Hardy is not should tell the gun-control lobby how far away their 
victory is. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is that people will be happy focusing on gun control when they 
should be focusing on education, teen pregnancies and young people without 
jobs. Young people without jobs is the disease, guns are the facilitators and 
injuries are the outcome. My only quibble with the gun-control argument," Hardy 
said, "is that it's fine to control guns, but don't forget that's not what 
caused the problem."

 Docent Job--The Sea & Sage chapter of the National Audubon Society can still 
use a few more volunteer naturalists to help with its outdoor educational 
program for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders at the San Joaquin Wildlife 
Sanctuary this fall and next spring. Interested volunteers must first 
participate in a nine-week training course that meets from 9 a.m. to noon on 
select Tuesdays and Thursdays.A meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalists assist children with identification of birds and pond life during 
two-hour tours around the Irvine Ranch Water District ponds and wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the training program, volunteer naturalists are expected to lead 
or co-lead a minimum of two tours a month during the 1994-95 school year.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the volunteer training is $15 and covers registration, training 
manual, materials and name badge. To register, call the Sea & Sage office at 
(714) 261-7963. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird's Eye Views--Shutter bugs with a passion for capturing birds on film can 
attend the next bird photographers meeting at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the 
Huntington Beach home of Jim Gallagher. Photographers are encouraged to bring 
up to 30 slides to share, and spectators are welcome. Directions: (714) 
962-8990. 
</P>
<P>
 Write On--The power of the printed word can come from you in a letter writing 
campaign supporting the Bolsa Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach. The Bolsa 
Chica Land Trust is encouraging all Orange County residents to write letters 
expressing their feelings about preserving the habitat and creating a land 
exchange between the federal government for its excess property and private 
developers. 
</P>

RAISING AWARENESS OF A BIRTH DISORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Kudos for (your) well-written and uplifting article on the musical abilities 
of individuals having the birth disorder Williams syndrome ("Tuning In on an 
Enabling Birth Disorder," Aug. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the names of two of the musicians were inadvertently 
omitted.One was tenor Dennis Butcher of Anaheim; the other was Cathy Krieger of 
Garden Grove, the guitarist-singer who composed the song "A Better World." 
Also, some quotes attributed to my daughter, Gloria, were actually said by 
Krieger. 
</P>
<P>
 One gratifying aspect of the article was the phone calls and letters I 
received from concerned parents and grandparents of children having Williams 
syndrome who were unaware of the parental support group. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are concerned that their child may have Williams syndrome, or who 
wish to see the Williams 5 perform, please write to me at: School of Biological 
Sciences, University of California, Irvine, Calif. 92717.

2 ISSUES INFLAME TENSIONS AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two serious problems confront Cal State Northridge these days, and we're not 
even talking about the earthquake and its aftermath. These two problems would 
be difficult to deal with separately. Unfortunately, they have collided on this 
campus of hard knocks and, once again, tensions are inflamed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem involves the fact that 28% of CSUN's burgeoning population 
of Mexican American, Central and South American students requires six years in 
which to graduate. An even larger percentage requires seven years. Just 22% of 
African American students have graduated after six years, and 28% require seven 
years. For the rest of CSUN's student body, 40% to 50% have graduated by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures are unacceptably low, and changes are in order. The other 
problem is more volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year or so, several groups within the increasingly diverse CSUN 
community have been outraged by one act or another. Latinos were livid after a 
fraternity circulated a racist song about a Mexican whore. Women on campus were 
appalled when flyers for another event asked "wouldn't it be great to rape, 
pillage and burn again?" A campus appearance by Muslim Minister Louis Farrakhan 
sparked a dispute between Jewish and African American students. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in the quake and you probably have a mix in which folks on campus aren't 
feeling especially trustful of one another and are waiting for the other shoe 
to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 For several Latino and African American students, the other shoe was the way 
in which CSUN officials chose to address the graduation and retention problem. 
CSUN would reorganize a long-respected sanctum called the Educational 
Opportunity Program (EOP) for disadvantaged students, and for which students, 
faculty and alumni have a deep, emotional connection. 
</P>
<P>
 It was predictable that dispersing EOP staff to other locations on campus 
would be seen as the first step in the program's dissolution. (It had much more 
to do with the quake and the need to free up as much space as possible for 
classrooms.) It was predictable that a vacancy in the position of EOP director 
would be perceived the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials said that they laid the groundwork for this last year. Well, 
the ground moved, quite literally in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more could have been done to sell this idea first, which CSUN insists 
involves no breaking up of the EOP office, nor any plans to eliminate the 
position of EOP director, nor any diversion of EOP funds. Now, a task force has 
been formed that will consult the aggrieved parties on the reorganization. That 
should have been the first step, not the last.

MOVIES; SCHWARZENEGGER, STALLONE, STREEP; MERYL STREEP TAKES TO THE WHITE 
WATER. WAS HER ACTION DEBUT SMOOTH SAILING? HOW 'THE RIVER WILD' STAR AND 
DIRECTOR CURTIS HANSON TOOK THE PLUNGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurie Werner, Laurie Werner is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Meryl Streep was announced as the star of "The River Wild," the 
suspense-adventure film opening Friday, some Hollywood insiders were surprised. 
Why would this formidable actress, two-time Oscar winner and master of a 
million accents want to do a mere action flick in which the extent of the drama 
seemed to be shooting the toughest rapids in the West? 
</P>
<P>
 Many figured it was a bid for broader commercial appeal; her recent films, 
such as "Death Becomes Her" and last spring's "The House of the Spirits," 
suffered at the box office. But as Streep, 45, and director Curtis Hanson ("The 
Hand That Rocks the Cradle"), 48, recently discussed on a stormy morning in New 
York, there were other challenges and goals at hand, including their joint 
collaboration to create the character of Gail Hartman, a mother and former 
river guide who takes her family on a rafting trip partly to help save her 
marriage to David Strathairn, and then has to fight both the river and a couple 
of menacing strangers, Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly, to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
 As Streep admits, this strong, determined character is closer to her own 
persona than any she's played onscreen. She even got to use her own accent. But 
as Bacon observes, she still achieved something transformational: turning 
herself into such an expert oarswoman after only two weeks of training, 
steering her raft down such dangerous rapids, on location in Oregon and 
Montana, that she regularly earned applause from the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Meryl Streep as action hero? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Hanson: I know. When it was announced that Meryl was doing this movie, 
the take that everyone had on it was Meryl Streep doing a Bruce Willis part, an 
Arnold Schwarzenegger part, like it was sort of a gimmick, putting her in an 
action movie. Why Meryl? 
</P>
<P>
 Meryl Streep: (Smiling) Well, it wouldn't be appropriate to have Bruce Willis 
as a mother from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: But I don't like to think of this as an action movie. It's a movie with 
action, a suspense picture with action. And for a suspense picture to work, you 
have to care about the characters. So the idea of having Meryl play this 
character was fun because we'd have this fabulous actress in a suspense movie 
and the audience would invest in her emotionally to the degree that we must to 
have a suspense movie work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did Universal immediately sign on to the idea of Meryl in this part? 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: Some people questioned it. One studio executive . . . 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: (With mock fury) Who? Whooo ??!  
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: . . . Referred to it as a fish with feathers, neither here nor there. 
Because they're so used to feeling that action movies appeal to young males and 
Meryl Streep movies appeal to females and the two don't cross. But they can if 
the movie is really good. So if this movie can be successful and make these 
parameters a little less narrow, it would be very good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Meryl, why were you drawn to this film? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: To be honest with you, when I first read the script, the possibilities 
of who the character might be in terms of a multidimensional person, someone 
recognizable to me, weren't as obviously there. She was a bit of a cipher, more 
plot-driven: Things happened and she fought back. But Curtis was willing to 
listen to what I felt were the shortcomings. I was interested in the interior 
lives of the characters, what they were grappling with beyond their physical 
challenges. And Curtis was kind in letting me help shape that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The physical aspects of the plot are so overriding, though, that that must 
have played a part in your decision. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: Oh, it did. I wanted to be outside. Of course, what was supposed to be a 
summer in Montana turned out to be a fall in Oregon. (Laughs) And I wanted to 
do something physical. I used to go off the diving board and do a 
one-and-a-half and I remember five years ago when I stopped wanting to do that. 
There's a fear that sets in and I wanted to challenge it. I learned to ski when 
I was 35 so I'd have something in common with my son. And I loved it, the 
newfound addiction to speed and danger. And before it's too late, I wanted to 
do that again. Challenge that, to see what I could do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you consider yourself athletic? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No! I'd much rather sit down, given the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You underwent a very grueling training effort (see story, Page 40). Have 
you kept up your workout? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No, No! But I do weights -- I have a 3-year-old, so I do weights. I just 
have to remember to lift on the right side occasionally. (Streep has also 
continued her river adventures, taking husband Don Gummer and all four children 
out on a river in Massachusetts that, she said, looked easy after her 
experiences out West.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Even with your training, you must have felt some trepidation facing the 
river. (It was actually three different rivers, the Kootenai and the Flathead 
in Montana and the Rogue in Southern Oregon.) 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No, my real anxiety was not about the river. It should have been; I was 
ignorant about what it would really be like. My real anxiety was about the 
first few frames of the movie. I was fixated on the sculling (in the opening 
scene, Gail is shown sculling by herself on the Charles River in Boston). It's 
really obvious if you're not doing it right.  
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: And we were prepared to fake it. Prepared to put Meryl on a little barge 
(a prop platform in the water that would make it appear as if she were rowing 
in the water). . . . 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: (Emphatically) That's a lie! I asked where the barge was. That's a 
flat-out lie. There was no such preparation. I got there and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: It was shocking, actually. She'd been practicing but I hadn't seen her. 
I had no idea how well she would do and after the first little stretch, I 
turned to my cameraman and said, "We're in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But the river must have been a completely different situation. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: It was, it's all wild, coming at you. 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: And Meryl was the one getting (the boat into) position all the time. She 
continued to get better as an oarsperson too. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: Well, I got more and less confident as the process went on. I started it 
as a 20-year-old who thinks they can do anything, all buffed and ready and 
totally fabulous. And then I had a couple of experiences during the shooting 
(laughs) that humbled me. Made me recognize the real danger of what we were 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Such as the time you've talked about where you hit a hole in the river and 
were thrown out of the boat and under the water? 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: Which was totally appropriate for the movie, actually (though that scene 
is no longer in the film). Because in one way, this picture's about the 
conflict between a woman who knows enough to be afraid of the river and a guy, 
Kevin, who doesn't. And because he doesn't, he makes bad things happen. Meryl 
went through that education herself. She started off cocky, thinking she could 
do whatever, and then ended up like a surfer standing on the beach looking out 
on the waves, thinking, maybe we shouldn't go out today. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: (Interrupting) Not really, Curtis. We'd have negotiations. Like, "I'll 
do it three times and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But when she hit the water, you must have thought, "Oh, my God, I've done 
away with Meryl Streep." 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: Oh, there were definitely times when I thought "Oh, my God. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: The first time it happened --  
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: The first time Meryl went over --  
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: I was holding my breath underwater deliberately, to scare you. 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: But it was that heart-in-your-mouth situation. First of all, it's Meryl 
Streep. Secondly, I had asked her to go back and do it again when she didn't 
particularly want to do it again, because we'd had a camera malfunction. She 
was tired after this long day. So you see her go into the water and on one 
hand, there's this personal concern growing out of my affection for Meryl 
(Streep laughs wildly) and at the same time there's the professional concern of 
"there goes . . . 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: . . . My movie" . . . and then he says, "Let's do it again." (Laughs) 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: We had a lot of mishaps, but, luckily, no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: It was a miracle, Curtis. After the fact, you realize just how much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were there any stunts that you simply refused to do? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: There was one that we watched a demonstration of, involving a 
helicopter. (The raft) was in a narrow canyon with deep walls on either side, 
the river condensed at that point, becoming roiling and fast moving, and the 
helicopter swooped in to this narrow cavern. It was harrowing because the back 
rotor was always in danger of clipping the side wall, it could pitch into 
Arlene (Burns, Streep's double and an expert kayaker who was piloting the raft) 
and everyone would be Cuisinarted.  
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the helicopter was creating so much wind in this tunnel that it was 
pushing the raft against the walls of the canyon. And as I was watching, I was 
thinking, "What is Kevin thinking?" because I can't be the one who says (in 
mousy little voice), "Curtis, I really don't want to do this," because this is 
three weeks in and I've been saying this a lot to Curtis. And Kevin walks up to 
Curtis, stands in front of him, smiles and says (in tough voice), "No 
(expletive) way." Thank God, someone else wimped out besides me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did your family think you were nuts for doing some of these stunts? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No, they have absolutely no sense of danger. They'd say (in child's 
voice), " I want to do that."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But they must have come out of it with a new respect for you. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No, nothing will give them more respect for me. (Laughs) Still, I have 
three girls and a boy (Henry, 14; Mamie, 11; Grace, 7; Louisa, 3), and I 
thought it was good for them to see a girl hero, a physical hero, using her wit 
and her strength, mind and body to get through something difficult. That's 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: It's true. We're not used to seeing movies, especially with physical 
action, when it isn't the man who comes in to save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If this movie is a success, do you think that might change? 
</P>
<P>
 C.H.: I hope it encourages people to make more movies with characters like 
that, to be less boxed in by certain givens or formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: I don't have a larger agenda, just that people go and like it. I don't 
have a feeling that it'll change the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the effect it could have on your career, broadening the image 
people have of you, broadening your commercial appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: No, I don't have a plan. I don't have a plan in general. I don't have a 
clue, you could say. (Laughs) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the movie's a success, would you consider a sequel? 
</P>
<P>
 M.S.: I don't know. Maybe they could send us out on the Brahmaputra River 
(which crosses China, Tibet and India). 
</P>
<P>
 (Laughs) That would be cool.

DEDICATED TO JUST PLAIN FOLKS; HOW HAS VINCE GILL'S SUCCESS CHANGED HIS LIFE? 
WELL, IF YOU ASK HIM, HE SAYS HE'S JUST AN OL' GUITAR PLAYER WHO LIKES PEOPLE. 
(OH, SURE.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 'Pressure's on," says Vince Gill, a couple of hours before his headlining show 
at the Greek Theatre. He smiles as he looks around the theater's subterranean 
commissary for a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew and band members sitting at nearby tables chuckle. They know their 
boss is having a little fun at the expense of his laid-back manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the man who by consensus is the nicest guy in country music might also be 
the most relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 He's definitely one of the hottest. Since his first big hit, 1990's 
Grammy-winning "When I Call Your Name," he's been a fixture at the top of the 
country charts -- most recently with "Whenever You Come Around" and "What the 
Cowgirls Do," the first two singles from his current album "When Love Finds 
You." He's picked up another four Grammys, and last year was named the Country 
Music Assn.'s entertainer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a singer, songwriter and lead guitarist, Gill represents a rare combination 
of versatility and virtuosity, earning critical respect to go with the 
commercial success. His fellow musicians are certainly clued in: Mark Knopfler, 
for instance, invited him to join Dire Straits in 1989, just before Gill's solo 
career kicked into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seems to have gone to his head. Indeed, Gill has been spending 
the hours preceding the show shuffling sleepily through the business of sound 
check and pasta dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him about his pre-concert routine -- for many artists a neurotic ritual of 
isolation, vocal exercises, wardrobe decisions, etc. -- and he just laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Nintendo," he finally offers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oklahoma native is sitting in his dressing room, wearing a T-shirt, 
rumpled jeans and thongs -- an outfit he'll upgrade only slightly for the show 
with a change of shirts and the addition of shoes and a jacket. Talk about a 
regular-guy image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't go out of my way to sell that to people," he says. "I think 
sometimes people take their success and their career and their whole deal way 
too serious. I really don't. I'm still just a guitar player, in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that just comes from me being secure about myself. I wasn't any 
different 10 years ago or 20 years ago. I just try to be normal. I like people. 
I'm approachable. It's not a conscious effort to be a certain way. I just am." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just big sales and good reviews that make Gill the kind of person the 
Country Music Assn. has named to host its awards show on Oct. 5 -- the first 
time the three-hour job has been handled by one artist. 
</P>
<P>
 In that kind of nationally televised forum, Gill invariably manages to project 
class and dignity, and as firmly as he rejects the notion, he's an ideal 
ambassador from Nashville to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything in Gill's life has been as sunny as his demeanor would suggest. 
His older brother Bob died of a heart attack early last year, ending what Gill 
calls "a rough life." And in a golf course robbery, Gill found himself facing a 
sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nightmares about it for a long time -- but in the nightmares I got 
shot," he says. "I still get jumpy if somebody runs up on stage during a show." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite his substantial charity work, including AIDS-related projects, 
Gill has come under fire for not wearing a red ribbon in support of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "My response to that is I think everybody's deserving," says Gill, who would 
obviously prefer to be talking about music than touchy controversies. "There 
needs to be a green ribbon, a brown ribbon, a yellow ribbon, a pink ribbon, for 
farmers, ecology -- there's an awful lot of problems besides just one." 
</P>
<P>
 And he admits there are sides of him the public doesn't see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have drive and ambition," he says. "There are things that I'm intense 
about. I get on the guys if they're not playing as good as they can and should. 
I want things to be the best. I'm a perfectionist. I want everyone else to be 
equally committed. I have a temper that shows up once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't seem to bother his musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what kind of guy he is," says drummer Martin Parker, a Gill 
band member for three years. "I had rotator cuff surgery earlier this year, and 
he told me don't worry about it, take as long as you need, your job's here. . . 
. Anybody else in this business would have fired me. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best job there is," adds Parker, smoking a cigarette in the wings 
as show time approaches. "You know what our name for this tour is? It's the 
'All Fun, No Ass----- Tour.' "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gill's steely tenor was forged in the propulsive drive of bluegrass, but it's 
pliant enough to negotiate the supple ballads that have become his musical 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 His music ranges from rootsy Western swing to pop-country hybrids to hard-core 
country tear-jerkers, but his trademarks are soaring expressions of affirmation 
and devotion such as "Look at Us" and "I Still Believe in You" -- classic 
records that are closer to Smokey Robinson than "Smokey and the Bandit." 
</P>
<P>
 "I found something that works, and that's pretty comforting," Gill says. "But 
I'm always tinkering. I always want to do something a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 Gill, 37, grew up in Oklahoma City listening to his parents' country music and 
his peers' pop and rock. But when he started playing music in high school, it 
was with the area's hotshot young bluegrass band. After high school, he decided 
to stick with music rather than try to be a professional golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, his progress in the bluegrass world brought him to Los Angeles, where 
he lived for seven years, frequenting clubs from the Troubadour in West 
Hollywood to the Sweetwater near his South Bay home. It was here that he met 
Manhattan Beach native Janis Oliver, a member of the sister duo Sweethearts of 
the Rodeo. They married in 1980 and have a 12-year-old daughter, Jennifer. 
</P>
<P>
 He played first with fiddler Byron Berline's group Sundance, then joined the 
country-rock band Pure Prairie League, singing lead on its 1980 hit "Let Me 
Love You Tonight."  
</P>
<P>
 Gill left PPL for progressive country singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell's 
backing group -- "the best band I've ever played with," he says. The lineup 
included Emory Gordy Jr., who would produce Gill's first solo albums, and Tony 
Brown, now Nashville's top executive and record producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown took an A&R position at RCA Records and signed Gill to the label in 
1983, but Brown moved to MCA Records before they could collaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sayin' Tony leaving is the reason I didn't have hits when I was first 
signed over there," Gill says. "The timing of things was not right for me. It 
took a long time, but in hindsight now, it gave me a lot of time to watch, hang 
out and learn. A lot of good things." 
</P>
<P>
 The next seven years were frustrating for Gill. His RCA singles periodically 
made the Top 10 of the country chart, but most died on the outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing gave me any kind of vision of what people really liked," says Gill, 
who also kept busy and built his credibility by playing on countless sessions 
by other artists. "Creatively I wanted to make records the way I like 'em, the 
way I hear 'em. . . . It was just nobody wanted to hear it for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was OK. Bonnie Raitt was a great example of a similar type situation. . 
. . In '89 when she won all the Grammys, I turned on the TV -- 'There you go, 
now that's fair.' I felt like it kind of paralleled my situation in a sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was pretty good. I felt like I belonged. I knew I could play and 
I knew I could sing. I don't mean that egotistically. My ears tell me that, 
that I have some talent. And I love it. I mean music is the greatest thing in 
my life.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have done it no matter what, no matter where I wound up on this totem 
pole of popularity. I didn't care if I was on the records as a harmony singer 
or as a guitar player, as long as I got to be on 'em kind of felt good to me, 
just to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 Gill moved to MCA, where he finally got to record with Brown. Their 
first album was "When I Call Your Name," and the title song made Gill a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something really country that showcased my voice," says Gill 
of that diverse breakthrough album. "For a long time I was hesitant to shove my 
voice way out there on a record. I'd always been really band-oriented in my 
thinking. . . . It just happened to be the right song at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never think about why it didn't happen those seven years. Because it 
doesn't matter in a sense. I figure that if it had happened then, then my 
career'd be over now, and I wouldn't be havin' any fun now."

RADIO; IS THIS THE BEST JOB IN L.A.?; CHRIS DOURIDAS JUST PLAYS THE MUSIC HE 
LIKES ON KCRW-FM'S 'MORNING BECOMES ECLECTIC.' HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH IT? 
WHAT'S THERE TO GET AWAY WITH?

<P>
 It's a typical morning at KCRW-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Douridas, the host of the public radio station's weekday morning music 
program, is running back and forth between his spot behind the mike and the 
library, grabbing CDs off the shelf that he feels like playing: indie-label 
rockers Sebadoh, French rapper MC Solaar, Dutch pop group Bettie Serveert, 
Me'Shell NdegeOcello teaming with Herbie Hancock for a jazz and hip-hop blend 
from an upcoming release. 
</P>
<P>
 His assistant is answering the phones, telling listeners what they just heard 
and whether it is available in local record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Sand, a quirky and beguiling alternative rock band that almost never 
gets radio play, is warming up in a spacious recording studio for a live 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see that all of this happens spontaneously," Douridas, host of 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic" and music director at KCRW (89.9), says as he 
punches buttons on his CD players, DAT recorder and radio soundboard while 
cuing up a track on an old-fashioned vinyl turntable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much science to it. Whatever we feel like playing, we pretty much 
just throw it on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 For music lovers, Douridas, 31, has the dream job. He wakes up every weekday 
and from 9 to noon shares his favorite songs with his Southern California 
audience. There's no playlist. No one tells him what he can and can't do. And 
he meets, interviews and watches performances by everyone from the Afghan Whigs 
to Little Jimmy Scott to Jackson Browne to Kristin Hersh to Ry Cooder to 
obscure ambient bands like Low. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a job that, especially in the world of corporate-dominated commercial 
pop and rock radio, has practically vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most disc jockeys just don't get to turn their listeners onto the latest thing 
anymore. Instead, they are required to play only what is prescribed by a 
computerized list -- with songs in "heavy," "medium" or "light" rotation -- 
created by professional programmers via market research, the input of radio 
consultants, the bullying of major record labels and sales charts that reflect 
the familiar tastes of the bulk of the audience. Adventure, experimentation, 
novelty are no longer a part of the equation -- or the deejay's job 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when I was a youngster in 1978, I used to be able to play anything I 
wanted," said Jed (The Fish) Gould, who has been a deejay at KROQ-FM (106.7) 
for much of the past 16 years. "And it was thrilling to be excited about your 
10 favorite songs and be able to play them all in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, the role of the jock was reduced to picking two songs an hour, 
then one song a shift, then nothing, Gould said, as professional consultants 
and music directors came to dominate an industry that fell into the hands of 
corporations -- such as KROQ owner Infinity Broadcasting -- that paid tens of 
millions of dollars for individual stations in the 1980s. That personality-only 
role for the deejay prevails today at KROQ and most other stations, although 
"Jed the Fish" gets to play his "catch of the day" -- one new song of his 
choice -- each weekday at 4:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's generally true that such tight control on the music makes for something 
bland and boring," he said, "but when you pay $50 million for a radio station, 
it's a big business, and like in any business, you want to control whatever you 
can to make sure you make money." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent my career fighting for it, for free-form radio, but basically my 
feeling is that they have ruined an art form," said Jim Ladd, longtime L.A. 
deejay for KLOS and the defunct but once preeminent rock 'n' roll station KMET, 
who currently works the night shift at KLSX-FM (97.1). 
</P>
<P>
 There, he can't play anything he wants. But within the restricted format of 
what his bosses define as "classic rock," he does put together sets of songs 
that attempt to tell some kind of story about a particular theme, such as 
politics or sex. Few jocks are even allowed that kind of creativity with the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone on the dial is following the well-traveled path to mediocrity," Ladd 
said. "You get just a list of songs made up by some person at a computer, 
belching this stuff out, who doesn't care if Joni Mitchell is followed by Black 
Sabbath. They don't care about how music goes together. It's soulless. It's 
mindless. It's just 'This song is A-list rotation and these are B-list,' and 
they think that's the way to herd the sheep." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a policy -- especially the fear of playing anything unfa miliar or new -- 
is a reason that many people have turned away from radio as a source for music, 
contends Mike Morrison, program director for KSCA-FM (101.9), which recently 
adopted a new music format -- kind of a mellow cross between KROQ's teen-aged 
alternative music mentality and KLSX's oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the station does play new music from relatively unknown bands like 
Toad the Wet Sprocket and Wild Colonials, it is not exactly a haven for those 
seeking a wildly new musical adventure ( see review, Page 84 ). 
</P>
<P>
 The station's playlist is "carefully planned," Morrison said, and most of the 
new songs on KSCA come from the latest albums of popular performers such as the 
Rolling Stones, the Pretenders, Counting Crows and Bonnie Raitt. Furthermore, 
about half the songs -- from artists such as Elton John, Steely Dan, Dire 
Straits and Don Henley -- come from the '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Douridas was offered the job of KSCA's morning drive-time deejay, but he 
decided to stay put at KCRW -- in part, he said, because he had concerns over 
restrictions about what he could play. He believes that a freewheeling show 
similar to "Morning Becomes Eclectic" probably would be allowed on L.A. 
commercial radio only as a specialty program on weekends or late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 KSCA's Morrison, who for now doubles as the station's morning deejay, said: 
"The reason we couldn't let Chris (Douridas) or anyone else play whatever they 
want every day is that this radio station was not intended to be the commercial 
equivalent of 'Morning Becomes Eclectic' followed by somebody else and 
something entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have a format, in that we have a method to our rotations and some 
songs get played more frequently than others. But that's because we don't want 
any confusion, at least at the beginning. We want to be consistent, 24 hours a 
day, so that people will be able to tune in and know that they are listening to 
this radio station. We might play a song you can hear on KROQ or one you might 
hear on KLOS, but we don't want to play three songs in a row that you could 
hear on KROQ or KLOS. We're not so inflexible, though, that our deejays don't 
have room to play a request." 
</P>
<P>
 But such a strict formula makes it extremely difficult to get airplay Please 
see Page 84 for new music and new bands that might not be instantly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the problem with radio today," said Joel Amsterdam, director of 
press and artist development for Elektra Records. "The trick for a great radio 
program director, what I'd like to see, is to find a bunch of deejays who share 
your aesthetic and taste and let them go for it. If everything is too tightly 
formatted, it takes the fun out of it. But even so, even if it might be a 
little too classic rock, even if it's not as eclectic as KCRW, KSCA really has 
been a breath of fresh air. They certainly have showed signs of taking risks 
with live performances and playing many artists that other commercial radio 
stations won't even touch." 
</P>
<P>
 The real heroes of record industry executives trying to find a break for some 
of their more obscure talents are deejays such as Douridas, who have the 
ability to champion artists they like, to talk about them on the air and to 
play their best song -- not necessarily the single -- several times over the 
course of a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why Chris is so invaluable," Amsterdam said. "He brings his great 
taste and passion and love for music to the airwaves, and unfortunately that 
just happens so rarely these days. So when you find someone like Chris, you 
cherish him. He loves great music and he's never afraid to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
 And he plays it first, often exposing L.A. audiences to music and artists long 
before their albums are even available. Douridas has been playing Wild 
Colonials, for example, for more than a year and invited them in to perform 
live before they had recorded their debut album, which has only recently been 
in heavy rotation on KSCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he helped to build anticipation for Eddi Reader's new album by 
playing songs off her British import before it was released here. He also 
invited her on his show to play live last year while she was recording the 
album (and she'll be returning to the KCRW airwaves Monday morning). Commercial 
radio generally plays songs off a new album only when it becomes available in 
record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most exciting thing about KCRW is how far upstream we can be in the 
creative process," Douridas said. "Very often we have artists coming in while 
they are recording something or before the record is out, or they bring us a 
DAT of something they've been working on, or I'm getting releases as imports 
before they come out in the States. I'm getting all kinds of indie releases and 
imports in the mail each day and I listen to them, and if a song stops and 
grabs me, if it connects, I play it. It doesn't have to be the one single that 
you might hear over and over on commercial radio. I'll play any song on the 
record that rings the bell for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Douridas' ear for good music won him a job as a consultant for Geffen Records 
in January, 1993. If he stumbles upon a band he loves that is not signed to a 
deal in the United States, he shares it with Geffen. That Dog, a local band, 
scored a major-label deal thanks to him, as did Leslie Winer, whom Douridas 
found on a British import. Though Douridas did give heavy early exposure to 
such recent Geffen stars as Beck and Wild Colonials, he said both were signed 
by the label before he began working for it. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees no conflict in scouting for one record company while hosting a radio 
program that serves to expose music from every label to the record-buying 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it almost hurts the band in terms of their exposure on my show," 
Douridas said. "If I had anything to do with them signing at Geffen, I tend to 
run the other way. My show is about playing the best music from around the 
planet, whatever the source. That's all I'm thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Several employees of rival record labels said they have no doubts about 
Douridas' integrity. Elektra's Amsterdam said he wishes Douridas worked for his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Douridas has served as KCRW's music director for the past three years after 
working as host of a similar music show at a public radio station in Dallas. 
When he came to KCRW, replacing Tom Schnabel as music director and host of 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic," he wanted to bring a younger, hipper feel to the 
station's music programming. Though Deirdre O'Donoghue, once the nighttime 
music host at KCRW, played a good deal of new and esoteric pop sounds, Douridas 
said, there was a huge gap between her tastes and Schnabel's mix of jazz and 
world music, a huge gap between what was being played on commercial radio and 
what could be found on KCRW. Schnabel still spins his favorites on KCRW on the 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 So Douridas hired younger hosts: Jason Bentley (his show, "Metropolis," a mix 
of acid jazz, cool pop and ambient dance music, airs weeknights from 8 to 10) 
and Liza Richardson (whose "Man in the Moon" mix of quirky pop and spoken word 
follows "Metropolis" nightly). Tricia Halloran, who deejays weekend nights on 
KCRW, presents what is arguably the best local show this side of college radio 
for fans of cutting-edge, alternative punk and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Douridas' own program is a random mix of the mellower, bluesier, acoustic side 
of the alternative pop scene -- with a dash of rap, country and international 
and foreign-language sounds thrown in at his whim. On occasion he will even 
stray into the harder-edged electric world of PJ Harvey or Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm very selective about that because, it's funny, when one person hears 
an electric guitar on KCRW, they might call me up and ask why I've decided to 
start playing metal," Douridas said. "So I guess that is the one parameter I 
have. When I get to that edge of music, once I stretch out their heads for 
three or four minutes, I'll come back pretty fast with something quieter. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the foreign-language stuff, I think the music will still have the same 
effect on people. Just because it's in another language isn't enough for me to 
pass on it. I think it's important for us to hear music from other cultures 
because it stretches our understanding, opens up our minds a little bit. If you 
hear all this extremely dark news about the slaughter in Rwanda and then you 
hear a piece of music from Rwanda that is exquisitely beautiful, it gives you a 
place to have some compassion for that part of the world. But it's not like 'Oh 
there's some news from Yemen today, let's get out the Yemen library.' It's all 
just a gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of his show, however -- besides no commercials (save the 
station promos) -- is the live performances that close nearly every program. 
Everyone from big-name pop stars like Natalie Merchant and Evan Dando to 
old-time superstars like James Taylor to yet-to-even-make-a-record-type bands 
like Pomegranate have stopped by the radio station to play a half-hour set. 
Douridas helped produce a compilation album that was released earlier this year 
containing what he selected as the best of those recordings as a benefit for 
the station. Another album is planned for early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 All this attracts about 25,000 listeners at any given moment to his program 
each day, Douridas said. Good for a public radio station -- good enough to keep 
it financially healthy. But would that audience be big enough if Douridas took 
the same act to a commercial station? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the $80-million question," Douridas said. "Most professional 
consultants would say, 'Are you kidding? Forget it.' They just don't believe 
there is a big enough potential audience for this more esoteric approach. The 
only way for open programming to work is for some station to try it and find 
that the audience embraces it." 
</P>
<P>
 KSCA's Morrison doesn't believe that putting power back in the hands of 
deejays will lead to success, or even to better and more varied music for the 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had experience with free-form radio, and a lot of people advocate for 
deejays to have more freedom because they think it will result in more 
diversity, more variety and be far less boring," he said. "But the truth is 
that free-form can often be more repetitive because one jock might not know 
what the other played right before and they might all like the same songs and 
you get the same thing over and over. You can avoid that with a format and by 
applying just a little more sophistication to what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ's Gould, meanwhile, has approached his boss about doing a free-form show 
in the wee hours of Friday night -- something that mixes "dance ambient sounds 
with random orb ambient music and a little spoken word and then some weird 
phone calls at 3 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "And he said to me, 'Jed, will I recognize anything I'm going to hear?' And I 
said, 'Nope.' And that made him very nervous. But hopefully, he'll let me try 
it anyway."

A WEIRD SORT OF CYMBALISM; LOOKING FOR REAL HEAVY METAL? CONSIDER 'STOMP.' THE 
BRITISH IMPORT MIXES THEATER, DANCE, PERFORMANCE ART AND PERCUSSIVE POP USING 
THE ODDEST INSTRUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jan Breslauer, Jan Breslauer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A guy in baggy pants and Doc Martens wanders onstage pushing a broom. Sweep. 
Sweep-sweep. Sweep-sweep-whoosh . 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, he looks like the classic image of the stagehand cleaning up 
for the show, but you sense that he's up to more. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the lone sweeper is joined by more blokes with brooms. Sweep , goes one. 
Sweep-sweep , responds another. Sweep-whosh-plunk , answers a third. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long before there's a cadre of muscled urchins onstage, 
pushing their poles and stomping their custom-made boots in a choreographed 
dance of whirling whisks and stylized syncopation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clomp-clomp, whoosh-whoosh, clack-clack-clack . It may not have a tune you can 
hum, but the British percussion act known as "Stomp" has certainly got a rhythm 
you can tap. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute show consists of more than 20 interludes in which six men and 
two women use everyday objects such as trash can lids, brooms and rolled 
newspapers to make their own brand of rhythm. The show has been playing Off 
Broadway since February. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with an American replacement cast performing in New York since May, 
the original crew of "Stomp" is set to launch the show's North American tour at 
the Wadsworth Theater on Friday, presented by the UCLA Center for the 
Performing Arts. ("Stomp" is also part of the ongoing citywide UK/LA Festival 
1994, focusing on British arts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Like the also-popular, long-running Off Broadway show "Tubes" by Blue Man 
Group, "Stomp" is a high-energy (and sometimes high decibel) romp that revels 
in a simple but exuberant kind of good clean fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just theater or dance, nor is it as rarefied as that amorphous genre 
known as performance art. Instead, "Stomp" is a mix of all three forms, with a 
healthy dose of pop appeal thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Structurally, "Stomp" also has ties to rock music. "We're looking at theater 
from a musician's point of view," says director-performer Luke Cresswell, who 
also composes music for television. "It's like a group of virtuosos in a band, 
except they're using their bodies and unusual instruments to play. We know that 
we're in a theater but it's the mentality of a band." 
</P>
<P>
 And "Stomp" owes a debt to street performance too. "Good street performance is 
an odd combination of aggression and assertion and vulnerability," says 
director Steven McNicholas, who co-created the show with Cresswell. "We started 
out on the street years ago and we learned how to hold people's attention with 
spontaneity. We've always worked instinctively rather than intellectually. 
You've got to be likable and skillful." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old, Brighton-born Cresswell's father is a painter and his mother 
is an art-school dean. Although he started drumming as a boy, he never had any 
formal training in the arts and was playing in bands by the time he was a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas, who comes from a small town near Leeds, is 39, and, like 
Cresswell, a musician. Unlike Cresswell, his early creative life was spent in 
the theater, including a stint performing with a comedy group called the Cliff 
Hangers. 
</P>
<P>
 C resswell and McNicholas first worked together as founding members of 
Pookiesnackenburger, a popular British "busking" (street performance) band that 
rose to prominence in the early 1980s. The group went on to make two albums and 
was featured in an ill-fated TV series on the country's Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Pookiesnackenburger, though, is best remembered in Britain for a beer 
commercial in which Cresswell and others did a routine with trash cans. That 
effort provided the seed for a trash can number that's now one of "Stomp's" 
set-pieces -- a mock clash in which the Stompers square off against each other 
in a tightly choreographed, and increasingly complex, routine involving the 
metal cans and their lids. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first things we did years ago was the trash can routine," 
McNicholas says. "We all played trash can lids from the sort of standard 
British trash can. But over the years, we've explored (using) every other (kind 
of) trash receptacle." 
</P>
<P>
 After Pookiesnackenburger fizzled, Cresswell and McNicholas formed the dance 
band Yes/No People in 1986. The troupe went on to a variety of ventures, 
including composing and performing works for television and theater in Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest Yes/No People hit has been the show "Stomp," which premiered 
at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1991, toured Australia and has been seen in 
Montreal, as well as at a number of festivals throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp" happens on and in front of a large scaffold-based set-piece full of 
junk -- trash can lids, street signs, car parts, metal pipes and scraps and 
more. "The set is there as a backdrop and it's there initially to play," 
Cresswell says. "We try and make the (entire) space a drum if we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of eight wears casual, albeit cool, street clothes with steel-tipped 
Doc Martens. "You're going to wear baggy pants and a cotton T-shirt because 
you're going to get hot," says Cresswell, who bridles at the suggestion of 
deeper meaning or symbolic value. "A lot of that is really necessity. The 
clothes are plain and ordinary so you see the person. To me, it's neutral. To 
you, maybe it's saying more." 
</P>
<P>
 Although writers have tended to impute meaning to "Stomp's" street aesthetic, 
Cresswell insists that neither the look nor the content should be read too 
closely. "I don't see any meaning in brooms," says Cresswell, referring to a 
"Stomp" sequence inspired by London street sweepers. "If other people want to 
read something into it -- sweeping away the blues or whatever -- that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Cresswell stresses instead the pleasures of abstraction -- rhythm and motion 
for their own sake. "I liked the way they (London street sweepers) looked and 
the rhythm was interesting," Cresswell continues. "Nothing more." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Stomp" has an undeniably theatrical side -- primarily based on personas 
that emerge during the performance -- and where there's theater, there's room 
for interpretation. "It's more theater to me than it is to Luke (Cresswell)," 
says McNicholas. "It's my job (as the non-performing director) to make sure the 
characters are there." 
</P>
<P>
 "The characters keep you involved," McNicholas continues. "They add color and 
humor. The characters add to the confrontations, speaking to each other 
rhythmically, making threats. If they were characterless, that rhythmic 
expression wouldn't necessarily mean the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 L ate last May, Cresswell and McNicholas sat in a noisy East Village 
cappuccino joint talking about what it'd been like to bring their show from 
London to New York. Around the corner at the Orpheum Theatre, "Stomp" had just 
passed the 100th performance mark -- without missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp" ran at Sadler's Wells in London's West End before opening in New York 
in February, where it has won Obie and Drama Desk awards. The show came to 
America backed by the powerful Columbia Artists Management Inc. (CAMI) -- whose 
John Luckacovic first spotted the group in 1992 -- which is credited in the 
program as one among 10 producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the reviews have been mostly favorable, the initial reception was not 
all that everyone involved had hoped. "It's taken weeks of getting people in 
suits to come see the show, get the reviews," Cresswell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were Cresswell and McNicholas happy with the early audiences. "Playing New 
York has been totally different than anywhere else we've played in years," 
McNicholas says. "The first six weeks playing here, the audiences that we had 
were decidedly theater audiences. They were quite critical, with a lot of 
intellectualization. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a feel of intelligentsia in New York that you don't get in London," 
McNicholas continues. "People were trying to be overly analytical about what we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stomp" has frequently been compared to Blue Man Group's "Tubes," yet the 
powerful producing and marketing machine driving "Stomp" deemed the 
"Stomp"-Blue Man Group comparison a problem -- and so excised a paragraph from 
"Stomp's" New York Times review before including it in the group's press 
package. The missing text said, in part, that "Although neither so 
sophisticated nor so witty as 'Tubes,' 'Stomp' has . . . even more popular 
appeal. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, New York has seen other acts that might be even better examples of the 
genre in which "Stomp" lies. An even clearer artistic fellow traveler than Blue 
Man Group, for example, is composer David Van Tieghem, who performed his 
concerts of junk percussion using car parts and other objects at Lincoln Center 
in 1987, 1988 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stompers also have a thing or two in common with those anonymous New 
Yorkers who make their own trash percussion, banging out their rhythms on 
plastic drums and whatnot in subway stations and on sidewalks in the hopes that 
passersby will drop change. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike those non-professionals, the Stompers have progressed beyond their 
street roots without forgetting the lessons they learned there. "Being a street 
performer is hard," McNicholas says. "When you're working on the street, you're 
stopping 20 people who are on their way somewhere else. If they're paying money 
to come, they're going to tolerate you for 20 minutes, even if you're rubbish. 
Whereas on the street, you've got two minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The street also teaches an artist how to play to a crowd. "How the audience is 
can affect how you want to play the show," Cresswell says. "A straight audience 
in the theater makes me want to be more aggressive, to kick out more with that 
rebel feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the audience is younger in mind, it's more like we're going to have a 
party," Cresswell continues. "You want to be more vulnerable. You can do an 
aggressive show or a light show." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in tone resides in part in the Stompers' individuated stage 
personalities. "If you work in a band, there are characters," Cresswell says. 
"The stereotyped drummer is the angry guy at the back and that's a character. 
Every musician is his own character and most characters in 'Stomp' are the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 These personas have emerged over the three years that the ensemble has been 
performing together. "It's not written line-by-line or beat by beat. In that 
sense, there's room for everyone to be themselves and do what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Also as with a band, the various interludes are like numbers, grouped in a 
particular order within the set. "There's a set list on the wall backstage, 
same as with a band," says Cresswell. "If you think the slow number is going to 
work best a bit later, then you change it so that it's later." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the order remains unchanged, the mood of any given performance can 
alter the feel of the material. "You could watch it one night and everyone is 
in an 'up' jokey mood," Cresswell says. "You could see it another night with a 
few hangovers and it's quite violent." 
</P>
<P>
 It leaves room for interpretation. "Two people on two different nights and one 
will come away saying it's vaudeville and another will come away saying it's 
post-apocalyptic punk," Cresswell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the Yes/No People likely to remain the same, now that they've had a 
taste of the possibilities that America has to offer. Following its three-week 
engagement at UCLA, "Stomp" embarks on a 22-city North American tour, produced 
in association with UCLA and sponsored by Target, for whom they've done a "back 
to school" commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 They've also completed a commercial for Coca-Cola, and there may be other 
gambits and ventures coming down the pike as well. Heavily marketed and 
promoted by the CAMI machinery, "Stomp" has shown up on "Letterman," "Good 
Morning America" and other television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cresswell and McNicholas aren't about to let the business of it all make 
them lose sight of the spirit of unpretentious fun they knew in their busking 
days. "We've removed instruments and drama and (the show) really is just a 
bunch of ordinary people that you can relate to," McNicholas says. "You can 
identify with them and get into it, so maybe you'll go home with a different 
attitude toward music and sound."

COVER STORY; THE JOY OF SAX; QUICK, WHAT'S THE FIRST WORD YOU COME UP WITH WHEN 
YOU HEAR THE NAME HUGH HEFNER? YOU SAID JAZZ, RIGHT? OF COURSE YOU DID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Heckman, Don Heckman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Hefner is perched on the edge of a luxuriously overstuffed couch in his 
mahogany trimmed, baronial-sized study. Nattily attired in now-famous silk 
pajamas and robe, with a trademark can of Pepsi (decaffeinated, these days) 
nearby, he is still, at 68, the personification of the self-invented Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's 1994, not 1954, and Hefner, his somewhat thicker waist balanced by 
slightly thinning hair, has been married for five years to former Playmate 
Kimberly Conrad. In the sunlight outside the Holmby Hills Playboy mansion, 
their two young boys play on the lawn, and the large, ornately wood-paneled 
chamber that Hefner calls the Great Room is cluttered with toys. The grotto, 
once the celebrated focal point for legendary adult games, is now just another 
upscale Los Angeles swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hefner -- who acknowledges having slept with "more than a thousand" women 
-- talks a lot about "romance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't there something deliciously romantic," he asks, "about the idea of this 
last bastion of male chauvinism being turned into a home, with children running 
around and toys underfoot? Sometimes I look out the window and see the kids 
playing in the front yard with Kimberly, and I get tears in my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone other than Hefner, it would be a curious statement to make while 
sitting directly across the room from a large, living color, near-nude 
photograph of his wife in her Playmate persona, proudly positioned near an oil 
painting of Hefner in the costume of an Italian count. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hefner is clearly delighted with this demonstrable proof of autumnal 
virility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite wonderful for me," he continues, "to have lived the life 
I've lived, and now have the chance to have a third act, to come full circle. I 
really believe that, in the past, I was always unwilling to commit to marriage 
because I was afraid to lose the romance. But now I think I've managed to 
romanticize the marriage and the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage? Children? Romance? Is this the same Hugh Hefner who was the 
free-living, free-loving playboy paragon of the '60s and '70s? To him, yes. 
More evolved, more matured, even more aware, perhaps, but living a life today 
which he feels flows naturally from his former lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that having a sense of who you were helps to tell you who you are," 
he explains. "And that's another romantic perception. But that's always been a 
part of what I'm all about." 
</P>
<P>
 One part, at least. The other part was a two decades-plus, self-described 
"adolescent dream of a life" that was spun out to the accompaniment of 
cinematic images and a jazz soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz and movies," says Hefner, with a smile. "More romance -- the two things 
that fed my dreams when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Hefner's keen interest in "the two things that fed his dreams" 
continues via his hands-on sponsorship of the first Playboy Jazz Film Festival: 
"From Bix to Bird," which runs Tuesday through Thursday at the Laemmle Sunset 5 
in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The determination to put together the festival -- with the assistance of 
producer Mark Cantor, a well-known jazz film archivist -- is another "romantic 
decision" for Hefner, one which is underscored by the constant companionship he 
has found in jazz and films. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it really comes down to," he says, "what this jazz film festival really 
represents, is the simple fact that I've never found anything that I've cared 
more about than the music from my youth. I loved the Beatles, sure, but I never 
became -- except for dancing purposes -- a hard rocker. To me, there is 
something incredibly celebratory, and so wonderful about really good big-band 
swing and Dixieland." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will cover big-band swing and a wide range of other jazz forms. 
Included in the three-day bill are the world premiere of Jean Bach's "A Great 
Day in Harlem," which chronicles the taking of a remarkable group photograph in 
1968 of nearly 30 major jazz musicians, interestingly the photo assignment came 
from Playboy's greatest rival at the time, Esquire magazine; "Bix Beiderbecke: 
The Documentary"; "New Orleans," in its first L.A. theatrical screening in many 
years; Brigitte Berman's Academy Award-winning Artie Shaw profile, "Time Is All 
You've Got," and powerful documentaries on Chet Baker, Billie Holiday, Duke 
Ellington and Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's one sound that stands out for me among these films, it's Bix 
Beiderbecke's trumpet," Hefner says. "To listen to good Beiderbecke is like 
listening to a gorgeous human voice. It's too delicious. It's like what some 
people say about symphonic music -- it's the difference between a good book and 
a tabloid newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the films on the festival program, a 1933 Bing Crosby film 
titled "Too Much Harmony," provided Hefner with the opportunity to restore a 
rarely seen, pre-Hays Code musical that had direct associations to the Jazz 
Age. "It has some wonderfully sexy stuff in it," says Hefner, "stuff that never 
could have been done a year or two later." 
</P>
<P>
 H efner is clearly enthusiastic about these films and the music they 
represent. Jazz and film have been essential elements to him -- and to the 
Playboy mystique -- since the first issue of the magazine was published in 
December, 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue contained a piece on the Dorsey brothers, and almost every 
subsequent Playboy contained something related to jazz: stories on Louis 
Armstrong and Charlie Parker; a picture story about the Stan Kenton band on the 
road; pieces written by Dave Brubeck and Benny Goodman. The subject of the 
first "Playboy Interview" was Miles Davis, and the interviewer was Alex Haley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started," Hefner says, "I just wanted to put out a men's magazine. But 
by the end of the '50s, it was so successful that I seized it as a vehicle for 
changing the direction of my life. And that crucial change in my life was also 
associated with jazz, because it all began within a space of about six months 
after the first Playboy Jazz Festival in August of 1959." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, held in Chicago, featured a remarkable lineup that included 
Miles Davis, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Coleman 
Hawkins and Dave Brubeck. It was described by critic Leonard Feather as "the 
greatest single weekend in the history of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 "That fall," continues Hefner, "I started 'Playboy's Penthouse' -- the 
syndicated TV show -- which used a lot of jazz acts. I bought the original 
Chicago Playboy mansion in December of that year, and in February of 1960, we 
opened the first of the Playboy clubs, which became important jazz venues." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that Playboy's birth at the close of 1953 came when a 
generation of postwar youth was turning to rock 'n' roll (both Bill Haley's 
"Rock Around the Clock" and Elvis Presley's initial Sun Records releases 
appeared in 1954), the magazine stayed with jazz because, as Hefner put it, 
"the guy who was editing it was into jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, rock 'n' roll simply wasn't the appropriate accompaniment 
for the Playboy lifestyle as it was envisioned by Hefner. Cool jazz, perhaps 
most definitively depicted by Cy Coleman's smooth and easy, and -- to anyone 
who watched the shows -- instantly memorable theme music for the Playboy 
television shows, seemed a far better choice for the cocktail party escapades 
of the '60s swingers. When rock music did eventually creep into the picture, it 
generally served as accompaniment for polite displays of the twist and the 
hully-gully. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner was well aware of the differences between the cool jazz he favored and 
the teen-oriented rock 'n' roll that was emerging throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was important to me," says Hefner, "was the connection to the music that 
I personally loved. But I also liked the fact that there was an elitist aspect 
to it which separated us from the bubblegum rock that was becoming popular in 
the '50s. The good music in that time frame was on LPs, while the kids were 
buying dumb music on 45s. So I think there was a certain kind of snobbery to 
our association with jazz too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leonard Feather wrote an early piece for us on rock 'n' roll and jazz and 
said, in effect, that there is good music of every kind, but that rock goes 
back to primitive forms that jazz has left behind. And of course that was my 
prejudice at the time too." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner was also prejudiced in favor of big-band music as well, which may 
explain why the Playboy Jazz Poll, begun in 1956, initially was structured with 
an oddly anachronistic big band instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections resulted in such curious mixtures as a trumpet section with 
Herb Alpert, Al Hirt and Miles Davis. Given Hefner's affection for swing music, 
the instrumental structuring of the poll is not surprising. But there is 
something jarring about the annual two-page spread of cartoon-like drawings 
depicting, for example, Lionel Hampton smiling benignly at a funereal-looking 
Ginger Baker, which occurred after the poll went to a Jazz and Pop format in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz memories seem to have a mellowing effect on Hefner. Recalling his first 
hearing of Billie Holiday, he pauses and leans back, eyes glistening with the 
still-poignant recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the exact moment and the exact song when I first heard her," he 
says. "The song was 'Travelin' Light,' because I was a senior in high school -- 
it was 1943 -- and I was driving back from Sunday school with the radio on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only time I could get to use the car, only for special occasions, 
like a Sunday-school class. So we'd pay the Sunday-school dues and then go park 
somewhere. We were driving back from church, and this incredible song came on. 
I was just blown away. I didn't know who it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day I went to the record store and found out, of course, that it was 
Paul Whiteman's orchestra with a vocal by someone named Lady Day. Well, I very 
quickly discovered who Lady Day was and started collecting her records." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hefner, jazz became the music "that didn't have boundaries," the music 
that was "slightly outside respectability" and the perfect underscore for the 
fulfillment of his life's fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Films had a similar effect: "Those movies I saw when I was a kid represented a 
time of wonder, a time of optimism, a time when all things were possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Astaire/Rogers pictures and the Art Deco thing had a tremendous impact on 
me," he recalls. "Everybody at nightclubs always wore tuxedos. Everything 
closed with a happy ending, and love was expressed through song and dance. All 
those things fed my fantasies. They described a world that made me feel -- 
having grown up just after the Jazz Age, just after Scott Fitzgerald's era -- 
that I had arrived a day after the party. And I've spent a good part of my life 
trying to relive that party." 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts to do so are fully apparent. Even a casual glance at the Playboy 
mansion, with its high, gated outer portal, its sweeping, circular drive and 
sumptuous, double-door entryway, calls up visions of Gatsby's digs. And Hefner 
is quick to acknowledge that the visual elegance of Fred and Ginger in "Flying 
Down to Rio" and "The Gay Divorcee" clearly impacted his view of the Playboy 
parties as gatherings for sophisticated people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner's origins were less than urbane and sophisticated. He was born Hugh 
Marston on April 9, 1926, grew up on the West Side of Chicago at a time when 
the area was rural, and the streets were illuminated by gas lights. Voted class 
"humorist" at Steinmetz High School, Hefner was raised in an atmosphere he 
identifies, without much humor, as "a typically American, Methodist, repressed 
home, in which no real emotion was ever shown." 
</P>
<P>
 But music and films were always present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the one common interest we had was the movies," he recalls. "And 
songs. The only way I ever saw my parents express emotion was singing, around 
the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feelings were there," continues Hefner, more darkly pensive now. "We knew 
we were loved. But there was no touching, no feeling, not even any verbal 
expression of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that very early on in my life, at an unconscious level, I escaped 
from that rather sterile environment into the dreams and fantasies that I saw 
in movies and heard in music. And I think that, in a very real way, romantic 
love, as expressed in those songs and movies, became the equivalent of any kind 
of love for me. And I think that much of my life -- even the more obsessive 
side of it -- has been a pursuit of that kind of romantic dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner's first serious effort to capture his own romantic dream came in the 
'40s, when he became engaged to and married his first wife, Millie Williams. As 
with so much of the Hefner chronology, the story links directly into his later 
life with Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 When he enrolled at the University of Illinois in 1946 after two years of Army 
service, Williams was ahead of him. Doubling up on courses, he graduated in 2 
1/2 years, while also serving as managing editor of a campus humor magazine, 
Shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Millie still graduated a semester ahead of me, and went off to teach," 
recalls Hefner. "We became engaged in December, even though I wasn't aware that 
at the same time she was having an affair with a coach at her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around February -- we were going to be married in June -- she told me about 
it. And here's the movie connection again: We'd just been to see a Loretta 
Young movie called 'The Accused' about a teacher who's guilty of something or 
other. And it pushed those buttons. I was absolutely devastated. It was the 
single most devastating moment of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner sighs, and pauses to take a thoughtful swig of Pepsi before continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," he says, "I was my parents' child, to some extent, after all, in those 
early days. I'm sure that in some way, that experience set me up for the life 
that followed. Part of that life was a consequence of the repression of 
childhood. But another part of it was simply that if you don't commit, you 
don't get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 H efner, nevertheless, decided at that time to commit. He married Williams in 
June, 1949. Their 10-year alliance produced two children: Christie, now the 
chairman and chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises, was born in 1952; 
David, a computer programmer, arrived in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 As the magazine's circulation skyrocketed, Hefner's marriage began to come 
apart. By the time of his divorce in 1959, he was ready to take his game to 
another level. Playboy's success provided the perfect international stage for 
the presentation of himself as a living embodiment of the Playboy Philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in an ideal situation with an ongoing interconnection with beautiful 
women who were attracted to me," he says (without any false modesty), "and I to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he sees any contradiction between his belief in romance and his 
pursuit of the Playboy lifestyle, Hefner hesitates for a moment, obviously 
craving the pipe that served as a useful prop before its abandonment after his 
stroke in the mid-'80s. He finally shakes his head no. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he says. "It's not at all inconsistent. I realized, very early 
on, that because Playboy was dedicated to the play and the pleasure part of 
life, that there were people out there who perceived that what we were saying 
was if it felt good, do it -- pleasure without any responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's why I started writing the Playboy Philosophy in the early '60s -- 
to try and say, 'Not at all, this is not what we mean. What we're really doing 
is exploring the possibility, for the very first time in our society, that it 
might be possible to be single and still live a moral life. That maybe there 
are other ways of living alternate lifestyles. That maybe there can be a 
morality that is related to what is both good for people and society." 
</P>
<P>
 The views represented in the Playboy Philosophy are, according to Hefner, the 
extensions of views he began to formulate during his high school years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, a movie set the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' I couldn't understand how it was 
possible for us to be fighting a war, and still live in a society in which 
there was no integration, in which schoolteachers made rules which I didn't 
think were democratic." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take very long for his differences with the system to make an impact 
upon Hefner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that by the time I got to the latter part of high school," he says, 
"I became convinced that when you grew up, you lost all your dreams, and 
compromised, and turned into something else. And I knew I didn't want to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 So, when the opportunity arose, in the late '50s for Hefner to live out his 
dreams, he embraced it wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost as though all the creativity that I'd experienced in my youth 
-- with little magazines and cartooning and making 8-millimeter films -- as 
though it all stopped when I graduated from high school. I went into the Army, 
and into college, then into marriage. Then, finally, it was the magazine, and 
the doors it opened that started the creativity all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 'Creativity" is only one of the words that could apply to Hefner's 
personification of the Playboy image in the '60s and '70s. Constantly in the 
media, soaring around the globe in his lush Playboy jet, "The Big Bunny", 
proudly displaying rotating circular beds in the Playboy penthouse and 
quasi-country English digs at the Playboy mansions, Hefner was surrounded by 
celebrities, intellectuals and, always, beautiful women. If he just missed the 
Jazz Age parties of the '20s, he more than made up for it in the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real magic time," he says with a smile, "almost a window of 
opportunity in those two decades between the invention of the pill in the early 
'60s and the arrival of AIDS in the early '80s. It was almost like a time of 
Eden, a time of real sexual innocence and exploration and adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 The magic disintegrated in the '80s. Playboy suddenly seemed irrelevant to a 
generation that initially took sexual emancipation for granted, and then was 
confronted with the fearful inhibitions of AIDS. Hefner's financial empire was 
shaken by Playboy club licensing problems and the magazine's diminishing 
circulation, and his free-and-easy image was tainted by the suicide of a 
trusted associate and his linkage -- however indirect -- to the Dorothy 
Stratten tragedy, in which 1980's Playmate of the Year was murdered by her 
estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he had a stroke. Recovery was fairly quick and apparently complete. 
But soon afterward, Hefner announced his marriage plans. In 1988, he turned 
over the reins of Playboy Enterprises to daughter Christie, and in 1989, in a 
high-profile ceremony at the Holmby Hills mansion, he married Kimberly Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner no longer participates actively in most of Playboy's far-flung 
commercial enterprises. But he continues to play a significant role at the 
magazine, still choosing both centerfolds and covers. Much of his spare time is 
spent working on an autobiography which, at this writing, has "reached the 
1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 But as we near the mid-point of the Generation X '90s, one wonders how 
relevant jazz, classic films and, for that matter, the 40th-anniversary issue 
of Playboy really are? 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner leans back, starts to reach for his nonexistent pipe, goes for a Pepsi 
instead and grins sardonically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they're all viewed as something from the past, sure," he says. "And 
they're all very American. Jazz remains the one true American art form. And I 
think that the movies and Playboy represent, to much of the rest of the world, 
the best of the American dream. And sometimes, as often happens, the rest of 
the world has a higher regard for that dream than we do. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not to say I don't think there is wonderful stuff being produced 
today, because there is. But I think something's also been lost. And I think 
it's our sense of wonder. People are more afraid to dream now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, there are still some dreamers around, and I count myself among 
them," concludes Hefner. "And it's my hope and expectation that -- before we go 
to hell in a handbasket -- we will begin to look back at this century and see 
some of the best of what we've done, in jazz, in film, in art and design and 
literature and, yes, in Playboy, and get back to an appreciation and 
understanding of some of the really exciting things that have happened, and 
that are still happening."

NO MORE MR. MODERATE; ONE PART OF WILSON IS A CONSENSUS-BUILDING PREPPY FROM 
YALE. THE OTHER IS A TOUGH-TALKING EX-MARINE. CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOSE THE YALIE 
FOR GOVERNOR IN 1990. NOW THE MARINE IS SEEKING A SECOND TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel M. Weintraub, Daniel M. Weintraub is a staff writer in The Times' 
Sacramento bureau. His last piece for the magazine was on Willie Brown's first 
10 years as state Assembly Speaker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is nearly dark on a late winter afternoon, and Pete Wilson is out to prove 
he is ready to rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 California's chief executive is concluding a two-day swing that has taken him 
through half the state he adopted more than 35 years ago, a state that, despite 
electing him twice to the U.S. Senate and once to the governor's office, has 
never quite adopted him. Wilson, despised by his own party's true believers and 
merely tolerated by most of the rest of his constituents, is recharging his 
batteries for what he says will be his final campaign. On this tour he has 
stopped at a Fontana steel mill, the Los Angeles County Central Jail and an 
Orange County police station. He has partied with old friends in San Diego, 
talked business with Fresno employers and chatted on-line with future-minded 
voters in the Silicon Valley. Now he is back in Sacramento to unveil his 
reelection campaign with a rally at a nightclub tucked into a newly renovated 
downtown shopping mall. Lest anybody miss the message, he will deliver his 
speech from the center of a boxing ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The room, decorated with blue and gold balloons and banners, is packed with 
Wilson supporters, many of them fresh from their jobs at the Capitol down the 
street. Even at day's end, their white shirts remain crisp -- like the 
enthusiasm they exude for their boss. They roar in approval when Wilson enters 
and strides toward the ring through an honor guard of supporters; as he passes, 
he slaps awkward high-fives at outstretched palms. Still clad in a dark suit 
and red tie more appropriate for the formal venues from which he has come, 
Wilson steps into the red, white and blue ring, shadow boxes for a moment, then 
grabs the microphone to address the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife, Gayle, standing beside him, the governor who rode into office 
four years ago as a different sort of Republican concerned about children, 
schools and the environment, who billed himself as a champion of women's 
rights, who openly courted the gay vote, delivers a speech to drive home his 
latest theme -- that guiding the nation's largest state is not a job for the 
weak of heart. He sums up his new message with these words: 
</P>
<P>
 "California," Wilson says, "is not for sissies." 
</P>
<P>
 This from a man who complains that the public misunderstands him. How could 
the public not? 
</P>
<P>
 Reinventing government may be all the rage at the moment, but sometimes it 
seems as if Peter Barton Wilson has been reinventing himself throughout his 28 
years in public office. Once the advocate of a "no bust" policy for marijuana 
possession, now he talks up zero tolerance for drug use. Despite having signed 
the biggest tax increase in state history, he portrays himself as a 
tight-fisted fiscal manager. And though he is a onetime Senate champion of 
cheap migrant labor for his friends in the farm lobby, he now blames immigrants 
for many of his state's mounting problems. The self-described compassionate 
conservative has become California's chief tough guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation strikes some as hypocritical. Gentler analysts might see it 
as evidence of how the man split his political personality to react to changing 
times. One part of Wilson is a consensus-building, compromising preppy from 
Yale who understands the limits of ideology and knows how to cut a deal. The 
other is a tough-talking, power-craving ex-Marine. California voters were 
offered the Yalie for governor in 1990, but watched him respond to the 
tempering force of the state's deepening recession with a public metamorphosis 
into a swaggering, take-no-prisoners autocrat. Now the Marine is seeking a 
second term. If Wilson wins, no one can be sure which side of him will govern 
the state -- if it can be governed -- for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 By any conventional reasoning, Wilson has no business even being in this race, 
much less leading it, which is where some polls placed him as summer headed 
toward fall. Since he took office, more than half a million Californians have 
lost their jobs. Those who still are working pay higher taxes, while the ones 
who depend on government benefits have seen their stipends slashed. With the 
acquiescence of the Democratic Legislature, Wilson has raided state workers' 
pension funds, raised college fees by more than half, grabbed local property 
taxes and let school funding be eroded by inflation. He has run a string of 
budget deficits unrivaled since the Depression, and it was his brinkmanship 
that forced the state to pay its bills with IOUs during a long budget stalemate 
in 1992. A year later, Financial World magazine rated the state's management 
the worst in the nation. Wall Street has downgraded the state's credit three 
times in three years, forcing taxpayers to pay higher interest on the 
government's burgeoning debt. 
</P>
<P>
 While no major scandal has rocked the Wilson Administration, on his watch the 
Department of Motor Vehicles spent millions on a new computer system that does 
not work, and the state lottery was found to have used slipshod procedures in 
awarding a $600-million contract without competitive bidding. The California 
National Guard, when called upon to quell the Los Angeles riots, had to cool 
its heels for half a day because the soldiers were ready but the ammunition was 
not. It is no wonder that seven in 10 voters believe the state is headed off 
down the "wrong track." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been enough misery in Wilson's 3 1/2 years as governor to bury most 
politicians. Yet this is no conventional pol. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1966 -- when Lyndon B. Johnson was in the White House and student 
radicals were in the streets -- Wilson has succeeded like no other California 
leader by distilling and then reflecting back the heartfelt impulses of the 
state's voters. The vision he has articulated for his state may be a narrow 
one, but Wilson is unparalleled at reading the public's will, and his instincts 
are remarkably in sync with a majority of the electorate, still dominated by 
the aging white middle class. From time to time he takes those impulses to 
extremes, and his poll ratings plummet. But he learns, refines the message and 
trudges on, for politics is his life. He has been a legislator, a mayor and a 
U.S. senator. Wilson, 61, has been elected nine times to public office and lost 
just once -- an ill-fated bid for governor in 1978. He doesn't mean to lose 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a real pain in the ass," Wilson says when asked to describe the trait 
that serves him best as governor. "I just stay with what I believe in until I 
get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Wilson claims no interest in national office, a comeback victory this 
year would put him on every pundit's A-list of Republican presidential 
prospects. Standing in his way is Democrat Kathleen Brown, the state treasurer 
and former Los Angeles school board member. Luck has given him a popular 
opponent whose campaign has repeatedly stumbled, plagued by management 
difficulties and a lack of focus. And he's seized the opportunity her missteps 
have presented by hammering at a tough man's triad of issues: crime, 
immigration and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 His longtime campaign manager, George Gorton, conceded after scanning the 
polls earlier this year that Wilson would have a hard time winning if the 
campaign were focused on softer issues like education and the environment, 
issues on which voters believe the governor has performed poorly. But Gorton, 
recalling Democrat Dianne Feinstein's 1990 slogan ("tough but caring"), says 
that in this mean season there is not even a need to make such a gesture of 
compassion. "This is a year," Gorton said, "for tough and tough." 
</P>
<P>
 DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS HAD another agenda in mind when they welcomed Wilson to 
Sacramento four years ago with almost open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years of George Deukmejian, who took great pride in saying "No" to 
legislative initiatives, most Democrats were happy to see a self-described 
activist grab the reins, even if he was a Republican. Wilson's first address to 
the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown recalled, might just as well 
have been delivered by Feinstein. The liberal chairman of the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee, Democrat John Vasconcellos, was accused of helping write 
Wilson's inaugural address, and he says he would have been proud had the 
assertion been correct. In those early speeches, Wilson denounced partisanship, 
called for consensus and outlined his view that prevention -- in the form of 
expanded health and social programs for the poor -- was far more humane, and 
less costly to taxpayers, than remediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Wilson saying the right things, as far as most Democrats were 
concerned, he also was stroking them personally, something most of them had 
rarely seen from a chief executive. In his first days in office, the new 
governor invited lawmakers to a lavish Washington-style dinner that featured 
political comic Mark Russell, and in the weeks that followed, Wilson proved to 
be far more accessible than his predecessor. His chief of staff, Bob White, 
took to playing racquetball weekly with the prickly Vasconcellos, a gesture 
that did not go unnoticed among Democrats weary of Deukmejian's taciturn ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were hints of another side. Only days into his first term, Wilson 
and his wife toured a nursery ward for premature babies at a Sacramento 
hospital, showing genuine concern as they chatted with the medical staff and 
peered at the preemies struggling for life behind glass. Afterward, the 
governor used the setting as a backdrop to make a pitch for expanding prenatal 
care for poor working mothers. But to fund his new program, Wilson said, he 
would need to cut $61 from the monthly welfare grants for poor women with 
children, whose stipend already was below the cost of housing in some 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced they will be able to pay the rent," Wilson said of the welfare 
mothers, "but they will have less for a six-pack of beer. I don't begrudge them 
a six-pack of beer, but it is not an urgent necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the remark, which sounded rehearsed, stunned advocates for the poor, 
many of them shrugged it off as a bit of cheap demagoguery from an otherwise 
sensitive man. Liberals were willing to overlook such comments as long as 
Wilson was willing to raise taxes to avoid deeper cuts in the state's 
threatened social services. While he had never urged voters to read his lips 
along the lines of George Bush's infamous pledge, Wilson did portray Feinstein 
as too eager to tax and had promised not to raise personal income tax rates. 
But faced with a $14-billion deficit in his first six months in office, Wilson 
and the Legislature raised the sales tax and expanded its reach, increased 
levies on alcohol, boosted motor vehicle registration fees and, breaking his 
pledge, raised income tax rates, though only on the state's wealthiest 
residents. The total tab came to roughly $250 for every man, woman and child in 
the state, or $1,000 for a family of four. When Republicans in the Legislature 
balked, the governor said he would not stop at twisting arms to get the votes 
he needed. If necessary, Wilson said, he'd break them. 
</P>
<P>
 If he sounded like a fierce advocate for his position at the time, now Wilson 
says he raised taxes only with great reluctance, and only to win Democratic 
votes for an unprecedented reduction in welfare grants and a five-year freeze 
on the automatic cost-of-living increases that had been part of the welfare 
program since Ronald Reagan was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it," Wilson says of the tax increase. But he adds: "That was the only 
way I was going to secure the agreement of the Democratic majority in both 
houses to the kind of spending cuts that I knew we had to get if we were to 
have any remote hope of containing the hemorrhage." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of horse trading, while often obscured by Wilson's pointed rhetoric, 
has characterized his Administration. "He's an ex-legislator," notes state Sen. 
Patrick Johnston of Stockton, one of Wilson's Democratic admirers. "He 
understands the mind-set of writing a bill that has to appeal to a variety of 
people and having to figure out what motivates legislators to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's conservative critics, of course, take a different view of his 
deal-making, particularly the grand compromise on taxes. They believe the 
rookie governor missed a historic opportunity to stand tough and reshape 
government. That episode early in his term, they say, exposed Wilson for what 
he is -- the ultimate pragmatist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a terrible budget situation and he chose the solution he could get, 
rather than the answer that was right," says economist Arthur Laffer, the 
former USC professor and supply-side theorist. Laffer's rather unconventional 
explanation for Wilson's economic policy, or lack of one: the leadership 
training instilled by his alma mater, Yale University. Like the three 
Republican Presidents from that school -- William H. Taft, Gerald R. Ford and 
Bush -- Wilson lacks ideological moorings, Laffer argues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yalies immerse themselves in the topic," says Laffer, a fourth-generation 
graduate of the New Haven, Conn., institution. "They learn the subject from the 
inside out. They put themselves in the other guy's shoes. The only thing they 
have to sacrifice is all their own personal values. They are like ships in the 
ocean with all the equipment in the world -- but no compass." 
</P>
<P>
 Such criticism might be easier for Wilson to stomach had his prescription 
cured the budget's ills. But, of course, neither the taxes nor the cuts 
stanched the fiscal bleeding, and the budget, along with California's economy, 
remained in the tank. The public soon turned irritable, and Wilson was their 
logical target. His public approval rating plunged in September, 1992, to the 
lowest level ever recorded for a California governor: Just 19% of the voters 
surveyed by the Field poll said he was doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson was absorbing these blows, he also was mourning the loss of a 
longtime friend and adviser, Otto Bos. The governor's eternally optimistic 
communications director had died suddenly of a heart attack in June of 1991. 
Bos, an immigrant with humble roots who learned English as a teen-ager, was a 
decorated veteran of Vietnam who later protested the war while a student at San 
Francisco State. After covering Wilson as a reporter for the San Diego Union, 
Bos joined the then-mayor's staff in 1977. He was, some said, the only man in 
Wilson's tight inner circle who had ever changed a diaper. Although his job was 
to communicate Wilson's message to the public, Bos probably was more valuable 
for his ability to communicate the public's message to Wilson. His passing left 
a void that no one else close to the governor was able to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otto just came at it from a different perspective than Pete did," says Gayle 
Wilson. "Whether it was being an immigrant, or having been at San Francisco 
State in the '60s, he would see things differently from a man raised in St. 
Louis who went to Yale and was in the Marine Corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Vasconcellos still describes the first six months of Wilson's term 
as the "period of enlightenment." He is not alone in citing Bos' death as a 
turning point in Wilson's governorship. Education lobbyists, children's 
advocates and environmentalists all saw Bos as their bridge to Wilson. "Otto 
was so public and so accessible and so buoyant," Vasconcellos says. "When he 
was there in difficult times, Pete was magnanimous. Without him Pete has been 
mean. He has been in the hands of people so cynical and so dark and so hidden 
that it's been pretty horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is typically dismissive of such analysis, deriding it as "pop 
psychology worth about what you paid for it." The governor considers himself a 
rationalist to the core. To suggest that a personal loss -- even a huge one -- 
might color his decisions on policy is to insult him in the basest way. Ask him 
about emotions and more often than not Wilson responds with facts. Prod him, 
and he will acknowledge that he loved Bos like the younger brother he never 
had. But he insists that Bos, while a friendly sort, was no political pushover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otto was a thoroughly decent, warm guy," Wilson says. "But he was 
tough-minded. And I don't know that his decisions would have been very 
different from my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in fact, did not need Bos' death to darken his world view toward the 
end of his first year in office. The state he was elected to govern, after all, 
was crumbling around him. In a thin but jolting report from his Department of 
Finance, the governor learned that even if the economy recovered, serious 
demographic trends would keep budget deficits piling up for years to come. 
Welfare caseloads were growing, immigration was rising unabated, prison 
populations were soaring and school enrollment was climbing inexorably. 
Meanwhile, the number of people in their peak taxpaying years was shrinking 
relative to the population of older and younger, more dependent residents. 
While some of its more Malthusian projections turned out to be exaggerated, 
this gloomy missive -- titled "California's Taxpayer Squeeze" -- confirmed for 
Wilson what he had already begun to sense: that the huge amount of political 
capital he had expended trying to balance his first budget represented no more 
than a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 WITH HIS STATE'S FUTURE LOOKING GRIMMER, WILSON'S TONE BECAME more severe 
toward the end of 1991, and his Administration's policies took a noticeable 
lurch to the right. In an interview for a November, 1991, Time magazine cover 
story about the decline of California, Wilson for the first time as governor 
cited the influx of illegal immigrants as a source of the state's problems. 
California's generous benefits also were luring the poor here from other 
states, he warned. "There is a limit to what we can absorb," Wilson said, 
reflecting the frustration so many of his state's residents were feeling. A few 
weeks later, he unveiled a proposed ballot initiative that would have slashed 
welfare grants and shifted the balance of budget powers from the Legislature to 
the governor. For Wilson, the state's sorry plight -- and perhaps his own 
increasingly desperate political standing -- had crystallized thoughts he'd 
long harbored about personal and parental responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 His strong feelings on parenting come despite not having had children of his 
own, though he did help rear the teen-age children of his two wives. When 
pressed on a subject he almost never discusses in public, he jokes that his 
childless status is "not for want of effort." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I was going to be the father of my own," he says with 
disappointment, unwinding over beers in early June at a Century City hotel. 
"That never happened . . . I think I missed a lot of fun. And also, I will 
concede, missed what I think is the heavy responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson seems to have absorbed through the military many of the life 
experiences others pick up rearing young children. A disciplined man himself, 
he admires that trait in others, going back to when he first tasted executive 
life as a lieutenant leading a rifle company in the Marine Corps after the end 
of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you really have to look out for somebody else, when their well-being is 
in your hands and you have to make sure they're fed before you're fed, that 
they are billeted before you are . . . that's the kind of responsibility I 
think has a maturing effect," he says. "I saw guys who I thought were absolute 
lightweights, suddenly when they had the responsibility of running a platoon or 
running a company, become very different people." 
</P>
<P>
 This theme, Wilson says, runs through every major issue he has dealt with as 
governor. And you can see it in his actions. The governor, after all, was 
talking about personal responsibility before Bill Clinton made it fashionable 
and even before Dan Quayle took on the nation's most famous single mother -- 
television character Murphy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson was confronted with his first chance to spare a man's life or send 
him to death, he sided with death. He denied clemency for two-time killer 
Robert Alton Harris even after acknowledging that Harris, the victim of 
monstrous abuse, suffered a childhood that was a "living nightmare." Wilson 
sent to the gas chamber a man who could have been a poster child for the 
governor's argument that prenatal care, early childhood counseling and 
intervention in dysfunctional families are needed to prevent California kids 
from going bad. 
</P>
<P>
 He will concede that the killer's backers presented a solid case for clemency. 
But the governor, discussing the case in an after-hours interview in July, 
betrays no regrets about the decision. Like a Marine storming the beach, Wilson 
answers questions as if he fears that any sign of doubt could get him killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have, I think, a pretty strict standard," he says, recalling the Harris 
case. "I don't think it is enough that you yourself have suffered abuse. You 
may very well have been brutalized. But if you are capable of discerning right 
from wrong, and capable of exercising a choice, an intelligent choice, and you 
choose to take a life, then I think you have forfeited your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's view of the Los Angeles riots is similar. Though he has spoken 
eloquently on the problems of low self-esteem among the underclass, he had no 
interest in joining those who blamed the riots on widespread poverty and the 
sense of helplessness it can breed in its victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can ever condone violence," he says. "That's just not 
acceptable. And it's not inevitable either. I mean look at the Great Depression 
of the 1930s. If there's been a tougher economic time in this century for the 
people of this country than the current time or the time just passed, it was 
the '30s. What was the crime rate then? And what was the violent crime rate? 
Negligible. "At that point we still had families, and we had people who were 
disciplined. And there was a code of conduct. You were raised to respect the 
rights of other people. You were raised to respect yourself, other family 
members. You didn't just do as you damn pleased and bash somebody because the 
mood was on you." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in those gloomy late spring days of 1992, fresh from the execution and 
the riots, that Wilson turned his attention to the Legislature, and his 
approach was no less harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a budget deadlock that accomplished little, the governor stared down the 
Democrats for 63 days and forced the state to pay its bills with IOUs. Although 
widely viewed as the victor in the confrontation, Wilson, to break the impasse, 
gave up on deep cuts in health and welfare programs and agreed to a disguised 
form of deficit spending. And by making education funding the major issue, 
Wilson picked a fight with an opponent, the California Teachers Assn., that was 
more than his match. In the end, the schools got enough money to stay afloat in 
hard times, and the teachers union got enough ammunition to paint Wilson as the 
anti-education governor. Democrats were more than happy to let Wilson claim a 
tactical victory. They knew it would be Pyrrhic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor wasn't through. With the November elections looming, he 
called the Legislature back into special session to fix the fraud-ridden and 
inefficient worker's compensation system. He argued persuasively that the 
system was costing employers too much while paying employees too little: the 
middlemen, mostly doctors and lawyers, were eating up the difference. But 
Wilson clearly wanted to use the issue as a wedge to drive voters away from 
Democrats in key legislative districts. When the special session convened, the 
governor demanded that lawmakers pass his bill. Instead, they recessed after 
one day and went home. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Wilson suffered such a shellacking at the polls that 
Republicans began talking openly about dumping him as the party's nominee in 
1994. With his ally, President Bush, pulling down the entire Republican ticket, 
Wilson lost big: voters rejected his ballot initiative to slash welfare grants, 
defeated his hand-picked successor for the U.S. Senate, and strengthened 
Democrat Willie Brown's grip on the state Assembly, which Wilson had hoped to 
put in Republican hands. The results amounted to a stinging vote of no 
confidence that threatened to make him the state's first governor in half a 
century to be forced out after just one term. 
</P>
<P>
 FEW THINGS FRUSTRATE Pete Wilson more than someone who disagrees with him 
because they don't understand his argument. Supremely confident in the strength 
of his own reasoning, he usually concludes that anybody who opposes him must 
not have heard, or comprehended, his point of view. This is a governor who 
watches legislative floor debates -- a usually meaningless theatrical exercise 
that occurs only after all the votes have been decided in private -- on 
closed-circuit TV in his office and grows angry when his allies fail to present 
his position forcefully enough, as if doing so would change some minds. So when 
the voters rejected everything Wilson stood for in the midterm elections, it 
was natural for him to discern that they did so because they were ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking stock after that electoral drubbing, Wilson resolved to redouble his 
efforts to educate the masses. "People are deluged with information, most of 
which they're not seeking, and if it's a choice between what they would like to 
know and what I would like them to know, they're going to choose what they'd 
like," Wilson said recently after a day of campaigning across Southern 
California. "And it gets worse, ironically, as we succeed in affording them 
greater range of viewing choice, a greater range of information sources. That's 
highly desirable in most respects. Except I'm not sure people have really 
learned how to manage their time and whether they've really learned how to 
manage gathering the information they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson once described the voters as "intellectual shut-ins," and clearly he 
would like to help these poor souls gather the facts they need to judge him 
fairly. "When the whole village had the same information from a handbill 
slapped up on the side of the Pony Express office," he says, "for better or for 
worse, whatever the quality of the information, at least they all had the same 
information. Now we've got channel surfing. And it's very difficult to develop 
a sense of community in a community that's channel surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 To compete for attention with Roseanne, Seinfeld and MTV, Wilson concluded 
that he would need to focus on a few simple goals while relegating other issues 
to the back burner. He chose economic growth, immigration, crime and welfare 
reform. Everything else that he earlier had advocated got short shrift, 
including water and timber policy, growth management, low-cost housing, and 
yes, prevention programs. He made peace with the Democrats who controlled the 
fate of his proposals in the Legislature, stopped battling the education 
establishment and developed an uneasy truce with the public employee unions. 
Illegal immigrants, criminals and Congress took the brunt of his firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Wilson realized that the two personas that had failed him so badly 
in his first two years could, if combined, be his salvation. In 1991, Wilson's 
penchant for cutting deals got him labeled weak. The following year he turned 
confrontational, only to find himself perceived as ineffective. But if pursued 
in tandem, these elements could produce everybody's ideal leader: tough yet 
reasonable. In Sacramento, he would once again engage in the kind of messy 
give-and-take that is central to building a record of accomplishment within the 
legislative process. But on the hustings, where his words would draw more 
attention than his deeds, Wilson could use his bully pulpit to the fullest and 
be more strident than ever. Much as his mentor, Richard M. Nixon, was remade 
for his 1968 run at the presidency, Wilson got a political make-over for his 
long trek back from public scorn. And like the "New Nixon," the new Wilson was 
a lot like the old one. Only the packaging was different. 
</P>
<P>
 When he cut the necessary bargains last year to enact the state's first 
on-time budget in seven years, he found the political press, and the public, 
more enamored with his punctuality than concerned about his product. The 
governor then compromised on worker's compensation reform, accepting a package 
that he might have won a year earlier had he negotiated with lawmakers rather 
than browbeat them. He OK'd business tax breaks that, while dwarfed by tax 
increases he had signed, were hailed as a signal that California was serious 
about keeping jobs in the state. And he began to win passage of some of the 
same welfare reforms that lawmakers and the voters had rejected the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 With just enough progress under his belt to declare an end to gridlock, Wilson 
hit the road to sell himself as the comeback kid. Having concluded rightly that 
television news crews would not come to the Capitol to cover him, he went and 
offered himself to them. No plant opening was too small for this governor, no 
ribbon-cutting too inconsequential. The man who preached personal 
responsibility was taking none for the state's economic woes, blaming most of 
the mess on someone else. With a Democrat now in the White House, Wilson toured 
the state, and the country, bashing the federal government at every opportunity 
-- for cutting the defense budget, for closing military bases, for declaring 
California critters endangered while ignoring the state's economic needs, and, 
especially, for failing to control the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration alone, Wilson became a perpetual motion machine, traveling to 
El Paso, Tex., to draw attention to a border crackdown he says shows that the 
federal government could do more to stop illegal immigration in California; 
filing lawsuits seeking reimbursement from Congress for the state's cost of 
educating, jailing and providing emergency health care to illegal immigrants; 
touring hospitals and police stations to discuss the effects of illegal 
immigration; appearing at the border again to question President Clinton's 
decision to send troops to stop the Cuban boat people while doing little, in 
the governor's view, to help California. All this leaf-beating has had only a 
marginal effect on public policy, but a huge impact on how the public views 
Wilson: A wide range of voters see him as a fighter on the right side of the 
immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also helped his image with his response to two Southern California 
disasters: the fires that stretched from Thousand Oaks to Laguna Beach, and the 
Northridge earthquake. Aboard a plane for Los Angeles only hours after the Jan. 
17 quake jolted the region, the governor spent most of the following two weeks 
in the city, viewing damage, meeting with everyone from the President to local 
City Council members, and convening his Cabinet for a rare session outside the 
Capitol. He signed a wave of executive orders to cut regulations and laid the 
groundwork for a rapid government response to the disaster, including the early 
reopening of two Los Angeles freeways that collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 At times like this, Wilson was more chief executive than chief comforter. At a 
shelter in Glendale, he walked briskly without pausing past rows of cots filled 
with the newly homeless so he could keep a date with local officials and the 
National Guard. At a downed freeway bridge, he spoke at length with Caltrans 
engineers about the damage before offering little hope to citizens pressing 
against the police lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a symbolic value to being here," Wilson said between briefings, "to 
make clear to people, whether they be Caltrans workers or National Guard or 
CHP, that you really value what they're doing." But what of the victims? "You 
can't say very much to the parents of a child who has been killed or the 
children of the parent. It's pretty difficult to comfort people who have lost 
their homes and their life's belongings." 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER ALMOST THREE DECades in public office, Pete Wilson knows that 
politicians and sporting events rarely mix well. So it was with some 
trepidation, but a sense of gubernatorial duty, that he took a break from 
budget deliberations on a Saturday in June to welcome the World Cup soccer 
tournament to California. The Rose Bowl was filled with 90,000-plus fans, a 
huge number of them Latinos there to cheer on Colombia in its game against the 
Romanian national team. As Wilson walked to the center of the field, the booing 
and hissing began. The chorus soon rose to a crescendo, drowning out his short 
speech. As he left the field, the governor waved to the crowd, and many 
returned his friendly gesture with an obscene one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The rude reception, naturally, was a reflection of the Latino community's 
irritation with Wilson's heated rhetoric on the issue of illegal immigration. 
The governor says he expected some hostility, and he dismisses its importance 
by suggesting that maybe 10 people in the vast audience were registered to 
vote. But talking to him, you can't help but think he'd like to meet with those 
10 voters and try to win them over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sad thing when a lot of people who are perfectly decent people 
are misled, have been deceived, and entertain a false notion," he says when 
asked if the animosity bothered him. "I think people are laboring under a 
misapprehension when they believe a big lie and think that the chief executive 
of their state is somehow a racist or anti-Latino. The sad thing about that is 
that it's untrue and it's ugly. And yeah, that bothered me." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Wilson is the one who helped turn illegal immigration into an "us against 
them" proposition. From his campaign commercial showing hordes of Latinos 
swarming across the border while the narrator intones "They keep coming," to 
his full-page advertisements in the New York Times, Wilson has been nothing 
short of shrill. Exaggerating for effect his positions on health care and 
education for illegal immigrants, he gives the impression that he wants these 
services curtailed when he really is advocating instead that the federal 
government pay the tab. His commercial might just as easily have shown an 
excerpt of a Wilson speech in which he says illegal immigrants most hurt recent 
legal immigrants who have played by the rules. But Wilson says that kind of 
message is too complicated to convey in a 30-second spot. Others say these are 
thoughts the governor would just as soon not get across. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to have an enemy," says state Sen. David A. Roberti, the former 
Senate leader. "I don't like that, but maybe that's how you win in California. 
That's how Republicans have traditionally won. . . . Fortunately for Gov. 
Wilson, he's got some very visible enemies who upset the public -- immigrants, 
welfare recipients being the old standbys, and criminals for sure -- that he 
can gravitate to." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of Wilson's term, the Democrats who control the Legislature checked 
the governor's impulses, rejecting or watering down his most extreme proposals 
on welfare, immigration, education and crime. Wilson, in fact, appeared 
comfortable with the relationship, which allowed him to portray himself as 
tougher than thou, blame the Democrats for blocking change and ultimately enact 
proposals in line with the centrist leanings that have characterized his 
career. Then came Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidnaped from a slumber party in her Petaluma home last year, and later found 
murdered, the 12-year-old girl became a vehicle for a state's fear of random 
crime, especially after an ex-convict confessed to the crime. The long search 
for Polly's body galvanized the public's anger and focused attention on the 
Legislature's failure to pass many of the anti-crime measures Wilson had long 
advocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson immediately endorsed the "three strikes" sentencing measure, which 
requires prison terms of 25 years to life for two-time losers convicted of a 
third felony. When some prosecutors and judges fretted that the measure was so 
broad it would clog the courts and fill the prisons with aging, nonviolent 
criminals, many in the Legislature expected Wilson to follow his usual pattern 
and agree to a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Nixon going to China or Reagan cutting an arms deal with the Soviet 
Union, Wilson, insulated by his immense store of credibility on the crime 
issue, could have taken a stand against the biggest crime bill of them all. 
Instead, he insisted that the bill be passed into law exactly as written by its 
sponsor, Fresno photographer Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered two 
years ago by a repeat felon. Less than a year after failing to advance past its 
first committee test, the bill sailed through on landslide votes in both houses 
of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed the historic legislation on a rain-swept March morning in the 
parking lot of the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood division, chosen 
because it had one of the city's highest rates of violent crime a year ago. 
With television cameras whirring, Wilson sat at a simple metal desk surrounded 
by uniformed cops, the leaders of several victims' groups and a handful of 
politicians. "We're going to start turning career criminals," he said, "into 
career inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's signature on the three-strikes bills spoke more about his 
vision than volumes of speeches on the power of prevention ever could. The new 
law is expected to produce a prison-building boom that will dwarf the past 
decade's explosion, which already has made California home to one of the 
world's largest penal colonies. The bill, according to Wilson's Corrections 
Department, will force the state to build an additional 20 prisons in the next 
six years -- at a time when the University of California and the California 
State University systems will be lucky to add one new campus each. The 
$2-billion annual cost of operating the new prisons -- at more than $21,000 per 
inmate -- is roughly seven times the amount Wilson will spend this year on his 
entire agenda of prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To lead is to choose, Wilson said in that first address to the Legislature, 
when he urged lawmakers to invest in programs that would prevent human failure 
rather than warehouse it. Now he asserts -- with significant public backing -- 
that the best prevention that money can buy is to lock up the thugs before they 
steal again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledges that every dollar he spends on prisons is a dollar he does 
not have for the kind of schools, drug treatment or job training that he has 
said can reduce crime over the long haul. He says he regrets that the state 
cannot do more to help children born to abusive parents. But that compassion so 
much on display four years ago has faded, overtaken, at least for now, by the 
cold reality of limited dollars and the voters' priorities, at least as he sees 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's predecessors -- his opponent's father among them -- built legacies of 
universities, parks and college campuses, but this governor describes his 
prisons as an investment in California's future. "You can't have people living 
in fear," he says, "and still have what I call a civilized society." While 
others may judge a society by the quality of its schools or the way it treats 
its poor, Wilson has subordinated those standards to something more fundamental 
-- a message that can be articulated clearly, and toughly, in a 30-second 
commercial, today's equivalent of those 19th-Century handbills.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On first reflection, Colombia doesn't seem the most likely place on Earth to 
seek utopia. Instead of weather systems, the map in a Bogota newspaper displays 
current outbreaks of guerrilla activity -- 19 in all -- scattered like storm 
cells throughout the land. Apparently, only four of them lie in the direction 
I'm heading: los llanos, the vast plains that begin near Colombia's geographic 
center and spread nearly 600 miles to the Orinoco River on its eastern border. 
But even though the llanos constitute almost half the country, fewer than 
one-tenth of the population lives there, mostly so isolated from telephones or 
electricity that little of what goes on here is actually reported. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates the llanos from the rest of Colombia are the Andes. The craggy 
easternmost Andean cordillera looms so massively over Bogota that few here ever 
consider that the Orinoco's enormous flood plain begins only a few kilometers 
away. Yet that neglected expanse, Paolo Lugari insists as we stroll through the 
vehicular paralysis of downtown Bogota, is crucial both to his country and to a 
world filling quickly with unprecedented numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is just four degrees above the Equator, Bogota's elevation is 
nearly 9,000 feet, and everyone except Lugari is wearing woolens. Tieless, in a 
lightweight suit, he is a tall, strapping man in his early 50s with a graying 
beard, who orates in a booming basso over the wail of internal combustion 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of years ago," he declares, "a group of African primates were 
running out of resources in the forest, so they ventured into the savannas. To 
defend themselves, they had to learn to stand upright in order to see 
predators." The place where Homo sapiens emerged, Lugari says, was practically 
identical to the Orinocan llanos . "Today, the savannas of the tropics are the 
only big open spaces left. We have to learn to live in them again." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just such a setting, exactly halfway between the Andes and the Orinoco, 
that Paolo Lugari chose for Gaviotas, the community he founded 23 years ago -- 
a community that simultaneously harks back to the land and forward to the 
future. Despite its dubious location, many admirers in and beyond Colombia 
consider Gaviotas, with its ingenious strategies for tapping sun, water, wind 
and soil, a strong candidate for utopia status. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugari appreciates their sentiment, but argues with the term. "Not utopia," he 
says. "Topia." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't recognize the word, either in Spanish or English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I invented it. In Greek, the prefix 'u' signifies 'no.' Utopia literally 
means 'no place.' Fantasy land. But Gaviotas is real. We've gone from fantasy 
to reality. From utopia to topia." 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any reality: The hydrocarbon haze, bleating automobiles and 
architectural anarchy surrounding us aren't Lugari's idea of acceptable 
existence. Paolo Lugari is convinced that humans can do far better, but he 
harbors no nostalgic, pastoral illusions. The future he envisions will achieve 
harmony through -- not despite technology. Although Gaviotas remains 
intentionally small -- its population has fluctuated between 200 to 500 over 
the years -- its accomplishments have attracted both a designation by the 
United Nations as a model to the Third World and an urban market for its 
technological resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 I've already sampled one taste of topia. The Bogota condominium complex in 
which I'm staying has water heated by solar collectors developed at Gaviotas. 
Solar energy isn't new, but it usually requires the sun. Here, although it's 
rained all week, I've had hot showers every day. In fact, chilly Bogota is 
overcast about seven months a year, yet the Gaviotas solar system works so well 
that a few blocks away, in Colombia's executive palace, it also warms President 
Ernesto Samper's daily bath. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's largest solar-water-heated public housing development -- 7,500 
units -- on the edge of town, as well as the next two runners-up, in Bogota and 
Medellin respectively, are also Gaviotas projects. The explanation is neither 
magical nor very expensive, Lugari tells me: Coating the rooftop panels with a 
reflective film helps them absorb diffused as well as direct light. At Clinica 
San Pedro Claver, one of the nation's biggest hospitals, they're installing not 
just heaters but solar water boilers, coaxing from Bogota's meager sunshine 
temperatures sufficiently scalding to sterilize instruments round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 A considerable amount of energy, pollutants and money are being saved in this 
cloudy city, and I wonder aloud why this isn't done on a much greater scale in 
my allegedly technically superior country. Good question, Lugari says. And, he 
reminds me,what I see in Bogota is one small part of what Gaviotas has 
accomplished in the impoverished llanos . "Remember, the United States now has 
a lot more poor people than Colombia. You might need a Gaviotas more than you 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS 1964 WHEN PAOLO Lugari first crossed the Andes and saw the bleached 
grassland of Orinoquia, spider-webbed with languid rivers, nearly the size of 
Wisconsin. He'd been invited by his uncle, then Colombia's minister of public 
works, on a inspection flight of nearly nothing. About the only project the 
government had ever undertaken in the llanos had begun 10 years earlier, when a 
previous administration briefly attempted to scrape a highway across the huge 
prairie. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, the idea was to open the eastern portion of the country to 
refugees fleeing the bedlam under way in the western half. Nearly 200,000 
people died in what is now recalled simply as "La Violencia," a decade of civil 
mayhem waged between Colombia's two major political parties, whose platforms 
barely differed. Many survivors, driven from their farms in the rich coffee 
highlands, wandered into the llanos . They didn't find much. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the fertile Andean slopes, filled with wildflowers and coffee blossoms, 
nearly nothing grew in the sunbaked llanos except a few low-nutrient grasses 
and a squat tree called the chaparro. The palm groves lining the rivers seethed 
with malaria-bearing mosquitoes. During the nearly nine-month rainy season, any 
place the sod was broken turned to butterscotch-colored muck.  
</P>
<P>
 But young Lugari was mesmerized by this immense savanna that from the window 
of the DC-3 became wonderfully confused with the horizon. It was the most 
beautiful landscape he had ever seen, and he started having visions.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the overland trip from Bogota to Gaviotas takes 16 hours by jeep, 
depending on the number of army or guerrilla roadblocks encountered. I don't 
mind these so much: The car and body searches are a relief from the sensational 
pounding of the rutted track that is the highway that never was. And the dust: 
This is the dry season -- the road is mostly impassable the rest of the year -- 
and I am so coated with powdered clay that one sergeant doubts whether my 
passport picture is really me. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, he also doesn't recognize my companion, Bogota journalist 
Constanza Vieira, whom I first met when she worked for the now-defunct Soviet 
news agency Novosti. Constanza's father was the former head of Colombia's 
Communist Party and a founder of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias 
Colombianas, FARC, the country's biggest guerrilla army. In 1985, many 
guerrillas and sympathizers accepted an offer of amnesty to form a legitimate 
party. Since then, right-wing paramilitaries have assassinated more than 1,000 
of their candidates, including several of Constanza's friends. Frequently, 
these private armies are financed by drug barons, whose sprawling ranches we 
cross for hours en route to Gaviotas. I'm traveling there to see sustainable 
technology created by and for the Third World; for Constanza, the compelling 
interest is that Gaviotas is considered an island of hope amid Colombia's 
ongoing tragedy. We suspect there's a connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Lugari made this drive, he reached an abandoned road 
construction camp in two days. All that remained was a shed filled with weeds. 
Lugari staked a claim to 25,000 surrounding acres, including the camp, which 
was named Gaviotas -- sea gulls -- for the yellow-billed terns that fish along 
Orinocan tributaries so flat they barely seem to flow. One of these wound 
through his new property. Soon afterward, Lugari appeared in the office of 
Jorge Zapp, then head of the mechanical engineering department of Bogota's 
Universidad de Los Andes. "True or false," he demanded. "Can you build a 
turbine efficient enough to generate electricity from a stream with just a 
one-meter drop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Zapp thought a moment. "True," he replied. "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Zapp knew about Lugari from the newspapers: the enfant terrible son of a 
brilliant Italian lawyer, engineer and geographer who'd found Colombia's 
tropics so irresistible he married into a prominent family here and stayed. 
Educated mainly at home by his father, Lugari passed his university exams 
without attending classes. On the strength of an inspired interview, he won a 
U.N. scholarship to study development in the Far East. Upon returning from the 
Philippines, he launched a highly publicized, successful national campaign to 
save a historic village near Bogota from being drowned by a federal 
hydroelectric project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come to Gaviotas and I'll show you," Lugari told Zapp. "Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he visited Prof. Sven Zethelius at the National University's 
agricultural chemistry department. Zethelius informed him that soils around 
Gaviotas were only about 2 centimeters thick and high in aluminum toxicity -- 
basically, the worst in Colombia. A desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of them as different soils," Lugari urged. "The only deserts are those 
of the imagination. If we can solve how to exist in the most resource-starved 
region in the country, we can live anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 With the world's population set to double within half a century, people soon 
would have to live on land previously considered unlivable, Lugari explained to 
the scientists, agronomists, engineers and doctors he recruited for his team. 
Here, they had three choices: burn down the Colombian Amazon; do the same to El 
Choco on Colombia's western coast (the world's largest intact rain forest); or 
move to the llanos . Gaviotas was a chance to plan their own tropical 
civilization from the ground up, instead of depending on models and technology 
developed for northern climates. "When we import solutions from the United 
States or Europe," Lugari argued, "we also import their problems. In Colombia, 
we've got enough as is." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen hours into our drive, bright aluminum sunflowers appear across the 
landscape, our first glimpse of what Zapp, Zethelius, their colleagues and 
graduate students have created here. Although this tropical plain floats atop a 
vast subterranean lake, destitute Indians and early settlers had to haul water 
from muddy, mosquito- and piranha-infested streams. Zapp's mechanical engineers 
studied 58 different types of windmills before creating a custom model to pump 
the llanos . The result was a compact unit weighing barely 100 pounds, its 
blade tips contoured like airplane wings to trap soft equatorial breezes. Over 
the years, Gaviotas technicians have installed thousands of these across 
Colombia -- in some places, gaviota is the local word for windmill. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gaviotas refuses to patent inventions, preferring to share them freely, 
the design has also been copied from Central America to Chile. There is 
something serene and lovely about seeing them whirling in the meadows, 
especially after miles of electrified fences bordering the haciendas of 
narcotraficantes. But now we're in Colombia's far-flung Vichada province, whose 
motto reads "Land without people for people without land." Suddenly, the 
temperature plummets 20 degrees and nearly horizontal rain collides with the 
windshield. Instantly, the road liquefies. 
</P>
<P>
 We slither on in four-wheel drive, negotiating potholes that are now 
ponds,aiming for an incongruous sight on the horizon. It is the unmistakable, 
fuzzy silhouette of a pine forest, bursting from these bare llanos , the result 
of years of experiments directed by Zethelius to determine what might flourish 
here. Earlier, Lugari had claimed that he planted more trees last year than the 
entire Colombian forestry department. I now see he wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 When we finally slog into a compound of neat white cottages with laminated 
roofs, shaded by mango trees and bougainvillea, the sky is clearing. Gonzalo 
Bernal, for years school director and now administrator of Gaviotas, greets us 
with the news that more precipitation fell in the previous hour than Israel 
gets in a year. "The rainy season's beginning. You may never leave." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to?" says Constanza, gazing around happily. The fresh air is 
gardenia-scented; yellow warblers and dazzling crimson tanagers sing in the 
mango trees. From the main office's tiled porch, Bernal, a slim man in khaki 
shorts and a T-shirt with a sea gull logo, indicates guest houses, refectory, 
commissary, school and bachelor quarters. Across a soccer field, horses graze 
in front of a meeting hall with a radically vaulted roof. Its aerodynamic 
appearance is echoed by clusters of brightly painted, airy family dwellings, 
whose pitched roofs, studded with solar panels, consist of two triangular wings 
joined at their longest edges, rising to a crest that dips to resemble a beak. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're gaviotas," Bernal acknowledges proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 A dinner bell interrupts the evening birdsong. Gonzalo shows us how the 
ceilings in our rooms slide back to let in starlight, explains how to operate 
Gaviotas' water-saving faucets and leaves us to grab solar showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although families have their own kitchens, Gaviotans mostly eat en commune. In 
the open-air dining room, a hundred-plus men, women and children gather at long 
tables for a cafeteria-style meal of lentil soup, salad, rice, meat-and-potato 
stew, cassava and papaya juice. We join Bernal, his therapist wife Cecilia 
Parodi and Carlos Sanchez, who runs the hydroponic farm. Vegetables, beef, pork 
and fish are produced here, Sanchez adds; other foods, like grains and poultry, 
have been raised experimentally but still are cheaper to purchase. No one feels 
discouraged by the fact that Gaviotas hasn't yet achieved total food 
self-sufficiency, or that when the brook flowing through Zapp's mini-turbine 
becomes a trickle in the short dry season, they still resort to a diesel 
generator. 
</P>
<P>
 Because everyone receives a salary, they must manufacture and market their 
windmills, pumps and solar inventions, an enterprise that keeps Lugari in 
Bogota much of the year. "But in 23 years, we've learned to cover 70% of our 
needs," Bernal says. "The trees we plant more than compensate for any 
greenhouse gases we emit. Imagine the difference if the rest of the world lived 
like us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lying under equatorial stars that night after a concert of musica llanera 
performed on guitar, harp and four-stringed cuatro by Gaviotas virtuosos, I try 
to imagine the rest of the world living like them. This began as a collection 
of researchers, students and laborers sharing communal vehicles, bedding, 
dishes, clothes -- and decisions. In time, several of their families joined 
them and a permanent colony with individual houses emerged, but government was 
by consensus rather than written rules. The unwritten ones have been few and 
simple. To limit public disorder, alcohol is confined to homes. To preserve 
wildlife, dogs and guns are banished. After distinguished weekend visitors 
began arriving, like Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the 
president of Spain, Sundays and Wednesdays were switched so guests could see 
Gaviotas at work. 
</P>
<P>
 A need for police, jail or door locks has never arisen. Anyone who violates 
protocol, like a storekeeper who recently admitted overcharging to finance his 
honeymoon, is effectively ostracized by the community until his debt is repaid. 
Loafers aren't tolerated, but with pay that starts above the Colombian minimum 
wage, plus free meals, medical care, school and housing, this isn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In 23 years, no murders nor rapes. "Not even crimes of passion?" I ask Cecilia 
Parodi. "Surely there's adultery."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to have adultery when there's no marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 "No marriage?" 
</P>
<P>
 She shrugs. "Gonzalo and I were already married when we came. But there 
doesn't seem to be any need for it here. Most people live in free union. 
Partners sometimes change, but it seems to work. All these kids have pretty 
nice homes." 
</P>
<P>
 It's 7:30 a.m.; we're at the preschool, watching children romp on a seesaw 
attached to a double-action pump. As they rise and descend, water gushes from a 
vertical pipe into an adjacent cement tank. Gaviotas has also installed these 
in villages across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no churches, either," Cecilia continues. She watches as a family of 
titi monkeys swings into the foliage overhead, releasing a cloud of squawking 
parrots. "We see God in the birds, the animals, in the trees. The kids are 
taught to respect nature and love humanity. That's the basis of any faith." 
</P>
<P>
 It's true: Beyond crosses in the small cemetery, we've seen no sign of 
religion. Missionaries and evangelicals who appear are welcome, Cecilia 
explains, but they usually don't stay long. "After a while, the priest gives up 
and leaves. Same thing with political candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 I am impressed by any society so evolved it ignores politics, but Constanza 
Vieira, who has seen colleagues massacred over ideology, is practically in 
tears that such a place exists. She can't fathom how Gaviotas has resisted the 
surrounding maelstroms. This is guerrilla territory, and pickups filled with 
paramilitary vigilantes packing assault weapons prowl the savanna roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stay neutral," says Gonzalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "But how can you?" Constanza insists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I can show you. Later." 
</P>
<P>
 First, we take a techno-tour of the llanos to see how Gaviotas has 
revolutionized life here. By a pool where tiny alligators sun themselves on 
rocks, a neighbor shows us a water ram, a small, upright cylinder containing a 
pressure valve that harnesses a river's current to irrigate a field a kilometer 
away. "The technology is 200 years old," Bernal tells us. "We updated it with 
modern materials." 
</P>
<P>
 But their most significant invention is nearly as ubiquitous here as their 
windmills. It is a simple hand pump capable of tapping aquifers six times 
deeper than conventional models but requiring so little effort that children 
can operate it. In normal pumps, a heavy piston must be raised and lowered 
inside a pipe. Gaviotas engineers realized they could do the reverse: leave the 
piston stationary and lift an outer sleeve of lightweight, inexpensive PVC 
tubing instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our first 10 years, we had to carry buckets from the river," says Julieta 
Martinez, one of the many neighboring ranchers who has incorporated Gaviotas 
technology, as she pumps clear water from a 100-foot well using just her little 
finger. Her children, she tells us, were born in the Gaviotas hospital and 
educated in its boarding school. "Gaviotas changed everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At Gaviotas itself, Omar Marin, who's tended livestock here for 18 years, 
leads us to a windmill-fed cattle trough, surrounded by a sloping cement floor, 
where his cowboys have just brought several thirsty calves. "Miren la caca, " 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 We do what he suggests and observe that as the bovines drink, their dung 
slides down the slope into a gutter, which sluices it to an enclosed vat. 
Inside, anaerobic fermentation turns this cow-pie slurry into compost and 
methane. 
</P>
<P>
 The methane flows through pipes to an extraordinary building set on a rise. It 
is, Bernal tells us, the reason Gaviotas has been able to avoid taking sides in 
Colombia's chronic internecine wars.  
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese architectural journal has named this, the 16-bed Gaviotas hospital, 
one of the 40 most important buildings in the world. It was conceived by 
Gaviotas engineers, doctors, nurses, patients and an architect, Esperanza Caro, 
whom we don't meet because she is currently designing Tokyo's new Wind Park. It 
is at once futuristic and ancient, a maze of angles formed by white walls, 
glass awnings, skylights, brushed steel columns and exposed supports trimmed in 
blue and yellow enamel. Like Egyptian pyramids, the interior is cooled with 
underground ducts whose hillside intakes face the prevailing northern breeze. 
Opposing layers of corrugated roofing create a series of air channels that 
further bleed away the llano s heat. The combined effect is cost-free, 
maintenance-free air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Solar collectors attached to gleaming rooftop tanks alternately heat, boil and 
distill water. A solar clothes-dryer freshens the hospital linens. Electricity 
is from solar photovoltaic cells, Gaviotas' only foreign technological import, 
still too expensive to produce here. These cells also run a pump that sends 
oil, solar-heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit, through a closed system to the 
kitchen, where it circulates around sunken stainless-steel pressure cookers. 
The stove-top burners are fueled with home-grown methane. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only hospital within a 12-hour radius. Patients arrive from across 
the llanos on horseback, bicycle or on foot, often leading a cow or hog to pay 
for medical care. At times, when guerrilla and army forces have clashed nearby 
and the Gaviotas airstrip was filled with helicopters, both sides have brought 
their wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sven Zethelius' son Magnus, a doctor here from 1976 to 1981, once discovered 
that he had placed an army corporal and a FARC guerrilla in the same room. 
Hours earlier they had been trying to kill each other; now the one who could 
walk was bringing the other water. "The rule here is never to ask," Gonzalo 
tells Constanza. "Like the Red Cross. Everybody respects us." 
</P>
<P>
 That respect allowed Zethelius and doctors who followed him to venture 
unprotected into the llanos , paddling dugout canoes filled with medicine to 
communities of formerly nomadic Guahivo Indians. The Guahivo, now boxed in by 
settlers' fences, suffer from malaria, tuberculosis and gastroenteritis. Yet 
they wouldn't enter a hospital: To wall off someone away from his family was, 
to them, the ultimate unhealthy confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a short, vine-covered walkway connects the Gaviotas hospital to the 
maloka, a separate wing built by the Guahivo themselves. Instead of beds, 
patients and their families lie in hammocks hung from wooden beams under a 
great thatch ramada. Relatives of the sick earn their keep by tending tomatoes, 
lettuce, cabbage and onions in an adjacent hydroponic greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 If Paolo Lugari, the National University's pharmacology department and Guahivo 
shamans have their way, this greenhouse will also one day become the finest 
medicinal plant laboratory in the tropics. But money is a critical factor and 
Colombia's expanding government-owned oil and gas industry has dampened 
solar-collector sales recently by effectively blocking any tax benefits for 
investing in alternative energy. At the same time, revenue from windmills and 
pumps dropped as Colombian agriculture was battered by an unexpected onslaught 
of cheap imported foods, the unanticipated fallout of new free-market policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1990s, Colombia's government was outfitting the president's mansion 
with solar panels, issuing commemorative stamps honoring Gaviotas' achievements 
and providing funds to the U.N. Development Program, which in turn supported 
the proliferation of Gaviotas' technology in villages across the country. 
Today, a new law prohibiting government grants to nonprofit organizations has 
not only eliminated federal aid for the Gaviotas school and hospital, but 
killed funding for matching U.N. support as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can the U.N. allow that?" I'd asked Lugari back in Bogota. "Their 
pamphlets extol Gaviotas as a model to the developing world." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're broke, too. Besides, we're not a model, we're a path. When it turns, 
we have to follow. Anyhow, adaptation stimulates invention." 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, he told me, they have decided to downscale their manufacturing. 
But no one is getting laid off. "Gaviotas isn't a company. We're a community. 
In fact, the solution means that both employment and Gaviotas will grow." 
</P>
<P>
 That solution is growing on nearly 20,000 forested acres. After no indigenous 
tree proved suitable for cultivation on the prairie, Gaviotas researchers 
imported Caribbean pines, found throughout Central America. In the thin llanos 
soils, they proved to be veritable sun-and-water-processing machines, growing, 
as Sven Zethelius marveled, "five times faster than any pine tree in Sweden." 
In the last 12 years, Gaviotas has planted 1.6 million of them. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of foresters, however, the Gaviotans chose not to cut their 
standing timber. Instead, Gaviotas is converting the windmill factory to 
process pine resin extracted from the sap of living trees, not unlike how maple 
syrup is produced. Until now, Colombia has spent $4 million annually to import 
such resins for manufacturing paint, turpentine and paper. Armed with that 
fact, Lugari persuaded the Japanese government to provide the seed money, via a 
grant through the Interamerican Development Bank, to begin tapping and 
processing resin for the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 On our final evening, the Gaviotas community assembles for a workshop by 
government forestry technicians, who arrived earlier in a chartered plane. 
Paolo Lugari was to have come as well, but he's back in the city, preparing to 
receive the president of Guyana and prime minister of Jamaica, who want to 
begin a Caribbean Gaviotas. 
</P>
<P>
 We settle back to watch a video about building firebreaks. Afterward, the 
community elects to let the generator run past 9, when lights usually go out. 
No TV reaches here, and one of the foresters has brought a tape of the previous 
night's World Cup tune-up match between Colombia and Mexico. For this occasion, 
the alcohol rule is relaxed. Bottles of beer and Coca-Cola are opened, and bets 
are taken. Anyone who might know the outcome is honor-bound not to wager. 
</P>
<P>
 Constanza and I slip away to Gonzalo's house. Joined by his neighbor, school 
director Teresa Valencia, we lie on patio hammocks, listening to crickets and 
the muted clucking of toucans, and meditate on the future of this tropical 
topia. A recent agreement with the Universidad del Los Andes will bring a new 
generation of engineers here, to add to the hundreds of doctoral theses that 
have already emerged from Gaviotas. What they'll invent to meet the coming 
challenges is anyone's guess, but they'll have plenty of advisers: Zethelius, 
now in his 70s, wants to inaugurate a colony for retired professors here, 
starting with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bernal confirms that Lugari has dreamed up a new project: Gaviotas is 
going to build a dirigible. "It's a perfect, cheap way to ship our products 
across the llanos ," Paolo had told me earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to build it yourselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure. With imagination and perspiration, we can do anything. That's how 
utopian miracles become topian truths." 
</P>
<P>
 The power shuts down. As Constanza and I feel our way through the peaceful 
darkness of Gaviotas, we are surrounded by a little miracle that seems to 
justify such optimism. When environmentalists initially questioned the wisdom 
of introducing a monoculture of an exotic tree, Pinus caribaea hondurensis, 
into the llanos, Lugari countered that since nothing else grew there, Gaviotas 
was displacing no native species. In fact, quite the contrary. "You need to see 
for yourselves what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 By the light of the rising moon, we can see it. In the moist understory of the 
Gaviotas pine forest, dormant seeds of native trees probably not seen in the 
llanos for millennia have sprouted. So far, biologists have counted nearly 40 
species. Sheltered by pine trees, a diverse, indigenous tropical forest is 
regenerating here with surprising speed, and Gaviotas intends, over decades, to 
let it choke out Pinus caribaea and return the llanos to what many ecologists 
believe was their primeval state: an extension of the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the population of deer, anteaters and capybaras is growing. As this 
natural process continues, Gaviotas will keep planting more trees. They've 
already given away thousands of seedlings from their nursery to neighbors, and 
groves of young pines are thriving all over the llanos . 
</P>
<P>
 "Elsewhere they're tearing down the rain forest," Paolo Lugari says. "In los 
llanos , we're putting it back. If we can create a topia in Colombia, there's 
hope that humans can do it anywhere."

<P>
 Perched high in one of Yankee Stadium's private boxes, George Steinbrenner is 
looking on warily as film crew technicians drag carts full of heavy camera 
equipment across the outfield far below. On a less beautiful Bronx spring day, 
Steinbrenner might be pitching one of his famous fits about the wheel marks 
being left on the diamond's grass, instead of quietly making note to an aide to 
have the invaders trod more gently. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sun is shining, the baseball strike is many weeks away, and, better 
yet, Steinbrenner is moonlighting as a movie star on this off day. So the 
not-entirely-camera-shy team owner is in a good mood -- so good that he's 
indulging in America's second-favorite pastime: pontificating on the picture 
business. I move a little closer to listen in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to come out with a bad baseball movie now," Steinbrenner 
announces to no one in particular, holding impromptu court before a few 
star-struck crew members in the box between setups. " 'Major League II' was a 
horse---- movie. The only reason to do it is because they hope that sequels do 
60% of the gross of the original. It's a horse---- movie," he reiterates, in 
case anyone missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
 By inference, at least, Steinbrenner -- who has almost never allowed film 
crews into his ballpark -- believes that the production on location here, "The 
Scout," is a horse of a different odor. I'm assuming and hoping so too, for 
reasons not unlike his that will shortly be made apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's comedic pedigree is promising: Albert Brooks ("Lost in America") 
as star and co-writer, working from a script originated by Andrew Bergman 
("Honeymoon in Vegas"), with Michael Ritchie (veteran of many superior sports 
spoofs, including "The Bad News Bears" and "Semi-Tough") directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie is insistent that "The Scout" is not a "baseball movie" at all, since 
the film doesn't center on the sport per se and features fewer than 10 pitches 
and hits. To his mind, it's a sensitive relationship comedy centering on the 
bizarre, uneasy bonding between Brooks, in the nebbishy title role, and the 
handsome young naif he discovers, played by Brendan Fraser, who may just be the 
world's best, and looniest, ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the average onlooker might be forgiven for thinking this to be exactly the 
sports picture Ritchie adamantly refuses to categorize it as, if only -- for 
starters -- because of the litany of famous faces popping up as quasi-realistic 
context throughout the film, many of them Major Leaguers or tangential media 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Down on the field, warming up, is the New York Mets' Bret Saberhagen, who will 
shortly be playing himself in a scene that ends with Brooks walking away and 
muttering disparagingly under his breath about the star player's $9-million 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you got robbed," Brooks calls out to the visiting pitcher with whom he's 
about to block out a scene, referring to the previous night's Mets game, in 
which Saberhagen threw most of the strikes but wasn't credited with the win. 
"Why don't you get the victory in those games?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I dunno, it's a bad rule," mumbles Saberhagen, amiably. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll make a call," Brooks brashly reassures him, as if reverting to his Joel 
Silver takeoff from "I'll Do Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Using real-life, non-actor figures in small roles is "something that I've 
always enjoyed from the time of my first movie," Ritchie says, harkening back 
to his well-remembered 1969 debut, "Downhill Racer." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "The Scout" isn't technically a satire, Ritchie says, "there are 
certain satirical elements in all my movies. One would have to say that I 
always have a feather to tickle the media -- particularly the sports coverage, 
in every sports movie that I've done. It's the hyperbole of it I find fun. On 
this one, Bob Costas said to me, 'Listen, is this supposed to be a sendup? How 
should I do this delivery?' And I said, 'Do it absolutely straight.' And he did 
it -- and of course it's a sendup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing happened with 'The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged 
Cheerleader Murdering Mom' " -- Ritchie's seriocomic, award-winning HBO account 
of a real-life mother who tried to put a hit out on the mother of her 
daughter's school rival, and the media aftermath -- "when I had the producer of 
'A Current Affair,' who didn't want to be in the movie, playing herself. She 
was afraid we were going to be making fun of her. And I said, 'I only want you 
to do what you really did in that situation; I'm only looking for accuracy.' 
And that sat well with her, and she did it, and of course everybody perceives 
it as a huge sendup of 'A Current Affair.' It's the true thing put in context 
that just happens to play like comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 I take a special interest in how Steinbrenner and Saberhagen are faring 
because I, too, have been pressed into service to modestly moonlight as a bit 
-- and I do mean bit -- player in the movie. I'm not sure I can vouch that the 
resulting authenticity is so thick you'll be able to set your popcorn down on 
it when "The Scout" opens Friday, but it is at least credible in that it has 
reporters (i.e., me and some legitimate extras) doing what reporters actually 
really spend much of their time doing -- dodging slings and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, plates, in this instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire in the hole!" someone yells. That's me down in the "hole," which is the 
brightly illuminated courtyard of a slightly run-down apartment building on 
Manhattan's Upper West Side. The "fire" isn't explosive charges, but 
dinner-table stoneware, about 20 cases' worth, that is about to be lobbed from 
a fifth-floor window at me and my comrades here below. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is this: Brooks has taken his young charge, Fraser, back to his 
apartment to hide him from the hoopla that results when the mystery pitcher 
signs an unprecedented $50-million contract with the Yankees. The media, 
naturally, want the goods on this suddenly wealthy complete unknown. So we 
gather outside the complex and pesteringly yell up at their window until 
finally Fraser, whose Steve Nebraska character may or may not have a streak of 
violence in his past, snaps and starts throwing plates at us. While the teen 
idol will lob only about six in the final edit, for the sake of overshooting, 
we plate-takers will have to dodge about 200 detonating dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 I actually got to trade lines with Brooks earlier, sort of, shouting my lines 
up at him to give him his cues. As foolish as I feel screaming " Where's Steve 
?" and " C'mon ! We need to know stuff !" -- my two given bits of scripting -- 
at the top of my lungs, it's still a thrill to be exchanging dialogue with, to 
my mind, the greatest comic talent of our generation. Any dialogue.  
</P>
<P>
 The day started off with sessions in the wardrobe and makeup trailers. The 
shadows under my eyes were removed, as I closed them and heard the sweet words, 
"We're going to make you look 30 again." My long hair was pinned down in about 
two dozen places, to keep the high winds coming off the Hudson from having 
their way with it. I was issued a goofy checkered shirt and, at their request, 
donned a generic-looking "press badge" for the first time in my journalistic 
life. I feel silly getting gussied up so, but remembering all those laser-disc 
buffs freeze-framing on Jessica Rabbit's naughty bits, I think of my 
descendants doing a digital freeze on me and am glad I trimmed my nose hairs 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think he'll pass for a reporter?" asked the wardrobe guy, studying me 
in all my youthful rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm . . . maybe from the Voice," answered the makeup guy, none too 
encouragingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that I stand out as a phony among phonies, looking less like 
anyone's idea of a reporter than all the faux scribes from Central Casting 
surrounding me. I feel troubled by my lines. The woman standing next to me in 
the courtyard, who plays a TV reporter, fans my nervous flames, perhaps because 
she's a little jealous; she hasn't been given any dialogue at all, even though, 
like all extras in the state of New York, she's a SAG member getting paid SAG 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are your lines?" she asks me. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell her, feeling myself turning a little red from pride and embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you ever in a hundred years as a reporter say, 'C'mon, we need to know 
stuff,' to someone you were trying to get an interview with?" she asks, shaming 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then don't you think you should talk to him and suggest something that sounds 
a little less hokey?" 
</P>
<P>
 This -- the idea that on my first movie shoot ever, I should be so bold as to 
affront the director and attempt to take the whole auteur theory down with him 
-- I was not prepared for. Timidly, I begin to justify in my own mind how my 
key line is not just specific to the scene, but has a certain existential 
universality about it. I think of the wonderful "Simpsons" episode where Bart's 
usual exclamation, "I didn't do it," suddenly through media exposure became the 
all-encompassing catchphrase of a generation. I picture Generation X throwing 
their Nirvana records aside and adopting my line as their Angst -ridden 
rallying cry, rising as one voice, shaking their collective fists at the 
unresponsive passivity of the heavens: C'mon, these disillusioned youth demand 
of the gods, we need to know stuff ! 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the moment of truth: The heavens are about to rain pottery. Am I 
nervous? On one hand, I know the unknown pitcher subbing for Fraser in the 
upstairs window must have the precise aim of a Saberhagen, since surely all 
involved here know they're in for some bad press if I head back to L.A. with an 
ugly gash. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I did once write a bad review of Ritchie's "Fletch Lives." 
Could this entire shoot be the elaborate pretext for an insidious revenge 
scenario?  
</P>
<P>
 "OK, now whatever you do, don't anticipate the plates," Ritchie tells us, 
seeming genial enough. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first take I've just finished my last line when the plates start 
popping around us, shards scattering everywhere except, miraculously, around 
our faces. We actors feign surprise, then terror, and run out into the street 
and hide behind cabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie tells us to try to be a little more chaotic next take. 
</P>
<P>
 Next take the chaos comes surprisingly naturally. The insignificance of my 
little line to the narrative suddenly becomes broadly apparent as the guy 
throwing the plates no longer waits for me to finish before he starts the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, we need to knoooaaaaa AAAHHHH . . . !!!" I scream as one disc sails by 
my master-thespian noggin and another simultaneously bursts into bits around my 
ankles. I trot in awkward reverse, even as the SAGs are nervously retreating 
into and over me. For the first time, I know the thrill of a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more than a dozen additional takes of this mayhem as the morning 
wears on, not stopping till every dish is history, and never again amid all 
those takes will I get all the way through my short last line before the shards 
send me fleeing. Catchphrase be damned -- the plate-pitcher with the 
lightning-quick arm has saved me from having to say "stuff" as part of my 
immortalization. 
</P>
<P>
 At Yankee Stadium a week later, on the last day of shooting, I approach 
Brooks, who has plopped himself down in one of the thousands of empty loge 
seats to luxuriate in the uncharacteristic Zen stillness of the ballpark.  
</P>
<P>
 I tell him I'd been worried about his nose, since word on the set was he'd 
done some bleeding after getting zinged by one of the plates Fraser was tossing 
during their part of the sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were one of the guys downstairs," he realizes out loud. (One actor 
recognizing the work of another.) "Oh, no, I was all right. I was surrounded by 
about four people that did break their noses, and they were all quick to say, 
'Oh, no, you didn't break it. You wouldn't still be standing here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I begin to query him about his improvisational approach to his scenes, which 
seems even braver to me than standing in the line of fire. Watching him riff on 
little phrases or intonations in take after take, you begin to regret the takes 
that won't make it to the final edit, the funny bits dropped because he came up 
with some other idea for the scene. Each new try brings a significant new spin 
on his readings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling about this is very specific: I believe it has to be on the paper," 
Brooks says. "I was watching them promote 'Serial Mom' on TV, and they were all 
tickled; Kathleen Turner said something like, 'We just had no idea what we were 
going to say every day.' Well, I mean, that's not what I do. With an entire 
crew and time pressure, coming up with things is not the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when it's on paper and it works, then you can start to play and move and 
do stuff. And sometimes it's important to do it, because when you're writing, 
you're writing in a room. When you're filming, you're in Mexico; if there's a 
dust storm, you've gotta cough, if a burro comes by and (expletive) on your 
foot, you've got to look at it. It's like you and me; if you drop that Coke on 
my pants, I'm going to react to it. I like to take advantage of the physical 
situations and see what I can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that comes from Michael's gonzo days, too. I think 'The Candidate' they 
did on their feet, the whole movie -- at least it looked like that. And he's 
good at editing on his feet with that. I sort of sense when it's not right, and 
I look at him and he acknowledges that, so he's been able to help me with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 B rooks is primarily known for writing and directing his own films, with the 
odd acting-only gig in the very occasional James Brooks movie. But "The Scout" 
is a first -- a project Brooks didn't initiate and didn't want to direct, but 
did co-author with his writing partner, Monica Johnson (retooling an Andrew 
Bergman script Ritchie had tried to get going for years). 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gamble that could pay off in different ways for both the star and 
filmmaker. For Ritchie, the lanky, gentle giant of a director who has made some 
of the most critically acclaimed pictures of the modern era ("Smile") and a 
good share of the critically reviled star vehicles too ("Cops and Robbersons"), 
it's a chance to do a broad comedy that might also carry a classier cachet. And 
for Brooks, it's an opportunity to do something with a more populist appeal 
than his own directorial efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Michael, barring a few of the Chevy Chase movies, does have fine 
taste," says Brooks. "He reminds me of an Englishman, sort of, this tall, quiet 
man who's got a great deal of intelligence . . . and it's good for him to be in 
situations where he can use it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because he doesn't write, he's at the mercy of taking a script. 
Unfortunately, in a comedy, if the script isn't there, and the actor you're 
working with is not able to improve it that much, what difference does it make 
if you're a brilliant director?" 
</P>
<P>
 When I talk to Ritchie later, he has his own feelings about how "The Scout" 
might be good for Brooks' mainstream appeal, putting the actor's often neurotic 
screen persona in a more relaxing context. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to take that audience as far as he can," Ritchie says, "testing, 
pulling, prodding, provoking. 'Look at me, I'm an (expletive), I dare you to 
love me' -- and of course you do. All you have to do is, no matter how puffed 
up he may be, put him with somebody who has more ego at stake in the scene and 
Albert will become very vulnerable. It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Brooks: "This is not a satire at all. In terms of broadness, I don't 
know. I classify this as a summer comedy that won't make you feel dirty. . . . 
I've never been in a summer comedy before," he adds, proudly. "My movies always 
come out in February or March or October. I'm always out of the summer. So now 
I'm in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite, as it turns out; after shooting wraps, Fox bumps the movie back 
from late July to late August to, finally, late September. But on the bright 
side, this movie's World Series will be the only one happening come the first 
days of fall. 
</P>
<P>
 B ut let's get back to how all of this affects (as Al Franken would say) me . 
</P>
<P>
 It's now post-production time and, back in L.A., Ritchie has summoned me to 
the Warner Hollywood lot for voice looping. He tells tales about how some very 
well-known actors are famous among directors for deliberately muffing lines so 
they'll be called back to loop later and get paid scale for the extra days' 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 I arrive to find that Ritchie has already banished my classic "C'mon, we need 
to knooooaaahhhhHHHHH . . . !!!" to the mixing-room floor, not because I muffed 
it per se, but because he needs me to dub the line "We need a press 
conference!" in its place, the better to set up the following scene. 
</P>
<P>
 I suffer some standard looping-stage dread here: Will it be obvious that my 
lips don't quite match up with what I'm saying? Then, as I see the tape of the 
roughly edited sequence come across the video monitor as I step up to the mike, 
I suffer another kind of classic actor anxiety: I can't even spot myself in the 
scene . 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the third pass through do I vaguely recognize the guy who doesn't look 
like a reporter amid the pack of reporters, as seen in a couple of dimly lit 
long shots from a fifth-story window. Verily, I say, there is better coverage 
of the gunman on the grassy knoll in the Zapruder film than there is of yours 
truly in "The Scout." 
</P>
<P>
 Consoling myself with the hope of future laser-disc freeze-framing, I 
determine to concentrate on putting my all into my vocal performance, which 
could still stand out. I bellow fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good," says Ritchie, ever the encouraging camp-counselor type, "but 
could you make it . . . angry?" 
</P>
<P>
 I try to summon up all the rage a succession of therapists has assured me I 
suppress deep within, but merely manage to sound squeakier. "We need a pre- ess 
conference!" I shout into the boom mike, reverting to puberty midsyllable. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel ashamed, but Ritchie speaks to the booth on my behalf. "I kind of like 
where his voice cracked," he tells the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice-cracking was good? Well, if my director says so. Ritchie still 
thinks something is missing, though. I remember my fellow actor, Brooks, 
teaching me about coming up with stuff in the moment.  
</P>
<P>
 "How about," I offer, just as they're ready to usher me out, "if I said, 'Quit 
holding out on us! ' ?" (So it's not Preston Sturges, but I could hear a daily 
journalist shouting it, and more importantly, it has that existential 
catchphrase potential.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie mulls it over briefly, as if tasting a fine wine. "I like that. Write 
that down," he tells the booth, "and let's have the next person say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some other looper will get my line, then, but I feel oddly satisfied. 
Attention, "Major League III" producers: I'm available for similar minor 
rewrites, and not too proud for foul ball-dodging stunt work as a featured 
extra. With a little drive and enough money to forgo my Taft-Hartley waiver and 
buy a SAG card, why, perhaps someday I, too, can aspire -- like William 
Kunstler, Chris Connelly, Kurt Loder, Larry King, et al. -- to be a 
full-fledged cameo whore. Consider me scouted.

FILM CLIPS / 'SIEGE' MENTALITY: STEVEN SEAGAL, PLEASE CALL YOUR ACCOUNTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Under Siege II: Dark Territory" could easily be dubbed "Steven Seagal: 
Forbidden Zone" if any weight is given to the rising tide of complaints and 
accusations from its crew that continue to plague the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Former line producer Chris Kenny has surfaced with a big bone to pick. He 
insists that he wasn't fired to be replaced by Steve Perry as stated in a Times 
article Aug. 28. And he and others involved with the production say that 
Seagal, the film's star and one of its producers, has been given so much 
control by Warner Bros. that Seagal is personally dictating who spends what. 
The reason: Warners decided that any cost overruns on the $51-million budget 
should come out of Seagal's $10-million fee because at times he is responsible 
for costly last-minute changes, production sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio, which allegedly had about $18 million committed to the movie 
before the cameras even began to roll last week (including an estimated $4 
million already paid to Seagal), had to punt when Seagal decided four days 
before shooting to bump co-star Gary Busey off the picture. The actor 
reportedly was being paid $750,000 whether he was in the movie or not. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been a lot of bumping since development of the sequel to the 1992 hit 
"Under Siege" began, with producer Jon Peters (who brought Busey aboard) 
bailing in July; then Kenny, production manager Brian Frankish and other Kenny 
loyalists exiting in August. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Kenny said, there had been a plan to replace director Geoff 
Murphy ("Young Guns II") with Peter MacDonald ("Rambo III"), who is now 
second-unit di rector. MacDonald, considered tougher, was reportedly being 
wooed to better rein in Seagal. But Seagal insisted on Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been continuous changes on this picture," says Kenny. "When Steve 
Perry was brought aboard he was supposed to serve as a creative producer to 
keep (Seagal) in line." Since both Kenny and Perry are line producers, Kenny 
opted to leave: " . . I had no conflict with (Seagal)." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny also says that the script is constantly being rewritten. "The problem is 
the studio sees one movie and Steven sees another. He wants this dark, 
intricate CIA movie and Warners just wants an action movie, which is what 
Seagal fans want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was a fire near Boulder, Colo., on Aug. 23 that scorched 200 acres 
of forest and grasslands, which was sparked by a locomotive rented by the 
film's production company, Dark Territory, during a trial run for the film, 
according to local news accounts. Warner Bros. and the company declined to 
discuss the costs of that episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuing comments through a Warner Bros. spokesman, Seagal had no comment on 
the fire, but said: "I wanted both (Kenny and Perry) to stay. I was 
disappointed that Chris left, but it was his decision to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 He says that it was he who pushed to excise Busey because the story that 
allowed Busey to be reincarnated as the villain "didn't ring true." In the 
original "Under Siege," Busey was one of two thugs who plotted to steal nuclear 
arms from a battleship. The decision to oust Busey was the last straw for 
Peters, who had fought for Busey to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Warners, Seagal refused to discuss the picture's budget, but said he was 
the one who offered to keep costs in line. "I have complete faith in the 
ability of this production team to deliver this movie on budget," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted this film to have upbeat action and humor," Seagal said. He 
said the strategy of the counterterrorists needed to be "beefed up" so he 
brought in some consultants from the CIA. "But I have to say ("Dark Territory") 
is not darker," adds Seagal. "It's now smarter and more realistic."

FILM CLIPS / BOOK WARS: FORREST GUMP MEETS HIS MATCH: HORACE DUMP; BILLY 
FROLICK'S 'DUMPISMS' TAKES ON WINSTON GROOM'S 'GUMPISMS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Move over, Weird Al Yankov ic. Billy Frolick, the twisted brain behind last 
year's lusciously wicked book parody "The Ditches of Edison County," has set 
his dead-on sights on this summer's biggest film-and-quickie-book phenomenon, 
"Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 As "Ronald Richard Roberts," Frolick ran rampant over Robert James Waller's 
"Bridges of Madison County," selling more than 100,000 copies in the process. 
Now his nom de plume is Horace Dump, and his "Dumpisms: The Witless Wisdom of 
Horace Dump," will be published by Plume with much fanfare Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Dumpisms" is not too far afield from Winston Groom's "Gumpisms: The 
Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump." "Dumpisms," as it happens, is the only book 
that pays homage to two of Tom Hanks' most memorable phrases from the film: 
"Stupid is as stupid does" and "Life is like a box of chocolates -- you never 
know what you're gonna get." 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find those in 'Gumpisms,' " says Frolick. And while they don't 
appear in exactly that form in "Dumpisms," these two phrases are included: 
"Stupid am as stoopid doo" and "Sex is like a box of chocolates -- sweet, gooey 
and nauseatin' if you overdo it." 
</P>
<P>
 Horace's pearls of wisdom, which Frolick says took just 2 1/2 days to write, 
are "such a bargain!" he says -- at $4.95, a nickel cheaper than Groom's 
"Gumpisms." Groom also wrote the novel on which the Paramount film was based. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian McLendon of Pocket Books, Winston Groom's publisher, said that the 
author hadn't heard about the unauthorized parody but was taking it in stride, 
saying only, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." 
</P>
<P>
 Frolick, 35, is not about to stop there. He's taken aim at James Redfield's 
best-selling "The Celestine Prophecy," which details a dangerous spiritual 
journey to find a life-changing ancient manuscript hidden in Peru. This time 
Frolick, a.k.a. McCoy Hatfield, has penned his adventure, "The Philistine 
Prophecy." "Surely, soon to be a major motion picture," snickers Frolick. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the success of "Ditches," Frolick spent much of his professional life 
covering entertainment in Los Angeles as a free-lance writer. He also schlepped 
for eight years in show business as a page for ABC ("seating geriatric bus 
groups in tapings"); worked at ICM as an assistant ("my personal Vietnam"); 
worked for producer Sandy Howard ("I felt like I was in 'The Producers'!"); did 
a little TV and script writing, and began developing a project called "Luck" he 
discovered while working at New World Pictures. It has since evolved into 
"Stars Fell on Henrietta," which he says Clint Eastwood -- currently starring 
in and directing Warners' film version of "The Bridges of Madison County" -- is 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our paths continue to meet," he mused about Eastwood. "I feel like Forrest 
Gump, telling all these stories about my past." 
</P>
<P>
 A childhood fascination with Mad magazine inspired the parodies. "I was always 
into Mad and loved making fun of stuff. Well, I had plenty of material after my 
Hollywood career," which will undoubtedly end up in a book somewhere, he says. 
"You know, it's the American way to trash things when they become successful.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think books like 'Bridges,' 'Gump' and 'Celestine' are good books, but 
they're ripe for fun. My dream project is to write one of those ABC disease 
movies-of-the-week. It'll be 'Sluggishness: America's No. 1 Killer'!" 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he says, he hopes that talent will pursue a film treatment of 
"Philistine" instead of "Celestine," now that Eastwood has missed his chance on 
"Ditches." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I gotta tell ya, the movie ("Bridges") is helping 'Ditches' -- it's 
selling like hotcakes overseas. Only problem," he adds, "is the U.K. They think 
Ronald Richard Roberts is a real person."*

LEARN, BABY, LEARN; FOR 20 YEARS, MAGNIFICENT MONTAGUE TRAVELED THE BLACK DJ 
CIRCUIT, RIDING THE EXPLOSION OF RHYTHM AND BLUES. WHAT HE BROUGHT HOME TO L.A. 
WAS THE SLOGAN 'BURN, BABY, BURN' -- AND A PASSION FOR PREACHING BLACK HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAGNIFICENT MONTAGUE, Magnificent Montague is writing an autobiography of 
his life in radio, with Times assistant metropolitan editor Bob Baker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I chase history. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been running after it for 30 years, half my life. I've chased it into 
rare-book shops, manuscript dealerships, antique stores, estate sales, rummage 
sales. Chased it across the ocean to Europe. Chased down more than 6,000 books, 
paintings, films, toys, pamphlets, letters and slave documents, all of it to 
tell the story of 300 years of the African-American experience. It torments me 
and terrifies me and leaves me trembling with joy. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes me wonder: Why me? Why is a man who spent much of his life as a 
disc jockey, screaming his heart out during the golden age of rhythm and blues 
music -- a man whose most famous words are " Burn , Baby, Burn!" -- why does a 
man like me become ordained to preach history? Why do I feel as compelled to 
explain the majesty of the Black Eagle (stay tuned) as to rhapsodize about Sam 
Cooke? Why am I chasing history when, for so long, history was chasing me? 
</P>
<P>
 The name is Montague. One word: MONT-a-gyew . When I was on the radio, when I 
was spreading the music of James Brown, Otis Redding, the Temptations, Aretha 
Franklin and Wilson Pickett, when I was turning an R & B music show into a 
sweet soul church service, commanding my listeners to put their hands on the 
radio and touch my heart, listeners from L.A. to Chicago to New York knew me as 
Magnificent Montague. Even today, a quarter-century later, it's not uncommon 
for them to recognize me. They'll hear my voice, or maybe spot my name on a 
piece of mail, and suddenly I'll be hearing their reminiscences about being 16 
and listening to my show on a school bus. And, inevitably, the question will be 
asked: Why aren't you back on the radio , Montague? Lord knows they need you to 
bring some fire to the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'll shake my head and smile. For my time on the radio was indeed a time 
of fire. It was a time when music and society and race and technology all 
exploded like a bomb, a time when black DJs made R & B erupt out of that old 
marketing niche of "race music" and changed the way young Americans -- white as 
well as black -- saw their world. To live in that vortex was to touch America's 
soul and be touched by it. 
</P>
<P>
 MY YEARS WERE 1952 TO 1971, AND THE HOTTEST YEAR of all was 1965, the year 
Watts burned. I had arrived at KGFJ, a black-oriented AM station on Melrose 
Avenue, early that year, bringing with me a slogan I'd developed on the air in 
New York at WWRL -- a harsh cry of delight I often shouted during a record I 
particularly enjoyed: " Burn , baby, burn!" My fans would call in on the radio 
every morning before they went to high school and yell it back at me -- same 
way Rush Limbaugh's crowd calls up these days to say "Ditto," only with soul. 
Just a way of signifying that rare, glorious, sanctified moment in which a 
record, or anything else, had taken its art to a new level. Out on the 
playground, a young man might make a twisting, Elgin Baylor, hang-in-the-air 
shot, and you'd hear it from the brothers on the sidelines: " Burn , baby!" It 
infected the lexicon like a virus, and to my horror, when Watts went up in 
flames that August, when people began setting buildings and cars afire on 
Imperial Highway and Avalon Boulevard and Main Street, they triumphantly 
screamed the most evident and analogous and hip thing at hand: " Burn , baby!" 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, as the city reeled, I didn't know what to say in response. For the 
first two days of the riots I kept using " Burn , Baby, Burn!" on the air, like 
I always did. It was my slogan, not the rioters'. And the people in power who 
were demanding that I stop saying it -- people like the mayor, Sam Yorty, and 
the police chief, William Parker -- had no right to take it away from me. 
</P>
<P>
 Only as the years went by and my hobby of collecting turned into an obsession 
with black history did it dawn on me that the right rhetorical response to 
"Burn!" would have been a tired but true cliche: " Learn , baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Learn about the forces that are controlling you. Learn to dominate them. Learn 
that your people in America have always struggled against oppression and always 
will. Learn, in ways that will astonish and inspire you, that they have often 
won despite odds much greater than those you face. 
</P>
<P>
 Learn, for example, about the Black Eagle. Come along with me on the chase for 
him. Feel my adrenaline pump and my goose bumps rise. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time there's a manuscript dealer I telephone. Last time must have 
been five years ago. "Anything for me?" I ask. She says, "No, nothing." One 
morning a few months ago, I'm doing my daily exercise workout near my apartment 
in Mid-Wilshire -- and I see her on the street with another lady. 
</P>
<P>
 I call out, in mock defeat, "I'm not gonna get anything from you, am I?" 
</P>
<P>
 And she answers, "I think I have something for you, but I'm not sure where it 
is." Her files are like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Black Eagle." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my heart about stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been fascinated with the Black Eagle since I first read about him in the 
'60s. His name was Hubert Fauntleroy Julian, and you can pick your description 
of him: soldier of fortune, stunt pilot, diplomat, rum runner, bodyguard, 
foreign correspondent, mercenary. The crown prince of black aviation. He was 
born in Trinidad in 1897, was raised in America and ran into the wall of 
segregation when he tried to become a military pilot in the 1930s. Blacks did 
not fly for this nation until the 332nd Fighter Group -- the Tuskegee Airmen -- 
was formed in 1942, a year after Pearl Harbor. So in 1936, Julian volunteered 
to fly for Haile Selassie's Ethiopian forces, which were under attack by Italy. 
He became a colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Eagle was a spectacular man. Six feet tall, 200 pounds, striding 
through life in a derby, cutaway coat, striped trousers and spats. I had never 
been able to obtain a shard of the man's life. But now my friend, the dealer, 
was offering me a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a letter that showed me yet another side of the Black Eagle. Dated 
Sept. 6, 1940, and written on stationery identifying Julian as a captain in the 
Finnish Air Force, it described how Finland, which had been attacked by Germany 
five months earlier, had asked Julian to broker the purchase of 10 air 
ambulances. Julian had arranged for a Delaware aircraft company to build the 
planes and for Finnish pilots to fly them back to their homeland. The Black 
Eagle would pocket 10% of the $529,000 cost. 
</P>
<P>
 I had known none of this. Now I did. I had never been able to touch the Black 
Eagle. Now I could. And so I slipped him into an acid-free folder and put him 
to sleep with the rest of the people whose glory and foibles I pursue, the 
people who one day will come alive inside what I will call the Montague Museum 
of African-American History and Culture. This is the vision that drives me, 
that keeps me cataloguing and indexing. I am one day going to build this museum 
for the ages, particularly for the youngsters, this show-me generation that 
needs history to live and breathe, that needs to hold men and women like the 
Black Eagle in its hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I started collecting in the 1950s, rummaging through used-book stores at 
first, then became obsessed in the '60s. Never expected to get interested in 
black history because I didn't grow up thinking of myself as black. Oh, I was 
black, but not black-black. I didn't feel black. I felt like Montague. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RADIO BUSINESS CHANGED THAT.  
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in New York in the '40s I was a radio junkie. I loved the voices I 
heard, the great radio voices of people like Gabriel Heatter, the newsman, and 
Martin Block, the pioneer disc jockey. I got the bug. I had no style, but I 
knew what styles to steal and meld, and at 16 I just picked up, headed north 
and managed to sell enough advertising time on a little low-frequency station 
in the Boston suburb of Brookline, to get a half-hour show. That job folded 
after a few months, and I hitched a ride with a music promoter down to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where I found out I was black. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, KCOH, 1953. Texas City, KTLW, 1954. "You got sponsors, boy? OK, you 
can have air time to play records, but please don't come into the station. You 
do your shows from nightclubs or restaurants, got it? Stay out of the 
building." It was a bitch. And what made it even harder was the fact that I 
started to develop a style of broadcasting aimed at women. Looking back, this 
was a no-brainer. You couldn't get on the air if you didn't find sponsors for 
your 15- or 30-minute show, and women held the purse strings But I pushed the 
envelope until it popped. I started to draw a surprising number of white female 
listeners. Here I am, confident as all hell, reading my poetry on the air, 
dedicating it to my "darlings," telling them not to let their men treat them 
like dogs, vilifying the male species. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't have to be a genius to figure out who that was going to upset. 
</P>
<P>
 One day some men in white sheets visit the station. The manager calls me 
inside and introduces me to the representatives of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 "By God, you been makin' love to white ladies, boy," one klansman complains. 
Boy this, boy that. Uppity, uppity. Manager jumps in to save his own scalp -- 
"Montague, didn't I tell you to stop that?" I'm dead, I know it, when in walks 
J. P. Richardson, later to be known as the Big Bopper, the singer who died with 
Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens in the historic 1959 plane crash. He stood up to 
the klan and the station manager and saved my job . . . and, for all I know, my 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of raw encounters scraped away my naivete. Later on down the road, 
fans would hear me scream with glee over Ray Charles' "Drown in My Own Tears," 
Stevie Wonder's "Uptight," James Brown's "Lost Someone," the Miracles' "Shop 
Around" and Otis Redding's "Mister Pitiful" and assume I was a soul brother off 
the block, blown onto the air from the corner of some mythical ghetto 
intersection. "Back it up and gimme four more bars!" I'd yell at the end of a 
record I wanted to promote, and then I'd play the last 30 seconds again and 
moan over it lovingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, I didn't know squat about R & B or the blues until I went down 
to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 I started learning on Sundays, when I'd fill in once in a while on "The Little 
Green Church on the Hill," a show for shut-ins. Bible reading and preaching. 
New to me, brother. My people in New York weren't fire and brimstone; I was 
raised Holiness, Pentacostal, but none of it hit me, you understand? This thing 
about "blacks all got soul," that's a lie. I didn't have no soul. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a black preacher whom I shared time on the air with, and I 
started picking up on how black preachers operate. I started to mock him: "And 
the L-o-o-o-r-d said . . . ." That's how I developed. I got my radio 
personality from a lot of unknown black preachers and artists of the South. 
Those fierce blues singers in Chicago. Those resolute Black Muslims of Harlem. 
Influences. I'm part and parcel of all of them. I want to be honest. Without 
them, there'd be no Magnificent Montague. Those preachers, they had the timing. 
I mean, I didn't know how to dance, man. And some of that blues music, I didn't 
understand what they were shouting about. What allowed me to develop my persona 
as a young man was that all kinds of black music filtered through Texas: Bobby 
Bland, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Louis Jordan, gospel stars like the Soul 
Stirrers and their new star, Sam Cooke, doo-wop. Meeting them, doing my daily 
show from clubs, record hops, living and breathing with the listeners, the 
fans, the advertisers -- something inside me started to bubble up. 
</P>
<P>
 I fled Texas for Chicago by 1955. Had to. Southern segregation was too 
stifling. A prominent black DJ in Chicago on WAAF died, and I beat out 150 
other jockeys for his job. I became, unknowingly, part of a huge migration of 
Southern blacks to northern cities, the same way I'd become, in the mid-1960s, 
part of another huge migration of blacks to Los Angeles. When I was on the air 
in Chicago, listeners who'd moved there from Texas would sometimes telephone 
their families and hold the receiver next to the radio, sending a nostalgic 
blast of Montague down South. 
</P>
<P>
 I understood none of the historical significance of these demographic shifts. 
I was too busy hustling, working the edges, trying to convert a $50-a-week 
radio salary into a living wage, cutting deals with sponsors and record stores 
and record companies and record promoters and advertisers. Example: You get 100 
extra promotional copies from a record company and give them to a liquor store 
owner; then he gives the beer brand that sponsors your show better shelf 
position. Over the years, I stuck my fingers into every crevice of the music 
business. I became a songwriter, a publisher of more than 150 singles and 
albums and a record producer. I built my own studios wherever I was a DJ and 
used them to record new talent. Managed artists, booked weekend shows. What 
else was I going to do, protest my lousy radio pay? There wasn't anybody to 
protest to . 
</P>
<P>
 Working in these racially charged environments, driving through so many cities 
in an era in which highways still let you see local commerce, and being the 
kind of person who likes to soak up a variety of influences, I spent more and 
more time looking for materials defining black history. There wasn't a lot of 
competition for memorabilia. Negroes were still relatively invisible in 
America. As any collector can tell you, you develop an addictive love of 
pursuit. You see a fragment and it fits because of a dozen other seemingly 
isolated fragments that you've bought over the years. You imagine or crave a 
certain work, and then one day, out of nowhere, you behold it. Better yet, you 
are occasionally confronted with material that transcends your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in a rare-book shop in New York once, leafing through the Civil War 
section. Man at the counter says, "Look, I don't have nothing." I keep 
browsing, and I see the spine of a thin book, the title so old I can't make it 
out. Now, I have a rule: Whenever I can't understand the printing on the spine, 
I always look. I open it up. It's in mint condition. The title is jarring: "Our 
Nig." I notice the date, 1859. I notice the subtitle: "Sketches From the Life 
of a Free Black." That's enough for me. Without reading further, I buy it and 
put it away for 15 years. Only when I read an article saying that Harvard had a 
copy of the first novel ever written by a black woman, and that someone there 
was bragging about it, did I check my file, and I smiled: It was the same book, 
written by Harriet E. Wilson, whose name was buried in small type on an inside 
page. But see what happens when you're consumed by collecting? Sometimes your 
instincts jump too quickly for your own good. I had assumed that I'd bought a 
white writer's biography of a black. Only now did I recognize that I'd 
purchased something far more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what I own, I have never seen another copy of. An example is my thick 
1895 book recording all written and spoken tributes after the sudden death of 
Frederick Douglass, America's leading Abolitionist -- and that scares me more 
than it delights. If I hadn't found that book, it might well be consigned to 
oblivion. Imagine: What happens if "Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil & 
Wicked Traffic of the Slavery & Commerce of the Human Species," written in 1787 
by Attobah Cugoano, an African taken to England, is never read? What happens if 
a tiny, elegant pincushion with an engraving of a black man in chains, called 
"A Colored Man in the City of New York," made in 1835 by Patrick Henry Reason, 
a black artist who worked for Abolitionists, is never seen? What happens if 
Frank Sapp's magnificent 1944 painting of Haitian Gen. Toussaint L'Ouverture 
astride a horse, symbolizing the ability of black men and women to throw off 
colonial chains, is never viewed? 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, what happens if you allow people to experience these works, and 
hundreds like them, in the course of a day? I'll tell you. You throw your 
so-called contemporary role models in the trash can. You proclaim that these 
are our role models. 
</P>
<P>
 The more I collected, and the longer I remained a DJ, the more my professional 
life bled into my fascination with the black experience. I was working at KSAN 
in San Francisco in 1957 when the station decided to jump into the violent 
struggle to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Ark. A delegation of 
us, including the station's white owner, the Rev. Norwood Patterson, flew to 
Providence, R.I., where Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus was attending a weekend 
governors conference, along with President Eisenhower. The week before, Faubus 
had barred nine black children from entering Central High. I squeezed into a 
Saturday press conference the governor was holding and burst out on behalf of 
one of the black children, Elizabeth Eckford, whom we planned to fly out to San 
Francisco Sunday for a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor!" I yelled. "That little girl says she's scared but she wants to go 
back to school. Why don't you give the kids a chance to learn, let them go back 
to school Monday, and if there's any trouble, then call out the National Guard 
to protect them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you try to crucify me?" Faubus replied. "I'm the most liberal governor 
in the South." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you call pointing guns at children 'liberal?' " I shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what the hell was I doing? I didn't have the political sophistication to 
be carrying on a debate with a minor-league politician, let alone Faubus. But 
at a time when blacks had no power base beyond their churches, this was the 
role that black DJs had begun to play in the '50s. Whites owned the stations 
and the unions. We DJs labored in electronic sweat shops, sweltering studios 
with noisy electric fans, one microphone and two turntables and heavy 
headphones. Your on-air nickname might be Jockey Jack, but if you messed up 
they'd fire you and put another Jockey Jack on the air tomorrow, and it would 
be as though you never existed. Barely up from slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite these hardships -- in fact, because of them -- successful black 
DJs enjoyed astonishingly strong, direct communication with a mass audience, a 
feeling of solidarity that was unprecedented in commercial broadcasting. We 
were de facto mayors and weekday preachers, masters of a private universe. We 
were the equivalent of movie stars, the sole link between listeners and the 
music. No way that happens today. You've got stations being routinely sold for 
tens of millions of dollars, programming their music on the basis of 
demographic and "psychographic" studies. The DJs are along for the ride. In my 
day, radio was a seat-of-the-pants business. You worked by your gut. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell you a story from 1961. I've left San Francisco for a brief stop in L.A. 
and then a year in St. Louis, and now I've hit New York, home at last, on WWRL. 
I'm so popular that in addition to my 1 to 3 p.m. show, the station adds 
another three-hour shift, midnight to 3 a.m. (Thousands of parents eventually 
wrote the station to complain that their kids' schoolwork was suffering because 
they were staying up too late.) Atlantic Records, the giant of R & B, has 
purchased a song called "If You Need Me," intending to have it recorded by one 
of its popular artists, the great Solomon Burke. But somebody has slipped me a 
copy of an unreleased "demo" of the song, recorded by a then-unknown artist 
named Wilson Pickett. I love it and begin playing it, and the request phone 
line starts jumping off the hook with calls from listeners who feel the same 
way. I call up Jerry Wexler, Atlantic's guru, to let him know. He's speechless. 
You're playing the wrong record, he complains. Didn't matter to me. I didn't 
need any market research to know a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, I had forgotten a lot about those days. I'm a stubborn kind of 
fellow, short and wiry and steel on the inside. I hate losing, and I pride 
myself on not looking back. After Watts burned, I reluctantly let "Burn, Baby, 
Burn!" slip out of my repertoire. It was stained. The Los Angeles Times had a 
front-page story the fourth day of the riots explaining that the "hep" slogan 
had been "borrowed" from the radio, but that wasn't enough to salvage it. 
"Magnificent Montague will 'burn' no more," the black-owned L.A. Sentinel 
proclaimed. I told the kids, if you want to call KGJF and scream a dedication, 
scream, "Have Mercy!" And they did, and I did, too, and my show on KGFJ 
continued through 1966, the greatest year R & B music ever saw, an endless 
sweaty parade of Otis Redding and Sam and Dave, Stevie Wonder and Eddie Floyd, 
Johnnie Taylor and Wilson Pickett -- music so simultaneously hard-edged and 
tender, rhythmic and melodic, lurid and sacred, gospel and gutbucket that an 
hour of my show could leave you slumping over your car's steering wheel, 
gasping for breath. Soul music, we called it, a brief but glorious marriage of 
R & B at midnight and church on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But my fascination ebbed. Radio was getting too profitable to be left to the 
DJs. Programming gurus were already institutionalizing the Top 40 format, 
playlists were replacing the instincts of the jocks, FM was replacing AM. I 
left KGFJ in 1967, broadcast for a couple of years on L.A.'s legendary XERB 
with Wolfman Jack, then set my sights on producing records and developing new 
radio stations. Meanwhile, "Burn, Baby, Burn!" was adopted by protesters of all 
races. In New York, black demonstrators, angered by a murder acquittal, yelled 
it as a threat. In Berkeley, flag-burners screamed it on the eve of a Supreme 
Court decision. In South Carolina, capital punishment advocates chanted it 
outside execution sites. I didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, nine years ago, on the 20th anniversary of Watts, I got a call from a 
white guy at The Times named Bob Baker, pitching a what-happened-to-you? story. 
I wouldn't talk to him. He wrote me a letter, told me that 20 years ago he'd 
been a fan, that in some weird way soul music had rescued him. I gave in. He 
drove down to Palm Springs, where my wife and I owned and ran an easy-listening 
FM station. After a couple of hours of talking, I started to think about what 
had happened to me, where my life fit. 
</P>
<P>
 All those crazy times. Spinning Sam Cooke's "You Send Me" for six straight 
hours from midnight till dawn while broadcasting out of a furniture store in 
L.A. in 1958. Refusing to sit in a blacks-only section at a Bobby Darin concert 
in St. Louis in 1960 and instead -- at Bobby's demand, once he heard about the 
nonsense -- introducing him onstage. Watching Johnny Ace shoot himself to death 
playing Russian roulette backstage in Houston in 1954. Having Malcolm X come to 
my apartment in New York in 1962 and use my black history collection to 
research those riveting street-corner speeches he gave on 125th Street. Making 
public introductions during the L.A. mayoral campaigns of a man I'd first met 
when he was a cop, Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to recognize that the black experience wasn't merely something that 
I'd collected. It was something that I'd lived, something that I'd helped 
shape. If history was chasing me, maybe I'd let it catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 See, I want stories like mine, bigger than mine, in the black history museum 
I'm going to develop. I want hundreds, thousands of them. I want to take my 
collection out of storage in a warehouse and lay it out in a place where 
history can leap out at you. Where you can walk the path of my people. Where 
you not only listen and read about the pain and the glory but you feel it. 
Where the video screens roll the images and the speakers burst forth, and the 
greats, the Booker T. Washingtons and the Frederick Douglasses, share the 
podium with the anonymous strugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 I want you to hold in your hand the 12 1/2-cent pamphlet written in 1850 by 
fugitive slave Henry Watson. I want you to watch the silent movies of 1916 by 
the black-owned Lincoln Motion Picture Co. of Los Angeles. I want you to sing 
along to "It Pays to Serve Jesus" by the Pace Jubilee Singers. I want to 
overwhelm you with the power of contralto Marian Anderson's Negro spirituals 
and classics. I want to bombard you with computerized special effects to make 
you well up with tears at the sheer brilliance of Dr. George Washington Carver. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the technological power now to show the course of a man's life in the 
span of five minutes: a sickly Alabama slave child, stolen from his mother, 
repurchased by his owner for the price of a horse, miraculously rising to earn 
a master's degree in agriculture, inventing the economic miracle of crop 
rotation by alternating cotton with peanuts, then developing more than 100 
peanut byproducts. Behold a replica of his laboratory, his letters, an original 
painting he did with peanut oils. Behold this inspiration -- inspiration for 
all Americans. Step inside my museum and touch my heart. That is my dream. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to tell these stories to reach the youngsters who have the energy and 
the intensity to succeed but don't know their history. I don't want to tell it 
to them. I want to show it to them. These gang members, these rappers -- once 
they understand their history, there'll be no holding them back. I will give 
them something more powerful than their AK-47s. I will give them their BHDs, 
their black history degrees. I will show them how to soar, like the Black 
Eagle.

WITH AN ACCENT ON CONDITIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's say you're a 45-year-old mother of four -- an actress renowned for your 
range of accents, not for your muscle tone -- and asked to helm a raft through 
treacherous white-water rapids, and make it look real. You only have a few 
months to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Who're you gonna call? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're Meryl Streep, set to star in your first action film, "The River 
Wild," you call the personal fitness duo of Kimberley Dashiell Silver and Mark 
Silver of Triangle Studio in Santa Monica. Known for low-key, confidential 
personal workouts, the Silvers beat out a town full of celebrity trainers to 
give Streep the strength she'd need for her role on the rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We groomed her like an athlete for an athletic event," says Mark Silver of 
the work he and his wife did with Streep six days a week, three hours a day for 
four months, a regimen the Silvers usually discourage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meryl's a woman who has never done anything physical like this before," adds 
Kimberley. "She's never really shown her body much on screen and she had to be 
in prime condition to control the raft, to physically handle the demands of the 
role and not hurt herself." 
</P>
<P>
 While one of the fruits of Streep's labor, Kimberley concedes, was that she 
"ended up looking great," Streep's appearance was a secondary concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meryl didn't have to stand there and hold a gun and look buff," Mark says. 
"She had to prepare for a role that demanded strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Streep agreed. "Kimberley and Mark knew that I didn't want to look gym-ized," 
Streep says. "I wanted to look like a mother who did this, but I wanted to be 
strong enough to be able to handle whatever came my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving that strength meant beginning her workout at 5:30 a.m. (an hour 
Streep chose so she could be back home in time to take her kids to school), 
working out for an hour and a half with Mark on weight training and aerobics. 
"I never had to motivate her," says Mark of the pre-dawn workout time. "We 
worked on her overall body strength, focusing on her upper back because of the 
rowing and sculling she had to do. I wanted her to have a workout that would 
translate to her life for the next four months while she was on the river."  
</P>
<P>
 Once her children were off to school, Streep would return to the studio to 
work with Kimberley on stretching and strenuous yoga. The yoga, Kimberley says, 
gave Streep a calmness and courage to work on the water by helping her stay 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had to be a believer," Kimberley says. "Sometimes she was exhausted and 
unsure, asking, 'Can I really do this?' But Meryl's a really powerful person -- 
she'd just grunt, sweat, get quiet and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark admits that he cried when he saw the film because "Meryl got what she 
wanted," but says he's proudest of the fact that Streep never got hurt while 
working on the river. "The fact that she never missed a day of shooting because 
her back hurt shows how well we trained her -- and how strong her will is," he 
says. Anne Bergman

LIFE UPON THE WICKED STAGE; LONETTE MCKEE ALMOST WON A TONY IN THE 1983 'SHOW 
BOAT' AS THE MIXED-RACE JULIE. NOW SHE'S BACK ON BROADWAY -- SAME SHOW, SAME 
ROLE.; HOW COME? DON'T GET HER STARTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 flop "The Cotton Club," Lonette McKee, playing 
a beautiful torch singer, sang a haunting ballad called "Ill Wind." She knew of 
what she sang, for on screen and stage she has created a number of star-crossed 
characters, none more touching than the half-black/half-white Julie in "Show 
Boat" for which she won a Tony nomination in 1983 when the Houston Grand Opera 
revived the 1927 musical epic on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a decade later, as she prepares to open again next Sunday in the same 
role in the lavish new Harold Prince-Garth Drabinsky production at the Gershwin 
Theatre, McKee has the age-worn and slightly cynical air of someone who herself 
has been buffeted by life. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what's happened in the intervening years to make this Julie different 
from the last, McKee responds with a throaty laugh, "Well she's lived, honey. 
She's 10 years older and she's been through a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the actress last sashayed across the stage as Julie, her 
once-promising career has moved in fits and starts, with momentary bright 
turns, like her Billie Holiday in the 1986 Off Broadway success "Lady Day at 
Emerson's Bar & Grill" and a series of small but flashy film roles in " 'Round 
Midnight," "Gardens of Stone," "Jungle Fever" and "Malcolm X." But, following 
the breakup of her marriage to Leo Compton, a high-school counselor, her career 
stalled so completely that she was forced to move to an embattled low-rent 
Brooklyn neighborhood with her new boyfriend, rock-musician Bryant McNeil, whom 
she met while working on her 1992 album, "Natural Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The tough breaks of the past may have bruised her psyche, but they haven't 
marked her physically. Sitting in her dressing room during rehearsal just prior 
to the start of previews, McKee, at 39, is still the arresting beauty whose 
1976 film debut in "Sparkle" inspired critic Pauline Kael to write, "McKee has 
the sexual brazenness that screen stars Susan Hayward and Ava Gardner had in 
their youth." 
</P>
<P>
 That beauty, however, flashes with frustration and some anger when she talks 
about a career that has admittedly become less and less fulfilling for her. The 
exception, of course, is the opportunity to play the classic role of Julie, who 
"passes" until the discovery of her mixed-race origins banishes her and her 
white husband from Cap'n Andy's Mississippi showboat. Adapted in 1927 by Oscar 
Hammerstein from the Edna Ferber novel, the musical, at least in the first act, 
is dominated by Julie, and it is her tale of miscegenation and racism that 
gives it such dark and unsettling power. Though she abruptly disappears, she 
briefly returns in the second act to sing the torch anthem, "Bill," and, in 
this new stage version, to give a hint of the degradation and alcoholism that 
followed her disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great role and a great team, Hal and Garth, so when they made me an 
offer I couldn't refuse, I took it," says McKee, who had first turned down the 
offer to repeat the role of Julie before she knew that it was Prince who was 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
 The production itself ran into public protests against what many blacks deemed 
to be stereotypes before it opened in Toronto last September. But McKee says 
that the controversy was rendered moot once the production was on view. She 
does register some impatience with the fact that blacks have had to continually 
fall back on playing roles connected to their tragic past rather than their 
present contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black actors are tired of the only roles being available to us are the 
'historically correct' ones of the olden days," she says bristling. "Why do we 
always have to be offered roles where we're housekeepers and slaves? We were, 
and we have a lot to be proud of that past, but what about what we're bringing 
to the table today?" 
</P>
<P>
 With such a paucity of female roles, McKee has been unable to exploit the 
promise of stardom first predicted for her. She's long since stopped listening 
to the periodic puzzling in the press as to why she is not yet a household 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell 'them' I'll become a star when they start writing great roles for black 
women in films," she says, bemoaning the mostly white, mostly male power 
structure of the industry. "Russell Simmons and Spike (Lee) have made some 
progress but things really haven't advanced all that much." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's rather surprising to note that McKee was actually the first 
black woman to play Julie in a major American production (Cleo Laine played it 
in London in the early '70s). Lena Horne was slated for the role in the 1951 
film, but the studio got cold feet and cast Ava Gardner who slapped on dark 
makeup to play the chanteuse. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee, who is herself the product of an interracial marriage between a 
Mississippi-born black factory worker and the daughter of Scandinavian 
immigrants, can closely identify with her character's sad and confused search 
for a place in society. Though early on McKee began by calling herself a 
"mulatto," she says that she quickly learned that when it comes to the politics 
and social mores of identity, she is a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that the only way this society was going to view my calling myself 
a 'mulatto' was as a rejection of my blackness, which was certainly not the 
case," she said. "I'm proud of my black heritage and I'm proud of my white 
mother too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up," she added of her childhood in a rough working-class 
section of Detroit, "my mother taught me and my two sisters that we had the 
best of both worlds, the opportunities and advantages of both races. But, in 
retrospect, that was idealistic of her. Now I'd tell kids from a mixed 
background, 'Remember your roots, and be proud, but don't be fooled. If you 
have black blood, in society's terms you are black and you will be treated as 
such.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Enraptured by the local Detroit Motown sound, as a 6-year-old McKee began 
composing songs on the family piano and by the time she was 14 she had scored a 
local hit on the pop charts. Emboldened by the success, her ambitious mother 
hocked her wedding ring and sent McKee off to join her older sister, who was 
also pursuing a career on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We damn near starved to death in Los Angeles," says McKee of those years, 
recalling that she was once thrown out of a car on Mulholland Drive because she 
had refused to have sex with a guy to advance her career. "I was told that I 
was too white for black roles and too black for white roles. I still hear that. 
They see me for the Michelle Pfeiffer and Annabella Sciorra roles. I just don't 
get them." 
</P>
<P>
 A break came when, at 18, she was a featured singer-dancer on the television 
variety show "The Wacky World of Jonathan Winters". But it was on that show 
that she herself became acquainted with dark makeup when the producers and 
director asked her to use it, sensing that the public would prefer a more 
"stereotypical" notion of a black entertainer. "It wasn't demeaning at the 
time," recalls McKee. "I think I was too young to realize what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainer, however, did put her foot down years later, in 1981 to be 
exact, when director Martin Charnin asked her to darken her makeup to play 
Jackie Robinson's wife in the Broadway musical, "The First," based on the 
famous ballplayer's life. It was her Broadway debut and she admits to being 
intimidated at first. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if her initial reluctance to complain might not also be explained 
by an ambitious desire to please, McKee laughs. "Well, I was certainly 
ambitious to a degree," she says. "But I was never the kind of girl that would 
do anything to get ahead, which is probably why I'm not further along in my 
career now." 
</P>
<P>
 After the closing of "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill," Lanie Robertson's 
one-person show in which McKee played Billie Holiday on the skids, and the 
failure of "Cotton Club," the actress was disillusioned with the business and 
even now it is obvious that she finds it hard to muster up much enthusiasm for 
being "cooped up" in a dressing room for eight performances a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ambitions these days are directed to composing and writing, and she has 
formed a record label, "Flat Daddy," with boyfriend McNeil. "I think it takes a 
certain masochism to stay in this industry," she says, "having to put on a ton 
of makeup and eyelashes and these big clothes and go out there and say 'yessir, 
yessir, yessir.' Despite the glamour and fun, actors are really low man on the 
totem pole and aren't really treated all that wonderfully well. So my advice to 
any young people who ask me is to be producers, directors, writers, not 
performers."*

PERFORMING ARTS; EXTRA -- BARITONE SEDUCED BY L.A.!; WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE NEAR 
ZURICH OR UPLAND? TO NATIVE ANGELENO RODNEY GILFRY, WHO HAS RETURNED HOME FROM 
A SEVEN-YEAR STINT IN EUROPE, IT'S AN EASY CALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rodney Gilfry relaxes in a chair on Los Angeles Music Center plaza. A showy 
succulent -- an opening night gift for "Faust" -- and a small black briefcase, 
complete with cel phone, sit at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The baritone in surfer shades scans the facade of the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, where he's sung many times. But these days his view has changed: 
After seven years abroad, it's his hometown house once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilfry has been based in Europe, where his reputation as an opera singer -- 
and particularly a performer of Mozart roles -- has been growing. And while he 
has continued to perform at least one role with L.A. Music Center Opera almost 
every season during these years, it wasn't until now that he could once again 
call his native Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilfry -- whose previous Mozart roles with L.A. Opera include Figaro in "The 
Marriage of Figaro" and Papageno in "The Magic Flute" -- takes over the title 
role in "Don Giovanni" from Thomas Allen for the performances of Oct. 11 and 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the remorselessly womanizing charmer holds great promise for the 
handsome and charismatic Gilfry, although he has only two previous productions, 
in Lyon and Parma, under his belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Don Giovanni, I'm in my infancy," he says. "That's a character that you 
never find the bottom of." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilfry has learned the lesson of pushing his talents too quickly into roles 
that don't suit him as well as the Don. "I have done some dangerous 
experimentation with some roles that I shouldn't have done that were too 
dramatic, too heavy, like Orest in 'Elektra,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm much more careful now about what I take so that I don't overextend 
myself. I'm happy to say that nothing in my future is dangerous. They're 
primarily lyric roles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reared in West Covina and Claremont, Gilfry, 35, originally planned on a 
career as a music educator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start by going to opera and falling in love with the genre and 
deciding this is what I want to do for the rest of my life," he says. "I 
started by studying music in high school and college and then I started doing 
more and more solo singing." 
</P>
<P>
 A scholarship to study music at USC encouraged him. "Between the time that I 
finished my bachelor's degree (at Cal State Fullerton) and the time I started 
my master's (at USC), I decided that I would give solo performing a shot. I 
found it fun and I was successful at it, so I just continued." 
</P>
<P>
 Going to Europe was a post-grad career move. "There's a great advantage to 
working in Europe as an opera singer or a classical musician and that's that 
there's so much work," Gilfry says. "From Zurich, the longest that you have to 
fly to get to a major opera house is an hour and a half. It's like having 65 
opera houses in the Western United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But that initial gambit was never meant to last so long for the Gilfry family. 
"We only intended to stay in Europe for two years and it ended up being seven," 
Gilfry says. "I hadn't finished what I'd set out to do. I wanted to sing in the 
important centers there like La Scala, Vienna and Hamburg and Covent Garden and 
Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 Family considerations, however, began to argue for a move back. "At the end of 
seven years there, our kids -- who are 9, 7 and 5 years old now -- were at the 
ages where if we stayed any longer they would become so entrenched in the 
school system and with their friends that it would be harder to take them back 
to America," Gilfry says. "We like the American way of life and wanted our kids 
to grow up as American kids." 
</P>
<P>
 And the L.A. area seemed like the logical place for them to do that. "The 
greatest thing about being here is to be back with family again," says Gilfry, 
who last month moved into a home across from that of his wife's sister in an 
area east of Upland. "No matter how long we were going to be living in 
Switzerland, it wasn't our country." 
</P>
<P>
 The return, of course, has required a little adjusting. "It's strange to be 
back," Gilfry says. "I slipped back into the old lifestyle a little too 
comfortably. There have been some unpleasant affirmations of my suspicions, 
like the smog problem. So what did I do? I went out and bought two cars, so 
it's not like I'm helping." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, overall, it was a good move -- one that Gilfry felt his career could 
handle. "I don't think it'll set me back," he says. "I've got a pretty good 
foothold in Europe and here as well. Five years ago, I couldn't have done that. 
I would have left Europe and been forgotten. But now I have enough engagements 
in the future in Europe that I'm not worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 His L.A. Opera roles this season -- including Valentin in "Faust," which has 
its final performance on Wednesday, and Dr. Malatesta in "Don Pasquale" (March 
18-April 1, 1995) -- will allow Gilfry to spend more time at home in L.A. than 
he had in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Don Giovanni" allows Gilfry a third pass at a character he's portrayed in 
two very different stagings already. "The first was traditional," says Gilfry 
of a 1991 production in Lyon. "The one that I just finished (a production that 
began in Parma, toured and culminated in a recording for Deutsche Grammophon) 
was like Don Giovanni as a bad boy rock star. It was incisive, even bitter and 
edgy at times, and that's how I sang it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Opera production, which is a revival of Jonathan Miller's 1991 
staging, offers yet another approach. "What we're doing has humor," Gilfry 
says. "This is a multifaceted character and there are more playful moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gilfry hopes to do one or two productions in L.A. each season, he 
will be on the road a bit more next year, although he'll be able to spend a 
substantial amount of time in the United States -- he'll sing Olivieri in 
"Capriccio" for the Chicago Lyric Opera's 1994-95 season, and Valentin in a San 
Francisco Opera production of "Faust" in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't plan to venture far from the lyric roles that are his specialty, 
though. "I'd rather discover (that I'm ready for certain roles) and then 
schedule them for five years in the future than schedule something for five 
years in the future that I'm not sure I'm (going to be) ready to sing and have 
it come looming before me (when) my voice hasn't developed the way that I 
thought it might," says Gilfry. "I've done that in the past. I kind of let 
people diversify my repertoire, which is not a wise way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 If and when he is ready to branch out, it may be easier to do that here in the 
U.S. "There's less resistance to diversifying repertoire here, but I think it's 
mostly based on ignorance," says Gilfry. "I don't mean that in a negative way 
necessarily. It can be good, because if you want to do something traditionally 
considered out of your repertoire, it might be easier to try it out here." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there's really no place to hide. "If you do it in a big 
house here, everybody knows about it," says Gilfry. "You've got five major 
houses (in the U.S.) and they all get reviewed so everybody knows. You could 
try something experimental in a small house in Germany and not many people are 
going to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 G ilfry does venture happily into the realm of musical theater. He was seen 
here, for instance, as Curly in the Music Center Opera's 1990 production of 
"Oklahoma!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the baritone would like to see more such fare at the Music Center. "We 
need to do musical theater at the L.A. Opera," says Gilfry. "They should do one 
American musical a year. It's our own native operetta, so to speak, and it 
needs to be promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 He does not, however, think such productions should be used simply as bait. "I 
don't think it should be done just as candy for potential opera goers," Gilfry 
says. "As an opera company, we can do it with the singing one notch up, with a 
different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 And he suggests that the Music Center Opera company, in particular, now in its 
ninth season, might be ready to present more diverse fare. "It's been 
unfortunate that L.A. has had to postpone some productions, but they basically 
have been operating in the black," says Gilfry of his hometown company. "That 
they are doing as well as they are in the face of the economic problems in 
California is a sign of their stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the mandate for any opera company these days can be daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. Opera and other organizations like that are trying to teach the public 
what they need to make up for a lack of cultural depth and that's really 
difficult," says Gilfry. "The audience is out there. It's just a matter of 
finding the people and educating them." Vital Stats

ART; INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH HARRY; GRITTY DEPRESSION-ERA PAINTINGS FLOWED FROM THE 
BRUSH OF HARRY STERNBERG. TWO NEW SAN DIEGO EXHIBITIONS OVERFLOW WITH WORKS 
FROM THE BLUNT-SPEAKING 90-YEAR-OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't be polite with me," Harry Sternberg admonishes shortly into the 
interview, and he means it. The 90-year-old artist's bluntness -- and that of 
his work -- is legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Sternberg's first solo show of prints and drawings in 1932, a 
New York Times critic warned viewers not to look to the artist's work for charm 
or delicacy, but rather for "strength and truculence." And in the catalogue 
accompanying "The Prints of Harry Sternberg," now at the San Diego Museum of 
Art, director Steven Brezzo offers this advice: "Don't try passing off 
gimmickry or artistic bluster to Harry -- his response is not pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 A large man wearing a boyish ensemble of shorts, T-shirt and suspenders, 
Sternberg sits in his tidy studio in Escondido, restlessly tapping his immense 
hands on the arms of his chair. Penetrating self-portraits vividly painted in 
Fauve-like greens and blues peek out from behind other neatly stacked works. 
Sternberg in person can be as disarmingly straightforward as his work, yet his 
no-nonsense manner is so genuine and full of warmth that, ironically, he comes 
across as charming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like suppressing my own feelings or anybody else's," Sternberg 
declares. That directness, he says, came with the territory of growing up on 
New York's Lower East Side and Brooklyn among newly arrived Eastern Europeans, 
including his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my youth was spent among immigrants and Jewish ghettos," he says. 
"The home was jammed with noise. To read as a kid in that environment was 
rough. But the juiciness of the wonderful, emotional, unpretentious joy of 
living that the immigrants had was really something beautiful. In the ghetto, 
birth, life and death are so intense that they become central to your 
existence, more so than in other cultures. It affected me profoundly." 
</P>
<P>
 An image in his 1991 artist's book, "A Life in Woodcuts," shows his mother 
cooking, a small clutch of men at the table drinking and the young Sternberg 
sitting contentedly on the kitchen floor with a book, perhaps a sketchbook. It 
was there, within the swirl of mundane passions, that Sternberg began to draw. 
By 12, he was taking art classes at the Brooklyn Museum. Like most of their Old 
World peers, Sternberg remembers, his parents had an intense zeal for books and 
music. But the visual arts were something of a taboo in his Orthodox Jewish 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "To draw the human figure was sinful," he says. "Man is made in the image of 
God; therefore you don't desecrate."  
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg's drive and his father's faith clashed decisively when he was about 
15, in high school but already taking classes at the famed Art Students League 
in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember coming home with some drawings one Friday night, which was a holy 
night for us, and he said, 'Let me see what you're doing there.' I tried to 
dodge him, but he said he wanted to see. So I showed him. It was a female nude. 
He took one look and (spit to one side). He rolled up the drawing, handed it 
back to me and he never looked at another thing I did. Ever. He accepted it but 
he didn't want it pushed in his face. I thought that was very beautiful, and I 
respected him enormously for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg studied at the Art Students League until 1927, the year he made his 
first etchings, and began teaching there in 1933. The current show includes 
more than 60 years of work, from the early etchings up through the recent book 
of woodcuts. "Celebrating Sternberg," a companion exhibition of prints and 
rarely seen drawings, is on view through Oct. 22 at San Diego's Brighton Press, 
which has printed his work since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither show includes paintings, Sternberg has always balanced his 
efforts between the two media, switching to painting when he hungers for color, 
shifting back when he craves black and white. Printmaking, however, has always 
been the artist's "natural habitat," says Malcolm Warner, the San Diego Museum 
of Art's curator of European art and prints and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg's own poignant sense of observation fused naturally with the strong 
current of social concern in American art -- especially graphic art -- of the 
1920s and '30s. He explored the tough and tenuous relationship between humans 
and their machines in images of railroad yards and construction sites. He 
talked his way underground and documented the harsh working conditions of 
Pennsylvania coal miners and steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 I nspired by Goya's practice of braiding together the real and the fantastic, 
the humble and the grotesque, Sternberg created a powerful and disturbing 
series of prints titled "Principles," which delved into what he calls the 
"foibles, joys and sufferings of people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The variety in his work is extraordinary, from fantastical compositions that 
have something in common with William Blake to gritty documentary studies of 
coal miners," Warner says. "One thing that will emerge in the show is that he 
has a wider range than people think. Most people associate him with 1930s WPA 
industrial realism." 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg's years teaching at the Art Students League among such esteemed 
colleagues as George Grosz and Yasuo Kuniyoshi, his post office murals painted 
under the auspices ofDepression-era government art programs and the general 
flavor of his work of the period make it easy to categorize him as an artist of 
the '30s. But Sternberg doesn't think much of being pigeonholed: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hate it. Hate it . The reason there's so much interest in the '20s and '30s 
is twofold. First, it's economic. There's money to be made, which sickens me. 
The other is that when I deal with the suffering of the coal miners, it's far 
enough away -- just like Christ on the cross is far enough away -- so that it's 
a safe symbol that everyone can kneel in front of and say, 'Isn't this 
wonderful? And isn't it nice that these steelworkers had to live in these 
shacks and this artist went and lived there and drew the shacks that they lived 
in? Isn't it nice?' My ass, it's nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg's evolution as an artist certainly didn't stop in the 1930s, though 
he enjoyed his greatest visibility during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 A founding member of the American Artists' Congress (1935-42), an organization 
committed to defending artists' rights and upholding their social 
responsibilities, he joined many of the country's most acclaimed artists in 
taking an activist stance against fascism, war and poverty. The feisty paper he 
delivered at the 1936 congress derided the precious aura of the limited-edition 
fine print and upheld the power of the print as an affordable, accessible 
vehicle of mass consciousness-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Sternberg has softened his views over the years and now, some what grudgingly, 
carries on the fine print tradition himself with such works as the 
spectacularly scathing "Myths and Rituals" series from the mid-1980s as well as 
his concise, elegant autobiographical woodcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually the print never performed what we hoped it would," he says. "We who 
were interested in mass-producing prints were doing it on the basis we felt the 
masses of people could afford to buy our pictures, which was nonsense, because 
the masses of people were no more interested in buying our pictures at five 
bucks -- we couldn't give them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Artists throughout history have felt misunderstood by the public, Sternberg 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no different. In some sense, we get a small kick out of the fact that 
we're good enough so that they don't quite understand us." Vital Stats

RADIO REVIEW; THE NEW 101.9: HIT AND MISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, a commercial station that plays more than just the hits. Finally, a 
station that finds a place for such distinguished and sophisticated pop music 
figures as Richard Thompson and Sam Phillips. Finally, a station that knows 
that good segues can take you from Tori Amos to U2 to Elvis Costello and make 
it sound like one piece of music. 
</P>
<P>
 On those counts, the new KSCA-FM (101.9) is a welcome addition to the L.A. 
radio landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is it so hard to listen to the station for any length of time without 
nodding off? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a lack of personality for one thing. The deejays are universally perky 
but characterless -- and generally without the kind of passion that should 
accompany the musical voyage of discovery the station purports to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of which: KSCA's playlist has not been exactly what you'd call a trek 
into uncharted territory. Rarely does it stray too far from the safe ground of 
its central realm, the romantic-topical musings of such singer-songwriters as 
Sheryl Crow and David Wilcox, with Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne serving 
more or less as the patron saints. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll play Peter Gabriel and David Byrne but not the world music artists 
those pop stars have championed; they'll play Eric Clapton but not the blues 
giants that inspired him. Similarly, the forays into reggae, country and even 
alternative rock are fairly timid, with nothing more adventurous than such 
worthy but predictable choices as Bob Marley, Nanci Griffith or Gin Blossoms, 
respectively, getting air time. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's waaaay too much in the oldies department -- even if they're oldies 
that we haven't heard for a while. One would hope that KSCA's ambition would be 
more than just to make KLSX's "classic rock" obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for a station like KSCA to succeed is for listeners to never know what 
might be played next but be eager to find out. So far it's failed in that 
mission. Steve Hochman

PRIVATE LIVES; VIDEO GAMES; HERE'S HELP FOR BAFFLED NINTENDO PARENTS; THE NEW 
SEX-AND- VIOLENCE RATINGS SYSTEMS ARE HITTING STORE SHELVES. ABOUT HALF OF THE 
NEW GAMES WILL CARRY THEM BY CHRISTMAS AND ALL MAY BY THE END OF 1995.

<P>
 When kids plead for the latest, hottest $60 video game, parents have to 
wonder: Just what mayhem might pop up at the punch of a button or the jerk of a 
joystick? 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, parents can try to find out how violent or sexual a game is by 
looking at the package. But only Sega regularly rates titles for its systems. 
</P>
<P>
 That means parents who want to know more have to plow through the thick, 
kid-oriented game players' magazines, which gleefully point out the icky stuff 
("Blowing away the prisoners is a ghoulish treat," one review raves). Or they 
could bust a thumb playing the game themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they could just ask the kids. Wouldn't they speak up if anything was 
inappropriate for their tender little eyes? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Help is on the way. By Christmas, the video game industry estimates, 40% or 
more of the new games on store shelves will carry ratings. Consumers will know 
at a glance just how much gore, sex or profanity is actually in that CD-ROM, 
cartridge or floppy disk. By sometime next year, all new games are expected to 
be rated. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for video game ratings arose after the release in 1993 of a few 
violent games, notably Mortal Kombat. It featured characters ripping beating 
hearts and bloody spines from their foes. A sequel, Mortal Kombat II, was 
released earlier this month. Kids love them. 
</P>
<P>
 But many parents -- and two U.S. senators, Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) -- don't. The senators held video game violence hearings 
in December and introduced legislation to create a national independent rating 
board for the games -- unless the industry found a way to police itself. 
</P>
<P>
 With the threat of federal regulation hanging over them, the video game and 
computer software industries responded in a hurry. They initially worked 
together but hit an impasse, parted ways and came up with two voluntary rating 
systems. (Sega has said that it will retire its rating plan and take part in 
one of the industrywide systems.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (game makers) should be given a lot of credit," said Mark Traphagen, 
in-house attorney for the Software Publishers Assn., which launched one of the 
rating systems. "Putting logos on packages is like a cheese manufacturer 
putting a clogged heart out front." 
</P>
<P>
 They were under tremendous commercial pressure to do so. Major retail chains, 
including Toys 'R' Us, Wal-Mart, Sears and J.C. Penney, and video-game 
specialty stores, including Babbage's, Software Etc. and Electronic Boutique, 
said they wouldn't sell unrated games. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a preview of the ratings, and the organizations that created them: 
</P>
<P>
 The Entertainment Software Rating Board was formed by the Interactive Digital 
Software Assn., which represents the major game system companies -- Sega, 
Nintendo and Atari -- and several game software companies. It started rating 
games Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The board reviews games and assigns one of five age-appropriate ratings, 
similar to those used by the Motion Picture Assn. of America. Ratings will 
appear on the front of the game boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The categories are: EC (Early Childhood, ages 3-plus), K-A (kids to adults, 
ages 6-plus), T (teen, ages 13-plus), M (mature, ages 17-plus) and AO (adults 
only). Also, the back of the packages will carry "descriptors," short phrases 
outlining the content that determined the rating, in four categories: violent 
content, sexual themes, profanity and "other," which would include activities 
of concern to parents, such as gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The other rating organization, the Recreational Software Advisory Council, was 
created by the Software Publishers Assn., the trade association for the 
personal computer software industry. It is expected to be rating games by the 
end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In this system, content will be scored in three areas: violence, nudity or 
sex, and profanity or vulgarity. If there is no such content, a symbol on the 
box will tell consumers that. On other games, a thermometer, graded from a low 
of 1 to a high of 4, will indicate just how much sex, violence or risque talk 
is in the game. Packages also will point out the game's content ("blood and 
gore" or "mild expletives") that earned the rating. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no age categorization in the Recreational Software Advisory Council's 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our idea was to let consumers, primarily parents, be aware of what's in the 
(game) and let them decide for themselves whether it's appropriate," attorney 
Traphagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The methods for determining game content differ: The Entertainment Software 
Rating Board will review videotapes, storyboards, scripts or narratives of the 
game. The Recreational Software Advisory Council will base its ratings on 
detailed questionnaires filled out and attested to by the software maker. 
Neither group will actually play the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Both rating boards will have the power to pull ratings or re-sticker products. 
Both boards said they will respond to consumer complaints and will spot-check 
games they have rated. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that video games already on the market will be rated. The sheer 
number of them makes that impossible, said Carolyn Rauch of the Interactive 
Digital Software Assn. But the PC software market has fewer "evergreen" games, 
and the Software Publishers Assn. expects that some software makers will submit 
perennially popular games for rating, Traphagen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when video game ratings are in place, it appears there will be a debate 
over whether retailers will enforce them by refusing to rent or sell sexual or 
violent video games to children and teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Sens. Lieberman and Kohl, who led the charge for ratings, have taken that 
battle to the rental front. They are asking the Video Software Dealers Assn. to 
pledge that its member stores will refuse to rent games with violent or sexual 
content to children. They have also asked that stores refuse to carry new, 
unrated games. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents interviewed recently at video game stores at the Lakewood Mall said 
they would be grateful for any guidance they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ratings would really help. You can't tell by looking at the boxes or reading 
the back," said Darl Gruzen of Lakewood. She said she buys games for her nine 
grandchildren, who range in age from 2 to 15. Although she plays video games 
herself, she shies away from fighting games. Ratings would help her decide if 
they are fit gifts for the grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A s Angela and Alfonso Gonza lez of Long Beach watched their 7-year-old son, 
Luis, test-drive a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger video game, they said they would 
appreciate ratings too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that much about the games," Angela Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are too violent," her husband added. "Kids play, and then they 
want to act the way they do in the video game." 
</P>
<P>
 They said their son likes games based on the movies "Aladdin" and "Batman." 
But the game Luis named as his favorite? Mortal Kombat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children think ratings are a bad idea, particularly if it might keep them 
from playing the baddest, bloodiest games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like blood and action," said Skyler Lynne, 12. "I won't play that baby 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Thomas, 16, said she can see the value of keeping violent games out of 
the hands of younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might not know it's just a game," she said. Teen-agers like herself know 
the difference between a video game and real life, so they don't need to rely 
on ratings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dilley, 12, sees both sides of the question.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid, I wouldn't want it," he said. "But it's a pretty good idea."

 FAMED YOUNGSTER: One of Orange County's youngest newsmakers -- 6-year-old 
Jimmy Peters of Huntington Beach -- has gone national. . . . The learning 
disabled youngster, whose dad has sued school officials over his educational 
program, was featured recently in a Wall Street Journal editorial critical of 
how much money has been spent in his case. CBS's Connie Chung has also 
inquired. "Jimmy is just a happy kid," shrugs father Jim Peters. "Jimmy doesn't 
know that he's in the Wall Street Journal; Jimmy doesn't see the TV."

 GOD'S FACES: Plans for a Religious Diversity Faire are underway on the grounds 
of the county's oldest church. The Nov. 5 event at the San Juan Capistrano 
Mission is to start with a Jewish Sabbath service, followed by a Muslim service 
at noon. . . . Participants will also include representatives of Roman 
Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist and Bahai faiths, says mission 
administrator Gerald J. Miller. "The idea is to promote understanding."

 BIG FISH: Tracy Melton of Los Alamitos caught one for the record books 
recently: a 1,083-pound Blue Marlin off Madeira, Portugal . . . What makes the 
fish noteworthy, though, isn't its size as much as the fact that Melton, 26, 
caught it and reeled it in while standing up. "It's the biggest fish ever 
weighed in that was caught that way," says Mike Leech, president of the 
Florida-based International Game Fish Assn. Says Melton of the four-hour 
tug-of-war: "My legs were killing me, but I never thought of giving up."

 JOIN THE BANNED: Cal State Fullerton's student bookstore is celebrating the 
freedom to read by joining an unusual national event sponsored by the American 
Library Assn.: Banned Book Week. Continuing through Friday, the store is 
offering discounts on displayed texts of books that were once the target of 
protest or censure . . . Among the so-called offenders: the Bible, "Catcher in 
the Rye," "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and "Where's Waldo?"

 Cuban authorities Saturday urged people not to attempt the dangerous return to 
Cuba from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay where thousands of Cuban boat 
people are being held. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Ministry said 59 people had escaped from the camps in the last 
three weeks, most over minefields separating the base from Cuban territory. 
Others had left by swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry urged Cubans to be patient, noting that one person had been 
killed and another seriously injured by mines.

SIMPSON ATTORNEY REJECTS BARRING TV FROM THE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER and DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said Saturday that he and other members of the 
O.J. Simpson defense team do not support Judge Lance A. Ito's threat to bar 
television cameras from the courtroom during the high-profile murder trial, 
which is set to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not prepared to say, 'Pull all of the cameras out of the courtroom,' " 
Cochran said at the State Bar of California's annual meeting in the Anaheim 
Convention Center. "But if at some point we can't control this," the judge "may 
have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran's comments came one day after Ito, enraged by a Los Angeles television 
station's inaccurate reporting on the case, threatened to bar the station from 
the courthouse and perhaps ban television coverage of the highly publicized 
trial altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cochran said barring television cameras from the courtroom would simply be 
punitive and would not stop the leaks or "fabrications" outside the courtroom. 
More effective in assuring responsible reporting, Cochran said, will be the 
probe of KNBC-TV and its reporter, Tracie Savage, at a special hearing Ito has 
planned for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to be embarrassed," Cochran said. "It's all about ratings 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has said he will consider at the hearing whether to cut off KNBC's access 
to the Criminal Courts Building and will evaluate whether TV coverage of the 
case should continue at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cochran said attention also needs to be focused on the sources of news 
leaks, who he alleged are members of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department, they should be held accountable also," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said assurances by Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams that an 
internal investigation of the leaks is underway will have a chilling effect on 
leakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LAPD is a paramilitary organization," Cochran said. "If Chief Williams 
said there will be no more leaks, they will stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran spoke about the trial during a morning seminar and outside an 
afternoon mock trial at the State Bar's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the morning panel discussion, entitled "Trial Strategies for High 
Profile Cases" he said that Ito was trying to send the media "a strong message. 
He's going to have to take strong action to curb this."  
</P>
<P>
 KNBC incurred Ito's wrath last week by airing a report that a bloodied pair of 
socks retrieved from Simpson's bedroom had been sent to a Maryland laboratory 
where DNA tests indicated the blood was that of murder victim Nicole Brown 
Simpson. The report was denied by both the prosecution and the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the panel included: 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, a Santa Ana attorney who represented police beating victim 
Rodney G. King; Harland Braun, who defended accused officer Theodore Briseno in 
the King case; Edi M. Faal, who represented Damian Williams, charged with 
beating truck driver Reginald Denny; Melanie M. Lomax, the attorney for a woman 
claiming to have been sexually harassed by Los Angeles City Councilman Nate 
Holden; and Carl E. Douglas, another member of the Simpson defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case easily dominated Saturday's discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the beginning of a new era," Douglas said of the vast amount of 
media coverage the case has engendered. "The rules are changing; things are 
very fluid." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the Channel 4 reports "outrageous," Cochran said they could seriously 
damage Simpson's ability to receive a fair trial. He also called a recent 
Newsweek magazine cover story chronicling what the magazine described as 
Simpson's double life particularly offensive to the family of a man who, he 
said, "has led an exemplary life." 
</P>
<P>
 The leak of the now-famous 911 tapes that appeared to capture a violent 
quarrel between Simpson and his wife was an especially egregious offense, 
Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 90% of the people in this area have heard those tapes, and they may not 
even be admissible," Cochran said. "We will have to question the jurors about 
that." The leaked tape raised the issue of spousal abuse, which is not the 
subject of the upcoming trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cochran said he would oppose Ito's suggestion that the jury be sequestered 
or held in seclusion during the trial to shield it from the media's coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would urge the judge to seek another solution," he said. "You would lose a 
lot of (potential) jurors through hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Cochran predicted, the media's presence could have a positive 
effect on the administration of justice in general.  
</P>
<P>
 "When this trial is over," he said, "I expect people to have a better idea of 
what lawyers can do; it upgrades the profession." 
</P>
<P>
 By depicting a multiracial defense team working together in harmony, Cochran 
said, the coverage will also help the status of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, he said, the trial's wide media exposure will, in effect, provide 
millions of Americans with a much-needed lesson in civics.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is more contemplative and introspective when the cameras are 
there," the lawyer said. "They put you on your best behavior. Children are now 
talking about the Fourth Amendment."

4 APPREHENDED AFTER $250,000 JEWELRY HEIST; CRIME: POLICE SAY A DEPARTMENT 
STORE EMPLOYEE WAS CLUBBED BEFORE TEEN-AGERS FLED. SUSPECTS CAUGHT AFTER SOME 
OF THE LOOT IS TOSSED FROM GETAWAY CAR.

 Four Los Angeles teen-agers -- one a gun-wielding 14-year-old boy -- were 
arrested Friday night after bursting into a local department store, where they 
smashed glass display cases and scooped up about $250,000 in jewelry and cash 
as more than a dozen horrified customers looked on, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As police from three local departments followed on a winding pursuit through 
North County, the suspects began tossing "the loot" out of their car windows 
before they were finally halted in Anaheim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although shaken, none of the customers was injured during the robbery. But the 
store's 42-year-old jewelry manager was clubbed over the head with a hammer, 
"apparently because he couldn't get the cash register opened fast enough," 
police said. He was knocked unconscious and was treated and released from 
Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning, the store was open for business and store manager Mel 
Edwards said "everything is fine." Edwards said the jewelry manager was 
released from the hospital Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fine," Edwards said. "I think he will be A -- OK. He was shook up. But 
even (the customers) who weren't hurt were pretty shook up." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Sgt. Phil Stufflebean said Friday's incident was the second 
time this year that the Service Merchandise Store at 1621 W. Imperial Highway 
was hit by four jewel thieves. In March, Stufflebean said, another store 
employee was pistol-whipped in that holdup. Two suspects were later arrested in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's case, Joshua Smith, 19; James Brown, 18; and two 14-year-olds were 
booked on suspicion of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Smith 
and Brown were being held at the La Habra City Jail on bond of $250,000 each. 
The minors were booked into Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said four teen-agers entered the store about 8:30 p.m. and ordered 
customers to stand back. One of the suspects, whom police identified as a 
14-year-old youth, brandished a handgun while others used hammers to smash the 
jewelry cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody sort of hit the floor," Stufflebean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits took necklaces, rings and watches, stuffing the valuables into 
pillowcases. After being ordered to open the cash register, the jewelry manager 
was struck on the head with a hammer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four made their escape in a 1980 Oldsmobile that had been reported stolen 
from Downey earlier in the day. Police began trailing the car shortly after it 
left the store parking lot, and local authorities were soon joined in the chase 
by Fullerton and Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 10-mile pursuit, Stufflebean said, those in the car began tossing 
jewelry from the car windows. Along the way, a handgun was also thrown from the 
car. It was later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, police blocked the entry to the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim at 
Euclid Street, when the suspects appeared to be heading in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blocking the freeway really helped wind this thing down," Stufflebean said, 
adding that authorities believed the suspects were trying to make their way to 
Los Angeles. The car was stopped by a small army of police a short time later, 
at Euclid Street and Glenoaks Avenue, he said.

MAKING HIS MARK; HANDWRITING EXPERT IS INCREASINGLY USED TO HELP IDENTIFY 
GRAFFITI VANDALS

 James (Jay) Black is the taggers' unseen enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Little do they know that the shy man in jeans and Nike running shoes could one 
day take the stand against them and put them away, without ever having met 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, 47, is a forensic scientist whose work the past dozen years has 
involved forgeries and fraud. But as a handwriting-analysis expert, he finds 
himself increasingly used in prosecuting graffiti vandals, otherwise known as 
taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently testified in two trials in Orange County, including one in which 
Kaya, one of the region's most infamous juvenile taggers, was convicted and 
given a three-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Black now is employed by six law enforcement agencies in Orange County, three 
in San Bernardino County and, increasingly, by others around the country. He 
recently was asked to testify in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, he has worked primarily for the Orange Police 
Department in 36 cases involving graffiti, or as Black calls it, "visual 
terrorism, constituting both a property crime and a social crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay is a recognized, court-tested examiner of 'questioned documents,' or to 
paraphrase, he's a handwriting expert," said Orange Police Detective Jack 
Nanigian, who works closely with Black. "Our agency had used him for years on 
forgeries and written-document fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, about two years ago, when graffiti vandalism -- especially tagging -- 
exploded, Jay conceived of the idea of using his skills in handwriting analysis 
to identify the authors of graffiti vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Black has proven consistently, Nanigian said, that the characteristics of 
handwriting are the same "for a questioned document as they are for 
spray-painted vandalism on walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Nanigian routinely provides Black with schoolbook covers, folders, lunch 
boxes, backpacks, practice pads, tennis shoes, hats -- items used by suspected 
taggers to scrawl their monikers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is primarily the tagger's moniker that opens the door for Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spelling (of the moniker) is one of the first things," Nanigian said. 
"The shape of the letters, the proportionality, the frequency of it being 
written in various locations. . . . If it appears similar to that of other 
writing samples, Jay can usually establish a connection." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Kaya, a 17-year-old high school dropout suspected in numerous 
acts of graffiti vandalism, Black was able to show that in 45 out of 100 
locations, "the author was (Kaya)," Nanigian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaya's work appeared on freeway signs, buildings and signal boxes and often 
was etched in glass throughout central Orange County, Nanigian said. He even 
was suspected of leaving his moniker outside the Federal Building in Santa Ana 
and on a sign along the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's skill at linking Kaya to as many as 45 incidents propelled the amount 
of damage to more than $5,000 -- meaning he could be prosecuted for a felony 
and not just a misdemeanor, a critical factor in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only four ways to nail a tagger," Nanigian said. "You've got to see 
'em do it, somebody else has to see 'em do it, the guilty party confesses, or 
you have a scientific handwriting analysis done to pin it down to a single 
suspect. . . . We don't get too many of the first three, which is the reason 
Jay's so valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs are Black's best pieces of evidence. But on occasion, he checks 
out the markings himself. On a recent muggy morning, he walked stealthily along 
a gravel-rutted road under an overpass, making his way past wary transients 
amid a clutter of broken glass and stolen shopping carts to eye every available 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 He found plenty of graffiti and several spent cans of Krylon spray paint, 
including one with a bullet hole straight through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was put up by gangs," he said, pointing to undistinguished markings that 
read "dark side" -- the name of a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 More scrawlings under the same bridge were the work of taggers, Black said, 
explaining that what the public knows about graffiti is oddly limited, 
considering the millions of dollars in damage it inflicts on property, both 
public and private, and the level of attention it commands from law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti vandalism now costs county agencies more than $4 million a year, 
including, officials say, more than $1 million a year in Santa Ana alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers, Black said, tend to be nonviolent and not affiliated with gangs, 
whereas the public assumes that most, if not all, graffiti is the work of 
gun-toting gang members. If graffiti is evident, Black said, the public 
frequently -- and mistakenly -- concludes that gangs are taking over the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Another misconception: that graffiti is the province of the underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the worst tagging is going on in affluent areas of Irvine by affluent 
kids who live in Irvine," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of three children who lives in a bucolic area of Lake Forest, Black 
finds himself cast in an unlikely role: He's suddenly well versed in the 
culture known as hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hip-hop or tagger graffiti is far more artistic than gang graffiti, which I 
don't work with very often," he said. "Members of the hip-hop culture, which 
began in New York in the 1970s and spread west, subscribe to rap music and 
break-dancing and love to spray-paint graffiti, usually in places more visible 
than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fame, artistic expression, power and rebellion are the major motivators of the 
hip-hop culture, he said, and fame is determined by the quantity and quality of 
a tagger's work. Why do they do it? "For peer approval and the thrill of it," 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-hop painters usually are males in their teens or early 20s, but, he said, 
"females and older individuals have been known to write it." Hip-hop 
increasingly is prevalent in Orange County, as are its symbols, Black said: 
baggy pants, shorts and shirts; stocking and baseball caps; long belts, 
oversize (often untied) high-top tennis shoes and backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Black most enjoys the work for "helping to establish out of a murky situation 
what the truth really is." 
</P>
<P>
 But the work isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process itself is very labor intensive, both for the police and for me, 
because it takes a lot of time for police to keep track of everything and a lot 
of time to do the procedures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A guarded man who describes himself as bland, Black said he "rarely gets 
excited about anything," whether it's triumphs or setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's real disappointing to police officers," he said, "to put in hours 
and hours of work and have something come back inconclusive or equivocal, 
because I didn't have enough to ID somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I can't prove it, or nobody can prove it, it's real frustrating, 
especially if a lot of time and effort has gone into the preparation."

MASTER HORROR WRITER ROBERT BLOCH DIES; AUTHORS: BEST-KNOWN FOR 'PSYCHO,' HE 
PRODUCED MORE THAN 25 OTHER NOVELS, 400 STORIES AND DOZENS OF TELEPLAYS AND 
FILM SCRIPTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Bloch, a master of the macabre who made the word psycho synonymous with 
mental disorders and chilling entertainment, has died at his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlan Ellison, his longtime friend and fellow author, said Saturday that 
Bloch -- who was writing of grisly doings decades before Hannibal Lecter 
savored his first victim -- was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of Robert Bloch closes that door on the Golden Age of fantasy 
writing," said Ellison, another noted writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Master science fiction writer Ray Bradbury recalled that he was only 26 when 
Bloch singled him out at a writers convention and told him he was doing quality 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't known for anything at the time except some pulp mysteries, which he 
had evidently read," Bradbury said. "He invited me to his home in Wisconsin, 
where I stayed two months and had a marvelous time. . . . He was the first to 
tell me I was a good writer doing good work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he added, "the number of writers in our field is getting very 
small." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloch also befriended and encouraged such modern-day mystery giants as Stephen 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 As modest in demeanor as he was outrageous in print, Bloch in August wrote his 
own obituary for the Writers Guild of America. That was shortly after he 
learned of the liver and kidney cancer that was to kill him late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a modest but comprehensive listing of his many accomplishments, Bloch 
added this routine denouement: 
</P>
<P>
 "Always interested in giving readers a 'surprise ending,' Bloch wrote these 
obituary notes himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise was a mild word from a writer who had shocked readers with deranged 
characters ranging from serpents to the devil himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he undoubtedly was best-known and world famous for Alfred Hitchcock's 
film "Psycho," Bloch sometimes chafed under the identification. 
</P>
<P>
 He liked to point out that he had sold his first story when he was 17 (to 
Weird Tales), had adapted 39 of his own stories for radio ("Stay Tuned for 
Terror") and had published more than 25 novels, 400 stories and dozens of 
teleplays and film scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1980 Times interview Bloch, however, did credit "Psycho" with taking away 
his anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 His tale was of the Bates Motel and its depraved owner, who kills guests and 
talks over things with his dead but evidently dry-cured mother. The book, which 
was the basis for Joseph Stefano's screenplay, was not written over a weekend, 
as many have said, but was Bloch's seventh novel and took six weeks to write in 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA bought film rights for $9,500 -- 15% of which went to Bloch's publisher 
and 10% to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the book -- based on a series of slayings by a demented Wisconsin farmer 
-- has been in print ever since the 1960 film was released "and that has 
helped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloch used simple prose to describe tormented, fearful characters, many 
trapped by horrifying dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his best-known tales, "The Hellbound Train," the devil gives a man a 
watch to stop time, but the man can never decide when to use it. At the last 
moment, as he is riding a hell-bound train filled with drunks, prostitutes and 
gamblers, he uses the watch -- and rides on for eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the outstanding thing about him is that not only did every other 
writer respect him as a writer but they all cared for him deeply as a person," 
said author and screenwriter Richard Matheson, who wrote many of the original 
"Twilight Zone" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloch said that violence was more appropriate for the printed word than for 
motion pictures or TV, now used by modern writers of the bizarre genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite squeamish about" such filmed works, he admitted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really did not like going to horror movies. When films turned bloody, Bob 
stopped going," Ellison recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950s, Bloch moved to Los Angeles from Milwaukee to try his hand 
at films and scripts for early TV shows ranging from "Alfred Hitchcock 
Presents" to the original "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote low-budget horror films and became friendly with some of the actors 
who were featured in such pictures -- Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of his career included the 1962 film "The Cabinet of Caligari," 
"Strait-Jacket," "The Night Walker," "The Psychopath," "The House That Dripped 
Blood" and "Asylum." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Albert Bloch was born in Chicago to a bank cashier father and a teacher 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 While young he began reading H.P. Lovecraft, an early and significant author 
of fantasy fiction. He wrote to Lovecraft, who encouraged him. 
</P>
<P>
 In one exchange with Lovecraft, Bloch offered as a tribute to make the older 
writer a character in a story he was calling "The Shambler From the Stars," 
about a man who meets a gruesome death. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovecraft authorized Bloch to "portray, murder, annihilate, disintegrate, 
transfigure, metamorphose or otherwise manhandle the undersigned." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloch told The Times that he disdained word processors and worked on an old 
typewriter each weekday, starting at 9, "until I start turning out more popcorn 
balls (wadded-up paper) than pages." His accolades included the Hugo, the 
science fiction world's highest award, and career honors from the World Science 
Fiction and World Fantasy conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview published in the anthology "Contemporary Authors," Bloch 
was asked whether -- in a time when mass murders and other horrible acts seem 
commonplace -- it was more difficult to come up with original ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference," he replied, "between what's happening in real life and 
. . . an unusual story. So often today, in my opinion, in films and on 
television, the stories are not necessarily all that unusual. They are merely 
gruesome and shocking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a distinction to be made between that which inspires terror and that 
which inspires nausea." 
</P>
<P>
 In his obituary, Bloch directed that he be cremated and that his ashes be kept 
in a book-shaped urn at the University of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Eleanor Alexander, and a daughter, Sally Francy, 
who were with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations in his name may be made to the Motion Picture and Television Fund.

A STEP BACK IN TIME; RECREATION: COUNTY FAIR IS ABOUT 30 MILES FROM DOWNTOWN, 
BUT ITS MIDWAY AND PIE-EATING CONTESTS MAY AS WELL BE ON ANOTHER PLANET.

 Jay Hitchcock stood poised, hands behind his back, head bent over a paper 
plate containing one jelly doughnut. Suddenly, he dove in, gnawing at the 
doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get it in your mouth!" screamed his wife, Jane, holding up a camera to catch 
her 34-year-old husband -- an engineering software salesman -- getting his face 
smeared with red jelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, he lost this speed doughnut-eating contest to a petite woman contestant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just scarfed it," Hitchcock said in awe, enduring the laughter of his 
wife and friends and the baffled look of his 14-month-old daughter, Arleigh. So 
what's a sophisticated Long Beach guy, who looks as if he normally doesn't 
touch fried dough, doing slurping jelly doughnuts on a Saturday morning? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the county fair!" Hitchcock said. "It's like leaving town for the 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 On the freeway scale of life in L.A., the Los Angeles County Fair is a mere 30 
miles or so from Downtown. But in mind-set, it may as well be another planet. 
Walk down the hill from the parking lot and you see the lazy spinning of a 
Ferris wheel in the distance, the brightly colored food stands, the carnival 
tents. A place apart from O.J. Simpson-obsessed L.A., the fair in Pomona 
beckons with pony rides, cotton candy and draft horse shows. The only debate 
here is whether to go to the livestock hall or the flower exhibit first. And 
the only judges are those deciding how good a cake tastes and which mother most 
resembles her daughter in the Mother-Daughter Look-Alike Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it always has been, the treasured prize is still the classic blue ribbon 
-- with some additional modern perks like a membership to a health club thrown 
in to the winners of the mother-daughter contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair is a place where you run into a 56-year-old man who cans preserves 
and an 11-year-old girl cuddling a day-old lamb. Some are fair mavens who bake 
and cook and grow their own gardens and enjoy seeing what others have done. 
Some are from families of fair-goers who've gone annually for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come every year since, golly, '54?" mused Nova Robinson, 67, watching 
her 2-year-old grandson, Kyle Henderson, navigate his way past Nubian goats in 
the petting zoo. "I brought all my kids, now I'm bringing my grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are some concessions to the modern -- an in-line skating exhibition, a 
virtual reality booth, an eco-chic waterless carwash demonstration. You can eat 
glistening slabs of barbecued ribs and cotton candy, but you can also get 
bottled water and cafe latte.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's still a reminder of more bucolic times. People are polite, even 
moderately happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main function is to run and play with people," said 19-year-old Chris Van 
Etten, an event coordinator who arranged the doughnut-eating contest. "I love 
my job." 
</P>
<P>
 They come for the crafts, the carnival rides and the food, but on Saturday, 
many said they come for the animals -- and there is no shortage of animals 
here. There is a cavernous livestock hall, horse shows and even elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The petting zoo," said Danny Aranda, 18, of Monrovia, as he entered the fair 
with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Brooke Blum. "Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the petting zoo, goats, miniature horses, pigs, and a wallaby that lopes 
more than hops mingle with fair visitors. Six-year-old Allysa Glover was 
stroking a contented potbellied piglet as her mother Denise Glover of Moreno 
Valley watched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were raised and born in L.A.," Glover said. "All these years, we've never 
been to the fair. We weren't well off when we were growing up. So it was a big 
deal to go anywhere. So we're making up for it with our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairs are also the bastion of contests -- cake baking, pie eating, best 
natural redhead (that was the first week of the fair, which opened Sept. 9.) In 
the home arts building, rows and rows of cakes sat on shelves behind glass, 
like museum artifacts from a prehistoric culture. Every conceivable baked 
flavor is on display, each one with a neat wedge carved out, presumably savored 
by the cake judges. 
</P>
<P>
 At high noon Saturday, mothers and daughters lined up on stage for the 
Mother-Daughter Look-Alike Contest. The savviest of contestants came matched 
from shoes to shade of lipstick. Valerie Wells, 35, and her daughter, Vanessa, 
12 -- entering their ninth such contest -- came in matching navy dresses, 
boater hats, and white scallop-edged cotton gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have someone so like you in looks and personality can't be beat," said 
Wells mere . "The Lord has blessed us." Shortly before the contest, the two 
clasped hands and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wells, a systems engineer, the contest is the only reason to come to the 
fair. Years growing up near the Fairplex in Pomona lessened the appeal for her. 
"I used to work at the Hot Dog on a Stick stand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They came in second, winning a red ribbon. No one could beat out Diana 
Crittendon, 41, and her daughter, Staci, 20, of Pomona. This is the first year 
they entered the contest but they always go to the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the roller coasters, I always have fun," Staci said. County Fair

TV OFFICIALS DENY THAT NETWORKS ARE RACIST; MEDIA: THEY TOUT PROGRESS IN 
POSITIVE MINORITY PORTRAYALS AND IN RECRUITING WRITERS. JESSE JACKSON SAYS THEY 
AREN'T DOING ENOUGH, AND THREATENS BOYCOTTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While acknowledging that more could be done to increase cultural diversity in 
television, representatives of the four major television networks on Saturday 
denied charges by the Rev. Jesse Jackson that the networks practice racism in 
front of and behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives for ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox defended their policies during a 
conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center sponsored by Jackson's Rainbow 
Coalition. The symposium, called "What's Wrong With This Picture?: Organizing 
to Win Cultural Diversity in Television and Film," was held to explore what 
Jackson termed a lack of minorities in positive roles on network television 
series and a significant absence of minorities and women among news anchors, on 
prime-time entertainment writing staffs and in key decision-making positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The network representatives -- executives from the development, business, 
employee relations and administrative divisions -- said progress had been made 
in increasing the number of positive minority portrayals in prime-time and 
daytime television series, and in the recruitment and training of Latinos and 
African Americans for writing positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Allau, vice president of the ABC Television Network Group, noted that 
five of the network's 16 current situation comedies feature all-minority casts, 
and said the shows reflect positive family values. Charisse McGee, vice 
president of prime-time series for NBC, said Latino writers are being recruited 
to work on several series. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after the comments, Jackson said he remained unconvinced that enough 
is being done by the networks, and that he was upset with the networks for not 
sending their top, decision-making executives to the conference. He repeated 
his threat to target the networks and advertisers with viewer boycotts if they 
did not immediately launch plans to improve ethnic visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the networks can deny that what has been going on is wrong, and we 
will not tolerate it anymore," Jackson said. "These people here today weren't 
decision makers, they report back to the decision makers. We want to meet with 
the presidents of all of the networks, and to see a plan of action and a 
timetable for putting that plan into place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticking off specific grievances against each network in turn, Jackson said: 
"At CBS, the eye seems to be blind to people of color. As far as Fox, this Fox 
cannot guard the henhouse. There is no minority purchasing office, or no 
corporate officer in charge of affirmative action. At NBC, there are serious 
deficiencies in hiring and in promotion on the corporate level. At ABC, we are 
tired of the advertised 'air supremacy' of all the white hosts on the Sunday 
morning news programs. That is not 'air supremacy.' That is race supremacy." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that efforts would be launched to set up picket lines at stations in 
the top 50 television markets if the networks did not make plans to improve 
ethnic representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will use our minds and the pitter-patter of our marching feet until there 
is change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the boycotts of stations and advertisers would most likely take 
place during the November sweeps period, when networks put on special 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unscheduled appearance, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) 
addressed the conference's luncheon crowd. She drew cheers when she spoke of 
the power of viewers against the networks, declaring, "Close them down! Close 
them down!" 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people attended the conference. Much of the day was devoted to 
testimony by leaders of ethnic media watchdog groups, who said the networks 
continually ignore minority groups on television series or place them in 
stereotypical roles.

 Amy Yu didn't hesitate five years ago when she had the chance to leave her Bay 
Area home and attend Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu, who is deaf, knew CSUN's reputation for running one of the largest and 
most respected university programs for deaf students in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a senior, Yu is disillusioned. Many of the most talented sign-language 
interpreters who enabled her to fully participate in classes have been replaced 
by novices, she said.

 "I'm lucky if I get enough information out of the classes to pass," Yu said.

Center on Deafness are complaining the operation has fallen on hard times and 
has lost talented interpreters amid complaints of low pay and difficult working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1960s, the Northridge campus became one of the first mainstream 
universities to accept deaf students. The center was founded in 1972 and today 
runs on a $1.8-million budget, about $1 million of it in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With talks on a revised union contract stalled, a delegation of interpreters, 
union representatives and deaf students aired their complaints last week before 
the Cal State University system's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at the center, which has about 250 deaf students and 130 
interpreters, were not present at the meeting. They later conceded the general 
decline, although they disputed specific issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Herbert Larson blamed a shortage of funds for the loss of experienced 
interpreters. "It's hard to maintain the good quality if you're not able to 
support it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpreters are a lifeline to learning for deaf students, conveying class 
discussions and speaking for many who cannot talk. CSUN's deaf population is 
one of the largest among American universities. By comparison, UCLA has only 10 
deaf students, CSUN officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN has suffered a mass exodus of talented interpreters in recent years, the 
delegation charged, due to Cal State personnel practices that deny many 
interpreters health benefits and pay them hourly wages that are half what some 
earn elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of interpreters at the campus has not declined. But among the 
80 or so who work full time, the portion at the highest skill levels has fallen 
from about 20 to just a handful, interpreters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpreters joined the California State Employees Assn., which also 
represents other Cal State system employees, in 1992. When the union and the 
system signed a new two-year general contract in mid-1993, they agreed to hold 
separate talks for the interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than a year has passed with little progress reported. Noel Grogan, 
the Cal State system's director of human resources, expressed sympathy for the 
complaints, but said money is tight. "If there is more money going to the 
interpreters, there is less going somewhere else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many of CSUN's deaf students complain that the problems are 
depriving them of the full benefit of a university education, which federal law 
guarantees to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deeply affected me because I have a lot of questions and I want to 
participate in class," said John Sherwood, a senior. "But if I can't have 
direct interaction with my instructors, I lose that." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I need to give oral presentations and participate, the interpreters have 
a lot of problems," said LisaAnn Tom, a graduate student who began studying at 
CSUN in 1985 as a freshman. "If the interpreter keeps asking me to repeat 
myself, I lose the flow of what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said interpreters generally do well translating the comments of 
instructors and other students in classes into sign language, which deaf 
students can understand. That is relatively easy for most interpreters because 
they are listening to their own language, spoken English. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger problem has been the tougher job of converting the sign language 
that many deaf students use into spoken words that others can understand. When 
those problems arise, students say, they feel isolated and left out of their 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a complete education. I don't want to miss out on anything. I want 
good interpreters so I can get it all," said Yu, who is majoring in deaf 
studies. "I feel like I'm behind my non-deaf peers." 
</P>
<P>
 All but a handful of the interpreters at CSUN are considered intermittent 
employees paid between about $7 and $21 an hour with no health benefits, 
according to the union. Other employers are paying up to $40 an hour for people 
with similar skills, according to a survey of companies in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals say interpreters generally cannot effectively work alone for 
more than 20 to 30 minutes in the physically and mentally demanding job without 
being relieved for a similar period. So a common strategy has been "team 
interpreting," in which two people continuously take turns. 
</P>
<P>
 But because CSUN lacks the funds, team interpreting is rarely used, even in 
classes that run for two to three hours. CSUN has instead taken a modified 
approach, using partial work-sharing in some of the longest classes. Larson, 
the center's director, defends the practice, but the interpreters denounce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sanderson, a staff member, said that at one point about a third of the 
center's interpreters had filed workers' compensation claims complaining of 
repetitive-motion injuries. But center officials said such problems could be 
due to interpreters overworking at other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN interpreters are "woefully underpaid," according to Jane Jarrow, 
executive director of the Assn. on Higher Education and Disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-person team interpreting is commonly used and is preferred, said Jarrow, 
who heads an 1,800-member group of educators who deal with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is the budget's got to go up. We're talking about students' basic 
civil rights here," Jarrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson expressed surprise at students' complaints, saying such dissatisfaction 
had not surfaced before in student evaluations. He attributed it partly to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he conceded that the pay and working-conditions issues have cost the 
center talented staff. But he said the center is caught in a squeeze. Its 
interpreting budget, about $238,000, has remained flat for years while its 
hours of service have risen 23% since 1990, he said.

CROWD OF 800 ASSAILS DOCTOR'S IMPENDING TRADE VISIT TO HANOI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 800 people opposed to normalized relations with Vietnam gathered 
outside the offices of Dr. Co Pham on Saturday in the largest protest to date 
of the physician's scheduled trade mission to Hanoi next week. 
</P>
<P>
 While Westminster Police Lt. Andrew Hall characterized Saturday's 
demonstration, organized by the Committee for a Just Cause of Free Vietnam, 
"noisy but controlled," an angry Pham said he planned to file harassment 
complaints Monday against the protesters who picketed his Bolsa Avenue medical 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have jeopardized my practice and the safety of my patients," the 
physician said. "They were yelling at my patients and obstructing my business. 
I'm going to have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has staged demonstrations outside Pham's office for the past 
several weeks, but Hall said Saturday's crowd was the largest yet. Last week, 
the committee used community advertisements in an attempt to draw larger 
assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee wants Pham to step down as president of the Vietnamese Chamber 
of Commerce, a position Pham has used to advocate trade with Vietnam. The 
doctor said his position on trade is not an endorsement of the country's 
communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say I am a communist. I am not a communist," Pham said, adding that he 
will neither step down from his chamber position nor cancel his mission to 
Hanoi. "They are not going to change my plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham will be traveling with a delegation of bankers, developers, academics, 
immigration lawyers and representatives of U.S. companies eager to open trade 
with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets at Pham's office began Aug. 22, just days after news leaked out 
that the Vietnamese chamber and the Asian Business League of California were to 
sponsor the trade mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned trip has rekindled debate within the Vietnamese American community 
about how to deal the Vietnamese government in the face of warming relations 
between Hanoi and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham declined to say exactly when he will be leaving for Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Hall said police made no arrests, but the demonstration generated a number 
of telephone calls to police complaining of noise and clogged traffic along 
Bolsa Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Hall said the crowd began gathering around 9 a.m. and dispersed promptly at 
noon, as organizers had previously told police. 
</P>
<P>
 "In past weeks, they have had as few as 20 people show up," Hall said. "But 
this time, they really turned out."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
CANDIDATE CLARIFIES HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PARTY'S INTELLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Brain dead" politics: Women's Alert, a bipartisan newsletter, recently quoted 
Democratic 70th Assembly District candidate Jim Toledano as saying: "For all 
practical purposes, the leadership of the Orange County Democratic Party is 
brain dead. It doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano, an attorney, said he did not know he was being interviewed for the 
newsletter, and his comments were taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in one of the most Republican districts in the state, Toledano said 
his message is that he is counting on voters to choose on the basis of 
substance, not labels. The Democratic Party, he said, is not running a unified 
campaign for all of its local nominees, but instead has splinter groups 
supporting individual candidates. That was the context of his comments, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Toledano insists he was not talking about the local Democratic Party 
organization -- only the process of choosing candidates -- and he did not call 
his political party "brain dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be attacking myself," Toledano said. "Whatever I am, I don't think 
I am brain dead." 
</P>

 Gil and Rush: At a gathering at his local office this week, Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) announced that the one and only Rush Limbaugh has 
agreed to be his honorary campaign chairman in his run for the soon-vacant 
state Senate seat now occupied by Marian Bergeson, also a Newport Beach 
Republican.  
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson proudly says that Limbaugh has raised money for only two politicians 
ever -- Ferguson and former Assemblyman and Vietnam War vet B.T. Collins. 
Limbaugh came to California in 1990 and 1992 to help Ferguson and could come 
again during this campaign, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I are going back to New York to be with Rush in October, and 
we're trying to get him to come out here one more time for me," Ferguson said. 
"It would certainly be a big shot in the arm for my campaign, even more than 
his agreeing to be my honorary chairman."

 None of the above: The president of the Fountain Valley Police Officers Assn. 
recently sent a letter to the head of the Peace Officers Research Assn. of 
California, or PORAC, complaining about the state group's endorsement of 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean that James R. McNeff, the local president, supports 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, our political choices have been 'slim pickins' recently," 
McNeff stated in his letter. "When that is the case, I would strongly encourage 
PORAC to remain neutral in such situations."

 Impartial analysis: Want a nonpartisan analysis of the California senatorial, 
gubernatorial and Orange County congressional candidates? Project Vote Smart 
will send you one, free of charge for the first time this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, based in Corvallis, Ore., with grant funds from the James 
Irvine Foundation, has interviewed all the candidates and "pinned them down on 
a range of issues. We consider it a job interview," said Adelaide Elm, the 
group's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Vote Smart, which was founded by former Sens. Barry Goldwater and 
George McGovern, among others, also gathers information on the candidates' 
voting records, campaign finance reports, including contributions from 
political action committees, and their ratings by a variety of special interest 
groups.

 Quote of the week: "Democracies make mistakes and I recognize that. But as 
long as democracy is retained, then the mistake (by the Clinton Administration) 
can be undone in the next election." . . . former U.S. Senate candidate Bruce 
Herschensohn, speaking last weekend at the state GOP convention in support of 
the planned U.S. invasion of Haiti, while also criticizing the Administration's 
handling of affairs. Herschensohn argued the United States must be the 
protector of democracy, even though most Republicans attending the meeting were 
against the proposed military invasion that was averted at the last minute in 
favor of a phased-in occupation. UPCOMING EVENTS

MUSIC FADES AT THE IRVINE CONSERVATORY; ARTS: NONPROFIT SCHOOL SPENDS MOST OF 
ITS FUNDS TO MOVE TO A NEW SITE, ONLY TO FIND IT CAN'T OPEN THERE BECAUSE THE 
BUILDING LACKS FIREPROOF WALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The future of a nonprofit organization that has provided low-cost music 
lessons and public performances in the city for 20 years is in jeopardy after 
being forced to close its doors to students amid a lease dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after spending most of its funds to move to the Airport Business Center 
on July 30, the Irvine Conservatory of Music was barred by the city from 
offering classes there because of zoning and fire code restrictions. A handful 
of the conservatory's 145 students are receiving lessons at their homes and at 
a local church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about to put us out of business," said Eric Wright, director of the 
conservatory, which also sponsors the Irvine Chamber Orchestra. The 
conservatory is paying $1,650 a month on a five-year lease for the 
2,000-square-foot facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright blames Koll Management Services for recommending the site to the 
conservatory, which was looking for room to expand its popular private and 
group classes. The city has required a $3,000 conditional-use permit and the 
construction of two fire walls if it is to be used as a music school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that perplexes us is that Koll didn't give us full disclosure of 
what was needed to be in here as an operating business in this facility, even 
though we asked them," Wright said. "We don't want to point the finger; it's 
been a screw-up all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Co. attorney Paul Hegness agrees there was a misunderstanding about 
zoning requirements, but he has pledged to help the conservatory solve its 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no reason to believe that the city wouldn't permit this use," Hegness 
said, adding that the conservatory will not be held to the five-year lease if 
it is unable to operate at the location. "We're not going to leave this tenant 
holding the bag -- that's the last thing that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said that if the Koll Co. will bring the 
property up to code by installing fire walls, the city will be flexible on the 
zoning permits. Otherwise, Brady said, he expects Koll Management Services to 
find the school a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a problem that was created by the Koll leasing agents because they did 
not check with the city ahead of time to see if it was a permitted use," Brady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Music Conservatory had 145 students and a 20-member faculty before 
moving to its new location on Skypark Circle near John Wayne Airport. In 
addition to vocal and instrumental music lessons, the conservatory has 
sponsored a youth chorus and jazz ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Symphony Orchestra, which has since been reduced to a chamber music 
group, was organized by the conservatory. Wright had hoped to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to gradually build it back up, using this new location," Wright 
said. "You work 20 years, and in the wink of an eye it's threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's "cease and desist" order, which was issued on Sept. 8, could not 
have come at a worse time, said Christine Jones, a music instructor, who heads 
the conservatory's piano instruction program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important time of the year for us economically, when we 
enroll most of our students," Jones said. "We've had to turn them away." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have offered to reduce the down payment required for the 
conditional-use permit. But Community Development Director Robert Johnson said 
the business cannot be allowed to operate unless additional fire walls are 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure that if one portion of the building catches fire, it 
won't move rapidly through the building," Johnson said. "We'll work with them 
on the zoning, but when it comes to fire safety, it's not one of those areas 
where we have much flexibility."

AN UPLIFTING EXPERIENCE; BALLOON FESTIVAL -- WITH A WILD MIX OF CHARACTERS -- 
IS A CROWD PLEASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Held aloft on his dad's shoulders, 5-year-old Alex Blakeman claimed one of the 
best seats in the house at the first Smith's Festival of Ballooning on Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 From his perch, he watched cartoon character Tony the Tiger slowly come to 
life as a fan inflated the beast's gigantic nylon body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to go and ask where the Frosted Flakes were," said the boy's 
mother, Terry, who stood with other fans of the Kellogg's cereal mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most avid groupies can get distracted when 61 hot-air balloons 
start taking fantastic shape. "Mommy, look," Alex commanded, pointing toward a 
purple dragon. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiger and dragon competed for attention with a rabbit, a stork, a bag full 
of groceries, a hot dog with mustard and a bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Each creation drew exclamations and sometimes applause from several thousand 
onlookers who gathered soon after sunrise in an open field in Tustin. They came 
by car, bicycle, roller skates and on foot to see what was billed as the 
largest balloon festival in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon launchings were originally scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m., but 
were delayed about 45 minutes because light winds were blowing directly into 
the landing approach at nearby John Wayne Airport. Ultimately, the winds 
shifted and the balloons were allowed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 As each balloon took off with its crew and guests, people ran to capture the 
excitement with cameras and camcorders.  
</P>
<P>
 "It brings out the child in us," said Rick Slinkard, 37, of Silverado Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is one word to describe it, it is 'awesome,' " said his girlfriend, 
Cindy LaChance, 35, also from Silverado Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie Ochoa, 46, who came with co-workers from the Santa Ana Unified School 
District, said, "I gave up sleep this morning and I am so glad. It is so 
beautiful. There is nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Von Helms, 81, said she also had trouble rising at 5:30 a.m. at her 
Leisure World home in Laguna Hills, especially since she had been up late the 
night before hosting a party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I could make it. But I did," said Helms, who was accompanied 
by her children and three grandchildren. "I think this is tremendous," she 
added with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 As the balloons took flight, they filled the sky with color and seemed to 
barely move in the calm air. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very little wind anywhere here today, which is perfect because the 
balloons hang around longer and are seen by the crowd," said festival director 
John Korff. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of the largest balloons, the dragon, couldn't catch a favorable 
wind and landed barely across the street from the festival, its neck visible 
among the trees as if in some primeval forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Wong, the balloon coordinator for the event, said an important purpose of 
this initial festival -- which continues today with various exhibits, 
entertainment and two more balloon launchings -- was to introduce ballooning to 
Orange County on a large scale and allay any fears about the inflatables 
breaking loose and causing damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Tustin apparently have been won over, Wong said. One of the 
ballooners was invited to land by homeowners who were having a block party in 
honor of the event. "It was an offer he said he couldn't refuse," Wong said. 
"They offered him brunch and champagne."

TWO-CAR COLLISION IN IRVINE INJURES 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six people were injured when two cars collided at an Irvine intersection 
Friday night, sending one vehicle careening into a light pole and rolling onto 
its roof, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Officer Gregg Gibbs said a Honda driven by Collin Eckert, 20, of Irvine 
was traveling north on Yale Avenue with three passengers about 10:40 p.m. when 
it struck a Mazda going west on Bryan Avenue and driven by Mina Maghami, 40, 
also of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and released from custody 
for treatment at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is still under investigation, and it is not clear whether alcohol 
was a factor in the accident, Gibbs said.  
</P>
<P>
 The injured were taken to two area hospitals.

MCCALL SHOCKS LEWIS FOR TITLE; BOXING: FORMER CHAMPION OUTRAGED WHEN FIGHT IS 
STOPPED IN SECOND ROUND, CANCELING BIG-MONEY BOUT AGAINST BOWE. 
</P>

<P>
 Oliver McCall, the sparring partner who would be king, is just that. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, a 5 1/2-to-1 underdog, won the World Boxing Council heavyweight 
championship in a shocking upset early this morning by knocking down and 
stopping previously undefeated Lennox Lewis at 31 seconds of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say?" a tearful McCall said in his dressing room after the fight. 
"I am happy, I am thrilled. We knocked him out. We did it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis admitted to being dazed by a left hook and right hand that knocked him 
down before about 7,000 shocked onlookers in the Wembley Arena. Then he became 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got caught with a lucky shot, and the referee seemed to help him, he 
really did," said Lewis, the only British boxer to hold a piece of the 
heavyweight title in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't badly hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Duva, co-promoter of the fight, called the action of referee Lupe Garcia 
of Mexico "an outrageous stoppage." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Maloney, Lewis' manager, said he would file a protest at the WBC 
convention in Seville, Spain, at the end of next month. The WBC board of 
governors can order an immediate rematch or a rematch after the new champion 
makes one voluntary defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, said he would be happy to consider a 
protest. But, he added, "An immediate rematch is seldom ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the money is right, I'll give him a rematch and I'll knock him down 
again," McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don King, McCall's promoter, warned that if the Lewis camp was going to 
protest, Lewis would not get a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, 29, said he had talked on the phone to former champion Mike Tyson, who 
is in an Indiana prison, and Tyson told him to keep throwing left hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as Lewis started to throw a long right in the second round, McCall threw a 
left hook and then crashed home a right to the chin that dropped Lewis in a 
heap. He struggled up at the count of six and was weaving about when Garcia 
stopped it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He landed a great right punch," Lewis said. "I tried to get up too fast. I 
was a little wobbly. But I was really surprised at the referee's decision to 
stop the fight so early. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee couldn't speak English. When you nod your head, it means, yes, 
you're OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, however, did look badly dazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely sure of what I did. Lennox Lewis was knocked out," Garcia 
said. "To allow more punches to Lennox Lewis would have fatal consequences. My 
duty is to protect the health of the fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 "What did they want me to do -- kill him?" McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fight, Lewis and others referred to McCall as a sparring partner 
despite McCall's No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall has sparred with the likes of Tyson, Larry Holmes, Tim Witherspoon, Ray 
Mercer and Pinklon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said after his victory that he was always more than a mere punching bag 
for the fighters he sparred with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never a sparring partner," said McCall (25-5). "I got the best of every 
round (in the gym) -- Tyson, everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had gotten up, he would have gotten knocked out again. For those of you 
who think there was some controversy, in the first round I had him going. All 
it took was one punch that I had to set him up for." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory knocked Lewis, 29, out of a megabuck fight against former champion 
Riddick Bowe. The fight was to have been held in March. Michael Moorer holds 
the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles 
and is scheduled to fight George Foreman in November. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall said he would fight Bowe, but not in a title match because Bowe had 
insulted the WBC by throwing its belt in a trash can in 1991 before Bowe was 
stripped of the title that allowed Lewis to become champion. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavyweight champion, however, cannot fight without the title being on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 King said McCall's first defense would be against Bruce Seldon, ranked sixth 
by the WBC, or Peter McNeely, a son of Tom McNeely, who made an unsuccessful 
title bid against Floyd Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 King, shut out of the heavyweight picture when Tyson was knocked out by Buster 
Douglas, now is back in it. The controversial promoter would love very much to 
keep a piece of the title so that Tyson can challenge for it when he gets out 
of prison in Indiana early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he definitely wants to regain the title. His first defeat after 25 
victories -- including 21 knockouts -- came in his fourth title defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who weighed 238 pounds, earned $3.5 million. McCall, 231 1/4, was 
supposed to get $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One of McCall's five losses was to Douglas on points July 21, 1989, although 
he had Douglas in serious trouble in the final minute of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In his next fight, Douglas knocked out Tyson in the 10th round in the biggest 
upset in boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Oliver had fought good (against Douglas) then we wouldn't have had that 
kind of history," King said of the victory that allowed Douglas to beat Tyson.

NOW PERRANOSKI KNOWS FEELING OF BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE GAME; DODGERS: COACH 
SURPRISED AT FIRING, BECAUSE HE HAD A HISTORY OF SUCCESS WITH YOUNG PITCHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was late Friday night when Ron Perranoski got the news, and it came, he 
said, coldly. The Dodgers' longtime pitching coach was in bed when his wife 
brought him a message to call Fred Claire, the club's executive vice president. 
When he did, Claire fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours later, Perranoski's shock had turned to disappointment, but 
he still had his sense of humor. Claire replaced Perranoski with minor league 
pitching instructor Dave Wallace, saying the move was made because there will 
be a lot of young pitchers on the staff next season with whom Wallace has 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too soon to say what I am going to do," Perranoski said Saturday from 
his winter home in Vero Beach, Fla. "Maybe I will take over a young pitching 
staff somewhere and develop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked with the young kids too. I had (Rick) Sutcliffe, Steve Howe and 
Fernando (Valenzuela) in the majors and in the minors, and they each won rookie 
of the year. I had Orel (Hershiser), (Alejandro) Pena and (Bob) Welch, but that 
was 20 years ago, and I understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski, 58, has been a coach in the Dodger organization since he retired 
in 1973 after 13 seasons as a successful relief pitcher. He spent seven seasons 
with the Dodgers from 1961-67, saving 101 games -- second on the all-time 
Dodger list behind Jim Brewer's 125 -- and pitched in three World Series. He 
finished his career with 179 saves and a 2.79 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pitching coach, he was equally successful, with his staff finishing 
either first or second in ERA in the National League nine times. He was Manager 
Tom Lasorda's pitching coach for 14 seasons and a minor league pitching coach 
for the seven years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 The news hit him hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they say it so coldly," Perranoski said, relating his conversation 
with Claire. "They say, 'I've got some bad news for you,' and you say, 'OK 
thank you, I'm still alive.' Then they tell you you're out and you say 'fine,' 
and that was it. The bottom line is that it is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski's dismissal signals a hastening in the direction the club was 
headed anyway, one of youth. Wallace, who has been a minor league coach for 12 
seasons, has worked with Ismael Valdes, whom the Dodgers have ticketed as a 
starter, and relievers Greg Hansell, Antonio Osuna and Todd Williams, all of 
whom have a chance to make the team, Claire says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock," Dodger reliever Jim Gott said. "But I was just talking to 
someone about this and it's kind of like last year when they brought Reggie 
Smith up as the hitting instructor and replaced Ben Hines because Reggie had 
worked with a lot of the players. Now they are bringing up a pitching coach who 
has already worked with what will be a very young staff. " 
</P>
<P>
 Gott, who is one of four Dodger pitchers who are potential free agents, says 
he doesn't expect to be asked back. And the more Claire talks, the more it 
seems the pitching staff could have an entirely different look next season. In 
the starting rotation, Pedro Astacio, Ramon Martinez and Tom Candiotti appear 
to be set, but Orel Hershiser and Kevin Gross are potential free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the bullpen, other than Todd Worrell, who has another year on his 
contract, and Rudy Seanez, it appears to be open game. Roger McDowell's 
contract is also up. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski said his phone rang off the hook Saturday with calls from friends 
who were stunned, and one of the callers was Lasorda. Later in the day, 
Perranoski took a drive to let the news sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what the heck, " Perranoski tried to joke, "it happens every 21 years.

CHIEFS QUITE A CHALLENGE FOR CHANDLER; PRO FOOTBALL: WITH MILLER SIDELINED, 
BURDEN OF FACING KANSAS CITY DEFENSE FALLS ON SHOULDERS OF THE RAMS' BACKUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The injured Chris Miller sat useless in the locker beside that of Chris 
Chandler, the next victim assigned hazardous duty as starting quarterback 
behind the Rams' offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler was late arriving in the locker room because he had asked offensive 
tackles Clarence Jones, Wayne Gandy and Jackie Slater to remain after practice 
for additional work. No coaches had thought about giving the team's offensive 
linemen post-practice tutoring, but Chandler had watched Miller take a beating 
and now must play in his place against the hard-charging Kansas City Chiefs 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Thomas vs. Clarence Jones? The potential for mayhem brings tears to 
the eyes. Neil Smith vs. Wayne Gandy? Is it too early to start having Tommy 
Maddox warm up? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always concerned and hoping it doesn't happen," Chandler said, 
directing his attention to Miller and Miller's sore shoulder and painful ribs. 
"Chris will be the first to tell you, all you can do is take your reads down 
the field and trust them up front. Once you start looking at your linemen and 
not where you're supposed to, you got double trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys we're going to play are about as good as any out there, but I just 
got to have faith in our people that they are going to do their job. We'll see 
what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who is second in the AFC behind Bruce Smith with four sacks, needs 
three more to become the Chiefs' all-time leader, surpassing Art Still, who had 
72 1/2. Smith, who will be matched early against Slater before getting a shot 
at Gandy, has two sacks this season and 59 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thomas is unbelievable," said Ram Coach Chuck Knox, who watched Thomas pile 
up eight sacks in one game against the Knox-coached Seahawks. "We gave up eight 
sacks that game, but we were fortunate to come back and score and win it with 
time running out." 
</P>
<P>
 Find a way -- any way -- to win, that's the Rams' theme for success this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts suggest implementation of such a plan is impossible: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chiefs, who are trying to start 4-0 for the first time in franchise 
history, have the better defense, two of the game's best pass rushers in Smith 
and Thomas, and an NFL-leading mark of 14 takeaways (interceptions and fumble 
recoveries). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chiefs' offense, which ranks sixth overall, has Joe Montana at 
quarterback and Marcus Allen ready to score if Kansas City gets a sniff of the 
goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what," Knox said. "They are the best team I've seen on film, by 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (3-0) will be trying to complete a sweep of NFC West opponents when 
they take on the Rams, while maintaining the national hope that they are the 
team to replace the Buffalo Bills in this year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 To guard against a letdown, the Chiefs have been reminded about an upsetting 
loss to Chicago in Arrowhead Stadium a year ago, which ultimately gave the 
Bills home-field advantage in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we're fortunate, because we haven't really played as well as we're 
capable of playing," said Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer. "Things are 
only going to get more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Chiefs have the Rams, next week they draw a bye, and how tough 
is that? The Rams are 1-2 for the fifth consecutive season, and besides Miller, 
will be without starting left guard Keith Loneker and Darryl Ashmore, who has 
taken the bulk of playing time at right tackle. Loneker has a foot injury, 
Ashmore a knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to force some turnovers, we sure do, there's no question about that," 
Knox said. "It's going to be a tough, tough football game for us, but we just 
have to play hard and make some plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs' success has been tied directly to their ability to force 
turnovers, while protecting the ball on offense. Kansas City has the best 
takeaway/giveaway ratio in the NFL the last four years and once again leads the 
league in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't give the ball away," said Ram cornerback Darryl Henley. "Watch 
Montana on videotape -- the ball is always there." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, who has completed 64.4% of his passes in previous assignments against 
the Rams, with 37 touchdowns and 15 interceptions, has led the Chiefs to six 
victories without a defeat while playing in Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs have 
won 16 of their last 18 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 79,907 contributed noise to the Chiefs' 24-17 victory over 
San Francisco two weeks ago and was credited with disrupting the 49ers' offense 
by having the offensive line react slowly off the snap of the ball. Another 
sellout is anticipated for this game, and the Rams have made preparations along 
their offensive line to contend with the anticipated noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a big test, handling the crowd noise," Knox said. "Those 
people know when to make noise. We can't get behind in the count, get an 
illegal procedure and get stuck with first and 15. We can't get in those 
long-yardage situations where they can turn Derrick Thomas loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the crowd gets whipped into a frenzy and you can't hear. We have to try 
hard to control the game. The disadvantage is, you get your tackles out wide 
and they can't hear, and the advantage you normally have on offense of knowing 
the snap count is gone. With the (rushers) they have, that's tough for even the 
best tackles." 
</P>
<P>
 Which might explain why Chandler had the guys up front stay after practice for 
some extrawork.

 One team begins today's game unbeaten, the other unproven. One is trying to 
keep its feet on the ground and not get carried away by all the praise coming 
its way. The other is trying to get back on its feet and not get swept out of 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Many might have predicted it would be this way on this fourth weekend of the 
NFL season with the San Diego Chargers coming to the Coliseum to play the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, however, would have dared to suggest that it would be the Chargers 
unbeaten at 3-0 and the Raiders unsteady at 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all their early-season difficulties, the Raiders appear to be back 
to the shape they were in before the kickoff of their disastrous opening game 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because they are coming off a 48-16 thrashing of the Denver Broncos. 
Scoring points off the Bronco defense is like hitting home runs against a 
batting practice pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Raiders are looking better because they appear to have answered the 
three questions that have hung over their heads since opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do they have an effective quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can they run the ball? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can they put together a defensive line? 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler continues to deny he had arm problems. But whatever 
caused his difficulties in the first two games seems to be gone. He completed 
21 of 33 passes for 338 yards and four touchdowns against Denver, but more 
impressive, the old snap is back in his passes, the deadly accuracy back in his 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 That can't be good news for the Chargers, who suffered through a club-record, 
424-yard passing performance by Hostetler the last time they came to the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, however, won that game, 30-23, the Chargers' third straight victory 
in Los Angeles. And one of the major reasons for last season's San Diego 
triumph here was the Raiders' inability to complement Hostetler's potent arm 
with some effective legs. The Raiders rushed for only 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the second question. 
</P>
<P>
 The season-ending injury to fullback Napoleon McCallum on opening night 
further weakened an already struggling running game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club last week broke through for its first 100-yard rushing 
performance, led by tailback Ty Montgomery's season-high 53 yards and 4.1-yard 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders rushed for 102 yards, only three more than the week before against 
the Seattle Seahawks. But the big difference was that the yards against Denver 
all were provided by the people who are paid specifically to get those yards, 
the running backs. Neither quarterback gained a yard. A week earlier, Hostetler 
and backup quarterback Vince Evans had accounted for 52 of the 99 yards 
rushing, numbers that don't say much for the other backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Add in Jerrod Bunch, the former New York Giant back signed a week ago, and the 
Raiders, though hardly a juggernaut on the ground, might have enough to keep 
the defense from zeroing in on Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the ball, missing defensive end Scott Davis is back after 
a two-game absence. He isn't expected to start, but his presence will allow 
starters Anthony Smith, Chester McGlockton, Nolan Harrison and Jerry Ball to 
get the breathers they need to stay at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 They will need all the rest they can get after trying to battle their way 
through San Diego's tough offensive line to get to quarterback Stan Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers have been sacked only twice, allowing Humphries the time to throw 
well enough to get the highest passing rating in the league. His 119.4 mark is 
nearly two points higher than that of the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino and 
slightly more than 10 points higher than that of the San Francisco 49ers' Steve 
Young, the NFL leader in that department in each of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Free of the shoulder problems that hampered him last season, Humphries has 
completed 61.3% of his passes, has thrown six touchdown passes and has not 
thrown an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Coach Bobby Ross figures it's easy to explain the fast start of 
Humphries, who had a 99-yard pass play for a touchdown against the Seahawks 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think he's healthy," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 There figures to be more pressure on Humphries today because of the absence of 
starting center Courtney Hall, sidelined because of a biceps injury. Third-year 
man Curtis Whitley is expected to start in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the Chargers have seven new faces, among them starters Reuben 
Davis at tackle, David Griggs and Dennis Gibson at linebacker and Dwayne Harper 
in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's one of the old faces that most concerns the Raiders, and anybody else 
who must face San Diego -- linebacker Junior Seau. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role hasn't changed," Seau said. "They're allowing me to run and hit. . . 
. I'm not going to be in one place all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by his teammates, Seau has helped put the Chargers in the one place few 
dreamed they would be at this point, tied for first in the AFC West.

PRITCHARD, BRONCOS' LEADING RECEIVER, HAS LACERATED KIDNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Pritchard's lacerated kidney is not as serious as first believed, and the 
Denver Bronco wide receiver might be back with the team later this season, 
Coach Wade Phillips said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Pritchard, in serious condition in the intensive care unit at 
Presbyterian-St.Luke's Hospital, would not require surgery and that physicians 
told him the kidney would heal itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard was rushed to the hospital Friday night after he noticed blood in 
his urine, hospital authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchard, 24, was acquired in a draft-day trade with Atlanta after three 
seasons with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Broncos' leading receiver this year with 19 receptions for 271 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said it was still not clear how long Pritchard will remain 
hospitalized or how long it will be before he can practice with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like he's going to be able to play at some time, and I don't know 
when, but he's going to be able to play this year," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lacerated kidney was pinpointed Friday night by a CAT scan and X-rays, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said Pritchard was knocked down while running a pass route, but "I 
couldn't tell whether he fell on the football or just on the ground."

FANS HAVEN'T DESERTED MCNALL; KINGS: HE SAYS THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE DESPITE 
'THE EXTRANEOUS STUFF.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Embattled King President Bruce McNall, who has been out among the public at 
exhibitions the last couple of weeks, was asked how fans have been treating him 
since the public emergence of his financial and legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He answered the question with one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think would happen if O.J. Simpson walked down the hall?" McNall 
asked reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall surmised that bystanders would cheer and pat Simpson on the back, 
drawing a loose parallel to his own situation. "The fans have been nice," he 
said Friday night. "The bottom line is that they care about the game. They 
could care less about the extraneous stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been awkward moments. Normal conversational openers -- how are you? 
-- can lead to a pause. McNall often tries to fill the gap with a quip, 
sometimes directed at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude is that I try to be normal, to be the same as I've been," McNall 
said. "At times it is (difficult), but not particularly. You have to take the 
good with the bad. I didn't always take the successes seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a 
federal bank fraud investigation, according to sources close to the case. 
Federal prosecutors have been completing plea agreements from other McNall 
business associates, the latest being his former accountant Robert J. Houston, 
who is expected to plead guilty to three criminal counts for his role in 
preparing false tax returns and financial statements.  
</P>
<P>
 McNall spoke about his commitment to the Kings as their president and his 
representation of them on the NHL's board of governors. McNall resigned as 
chairman of the board in April once the federal investigation became public. 
</P>
<P>
 King co-owner Joseph M. Cohen has made repeated statements of public support. 
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has not commented, but McNall said they recently 
spoke about his situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to the league. I've told Gary I'll do the right thing at the 
time," McNall said. "If there's an appearance (of a problem), I feel at some 
point I would do something as I did when I was chairman. We'll take a look and 
see. Everybody has been sympathetic. " 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he would step down if he felt it was necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it's in the best interest of this team, I don't want to put a cloud on 
anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a title, he didn't think much would change, hoping he could 
continue to contribute. Meanwhile, McNall continues to operate much like 
before, such as having a pregame dinner with Wayne Gretzky and then 
entertaining other Hollywood types. Friday's celebrity guest was Simpson lawyer 
Robert L. Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall was discussing hockey's current labor situation and his active role two 
years ago in helping negotiate the end to the brief players' strike. This time, 
he is being informed by Bettman like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall spoke about the looming postponement to the season and sounded wistful, 
saying: "I wonder what would have happened if all this hadn't happened."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; HERE ARE KEY ISSUES TO BE FACED IN FINAL WEEK BEFORE 
DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman had a curious reply when asked why he and Bob 
Goodenow, head of the players association, hadn't talked between Wednesday and 
a session scheduled for Monday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob Goodenow told me he had to be in Las Vegas over the weekend and wasn't 
available to meet," Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounded like Goodenow was on a gambling junket or attending a Flying Elvises 
convention. Hardly. He was finishing a cross-continent tour of training camps, 
where he gave a combination pep talk-seminar about the tedious -- and so far 
fruitless -- collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the key issues that must be agreed upon by Saturday, or Bettman will 
order a delay in starting the season: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who helps subsidize the small-market teams. The NHL's proposal focuses on 
player payrolls with levies against teams that exceed a predetermined figure. 
The players want to raise money with a 5% levy on clubs' revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salary cap. Bettman prefers to call it "a relationship between salaries and 
revenues," but whatever name he gives it, players don't want it. Among the 
NHL's proposals is a plan in which salaries would be a fixed percentage of 
clubs' revenues, with that percentage to be negotiated. Players say clubs will 
use creative accounting to hide revenues, which would make their gross revenues 
seem lower and thus keep salaries lower. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arbitration. The NHL wants to eliminate it, saying that its unpredictable 
nature ruins budgets. Players, who went on strike in 1992 to get it, want to 
keep it. They are pushing for a system like baseball's, in which an independent 
arbitrator would choose either the club's figure or the player's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free agency. The league proposes a limit on the number of free agents teams 
can sign and can lose and gives them the right to match offers to players who 
become free agents. The players would eliminate equalization payments to teams 
that lose free agents and eliminate teams' right to match offers. They would 
also redefine the current three-group system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rookie salary caps. The NHL's plan would control salaries of players in 
their first few years through a cap, salary scale or pool. Bettman said 
exceptions could be made in isolated cases. Players are probably less united on 
this than other issues, but Goodenow says a rookie cap "is not in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Game rosters. The league would shrink them to 17 skaters plus two goalies, 
from 18 and two, and limit clubs to carrying 22 players. Players want to keep 
rosters at 18 and two and impose no limits on the number of players with a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, asked about the resumption of talks. "On money . . . um, Monday," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fans and coaches were puzzled when players began exchanging union solidarity 
handshakes before exhibitions Thursday. When the Rangers and Kings formed the 
handshake lines usually seen at the end of playoff series, some New Yorkers in 
the crowd thought the Kings were congratulating the Rangers for their Stanley 
Cup victory last spring. One suggested the Rangers had already eliminated the 
Kings from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone approved of the practice, especially after the Maple Leafs and 
Canadiens battled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise to me," Maple Leaf Coach Pat Burns said. "I started across 
the ice and Patrick Roy stuck out his hand. I didn't want any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NHL referees and linesmen are wearing jerseys that have only their numbers on 
the back, not their names. It affords them some anonymity, but it's no fun to 
yell, "Hey, 57, you're a bum." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Bob Gutkowski resigned as president of Madison Square Garden, 
he had nearly worked out terms of a new contract with holdout center Mark 
Messier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutkowski's departure, expected because of his feuds with Chuck Dolan of the 
new ITT-Cablevision ownership group, has delayed an agreement, although new 
Garden interim President Dave Checketts said signing Messier is his top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Messier's agent -- his father, Doug -- said he was told talks would have to 
start over, but Ranger General Manager Neil Smith said that's not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to carry on from where we've been," Smith said. "I think it 
will be resolved before the season starts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should the season start on time, Messier's teammates don't want to start 
without him. Defenseman Brian Leetch is said to be considering skipping the 
Rangers' Stanley Cup banner-raising ceremony at the Garden, set for Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "That banner should not go up without him," Leetch said. "They should just 
keep moving that back until he's here. There is no reason for that banner to go 
up without him there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mike Keenan era began in St. Louis on Saturday. The end of the Brett Hull 
era will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues are trying to trade Hull. The Kings wisely refused to give them Rob 
Blake for Hull during the summer and held firm when the Blues tried again 
during training camp. The Rangers don't want him either, saying he has a poor 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Blues are hoping the Blackhawks will like the idea of a 
second-generation Hull in their second-generation stadium in Chicago. No word 
on whom the Blues want in return. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, who left camp in a contract dispute, said he would be 
satisfied as the league's third-highest-paid goalie. Who wouldn't be, after 
only one good season to his credit? Hasek's 1.95 goals-against average and .930 
save percentage were the NHL's best, but he now wants to jump from $600,000 to 
$2 million-$3 million. . . . The Penguins, who are paying Mario Lemieux $3.5 
million this season despite his inactivity, might pare their payroll by trading 
defenseman Larry Murphy and his $1.26-million salary. . . . Vancouver 
defenseman Gerald Diduck is still recovering from off-season surgery and won't 
be back until November.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; ADVOCATE FOR ASYLUM; ORANGE COUNTY LAWYER LAN QUOC NGUYEN, 
A FORMER REFUGEE, DONATES HUNDREDS OF HOURS A YEAR HELPING OTHERS FIND 
SANCTUARY OUTSIDE VIETNAM AND OFFERING LEGAL ADVICE IN HIS OWN COMMUNITY. HE 
SAYS HE FINDS MORE HAPPINESS THAN MONEY IN FULFILLING WHAT HE SEES AS HIS 
OBLIGATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California office of Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum 
Seekers (LAVAS) is almost in visible, tucked into a far back corner of a 
two-story Bolsa Avenue strip mall on the edge of Little Saigon. It is spare and 
cluttered, decorated only with posters extolling human rights and postcards 
painted by Vietnamese refugees living in detention camps throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a hot Sunday, and Lan Quoc Nguyen is getting ready to settle in for a 
typical day's work. Throughout the day Nguyen, the supervising attorney for the 
office, and his staff will continue the often frustrating and labyrinthine job 
of reviewing case after case of Vietnamese refugees being held in the camps who 
want desperately to find asylum in a country -- any country -- other than 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 30, says he does it because, as a former refugee who escaped from 
Vietnam with his family in a boat and who spent time in a detention camp in 
Malaysia, he feels it is his moral obligation. A general practice attorney with 
an office in Tustin, Nguyen says he puts in between 30 and 40 hours a week, 
evenings and weekends, at the LAVAS office doing free legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts in even more unpaid hours each week on a series of radio and 
television shows broadcast locally to the Orange County Vietnamese-speaking 
population on Little Saigon Radio and Television. On both programs, he presents 
legal advice on a variety of subjects from property law to traffic violations, 
all tailored for an audience faced with the task of sorting out unfamiliar 
federal and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sense that Nguyen is a careerist. His ground floor Tustin law 
office is small, neat and functional, but hardly the sort of legal sanctum 
designed to impress or intimidate. He dresses cleanly, but without flash. 
</P>
<P>
 His passions are genuine, but he has lived with them for so long -- through 
years of his own persecution and confinement in an Asian camp -- that he speaks 
of them in matter-of-fact tones, with conviction but without missionary zeal. 
He can tell of squalor and suicide in the detention camps with controlled 
force, but there are no theatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen may be the most visible and best-known Vietnamese attorney in Orange 
County, familiar particularly to his own countrymen and women. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a result of all his high-profile pro bono work in the Vietnamese 
community (as well as the fact that he follows Vietnamese tradition by living 
with and supporting his elderly parents in Westminster), Nguyen says -- smiling 
-- that he is "barely making it. But I'm happy. That's more important. I spend 
long hours, but I think it's worth it. I do feel I have an obligation to the 
community to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he turned 14, life in Saigon had become intolerable for Nguyen and 
his family. It was 1979, and Nguyen's teacher father and his oldest brother, a 
former soldier, were both interned in "re-education camps." 
</P>
<P>
 "Security was tight in the Vietnamese government at the time, and persecution 
was rampant," Nguyen says. "Any intellectual family couldn't do anything, and 
we had a black mark on our history because of (supposed political activities) 
by other members of the family already. We were always under surveillance by 
the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The family planned escape by boat, but time and time again the attempts 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to do everything secretly," Nguyen says. "Get a boat, find petroleum, 
get food and water, find people you could really trust. Some of the people 
would just rip you off and run, and you couldn't go to the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven times the plans went awry before the Nguyens could even get to a boat. 
Family members were turned in to authorities, jailed and later released. 
Finally, on the eighth try, the Nguyen family of seven boys and their mother 
sailed away on a small boat with several other families. 
</P>
<P>
 During seven days at sea, the boat ran out of fuel and its passengers ran out 
of water before taking on other refugees from a smaller boat that had an 
abundance of both. After weathering a fierce storm, the boat finally landed at 
Malaysia, and the Nguyen family was immediately processed into a detention camp 
at its port of entry, where the family lived for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, they were transferred to a transit camp in Kuala Lampur for two months 
and from there emigrated to the United States in 1979, where they were 
sponsored by a family in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's father was eventually released in 1990 from his camp in Vietnam (the 
oldest brother escaped with the rest of the family), but the government refused 
to allow him to join his family in the United States. Finally, "he got a 
tourist visa to East Germany right about the time the Berlin Wall came down," 
Nguyen says, "and when he arrived there he crossed into West Berlin, went to 
the nearest American embassy there and applied for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I passed the bar, he was my first client. I was scared to death, because 
if I lost that case I didn't know what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who was graduated from Hastings Law School in San Francisco, won his 
father's case, and, when the family was reunited in the United States, Nguyen 
says he felt he was finally free to "work fully on behalf of refugees without 
worrying about retaliation against (my family) by the Vietnamese government." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's experience as a boat person and a refugee interned in a detention 
camp "is what I think drives him," says Van Tran, who works with Nguyen at 
LAVAS. "He's seen as very committed, a very bright attorney who has a deep 
concern for the welfare of the refugees -- his own people -- as well as the 
community welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lan is a person with a conscience, and that's what I find appealing about 
him. He doesn't forget his roots as a boat person. He's definitely one of the 
key members of the future generation of Vietnamese Americans in this community, 
and we can expect him to contribute more as the years go by." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lam, mayor pro tem of Westminster and the first Vietnamese American to be 
elected to a public office in the United States, called the amount of time that 
Nguyen spends in free legal work for refugees "amazing. He could be making a 
much better living at (his practice), but he spends so much time at LAVAS. I 
really credit him for that. He has a lot of passion and compassion. He's 
already earned the respect and affection of the community here." 
</P>
<P>
 The need for such advocacy, Nguyen says, is more urgent now than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The asylum-seekers, he says, would almost surely face persecution in Vietnam 
as political undesirables. And, he adds, because of a deadline agreed upon by 
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the U.N. member nations, 
the camps likely will close at the end of this year, and thousands of refugees 
may face forced repatriation to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger strikes in the camps in protest of the policy are common, he says. Some 
refugees, believing themselves beyond hope, have resorted to self-immolation, 
hanging or poisoning as a dramatization of their plight. 
</P>

 "Many of them would rather die than return to Vietnam," Nguyen says. "Legal 
abuse over there is so rampant. Under international law, they're no longer 
recognized as official refugees. It's an unfair rejection of their refugee 
status. So it's not really an immigration problem now; it's a human rights 
problem. That's where we come in." 
</P>
<P>
 The work often obliges Nguyen to confront massive and sometimes impenetrable 
bureaucracies. From the LAVAS office in Westminster (the national office is in 
Virginia), Nguyen and his staff are working on about 230 cases involving camp 
inmates in Asia who have relatives in Orange County. Local LAVAS office 
estimates of the total number of inmates in the Asian camps hover around 
50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially," Nguyen says, "we work on a specific person, but along the way 
we also engage in some (general) advocacy to some extent, speak out on the part 
of refugees and asylum-seekers." 
</P>
<P>
 The process most often begins, he says, when a relative or friend of someone 
in the camps brings a file of data collected about that person to the LAVAS 
office and asks for help in getting that person out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communications between here and the camps are difficult," Nguyen says, "and 
some people we can't contact at all. We have a case where we don't know what a 
person looks like, and we can't talk to them. We do what we can, though, and 
take their word on the basis of the papers they have, or talk to their 
relatives or associates here, people or activists who might be able to verify 
the information."  
</P>
<P>
 If Nguyen determines that a case has promise, appeals to grant refugee status 
for the asylum-seeker are filed either with a reviewing board in the country in 
which the camp is located, or with the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees, or with the U.S. State Department, depending on how far previous 
appeals have gotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they are granted refugee status, a lot of times we never see them again, 
since the United States may or may not be their No. 1 choice," Nguyen says. 
"They are seeking protection from persecution in Vietnam; they want to get out 
of the camp where they are now, and they will go anywhere they can get 
sponsored, any country that will accept them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is frustrating work because you have a situation where some country will 
take in the person and the relative will sponsor them, but the local country 
will refuse to let them go, refuse to process their papers, even refuse to let 
us talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The cases that Nguyen and his associates take on have already been rejected by 
one authority or another at least once. Their success record, however, is good. 
Hard percentages, listed by camp, don't accurately reflect that success, says 
Nguyen -- about 80% of the cases they take on in the camp in Hong Kong are won 
and about 45% in the Philippines camp -- because some authorities are easier to 
work with than others, and circumstances often vary by country. 
</P>
<P>
 To see for himself, Nguyen traveled at his own expense to the Philippine 
detention camp known as Palawan in 1992. Working with international volunteers 
there, he began processing cases from the day of his arrival, often working 
outdoors in stiflingly hot and humid weather. He says he found the camp 
conditions deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palawan is one of the best camps in the region," says Nguyen, "but the living 
conditions are still very difficult. Families live in a very small space: 12 
feet square for a family of three or four, with all the facilities there. They 
cook there, and much of the food is rotten. All communications with the outside 
world are censored. There's no work, and people have nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 To worsen matters, the U.N. high commission and the governments operating the 
camps "imposed things that made life difficult for them," Nguyen says. "They 
had been trying to implement what they called a voluntary repatriation program, 
but it didn't go well, so they made life difficult (in an attempt to force the 
refugees to return to their home countries). They cut out all information and 
material coming in or out of camp, cut out all overseas remittance from 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to tell them that it's against the U.N. Charter, that it's a human 
rights issue. We yell, keep up the fight as best we can and never give up. If 
we give up now, we lose." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Wednesday morning, and Nguyen is a half hour from leaving for Long 
Beach, where he is due in court. At the moment, however, he is wedged into a 
corner of a tiny studio at the offices of Little Saigon Radio and Television in 
Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 It is his weekly, morning call-in show from 9:30 to 10 on KWIZ (96.7 FM), 
during which he answers questions from listeners -- he usually gets about 20 
calls -- on matters legal. The show is conducted entirely in Vietnamese, and 
today's topic is how property taxes are assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be talking about how people can apply for a reduction on their 
property taxes," he says. "A lot of people don't know they can do that. Next 
week I'm going to talk about what to do if people get stopped for a DUI." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets no pay for the radio show, or for the 15-minute legal advice 
television spot he does for Little Saigon Radio and Television every other 
Tuesday at 6:10 p.m. on KRCA Channel 62. But the staff at the station says that 
in the approximately eight months since the shows began, his programs have 
become among the most popular in their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find his programs very, very educational," says co-worker Tran. "It's 
probably the first time, in a major way, that segments providing free legal 
advice by an accredited attorney are going on the air on a weekly basis. 
There's a great need for that in our community because we're very young; many 
of us are newly arrived, and we may be intimidated by the legal system here." 
</P>
<P>
 Diem Do, who hosts shows on Little Saigon Radio and Television that deal with 
youth and human rights issues, says he and Nguyen often exchange ideas about 
their programs and occasionally appear together. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many local Vietnamese people, Nguyen "came a long way," Do says. "He came 
with nothing, had lost everything, came to a strange land not knowing the 
language, being on the bottom of society, having to fight his way up. He has a 
lot of good ideas, and he's a man with a good heart. I think what he's been 
through helps him relate better to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen calls his time in the broadcast booth "very fun. And it makes me do 
research. I can't just get a lot of this stuff off the top of my head. It helps 
me learn." 
</P>
<P>
 That thirst for knowledge, and the passion to put it to use, drove Nguyen even 
before his arrival in Orange County, poor and with a limited command of 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the first acts on his arrival was to enroll at Garden Grove's 
Bolsa Grande High School, where he graduated in 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the camp," he says, "I always had a desire to become one of 
those people who helped. It's very emotional for a boat person to return to a 
camp and do that. During my time in the camp, my education was still in my 
mind. And when I was in law school, I did research in international law. The 
refugees were my major concern." 
</P>
<P>
 And likely will continue to be. Nguyen says that "the refugee situation won't 
be over by the end of the year. Even though they say they're closing the camps, 
there may be some people still there. So we'll continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nguyen will continue to divide his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's really intelligent," says Do, "and he could be really successful in 
his (private law practice), but he diverts his time and energy to so many other 
things. He's managed to find the time to do that. Money is not the only thing 
in his life. 
</P>
<P>

life." Profile: Lan Quoc Nguyen

3RD STREET'S GANG FIGHT CONTINUES; NEIGHBORHOOD: SANTA ANA'S TOUGHEST AREA 
ENJOYS THE RELATIVE CALM AFTER MASSIVE SWEEP -- BUT FEW EXPECT IT TO ENDURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The crack of gunfire is now rare on this battered stretch of 3rd Street, just 
blocks from the hub of county government. For the children, it is a novel calm, 
filled with the sounds of their laughter and roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
 But 72-year-old Ignacio Barrientos remains unconvinced that his neighborhood 
has become safe. "Here, one can't trust others. You walk in the street and see 
a little boy, but he pulls up his shirt and shows you he has a gun," Barrientos 
said. "Now it's calm, but it will start again. The violence will be the same, 
or worse." 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that police swept through the neighborhood at dawn on Sept. 7, 
armed with grand jury indictments, in a raid that resulted in 119 arrests, 
mostly for drug charges. By day's end, officials declared they had crippled 
Orange County's most vicious street gang. Even Gov. Pete Wilson made an 
election-season appearance to commend "Operation Roundup." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite authorities' efforts to intervene, the legacy of violence here has 
so shrunk people's dreams that their lives are still centered around protecting 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 An uneasy peace has settled over 3rd Street, but it is a respite from violence 
that few believe will endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be really hard to keep things calm," said Eleanor Martinez, who has 
twice buried relatives gunned down by gang bullets in as many years. "First of 
all, we would have to be a united neighborhood. But we're all afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the raid highlighted the troubles on 3rd Street, residents say 
conditions actually began to improve earlier this year with the arrest of some 
key members of the 6th Street gang, which has controlled the two-block stretch 
of 3rd Street between Flower and Baker streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, this street of mostly older bungalows, many with well-kept 
gardens full of roses and fruit trees, is no longer a clearinghouse for rock 
cocaine and heroin. Families have stopped sleeping on the floor for fear a 
random bullet will find them. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, roosters crow and Mexican music wafts from open windows as residents 
water their yards. Pushcart vendors peddle corn and Popsicles. But by sundown, 
the street is eerily deserted, the metal-grilled doors on almost every house 
locked tight. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of life along 3rd Street is about Martinez, who struggles to believe 
she has raised her children well, despite their troubles with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about the family of Imelda and Jesus, baffled by the court system and 
overwhelmed by the events that led to the recent arrests of their son and 
daughter on suspicion of selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is also the story of their grandson, George, who at 14 works a full 
seven-day week while attending middle school, in the hope of earning his way 
out of the barrio .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Barrientos has lived a life of internal exile in his 3rd Street 
apartment, strumming his guitar, studying the apocalyptic writings of the 
Jehovah's Witnesses and watching the late-night Spanish-language news before 
turning in alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When he did venture out, he collided with the violence: Two blocks from home, 
a group of men ambushed his car last year, threw him to the ground and stole 
all his papers and money, he said. When a young teen-age couple asked him 
sweetly for a ride, he welcomed them into his car and they mugged him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I do, I do in plain day, and I never leave on foot," said 
Barrientos, who always sports a smart short-brimmed hat. "I have thought that 
there might come a day when I have to leave the house at night, and I live in 
fear of that day." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, the diminutive man, nicknamed Nacho, came to Santa Ana from Mexico, 
leaving his home in the state of Guerrero. For eight years, he has managed a 
3rd Street apartment building for the nonprofit Civic Center Barrio Corp, which 
he helped found in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the security gate was installed, and during the months earlier this 
year when it was broken, Barrientos said as many as 40 or 50 youths would 
loiter under the carports, painting the walls with graffiti and blasting their 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who would go down and tell them to calm themselves was really risking 
something," he said. "One time I said to them, ' Hombre , please don't paint 
the wall.' And one told me, 'Shut up, because if you don't, you'll be gone.' 
It's sad, but it's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 On doctor's orders, Barrientos must walk daily, but he refuses to do so in his 
own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he grabs his cane and one of his four hats at 7 each morning, climbs 
into his brown Buick Century, and drives three miles to a park in another part 
of town. There, he walks briskly around the lake, with nothing more than the 
sound of sprinklers and the squawking of ducks to distract him. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Between November, 1993, and February of this year, police said, 6th Street 
gang members were linked to five fatal shootings and more than a dozen 
robberies. In a recent 10-month period, the two-block strip of 3rd Street 
generated 500 calls to police for help, said Santa Ana Lt. William Tegeler. 
</P>
<P>
 But since early this year, police have dealt a series of blows to the gang, 
which took over 3rd Street in 1989 after splintering from F-Troop, now an 
archrival that occupies territory north of Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of 6th Street's most violent members were arrested earlier this year. 
Then came the Sept. 7 raid, which culminated five months of undercover work. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-five people, six of them juveniles, were arrested on the street that 
day, most of them suspected of committing crimes in the 3rd Street area and 
some of them -- police will not say how many -- gang members. Others already in 
jail or prison were also charged. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference held to unveil the undercover operation, Santa Ana Police 
Chief Paul M. Walters said 6th Street has "become the most violent gang in the 
city and maybe the county." Added Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi: 
"The 6th Street gang has been busted in every sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents criticize the sweep as political theater, pointing out that 
many gang members were already in jail. Others claim that officers sometimes 
did not respond to calls for help when the neighborhood was suffering its worst 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealing had turned the area into a gathering place for users in search of 
quick cash. Rock cocaine addicts actually blockaded the street last year with 
old sofas and abandoned washing machines, brazenly robbing the occupants of 
cars passing through the neighborhood, according to several residents who 
watched from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighborhood just blocks from the Santa Ana police station and nearly in 
sight of the Orange County Courthouse and the County Jail, residents saw people 
they grew up with pressing guns to the temples of passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see someone walk up to someone else and put a gun to their head, to jump 
them, and you don't know whether to witness it or walk away," said 22-year-old 
Ruth Arreguin. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, gang members squatted in several empty houses on 3rd Street, 
turning one into a nightmare for the owner, who fled the neighborhood two years 
ago for Riverside. They plastered it with graffiti and blasted holes through 
the roof, the owner said. On an outside wall, they scrawled "Sixth Street 
Motel." 
</P>
<P>
 Once those houses were boarded up, the dealing moved west to the corner of 3rd 
and Baker streets, where police in hiding shot much of the videotape of frantic 
drug deals used as evidence for the Sept. 7 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, four members or friends of the gang were gunned down, the first 
deaths since 6th Street split off from F-Troop. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was a 13-year-old youth with a loud laugh who is now known by the 
martyrized jargon of his gang name: "Chucky Rest-in-Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The day he was shot while climbing on his bicycle to pedal home, Chucky had 
made a request that would be strikingly macabre for a child his age in nearly 
any other neighborhood: He wanted to be buried in his parents' native Mexican 
state of Michoacan, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, four graves are clustered close 
together, covered in cloth flowers and children's pinwheels that squeak in the 
afternoon breeze. Three hold the young men who fell to gunfire last year along 
with Chucky, their lives and deaths entwined in 3rd Street's warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest contains the body of Maria Corona, 27, a young mother caught in 
gang cross-fire this month six blocks from 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eleanor Martinez, Corona's funeral marked the second time in as many years 
that she has watched a relative laid to rest here. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserved and well-groomed woman has lived on 3rd Street for two decades 
and struggled to raise a good family. She and her husband even counsel troubled 
couples, convinced that strife at home drives children to the streets. But her 
own home seems only to attract more misfortune as time passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's nephew, Corona's widower, has been in and out of jail for years on 
drug-related charges. A spindly man with an elaborate tattoo of Christ and his 
crown of thorns on his bicep, Frank Gonzales Martinez last got out of jail only 
four months ago. Last week, he was hauled off to jail again, this time on a 
parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Martinez's son, Gilbert, whom she tried to tether to the house and 
shield from trouble, was shot in broad daylight at age 16 last year. Another 
son is an alleged member of the 6th Street gang and currently on probation, 
police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy, being a mother here," confides Martinez, whose living room is 
arranged like a shrine, filled with votive candles and religious images. Among 
them hangs a giant portrait of Gilbert, a handsome young man who stares 
disarmingly into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night she sits on her porch in a white quilted robe, a risk she 
would not have taken just months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the current lull in the violence and efforts to clean up 3rd 
Street, Eleanor Martinez doesn't believe the killing will stop. Maria's death 
has prompted her to buy two plots next to the cluster of graves, before they 
fill up with more of the neighborhood's young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trapped, with gang problems and drug addiction. These things are 
destroying everyone. All of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the sense of despair on 3rd Street as evident as at the home of 
Imelda and Jesus, a house that not long ago attracted 6th Street gang members, 
who lounged outside, dealing drugs and painting gang slogans on the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The tan dust of the front yard, where three junked cars are parked, bears the 
marks of Imelda's incessant sweeping. These days, she clutches one of her six 
brooms almost constantly, an attempt to bring order to a life plagued by new 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since two of her seven children, a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old 
daughter, were arrested in the Sept. 7 raid on first-time charges of selling 
crack cocaine, Imelda has broken down in regular sobs, hiding her face in the 
heavy black shawl that she rarely removes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some woman told me that I should just leave (the boy in jail) because he's 
malcriado, " Imelda cries, using the Spanish word for "ill-bred." "But I could 
never do that. Even if they raise a hand to me, even if my children kill me, 
then I will simply go to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Imelda has remained true to a regimented daily routine, rising at 
dawn to collect cans and bottles she turns in for cash. At 6:20 a.m. on Sunday, 
she emerges into the gray dawn dressed neatly in black stockings and a fresh 
shawl, and traces a circuitous route west to Our Lady of the Pillar Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always return a different way than I went," Imelda says, keeping an eye out 
for empty cans. "You never know who will be waiting to get you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For 3rd Street's youth, violence is a casual reality, more a part of daily 
life than school or play. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, 13-year-old Nancy and 9-year-old Salvador wrestle playfully 
outside in the driveway. "I'm a gangster, beating up a (newcomer)," Nancy 
squeals in jest. Recent immigrants suffer a disproportionate share of street 
attacks in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 For the older girls, who have all dated 6th Street gangsters, beatings are 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana, 19, another of Imelda and Jesus' daughters, went out with one gang member 
who is now serving 25 years to life in prison after a murder conviction. She 
split up with him before he landed in jail, but not before he punched her in 
the face and broke a tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Another girl, a 16-year-old, holds her 4-month-old baby boy in the air and 
recounts the beatings her ex-boyfriend inflicted on her. A 6th Street gang 
member picked up on drug charges in the Sept. 7 raid, he scraped her legs with 
knives in a regular ritual of domestic abuse. He once broke three bottles over 
her head, she said. One of them was full. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to beat me like I was a guy, like I was a Trooper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after she became pregnant, the 16-year-old decided to leave him 
and tossed his belongings out the door. But now she says she might take him 
back, if he decides to change, "so me and him and the baby can be together." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl rarely ventures outside with her baby, afraid that she will be jumped 
by rival gangsters while the child is in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, workmen nurse beers in the afternoon light and patch bullet 
holes in the front wall of the small house that was ransacked by gang members. 
Tortillas and tripe sizzle on a makeshift barbecue in its front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months, the 3rd Street neighborhood has clearly settled down. 
But neighbors speak uneasily about the cars they've seen cruising the 
neighborhood all week, full, they say, of rival F-Troop gangsters who are 
boasting of plans to fill the power void. Remaining 6th Street gang members, 
still a threatening presence to some, vow they will never allow that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on weekday mornings, women come out of their homes along 3rd Street, 
cautiously pushing strollers as they accompany their children to school in 
groups. The goal of the project, begun six months ago, is to bring the children 
to Carver Elementary School and back without assaults or harassment by drunks 
who hang out at a liquor store near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent patrol, organized with the help of the county-funded Project 
SABADO, also received training in safety techniques from police. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents still have a familiar fear: that gang members might mistake their 
activity for some attempt to challenge the gang's dominance, a step no one here 
is willing to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make a special emphasis that our sole purpose is walking the kids 
to school," said one mother, who fears that gang members might target her house 
if they misunderstand the group's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few remain hopeful that the next generation might escape the neighborhood's 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 George, 14, stocks shelves at the same market where Imelda's 13-year-old son 
worked before his arrest. As soon as school lets out, he races there and works 
a full eight-hour day. He also works on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to it," he said of the labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Late at night, his mother often hears him washing the dishes, listening to his 
radio and savoring an imagined solitude in the one-bedroom bungalow that is 
home to their family of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Friday, George wears a heavy cotton short-sleeve jersey with a wildly 
colored geometric print -- one of five he bought with the money he has earned. 
</P>
<P>
 George said he also bought two pairs of pants and a pair of sneakers, pooling 
the $95 a week he makes at the market with $200 he managed to save from helping 
his stepfather in a job now relegated to his little brother, 9-year-old 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 What he doesn't spend, he gives to his mother, Gina, another of Imelda and 
Jesus' daughters. One day, he tells her, when he's a lawyer "helping people," 
he'll buy her a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'm scared for them to grow. I just want them to stay like that," 
said Gina, a 33-year-old mother of six who has just started the first job of 
her life, working three hours a day as a playground monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if they grow, I don't want them to grow crooked. I want them to grow 
straight, straight up so they can be something. I do want my kids to be 
something in life." 
</P>

 The number of robberies in the area controlled by the 6th Street gang has 
increased since 1990, while the number of residential burglaries remained 
relatively constant. But not all these crimes can be attributed to gang 
members. Authorities say the number of reported crimes does not reflect the 
actual number committed, because victims fearful of gangs might not report 
them. 06,30,06,06,06,06,07 Reported crime 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994* Homicide 0

<P>
 After a long, frustrating day of negotiations with Haiti's military rulers 
last Saturday night, former President Jimmy Carter abruptly excused himself 
from a dinner with Haitian businessmen, closeted himself in his suite in 
Port-au-Prince's Villa Creole Hotel and typed for an hour on his laptop 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The page that he produced -- and handed to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras a few hours 
later -- became the first draft of what soon evolved into the American 
agreement with Haiti's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Carter did not clear his proposal with President Clinton; indeed, 
the White House did not even see it until the next morning, almost 12 hours 
after Carter gave it to Cedras. By then, the Haitian general had already 
accepted the document as the basis for an agreement, and it was too late for 
Clinton or his advisers in Washington to make major changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best we can get," Carter told Clinton late Sunday afternoon, 
shouting over a balky satellite telephone to the White House from a little 
office at Cedras' military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, 2,900 paratroopers of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division were 
already in the air, counting the minutes until the planned American invasion of 
Haiti. Offshore, Navy SEALS were standing by motorized black rubber rafts, 
ready to head for the beaches around Port-au-Prince. And at a secret location 
in the city, a team from the Army's secret Delta Force was already on the 
ground, poised to grab Carter and his fellow negotiators, retired Gen. Colin L. 
Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), and "extract" them from Cedras' headquarters 
by force if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's advisers were divided on what to do. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher complained that Carter's document was too loose, too favorable to 
Cedras. Vice President Al Gore, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and 
special adviser William H. Gray III said the wording was not as important as 
the reality that the pact would put Haiti under the control of 15,000 U.S. 
troops, without the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton hesitated, then told Carter: "Go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the agreement was signed, the arguments began again: Exactly what 
had been agreed to? Were Haiti's generals going into exile or not? Who would 
police Port-au-Prince's squalid streets? How long would the U.S. Army and 
Marine Corps stay? 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend's frenzied negotiations, which climaxed the Clinton 
Administration's long struggle over Haiti, also captured its essence. Committed 
to restoring democracy but uncertain how to do it, Clinton has lurched from one 
improvised strategy to another, from negotiations to sanctions to the brink of 
war and now U.S. military occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, his policy on Haiti has been unusually susceptible to the 
influence of strong-minded outsiders, from the CIA to the Congressional Black 
Caucus and, most recently, Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, based on interviews with Carter, Nunn and more than 30 other sources in 
Haiti and Washington, is the story of how Clinton decided to invade Haiti, how 
Carter engineered the agreement that averted war and how both sides began 
remaking the pact as soon as it was signed. I: Policy Reversal 
</P>
<P>
 Even before his election as President in 1992, Bill Clinton was out on a limb 
over Haiti. When Haiti's fiery, populist president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was 
overthrown in a military coup in 1991, then-President George Bush promised that 
the United States would work to "restore democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton asserted that Bush wasn't doing enough and denounced his policy of 
returning Haitian refugees to Port-au-Prince as "cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 "My Administration will stand up for democracy," Clinton promised. 
</P>
<P>
 His first decision was forced on him even before Inauguration Day. Emboldened 
by the new President's rhetoric, thousands of Haitians began building boats and 
preparing to sail to Florida. Bush warned the President-elect of impending 
disaster. Clinton reversed himself and ruefully announced that Bush's policy 
would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The new President was stung by reports that he had "flip-flopped." At one of 
the first meetings of his national security team, he blew up at a report that 
promised no real movement on Haiti. "It's just not good enough," he railed. "I 
want more progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Pezzullo, who later quit as his special negotiator in Haiti, observed 
that Clinton "had a sense that Haiti was a problem that he could solve and come 
away with a diplomatic victory. I thought it was naive. . . . Haiti is always 
more complicated than it looks. He didn't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration's first efforts had some success. Pezzullo told 
Cedras, the head of Haiti's military regime, that this President was serious 
about putting Aristide back in office. After American cajoling, the U.N. 
Security Council imposed an oil and arms embargo. Cedras and Aristide agreed to 
work on a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the wind-swept Coast Guard station at Governors Island in New York, they 
made a deal last year: Cedras would retire in four months with a grant of 
amnesty; Aristide would return; the Haitian armed forces would be retrained by 
a multinational force. It didn't work. The two sides quarreled over what the 
agreement meant. 
</P>
<P>
 And, only 10 days before the United States was scheduled to land its first 
large group of military trainers, U.S. Army Rangers were ambushed by guerrillas 
in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and 18 Americans were killed. Congress 
and the public went into an uproar over the Administration's visions of 
deploying U.S. peacekeeping troops around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 11, 1993, the tank landing ship Harlan County steamed into 
Port-au-Prince harbor carrying 218 military engineers and police trainers armed 
only with M-16 rifles. A group of the junta's thugs waited on the dock and 
created a fracas. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington didn't want to lose any lightly armed trainers to a mob. On Oct. 
12, the Harlan County sailed away. The message to Cedras, American officials 
later acknowledged, was all too clear: Clinton didn't care enough about Haiti 
to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, liberals in Congress were upset over the apparent drift in American 
policy and the practice of returning refugees to Haiti, despite grisly 
repression there. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson -- head of TransAfrica, an African American lobbying group, 
and a longtime acquaintance of National Security Adviser Lake -- launched a 
hunger strike, demanding that refugees be granted hearings. Lake called 
Robinson several times, and Clinton announced that he agreed with the protest 
of his own policies. 
</P>
<P>
 That produced a huge jump in the number of Haitians taking to the sea and sent 
the Administration scrambling to pressure Cedras from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tried a complete U.N. trade embargo, a ban on commercial airline 
flights, a freeze on assets of wealthy Haitians. But Cedras did not budge. 
Clinton sent more Navy ships into the Caribbean. But Cedras, remembering the 
Harlan County, was unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 31, the Security Council authorized the United States and its allies 
to use "all necessary means" to depose the military. Cedras did not believe the 
threat. When the United Nations sent an envoy to Haiti to try to set up talks, 
the general refused even to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That told Clinton that these people would not be moved," said Gray, the 
President's new special envoy. Further, he said, the State Department kept a 
stream of atrocity reports flowing to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 26, Clinton met secretly with his advisers and ordered preparations 
for an invasion of Haiti. Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch announced on 
Aug. 31 that U.S. forces were "going to Haiti" one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, events went on fast-forward. On Sept. 10, Clinton ordered Perry 
to plan for an invasion "as soon as possible." H-Hour was set for one minute 
after midnight Sept. 19. II: Call to Carter 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said they were ready for battle, but neither wanted to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's seemingly abrupt veer toward war caused near-panic in Congress. 
Polls found massive majorities opposed to invading Haiti. Clinton had been 
emotionally engaged in Haiti for months but, preoccupied by his domestic 
priorities, had never gone to the nation to build support for military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's leaders had their own doubts. All through July and August, a flurry of 
messages came to Washington through men who said they were acting for Cedras or 
his cohorts, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois. 
They sought meetings, negotiations, a deal. After months of dead ends, the 
Administration was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official later said, "Some of those overtures were more real than we 
judged them to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides had long agreed that they wanted to send a last-ditch 
envoy to Haiti to give the generals one last chance to back down. Now, with two 
U.S. aircraft carriers and dozens of other ships carrying thousands of troops 
to Haiti's shores, the question was: Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, dubious about the mission, suggested William L. Swing, U.S. 
ambassador to Haiti. But Cedras' wife, Yannick Prosper, had scornfully told an 
intermediary that her husband no longer wanted any messages from Swing. Lake 
and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were 
proposed and rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, five days before H-Hour, an alternative appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carter had returned from a trip to find a letter from Charles David, 
Cedras' foreign minister, asking him to mediate. Carter, as an observer at 
Aristide's election, had met Cedras in 1990. On Sept. 14, Carter asked a mutual 
acquaintance in Haiti to tell Cedras to call him if he was serious. In minutes, 
Cedras telephoned Carter's home in Plains, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dialogue is the only way to end the crisis," Cedras said, according to notes 
taken on an extension by Carter's wife, Rosalynn. "Clinton's solution is the 
worst of all possible ones." He warned that Aristide's return would touch off a 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's response was tough, the notes show. "I do not represent the U.S. 
government, but it is necessary for me to tell you the truth," he said. "An 
irrevocable decision has been made to invade Haiti unless you . . . are 
prepared to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras seemed taken aback. "As a Christian and a nationalistic Haitian, I will 
do everything possible to avoid any problem for my country," he said. "My long 
career has not prepared me for this situation. . . . How will history judge me 
if I depart and leave my fellow citizens to face death?" 
</P>
<P>
 They argued for more than an hour without resolution. But Cedras said he 
wanted to talk again. "I invited him to come to my Sunday School class, either 
to hear me or to teach it," Carter's notes recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter made a transcript of the notes and faxed it to the White House. Then he 
called Powell and Nunn. "They both were totally against the invasion," Carter 
said in an interview. "I asked both of them if they would be willing to go to 
Haiti with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter faxed a letter to Clinton proposing a Haiti mission; he followed up 
with a call. "He was equivocal about it," Carter said. "He was catching hell in 
the White House about the concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Clinton's top aides, including Christopher, were skeptical about 
Carter, who had irritated Christopher by trying to inject himself into 
sensitive Middle East negotiations and by acting as a free-lance negotiator 
with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Two factors turned the tide in Carter's favor: He already had a measure of 
Cedras' confidence and, if rejected for the job, he could go public and 
embarrass the Administration. Carter's decision to recruit Powell and Nunn 
helped too; officials expected the general and the senator to keep an eye on 
the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday evening, Sept. 15, Lake phoned Carter and told him to expect a 
call after Clinton made his televised speech explaining the reasons to invade. 
The speech was bellicose. "Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign of 
terror -- executing children, raping women, killing priests," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, watching, was distressed: Would the Haitians still want to negotiate? 
He sat by the phone, but it didn't ring. "Finally, we went to bed," Carter 
said. A little after 11:30, Clinton phoned, Carter recalled. "What he told me 
that night was: 'See if he will let you come down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carter phoned Cedras, who called back at 4:30 a.m. Friday to invite Carter, 
Nunn and Powell to come to Haiti the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Clinton and his advisers discussed Carter's instructions 
-- the detailed goals and limits that normally guide negotiators. But "this was 
an unusual situation," one official recalled. "President Carter was going as an 
unofficial person, and we wanted him to have as much flexibility as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton merely called Carter, Powell and Nunn to spell out three goals: to 
persuade the Haitian generals to step down, to get their agreement to a 
peaceful entry for U.S. forces and to get it done by noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no written instructions. III: Role-Playing 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, Carter, Powell and Nunn boarded a blue-and-white Boeing 
707 at Warner Robins Air Force Base near Atlanta. Although the three had never 
worked as a group before, aides said they seemed to mesh immediately on the 
three-hour flight to Port-au-Prince, working on the roles they would play. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was to maintain Cedras' confidence, be sympathetic to the Haitians' 
concerns and work out proposals to bridge gaps between their demands and what 
Washington wanted. "It was implicit from the start that Carter was to be first 
among equals," said a White House aide who was on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge to Powell, as one of the world's most admired military officers, 
was to appeal to the Haitians' sense of duty -- and, in a word that later 
became controversial, their honor. "Never mind whether we think they are 
honorable men," a senior official noted later. "The important thing in this 
context is that they think they are honorable men." Officials also hoped the 
Haitians might find it more palatable to hand over their swords to a Caribbean 
American (Powell's parents came from Jamaica) than to a white officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn's function was straightforward: to explain to the Haitians that Congress 
was not going to stop Clinton from invading their country, no matter how much 
noise members had made. "The Haitians were under a lot of illusions on that 
count," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's first task, they agreed, was simply to break through the 
Haitians' skepticism and convince them that the American forces they could see 
offshore were prepared to invade their country. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, they hoped to persuade Cedras and Biamby to step down -- but not 
to leave Haiti. Clinton and other American officials had said they wanted the 
generals out of Haiti. But in recent weeks, officials had concluded that U.S. 
troops would be better off with Cedras and Biamby in command than with the 
chaos of a headless opposition army. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Carter plane landed at 12:20 p.m., anti-American demonstrators, bused 
in by the regime, marched at the airport. The first meeting was dreary: a long 
session with a room full of pro-military Haitian politicians delivering 
harangues about U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:15, the three Americans were ushered into a conference room at military 
headquarters to meet the men they had come to see: Cedras, Biamby and seven 
others in the high command. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Americans' distress, this meeting was more of the same. When the 
delegation emerged and called the White House on their portable satellite 
telephone, their report was grim: We aren't getting far but will keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the invasion was moving inexorably toward H-Hour. Clinton was 
briefed in the Pentagon war room. His press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, solemnly 
read reporters a deliberately Churchillian quote, ostensibly from Clinton: "I 
will not be delayed. I will not be deterred." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, during a long dinner with leading Haitian businessmen, 
Carter seemed impatient. "What can you do to create conditions for 
reconciliation?" he asked them. "Not much," one replied. By dessert, Carter had 
excused himself and gone to his suite. 
</P>
<P>
 There he drafted the document that, with few significant changes, would become 
the seven-point accord on Haiti's future. Its essential elements: an "honorable 
retirement" for top officers in Haiti's armed forces; an agreement to cooperate 
with U.S. armed forces; a pledge to hold free, fair legislative elections. Any 
requirement that the generals go into exile was absent, as was any mention of 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 p.m., the phone rang: Cedras wanted another meeting. This time only 
Cedras and Biamby were there. The discussion was more cordial, with more 
give-and-take. Cedras, talking about his love of country, said he would be shot 
as a traitor if he tried to leave: "I'd rather be killed by an American bullet 
in my chest than a Haitian bullet in my back." 
</P>
<P>
 The key contribution came from Powell, who soberly told Cedras and Biamby 
about the firepower of U.S. forces poised to storm ashore: 20,000 well-armed 
troops to Haiti's poorly armed 5,000; more than 300 helicopters plus tanks, 
armored vehicles, close-support planes -- the fury of America's arsenal 
concentrated against a small, poor republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said the generals sagged visibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras was bewildered," Nunn said in an interview. "He said, 'Once you get 
all those troops on the ground, Haiti won't be the weakest country in the 
hemisphere anymore.' And he laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and the others were quietly elated. They had broken through the facade 
of defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after 2 in the morning. Carter had given the generals his draft accord, 
but a full discussion of it would have to wait until morning. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way out, Carter told Cedras that he wanted to meet the general's 
family. Cedras grimaced. "Yesterday was my 10-year-old son's birthday," Cedras 
said. "I love my family, and I'd like to see my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Creole Villa Hotel, Carter phoned his wife and recounted the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy, I'll give you some advice," she said. "Go see Gen. Cedras' wife." IV: 
A Wife Speaks 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras' home is no mansion by American standards. It's a sprawling, 
whitewashed suburban house with a handsome swimming pool behind high walls and 
tropical shrubs. Even in Petionville, the Beverly Hills of Port-au-Prince, it 
is overshadowed by more lavish neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Carter, Powell and Nunn arrived Sunday morning at 8:30, they noticed 
little about their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attention -- particularly Carter's -- was captured by imperious Yannick 
Prosper, Cedras' wife. "She was a good-looking woman, not beautiful, but very 
attractive . . . tough, competent, strong, determined," Carter recalled. U.S. 
intelligence reports described her as a Haitian Rasputin, a suspected drug 
abuser who had both her husband and Biamby under her thumb. Now she turned her 
charm -- and her intensity -- on the three Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People outside this country don't recognize the grandeur of Haiti," she said, 
as Carter recalled it. "They underestimate our pride and our motivation. We are 
the oldest black republic on Earth; Haitian slaves defeated the finest army 
that France could marshal. . . . (We may be) one of the poorest countries on 
Earth, but we have not lost our dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke of her father and grandfather, both generals in the Haitian army. 
Then she talked of her children, ages 17, 13 and 10. "Last night, when my 
husband didn't come home and we knew that the Americans were going to come in 
with waves of strength that we could not meet, we took an oath to give our 
lives," she said. The children had agreed, knowing their home would be one of 
the Americans' first targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never yield to foreign invaders," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell broke the silence. He said he understood what Mrs. Cedras meant by 
honor and integrity, why she felt an invasion of her land should be fought to 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the real duty of a general is to defend his nation and his people 
from destruction -- and that means knowing when a battle is not worth fighting. 
"It would not be a betrayal," he said, if her husband was to defend Haiti from 
harm by leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter spoke too, saying: "The greatest duty of a leader like your husband is 
not to give his life, not to go to war, but to work for peace. The decision to 
wage war, even if it means giving your life, is a simple decision. The decision 
to wage peace is more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour had gone by, Carter said. Mrs. Cedras was quiet. Then she 
looked at her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. President, I've got your written proposal," Cedras said, referring to the 
draft Carter had given him. "Let me meet with you at the headquarters and give 
you our response." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, believing the generals finally ready to negotiate, handed a copy of 
his draft to Larry Rossin, a White House aide with the delegation. Rossin 
immediately faxed it to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," Clinton groaned, as he read the agreement with aides in the Oval 
Office, said an official present. Carter's draft said nothing about Aristide's 
return, not even indirectly. It didn't seem to bind the generals to step down. 
It said the hard-won U.N. trade embargo would end "without delay." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, Carter, Powell and Nunn began meeting with Haiti's generals 
only 40 minutes before the noon deadline. Down the hall in the military 
headquarters, Rossin got on an open phone line to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, a former Time 
magazine correspondent, began drafting a new agreement. Too late, Carter said; 
the generals had agreed to use the first draft as a framework. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official in Haiti was struck by the realization that Carter was no 
longer acting as a Clinton emissary but "as a mediator, as a broker in the 
middle. He was negotiating with us on behalf of the Haitians as much as the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton focused on one big problem: The Carter draft committed the generals to 
step down once the Haitian Parliament passed a "general amnesty." The President 
interrogated his aides: Could the generals use this to stall and stay in 
office? 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be OK if a date certain could be added" for the generals to step 
down, said Christopher, a longtime Los Angeles lawyer. Clinton said the 
deadline had to be no later than Oct. 15. Christopher, using a secretary's 
telephone outside the Oval Office, told Rossin to tell Carter that the 
President insisted on a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, the generals now were unhappy. Giving Cedras the deadline, 
Carter said, "was an insult. He was willing for the Parliament of Haiti to 
determine when he left . . . by passing the amnesty. But he wasn't willing for 
me to do it." Biamby told Powell that he would commit suicide rather than 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave Carter a three-hour extension of the deadline. The arguing went 
back and forth for that long and longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at 1 p.m., Shalikashvili, after checking with Clinton, had ordered 
the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, N.C., to board planes for Haiti. The 
invasion was still scheduled for one minute after midnight, and "I frankly had 
come to the conclusion that we were not going to reach an agreement," Clinton 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5 p.m. in Port-au-Prince, Biamby burst into the conference room, 
shouting: "You men have tricked us! You've been here talking about peace . . . 
and I've just been informed from Ft. Bragg that paratroopers are on their way 
to invade our country." 
</P>
<P>
 (Haitian officials later said Biamby had been tipped off by a Haitian American 
serviceman at Ft. Bragg.) 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby charged that Carter's talks had been nothing but a ruse. He announced 
that he was taking Cedras to a command post to begin directing Haiti's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would later assert that dispatching the 82nd was the decision that 
pushed the talks to success, but Carter disagrees. At that moment, Carter said, 
"We knew we had failed." Nunn agreed: "We thought we had lost it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, desperate, launched a last emotional appeal, beginning with the 
Haitians' own complaints that the embargo was causing malnutrition and disease 
among children. "If I go back home and we give up this effort for peace, what's 
going to happen to your children?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he turned to Cedras. "I had respected you for your integrity and 
unselfishness," he said. "But here, in order to stay in Haiti a few more weeks, 
you're willing to sacrifice the well-being of your own people and the lives of 
many Haitians and, perhaps, Americans. And the children that you claim you love 
quite often will not live." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras suggested that they talk to Emile Jonassaint, 81, the interim president 
whom he had installed after Aristide's ouster. At 5:30, the Americans and the 
Haitian generals drove to the Presidential Palace. According to some Haitian 
officers, Cedras already knew that Jonassaint would bless the accord -- 
including the Oct. 15 deadline -- and take responsibility for signing it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter thought he would turn it down. "You have 30 more minutes," Clinton 
had warned, "and then I will have to order you to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonassaint, imposing with white hair and huge, expressive hands, listened 
gravely and announced his decision: "We will take peace instead of war. I will 
sign this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, one of the U.S. aides had found a usable phone and dialed the 
White House direct. Clinton and his advisers were in a near-panic; Carter and 
his party had been out of touch for half an hour, and the invasion force was on 
its way. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Clinton was having second thoughts. Talbott asked if it was too late 
to add a clearer reference to the U.N. resolution calling for Aristide's 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter lost his temper briefly. Powell brought the process back under control. 
"Let's not get lost in the details," he told Clinton, an aide recalled. "The 
important thing is that you will have 15,000 troops on the ground. You will 
control what happens on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 By about 7, the deal was ready. Clinton asked each of his advisers once more 
if there was any reason not to accept it. "There's no choice," said Gray. "We 
can worry about the details tomorrow." At 7:45, Clinton gave his approval. The 
61 transport planes carrying the 82nd Airborne turned around in midair. Carter, 
Powell and Nunn headed home; Powell ordered rum and Cokes all around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective . . . has been to make sure that the military dictators leave 
power and that the democratically elected government is returned," Clinton said 
on television two hours later. "This agreement guarantees both those 
objectives." V: Bitter Reception 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Aristide was not happy. The elected president of Haiti, joined 
by Lake and Gray, glumly watched Clinton's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like this agreement," Aristide said, according to Gray. "I understand 
what the President had to do, but I don't quite agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was unhappy that the accord did not explicitly promise that he would 
be restored to power; he was upset that it seemed to let the generals remain in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all issues that are subject to interpretation," Gray lobbied 
Aristide. "And we'll have 15,000 troops on the ground -- so our interpretation 
will carry some weight." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Aristide finally issued a statement 36 hours later, it did not 
mention the United States at all. Not until Wednesday, two days after U.S. 
troops began taking control of Port-au-Prince, did he say "Thank you" -- at a 
Pentagon ceremony where he received a 21-gun salute. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, Cedras was not happy. Like Aristide, he watched Clinton's televised 
speech Sunday night and did not like what he heard. Only hours after he 
assented to Carter's agreement as a man of honor, Clinton was again denouncing 
him as a "military dictator." 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton announced that the 15,000-strong force was about to enter Haiti 
"immediately," whereas Cedras thought the issue was still to be worked out. 
Cedras called Carter's assistant, Robert Pastor, who had stayed behind in 
Port-au-Prince. The accord was "breaking down," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Carter was not happy. The rhetoric from Clinton's aides 
was infuriating the Haitian generals and threatening to wreck his deal. Carter 
telephoned the Cable News Network and asked to be interviewed. Without telling 
Clinton or anyone on the White House staff, he left the mansion at 6:30 a.m., 
went to CNN's Washington studio and gave his startling version of the talks: 
that Haiti's generals had acted in accord with their sense of honor and 
dignity, that Clinton's decision to put the 82nd Airborne in the air had nearly 
blocked a deal and that nothing in the agreement required the generals to leave 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Congress was not happy. The invasion had been averted, but 
had the concessions been too great? Briefing leading senators and members of 
Congress, Carter was asked why he did not make it explicit that Cedras must 
leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 His response: Forcing the general to leave his country would be a violation of 
his human rights. "Give me a break," moaned Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.). 
</P>
<P>
 But in Port-au-Prince's streets, Powell was being proven right. By week's end, 
more than 10,000 American troops were in Haiti, patrolling towns, delivering 
supplies and bringing the army and police under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cooperation has been superb," said Brig. Gen. Richard Potter, commander 
of the Army Special Forces unit that seized the Haitian army's heavy weapons. 
"But what choice do they have?" 
</P>
<P>

Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this report.

AMERICA AS DISNEY'S LAND: THE FANTASY VS. THE REALITY; CULTURE: A NATION 
MIRRORED BY THE COMPANY'S CREATIONS RE-EXAMINES THE IMAGE REFLECTED IN ITS 
CORPORATE AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The upstairs bedroom that belongs to 8-year-old Kelly Urso is a veritable 
shrine to "101 Dalmatians." She has the bedspread, the pajamas, the notebook, 
the lunch box. So in love is she with the Walt Disney Co.'s animated spotted 
dog that her dad plunked down $150 for a real one. 
</P>
<P>
 But downstairs, in the basement that belongs to Kelly's 39-year-old father, is 
a bunker recently converted to run the Walt Disney Co. out of the state of 
Virginia. Tony Urso is installing a second phone line, buying a second computer 
in his escalating war to stop Disney from building its fifth theme park next to 
his hometown of Haymarket. He traded the beloved Washington Redskins vanity 
plates on his blue Bronco for a set that says NO DZNEY. Kelly and her sister 
had to see "The Lion King" with their grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 The split loyalties that manage to peacefully coexist in the Urso household 
are not unlike the ones that have lately left the country confused and divided 
over Disney. As this entertainment giant sets out to define America in a 
3,000-acre theme park, so does the nation struggle to define a company with a 
cultural impact so profound that Mickey Mouse is a symbol for America abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, the Walt Disney Co. has helped rear two generations of 
Americans in the past 50 years, influencing everything from our moral code to 
the way we stand in line at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But do we love 'em or do we hate 'em? Is Disney the genius creator of "Beauty 
and the Beast" or a big-footed, money-grubbing developer? We subscribe to the 
Disney Channel as one of the few things on television a parent can trust, only 
to blast the company for a worldview so sugarcoated it makes one's teeth ache. 
We affectionately dub its creator "Uncle Walt," only to read in a controversial 
biography that he was really a booze-addled anti-Semite in cahoots with the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drives you nuts," said Karal Ann Marling, professor of American studies 
and art history at the University of Minnesota, where she teaches an annual 
course on Disney. "On the one hand, this company is part of the fiber of who we 
are. On the other hand, it's a company, and we don't like them when they act 
like one." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Disney developers want to put Disney's America -- a $650-million tribute 
to the nation's history -- smack in the cradle of democracy, and our 
ambivalence is bubbling up all over. Even as some of the country's most revered 
historians warn that Disney will "vulgarize history," Northern Virginia 
businesses are hanging out banners proclaiming "We Love Mickey." When it comes 
to Disney, America can't seem to make up its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1955 and the Walt Disney Co. was on the verge of setting off a cultural 
revolution. "Davy Crockett," the frontier television show starring Fess Parker, 
was a baby-boomer smash, and Disney decided it might be profitable to slap the 
Crockett image on lunch pails, pencil boxes and various other kid equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ran out of fur for coonskin caps. No craze had ever made so much money 
to that point in time, something like $300 million," said Margaret King, a 
cultural historian retained by the Walt Disney Co. to assess the company's 
cultural impact. "It was the first time marketers realized that children could 
influence the way their parents spend money." 
</P>
<P>
 That was neither the first nor the last time that Disney would fundamentally 
alter what it meant to be a child growing up in America. It is impossible to 
measure an average child's exposure to Disney in a day. From home videos to 
classroom instructional films to shopping mall outlets, the corporate presence 
is overwhelming and pervasive: Disney lays claim to the No. 1 box office hit of 
the summer ("The Lion King"); the No. 1 Broadway show ("Beauty and the Beast"); 
the No. 1 network TV series ("Home Improvement"); the No. 1 music album ("Lion 
King" soundtrack). 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has influenced American culture in more ways than most of us realize -- 
or care to acknowledge. If the space program gave us Teflon, the Walt Disney 
Co. gave us the twisting "switch-back" lines we stand in at the bank and 
springy asphalt that keeps the feet from tiring. The monorail at the Houston 
airport is modeled after the one at Disneyland. The Victorian architecture of 
the redeveloped downtown in Medina, Ohio, is said to have been inspired by 
Disneyland's Main Street USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost anybody who knows about urban development, restoration and design has 
been to Disneyland or Disney World," said Richard Francaviglia, director of the 
Center for Southwestern Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington, who 
has written extensively about the Disney influence on American towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of Disney moralizing has to some degree shaped American minds. Some 
experts suggest that it was the Disney nature films of the 1950s that gave rise 
to the ecology movement a decade later; that it was the anti-war message in 
Disney movies (one character in the middle of an Alamo battle notes that war is 
"the most untheatrical method of suicide") that planted the seeds for 
demonstrations against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those (Disney) experiences shaped those of us who were at Woodstock," Marling 
said. "I can't imagine the Vietnam War protests in some ways without all of us 
having sat around watching 'The Walt Disney Show.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With this resume of goodness and success, Disney officials expected to be 
roundly cheered when they announced they would pay homage to America with 
"virtual reality" re-enactments of Civil War combat and other epic events, not 
to mention a 27-hole golf course, 2,300 homes, 1.9 million square feet of shops 
and businesses -- all of which would entice 6.3 million tourists to pour an 
estimated $48 million a year into the Virginia state treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials expected resistance from no-growth residents opposed to 
Bermuda-shorted and fanny-packed hordes invading their pretty countryside. They 
were not surprised when amateur astronomers grumbled that Disney lights would 
mess up their view of the skies. But never did they anticipate that what began 
as a local land-use dispute would explode into a national "referendum on 
Disney," as CEO Michael Eisner put it. The company was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to be dumbstruck that the critical pencils have been so sharpened 
before we've done anything. This is very early in the design process," said 
Mark Pacala, general manager of Disney's America. "We are not just Mickey Mouse 
animators. We are a much richer, more contextual company than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom have the plans of a single company attracted such international 
scrutiny. The mayor of Haymarket, population 483, found himself being 
interviewed by the BBC. Countless editorials and opinion pieces have warned 
that Disney will "plasticize . . . sentimentalize . . . sanitize" American 
history, some authored by historians who concede they have never once set foot 
in a Disney park. 
</P>
<P>
 The great debate went all the way to Congress, where this summer a Senate 
panel heard testimony on the virtues and vices of Disney. Is Disney worthy of 
countryside so pristine George Washington might still recognize it? Will 
Disney's synthetic version of history just four miles from the sacred site of 
two Civil War battles ruin the real thing? Can Disney be trusted to honestly 
interpret America's sometimes shameful past? 
</P>
<P>
 "EEEK A Mouse! Step on It!" a Washington Post headline shrieked as some of the 
nation's most revered historians -- David McCullough and Shelby Foote -- allied 
with the landed gentry who live out there -- Robert Duvall, Willard Scott -- to 
turn back Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The frenzy was fueled when a Disney executive predicted a park exhibit that 
would "make you feel what it was like to be a slave." Eisner later recanted the 
notion, but not before critics went wild over the idea of human bondage as seen 
through the eyes of Mickey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have no objection to kids learning what a frontier village looked 
like. I might want to go myself," said William Styron, who won the Pulitzer 
Prize in 1968 for his novel about slavery, "The Confessions of Nat Turner." 
"But trying to deal with the fundamental horrors of American history -- with 
250 years of slavery -- in an amusement park? It's ludicrous. They can't do it. 
No one can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some academics point to the company's film legacy as evidence that Disney is 
capable of treating history in ways that are "not all sweetness and light." In 
"Tonka," a 1958 account of Custer's last stand, at the Little Bighorn, the 
Sioux are the good guys and Custer is an "untrustworthy, racist, lunatic, glory 
hunter." In "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," a Cold War-era film in which an 
ultimate-weapon submarine ultimately destroys itself and everyone else -- is 
regarded by many critics as an early argument against the nuclear arms race. 
Even Disney's portrayal of women has become more socially correct, experts 
argue, with a love-struck Snow White yielding to an ambitious, aspiring 
archeologist named Ariel in "The Little Mermaid." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Disney's defenders are quick to note that when one mentions the Walt 
Disney Co., "Tonka" -- later retitled "A Horse Named Comanche" -- is not 
exactly the first thing that comes to mind. Mickey Mouse's public image may be 
well intact, but the corporation is at a crossroads, experts say, and the 
battle in northern Virginia is proof of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney is our national storyteller, the primary cultural 'imprinter' of what 
it means for children to be American," said Jamie O'Boyle, a Philadelphia-based 
cultural analyst who has spent years studying Disney. "But if they come in and 
act like a hard-boiled, profit-minded, bottom-line company, we are going to 
treat them accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kapp, the mayor of Haymarket, answers the door in his stocking feet. He 
runs a busy wallpaper business, but always finds time to talk Disney, the 
biggest thing to happen in Haymarket, he says, since Union troops sacked it in 
the Civil War. If this town didn't already exist, Disney might have invented 
it. Haymarket has two dentists, one doctor, one bank, two beauty shops, two 
full-time police officers and 95 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks for all the world like Mayberry, but it isn't. The town cannot afford 
public water; the residents get theirs from eight wells, four of which were 
declared contaminated when they were tested three summers ago. People don't 
know each other all that well anymore, so much of their time is spent on the 
road commuting to jobs somewhere bigger. The recession hit Haymarket hard; 
Gossam's Hardware Store, which grossed $1 million in 1989, brought in just 
$383,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonder I'm sane. This place is a desert," hardware store owner Tim 
Everett grumbles in his store one afternoon beneath a mounted deer's head, a 
hunting cap stuck irreverently on its antlers. "Every time a business leaves, 
nothing comes in to replace it." 
</P>
<P>
 If Disney builds its park across the road, Haymarket gets water. The 
beleaguered roads that lead to and through it get rebuilt. There will be a 
summer job for Mayor Kapp's teen-age granddaughter and a tax windfall for 
Prince William County, where schools are so crowded some children are learning 
in trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the face Disney loves to show, the economic messiah it longs to be. 
Already the company is working hard at being a good neighbor, setting up its 
neat headquarters in what used to be the telephone company and donating $1,000 
to the LaFayette Day celebration. Some people in Haymarket are virtually 
blushing from all the attention. "Zippity Doo Dah!" a local paper squealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are still some 70 permits to secure, the project last week won 
the blessings of the Prince William County Planning Commission and is almost 
certain to get county supervisors' approval in October. 
</P>
<P>
 But as ever, there is a flip side to this success-in-the-making story, one 
that spotlights Disney's least flattering face -- corporate, the side that made 
$8.5 billion in revenue last year, the side that once paid its CEO $203 
million, the side, critics say, that has behaved more like a ruthless company 
than the American institution it is supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials bought the options on the Virginia land in secret, retained 
one of state's most influential law firms and hired powerful lobbyists, one of 
them former Jimmy Carter press secretary Jody Powell, to steer their project 
through the state Legislature. They waited until the last possible day to ask 
the Legislature for an unprecedented $163 million in road improvement bonds, 
then threatened to walk away unless they got what they wanted. They got it. Not 
since the National Rifle Assn. has an organization lobbied the state capital as 
hard as Disney has, angry critics charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If an oil company practiced such strategy, it might be called savvy. But 
Disney, which has moralized for half a century about virtue and fair play, is 
held by the public to a different standard. Glimpsing Disney in a real estate 
deal is a little like watching Mother Teresa play the slots. There's nothing 
illegal about it, it just doesn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Disney were a country, it would be Israel," cultural historian King said. 
"Their reputation is almost a burden. There are things they cannot do with 
impunity that other companies can." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally infuriating to opponents, however, is a sort of corporate arrogance 
that has haunted Disney from Long Beach to France. "We have the right to 
build," Eisner and other executives insist again and again of the Virginia 
plan. They dismiss as "cheap-shotness" any criticism of the park's rides and 
attractions, of what Disney might do with the subject of slavery, "until the 
day the gates open in 1998." 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to envision such words coming from the lips of Walt Disney, 
experts say, a man who used television to inform the nation of Disneyland's 
long construction. By the end, the citizens felt like stockholders, Disneyland 
was theirs, they had seen its birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate Disney today might do well to spend a little more time thinking the 
way Walt did, several experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Disney defending the (Virginia) park, they are defensive and not very 
forthcoming, which is really silly," Marling said. "I don't think Walt would 
have asked the people to just trust him. Walt would have explained. They are 
part of the fabric of our lives. It's time they acted that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials vigorously disagree. The corporation is "revered, loved and 
admired throughout the entire world," according to Pacala. They say Disney has 
behaved admirably in Virginia, pointing to several concessions already made to 
appease a worried community by expanding wooded areas, banning diesel engines 
at the park, even floating balloons to make sure that the tallest of the 
planned structures could not be seen from the tranquil countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning the public seems harder lately. Disney's proposed park near the 
Queen Mary in Long Beach was scrapped in recent years after environmentalists 
and residents revolted. A small but vocal group of Anaheim homeowners has been 
protesting the noise and traffic that would result from a proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort project. Protesters in turtle suits picketed the company's 
annual stockholders' meeting in Florida last year in opposition to further 
development in the habitat of the endangered gopher tortoise around Disney 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that Disney has come under public fire in its long 
history. Before World War II, British censors banned "Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs" as too violent and forbade anyone under 17 from seeing it. (The ban was 
lifted after a public outcry.) Film critics initially decided the classic 
"Fantasia" was a big bomb. Hippies stormed Disneyland's Tom Sawyer's Island in 
1970 in an anti-Establishment protest, stripped naked and smoked pot, according 
to O'Boyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They recognized Disneyland, correctly, as a metaphor for America," O'Boyle 
said, suggesting that one reason we can't make up our minds about Disney is 
because Disney is us. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like spotting the wires in a magic act. When we look too closely, we 
don't like what we see -- a Fortune 500 company lurking behind a lovable 
cartoon mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney is so closely tied in with a national psyche of who we are, the things 
we like about ourselves, that we don't like the idea there's a corporation 
behind it," O'Boyle said. "As much as anything, this is about us." It Started 
with a Mouse 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mickey Mouse made his debut as "Steamboat Willie" in a 1928 cartoon, the 
Walt Disney Co.'s creations have become an integral part of American and world 
culture. Theme parks, a chain of specialty stores, movie studios and a cable 
television channel all have spun off from the big-eared icon with red knee 
britches and white gloves. Some of the points made by Disney boosters and 
critics: 
</P>
<P>
 Movies and Television 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nature movies encourage an interest in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Television programs and films celebrate fairness, self-reliance and sense of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nature films demystify the wilderness by personalizing animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Historical programs foster "good guys" and heroic traits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Movies humanize animals, giving a distorted view. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simple stories simply told lack depth and diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Evil element" of a story is there only so the good side can eventually 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 * Historical accounts are sanitized, sometimes to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme Parks 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: 
</P>
<P>
 * Millions of people entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parks are economic engines directly providing jobs and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rides geared to heighten fears, challenge rider to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Parks predicated on using automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy traffic contributes pollution, wears down infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Urban sprawl outside gates is sometimes ugly, overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Host communities said to be co-opted and succumb to Disney power, often at 
local expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: 
</P>
<P>
 * The ultimate one-stop shop for everything Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merchandise does not promote or glorify violence or war. 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Customers pay a steep price for merchandise bearing a Disney image. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keyed to desires of children, who have no sense of restraint.

PROP. 187'S SUPPORT SHOWS NO BOUNDARIES

 At least part of Veronica Rodriguez's attraction to Proposition 187, the 
sweeping November initiative that would deny basic services to illegal 
immigrants, can be traced to the Mexican license plates at her community 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 A working student in the Imperial County farm town of Holtville, Rodriguez 
says she was turned down for educational aid because she earned too much. Now, 
the 21-year-old daughter of legal immigrant farm workers smolders when she sees 
cars bearing Mexican plates in the parking lot and lines of people collecting 
aid checks at the campus. Many immigrants, she suspects, are getting assistance 
they should not. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno resident Vanessa Quintero also is tilting toward a vote for Proposition 
187, grasping for something that will help arrest the crowding and 
deterioration in the heavily Latino neighborhood where she bought a home five 
years back. Fueling her frustration, she says, is the stream of 
Spanish-speakers seeking directions to the welfare office half a block away, 
some explaining they recently arrived from Mexico and don't know the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a heart. I am human," said Quintero, a tax examiner who once worked in 
the Central Valley's farm fields. "But each time I walk out my door, I think: 
'Oh boy. Something has got to be done about this problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the California heartland, in Los Angeles, a self-described "very 
liberal" Democrat who helps run a theater troupe that performs for thousands of 
underprivileged children has reached a similar conclusion. Although she says 
she's convinced illegal immigrants contribute more to the state than they use 
in services, she is supporting Proposition 187 on what she calls ethical 
grounds. "Entering the country illegally by definition is breaking the law," 
said the Westside woman, who, like many pro-187 liberals and Latinos, preferred 
not to be named. "To reward people for that with health (services) and public 
education is just ethically wrong. . . . The law has to mean something." 
</P>
<P>
 As Election Day nears, an unusually broad consensus of support has emerged for 
Proposition 187 -- one that transcends conventional political wisdom and 
typical electoral alignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Large numbers of liberal, Latino and Democratic voters of all stripes -- those 
who normally could be expected to forge the core opposition to such a measure 
-- are embracing one of the harshest immigration reform schemes ever placed on 
the ballot, polls show. 
</P>
<P>
 Veering sharply from the path of their ostensible political leaders, who warn 
that Proposition 187 panders to prejudice and will be a financial and social 
calamity, these voters appear ready to fall in with California's latest 
benchmark political revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a situation where there's been a disconnect between the political 
elite and just rank-and-file Americans," said former UCLA political science 
professor Peter Skerry, author of "Mexican Americans: The Ambivalent Minority." 
"The dam has broken and people feel they can express these feelings that kind 
of pent up." 
</P>
<P>
 How deep the tide of support will remain by Election Day is unclear. Voter 
attention -- and the campaign against the initiative -- is only beginning to 
fix on the hard details of the measure. And uneasiness could grow as voters 
weigh the measure's practical implications, including denial of public 
schooling and routine medical care to hundreds of thousands of illegal 
immigrants already living in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the breadth of current backing for the measure is remarkable, 
experts say. Most Republican, Democratic and independent voters favor it, a 
recent Times Poll found. So do whites and Latinos, moderates and conservatives, 
and people from all age groups, income and education levels. Even liberal 
voters are evenly divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters -- particularly in less predictable liberal and minority pockets 
of support -- are latching on to the simple power of the initiative's message. 
Dozens of interviews with voters, poll respondents, Democratic Party activists, 
neighborhood leaders and political analysts indicate that Proposition 187 is 
resonating through deeply embedded, often personal and anecdotal, voter 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 People speak of a sense of order diminished and of control lost. They see 
undisciplined, profligate government programs failing to address glaring 
problems of homelessness and troubled schools, even as they extend more 
services to illegal newcomers. Threading through it all are discomforting 
changes many have witnessed in their town, at their school, in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find (support for the initiative) in strange places where you wouldn't 
necessarily expect to find it," said Bill Christopher, the head of a large 
coalition of Los Angeles homeowner and neighborhood watch groups, which 
recently held a highly charged, sharply divided discussion of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a lot of people out there just flailing away (on an) issue that 
needs to be addressed. It's a manifestation of everybody's desire to get a 
handle on the issue. . . . But no one's quite sure the best way to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of the measure is palpable in places like the Evergreen Senior 
Center in Boyle Heights east of Downtown Los Angeles. Gathered for bingo on a 
recent afternoon, many of the older Latino homeowners -- mostly Democrats who 
vote regularly -- sharply criticized illegal immigrants they say are crowding 
their communities and taking advantage of tax-supported programs for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several viewed Proposition 187 as discriminatory, chiefly targeted at 
Mexicans, and a political ploy designed to boost the reelection chances of 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who has endorsed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But others -- on condition that their names not be used -- said they are fed 
up and planning to vote for the measure. "(My family) never asked for welfare. 
Not once," said a 75-year-old Latina who has lived on the Eastside much of her 
life. "I see some people demanding things they shouldn't demand. I'm against 
all those girls coming over here (to have children) so they can get a check, 
free (food) stamps, medical and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 An 81-year-old Mexican American retiree, who prides himself on reading the 
paper daily and keeping abreast of the Proposition 187 debate, said cutting off 
services would be tough. But he said it may be the only solution to what he 
insists is a drain on public services by undocumented new arrivals. "I support 
the idea. You've got to put a stop to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Dora Hernandez, a Boyle Heights legal secretary and longtime 
resident, is still uncertain which way to go. Although she is uncomfortable 
with the "racial bashing" she senses is inherent in the measure, the longtime 
registered Democrat complained: "I abhor what (illegal immigrants) have done to 
my neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments -- and a recent Times Poll finding Proposition 187 is favored 
52% to 42% by Latino registered voters -- are no surprise to Armando Garcia, a 
Catholic brother who grew up on the Eastside. Today he runs a nonprofit parent 
education program for immigrants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many pochos -- a critical term for Latinos who have lived here many 
years and become more Americanized -- complain to him about their new 
neighbors. "(They say) they play their music too loud, they throw trash around 
. . . they have clothes hanging, they take the shopping carts out of Ralphs," 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great disdain (for) what I call the culture of poverty. It's 
entangling the Anglo community, but more so the pocho community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This vast accumulation of aggravations over large economic issues and 
day-to-day community problems extends far beyond the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Dones, a computer firm manager and mother of three in the East Bay 
community of Fremont, is leaning toward supporting the measure, even as she 
worries about its severest provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A liberal Democrat, Dones struggled to explain what is drawing her to a 
measure she by no means is entirely comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's any one thing. It's a lot of little things that can add up 
to be (a) major problem," she said. She described a longtime kindergarten 
teacher in her child's school, who was reassigned because a bilingual teacher 
was needed for the growing numbers of Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had 25 years experience. She was caring, loving. You just look at a 
situation like that and say: Wait a minute! You're taking good people out of 
their jobs for the wrong reasons." She later acknowledged that many of the 
Spanish-speaking students could have been legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said illegal immigrants are straining the school system at a 
time when teachers do not get raises and schools cannot afford modern 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, the people in office don't do a lot of long-term planning," 
she said. "(Then) it seems like we're kind of faced with an all-or-nothing 
choice. This may not be the right thing to begin with. But hopefully if we take 
a harder line, they'll figure out what's right and not right to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to auto insurance rate rollbacks and other voter-approved measures 
that have been buried in court battles or watered down, some liberals seem 
willing to gamble that the toughest elements of Proposition 187 won't survive. 
The measure is squarely at odds with a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that 
undocumented children are entitled to public education, although supporters 
hope to challenge the decision if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think kids would be denied school," said Mayo C. Williams Jr., an 
electrical contractor who lives in Los Angeles' Windsor Village area. "But I 
think it would send a lesson back to those thinking about coming to this 
country that it's not as easy as it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a Democrat who said he normally votes for liberal causes and 
candidates, says he's seen illegal immigration help drain money from his small 
business. Competing contractors who use undocumented labor can pay lower wages 
and underbid him, he said. "They'll come in and work for less than minimum 
wage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cultural clashes, competition for jobs, school programs and 
affordable housing seems to be fueling some of the support for Proposition 187 
in urban minority communities, where many illegal immigrants have settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fair-minded. But we're so close to one another here we can smell one 
another's breath," said Lois Medlock, a longtime neighborhood activist in a 
once predominantly black South-Central Los Angeles community that now is 
heavily Latino. Medlock's Southeast Central Homeowners Assn., made up of more 
than 100 black property owners, recently endorsed Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Friction has been building in her area over everything from expansion of 
bilingual education in neighborhood schools to immigrants who raise chickens in 
their yards, she said. "We need to stop somewhere . . . " she said. "I'm not 
mad at them. I'm mad at this government." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Charon, a liberal-leaning Democrat and neighborhood watch leader in 
the Los Feliz and Hollywood areas, has raised money each Christmas to provide 
gifts for thousands of children in her area, many of them immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is supporting Proposition 187 because she says the steady influx of 
illegal immigrants in recent years has exacerbated everything from litter and 
crime to overcrowding in neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal and moderate Democrats on the Westside, where housing costs are higher 
and fewer poor immigrants tend to settle, often cite larger principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legal immigration is the lifeblood of the country," said Jack Hirsh, a 
45-year-old computer programmer and "middle-of-the-road" Democrat. But he says 
he supports the initiative because "it's a simple matter of propriety. I 
believe in the law. It's hard for me to see any justification for anything 
having to do with people whose presence inside the country is not lawful." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Plotkin, a grass-roots Westside Democratic Party activist, senses the 
measure's appeal in rank-and-file party circles, despite the opposition of many 
party leaders. "A lot of liberal Democrats (are) looking in terms of supporting 
it . . . which surprises me," she said. "There's a futile sense here. People 
are so frustrated that nothing is being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say racial bias is feeding the support for Proposition 187, and 
discrimination could be rampant if it passes. Provisions to require public 
employees to question people about their immigration status and report 
suspected illegal residents would throw suspicion on many minorities who speak 
with accents, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of racial prejudice is nearly impossible to gauge in polls, experts 
say. Predictably, racial considerations are discounted by supporters of 
Proposition 187 across the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be a factor. But I'm Hispanic and I don't think race is really the 
issue," said Rodriguez, the Imperial Valley college student. It's about public 
money and opportunity, she said. "There's a lot of people out there that live 
in this country -- American people -- that need the help." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some critics of the initiative say its appeal is not as simple as race 
and are concerned about the polarized rhetoric of the early public debate on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Those supporting the measure tend to be tagged as racist and those opposing it 
are dismissed as favoring open borders, said Harry Pachon, president of the 
Tomas Rivera Center, a Latino policy think tank at Claremont College. "Both 
sides are not even listening to each other, so the middle (ground) has been 
lost in the debate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA professor Skerry, who argues Proposition 187 is simply bad public 
policy, also says it was foreseeable. California polls have shown a high level 
of anxiety the last 10 or 12 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw what was going on, immigration was at such a level that something 
had to give," he said. "Political figures didn't want to see it, but it was 
there."

FIGHT TO CONTROL PURSE IMPERILS PALESTINIAN PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A struggle for control of the treasury of the new Palestinian Authority is 
under way, sharply dividing the political leadership and putting the economic 
future of the Palestinian territories at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are Yasser Arafat, head of the authority and chairman of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, and his finance and planning ministers, 
according to well-placed Palestinian sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and the ministers want the $2.5 billion in economic assistance promised 
by the West to be spent by the authority. For them, the issue is political 
control of Palestinian economic development, with Palestinian leaders deciding 
priorities and responding to their people's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, sources say, is the authority's economy minister, Ahmed 
Suleiman Khoury, and the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction (PECDAR). They want all aid to go through the council and its 
Western-trained economists, engineers and managers to ensure efficiency and 
prevent corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoury, severely critical of Arafat's practice of reserving all key decisions 
for himself, is threatening to resign, a move that would embarrass Arafat both 
here and abroad. Khoury has also questioned the integrity of some Palestinian 
businessmen who are seeking big contracts from Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Siding with Khoury and his council for the most part are Israel and Western 
donors, international institutions such as the World Bank that collect and 
allocate the funds. They fear waste and corruption on a multimillion-dollar 
scale if Arafat handles the money. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two fundamental sets of issues: 
</P>
<P>
 * Arafat's one-man style of decision-making versus the demand of many 
Palestinians, especially in the West Bank, for open government. 
</P>
<P>
 * A development strategy, setting Palestinian priorities for long-term growth, 
that will be decided by political leaders -- or by economists. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle is still at an impasse, with the Palestinian Authority only able 
-- and even then with the greatest difficulty -- to get minimal operating 
funds; few of the big projects that will be the basis of Gaza's reconstruction 
after 27 years of Israeli occupation have received even preliminary approval 
because of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Bank prefers to deal with technocrats who don't have political 
direction from the Palestinian leadership," Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi, the 
finance minister, commented this month. "This is not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials criticize the Western donors' selection of the World 
Bank, known largely for its high-living bureaucrats and penchant for 
mega-projects, to oversee aid here. Only after a year, they note, is the World 
Bank planning to open a local office. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoury, who represented the PLO in secret negotiations with Israel on the 
autonomy agreement and who was then appointed by Arafat as managing director of 
the Palestinian economic council, defended the agency's selection as the 
"Palestinian address for major aid projects." 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, PECDAR is the only well-organized Palestinian institution," 
Khoury said in an interview this month. "It should be the central body (for 
receiving aid), or there will be real problems with Palestinian fighting 
Palestinian and no assistance coming in as donors flee." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the council, the Palestinian Authority has received only $65 
million of the $750 million it was promised in aid for its first year. This has 
meant hand-to-mouth financing of normal operations, pay for the police and a 
delay in Palestinian assumption of responsibility for health care and welfare 
services in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority has drawn up a budget of $135 million for the next 
four months, and local economists expect that it will be able to finance only 
half that, at most, from tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Western donors are increasingly concerned by the infighting. "We know Abu Alaa 
(as Khoury is better known), and we trust him," a senior European diplomat 
said. "With him in charge, PECDAR can provide the accountability and 
transparency we require. 
</P>
<P>
 "But time is increasingly out of hand," the diplomat said. "There is an 
urgency in getting the Palestinian Authority up and running so it gains 
credibility among the people of Gaza and the West Bank. Arafat has been using 
this to get donors to drop our conditions. The pressure is really intense 
because we can't let this effort fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise worked out by Terje Larsen, the United Nations' new 
coordinator for the Middle East, some assistance will flow through U.N. 
agencies, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat, continuing to resist direct donor financing of large projects and 
the use of the Palestinian economic council as an intermediary, has stripped 
the council of all decision-making authority and decreed that all aid programs 
be "coordinated" with Nashashibi's finance ministry. As a result, some key 
council officials are resigning to take posts in various ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoury's resignation remains on Arafat's desk. But the two men are still 
discussing their differences.

AS ELECTION NEARS, GOP PROSPECTS EVEN BRIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gloomy message that Democratic political consultants had been delivering 
to their candidates all summer has become increasingly bleak in the last 
several days: With November's midterm elections only six weeks away, even 
Democrats whose seats seemed secure are in trouble in state after state, 
district after district. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a veteran of 32 years in the Senate 
and the best-known liberal political figure in the country, is suddenly running 
even, and perhaps slightly behind, his challenger, Mitt Romney, a wealthy 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wyoming, where Democrats once thought they had a better than even chance of 
winning a Senate seat that has long been in Republican hands, the GOP 
candidate, Rep. Craig Thomas, appears to be pulling away from Gov. Mike 
Sullivan, who has been weighted down by his close friendship with President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio, traditionally a state that is closely divided in national politics, 
the Republican Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine, has put together a 
substantial lead over Joel Hyatt, the Democratic candidate and the son-in-law 
of the incumbent senator, Howard M. Metzenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Tennessee, where Democrats thought they faced one close race -- between 
Rep. Jim Cooper and Fred Thompson, a lawyer and actor, for the seat once held 
by Vice President Al Gore -- they now find two close contests. Not only are 
Cooper and Thompson in a dead heat, but Jim Sasser, the state's senior senator 
and a man who aspires to be Senate majority leader, has slipped into a close 
race against William Frist, a surgeon from Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are only some examples of what delighted Republicans insist is a wave 
building beneath their feet. Some of the Republican claims are clearly puffery 
designed to demoralize the opposition and attract campaign cash, but 
nonetheless, Republican strategists in Washington have begun to talk out loud 
about such previously whispered fantasies as Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Republicans running not only the 
nation's two largest cities -- New York and Los Angeles -- but six of its 
largest states. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans would need to win 40 House seats and seven in the Senate to gain 
majorities in both chambers for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower's 
first term. But while the goal still seems a considerable stretch, it is no 
longer an inconceivable one. 
</P>
<P>
 "In late August, there was a sense that things couldn't get any worse," says 
Democratic consultant Alan Secrest, who handles races for a number of Democrats 
in the South. "But it's tapered off a bit more." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, predicts Dan Leonard, spokesman for the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, "could be one of the best Republican years since the 
Reagan landslide of 1980." 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic counterpart, Mike Casey, concedes that the tide seems to be 
running against his party despite its best efforts. "We're running a very good 
ship in 65-foot seas," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern on Capitol Hill deepened even further this week when Rep. Mike 
Synar (D-Okla.), a well-liked House veteran, lost his primary race to a 
71-year-old retired teacher, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) won 
only 35% in the state's unusual open primary in which candidates from both 
parties compete on the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts from both parties offer several cautionary notes. 
"Republicans have whistled this tune many times in the past, and it hasn't come 
true," notes Secrest. "Democrats have developed some pretty good political 
survival skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Republicans concede that point. Democrats tend to field candidates with 
more political experience than do Republicans. Furthermore, GOP candidates 
often are business people with little campaign savvy who are prone to make 
mistakes in the closing days of an election or who have politically fatal 
problems in their pasts that previous campaigns might have revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, to take one dramatic example, Democratic Gov. Roy Romer had been 
facing a difficult reelection. In the past two weeks, however, his Republican 
opponent, Bruce Benson, has owned up to two drunk driving arrests, admitted 
cheating on his wife of 30 years before divorcing her and said at a press 
conference that while he may have threatened once to kill her, as she claimed 
in divorce papers, "it was a statement made on the spur of the moment." Romer 
is now expected to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, notes Democratic consultant Joe Trippi, Republicans in a number 
of states have nominated candidates who simply may be too conservative for 
public tastes. The Virginia Senate race between incumbent Democratic Sen. 
Charles S. Robb, retired Col. Oliver L. North, a Republican; and independent 
Marshall Coleman "is going to go down to the wire," said Trippi. "But if they 
had just found a moderate Republican to put up against him, Chuck Robb would be 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Republicans in Minnesota could lose the seat now held by Sen. Dave 
Durenberger, who is retiring, because their candidate, Rep. Rod Grams, is 
considerably more conservative than most voters in that traditionally liberal 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, says Republican consultant William McInturff, "this is not a 
pro-Republican year. We just happen to be the beneficiaries" of voter sentiment 
that has turned against incumbents in general, and Democrats in particular. Or 
as Secrest notes, "There are very few people in our focus groups or polls who 
are calling for a return to the George Bush era." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Malcolm, director of EMILY's List, which raises money for Democratic 
women candidates, adds that "I don't see much of a wave building for anyone. 
What I see is a lot of voter anger and cynicism, which makes for a very 
unstable political environment for anybody." Malcolm notes that while her 
organization had 16 Democratic women on its list of endangered candidates 
earlier this year, that number has been pared to only six. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they see the election more as a case of general voter anger than of a 
Republican surge, many Democratic strategists hope the Republicans have erred 
in trying to turn the election into an ideological referendum. The Republican 
congressional leadership has summoned all the party's candidates to Washington 
this week to unveil a "Contract for America" that Republicans will pledge to 
run on. The contract, which promises to increase defense spending, cut taxes, 
balance the budget and revive such projects as the Reagan-era "Star Wars" 
missile defense program, could provide Democratic candidates with some tempting 
targets, Democratic consultants believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Democrats still face a series of difficult, interlocking 
problems. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Incumbency. Two years ago, angry voters turned against incumbents and voted 
into office the largest class of freshmen House members in half a century. This 
time around, the public mood remains bitter, cynical about politics, and angry 
at incumbents. That hurts both parties, of course, "but the problem is, we have 
more incumbents than they do," says Democratic consultant Mark Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turnout. President Clinton's unpopularity does two things, both of which 
hurt Democrats -- he fires up the large number of Republicans and conservatives 
who strongly disapprove of his performance in office, making them more likely 
to vote, and he demoralizes Democrats, making them less likely to show up at 
the polls. As a result, even Democrats who go into the last week of the 
election a few points ahead are in danger of losing. A similar effect hammered 
Republicans in 1974, after then-President Gerald R. Ford issued a pardon to 
Richard Nixon for his Watergate offenses -- leading to massive GOP losses that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gridlock. Democrats insist that Congress has accomplished far more in the 
last two years than voters give it credit for. Unfortunately, most of the 
accomplishments they point to -- passage of family leave legislation and 
deficit reduction, for example, happened last year. Most of this year has been 
a series of frustrations, including the collapse of the health reform effort 
and the partisan battle over the crime bill. Democrats have tried to turn the 
gridlock issue against Republicans, but it mostly seems to be hurting them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The South. A generation ago, the Solid South gave Democrats a seemingly 
permanent cushion of congressional seats. Long after most Southern states 
became reliably Republican in presidential elections, popular Democratic 
incumbents managed to hold on to many of those seats. This year, many of those 
incumbents have chosen to retire, and at least a dozen, perhaps as many as 20, 
Southern seats seem headed from the Democratic to the Republican side of the 
aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those problems -- the fact that Democrats have more seats to defend and 
the long-term political and demographic shifts in the South -- are simply part 
of the landscape, something that Democrats must adapt to but cannot change. The 
turnout and gridlock problems are susceptible to resolution, but doing so will 
be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 On gridlock, Democrats are clinging to thin hopes of passing a few 
eye-catching bills before quitting for the fall. Republicans are doing their 
best to block almost anything and no longer bother to deny that they are doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 The top candidates for action are bills to put new restrictions on lobbyists 
and their ability to give gifts to members of Congress and legislation that 
would require Congress to operate under the same health, safety and 
environmental laws that affect the private sector. Those bills, Democrats hope, 
would assuage some of the voter anger directed at Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And Democrats hope to score points with legislation on aid to education that 
is likely to pass before Congress adjourns. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic candidates also are likely to step up efforts to convince their own 
supporters that the consequences of a Republican victory would be so scary that 
they need to get out and vote. Because of that, voters likely will see both a 
barrage of negative advertisements and efforts to tie Republicans to the 
positions of the "radical right" on issues such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those strategies may work. For now, however, Republicans remain 
confident. "There have been times in the past when this party has erred and 
wrongly tried to impose a national focus on local elections," says McInturff. 
"This time, however, we are going to have a national referendum on Nov. 8, and 
that referendum is going to be on your thoughts about Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen an election like this before, it was 1982," McInturff adds, 
recalling the year when anger at a deep economic recession caused large GOP 
losses and derailed much of Ronald Reagan's agenda. "That time the shotgun was 
against my head. This time, it's a lot more fun."

</P>
<P>
 Although only a small handful of Democratic incumbents feel truly safe this 
year, there are a dozen Senate seats currently held by Democrats that the party 
is most worried about, including six incumbents who face strong challenges and 
six more seats in which retirements have put a seat in jeopardy. Republicans 
are mostly worrying about only five seats, including two incumbents.

 * incumbent GOP Targets Southern House Seats 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, dozens of seats held by incumbents of both parties are up for 
grabs, but Republicans start off with a major head start. The reason is that a 
series of retirements of longtime Democratic representatives in the South have 
put in play seats that by most political measures, such as votes in 
presidential elections, should have been in Republican hands long ago. 
Including incumbents who face very strong challenges, the Democrats fear losing 
as many as 20 seats in the increasingly Republican South.

HUMAN EMBRYO RESEARCH POSES ETHICS DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baltimore nurse Janice Pearse recalls her long quest to become pregnant using 
in-vitro fertilization through a lens of pain, embarrassment, disappointment -- 
and awe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time her eggs were mixed with her husband's sperm in a petri dish 
and the doctor told her that embryos had been formed was an exhilarating moment 
because "it's the closest to having a baby you've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 But for every experimentally created embryo that is successfully implanted -- 
and Pearse was one of the lucky ones who eventually became pregnant -- 
thousands of unneeded embryos are frozen in storage -- or discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is acceptable to create an embryo for transfer into a woman's uterus -- 
as is now routine in fertility clinics -- is it ethical to experiment on an 
embryo in the laboratory? Or just throw it away? 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the more troubling aspects of the new frontier of medical 
science known as human embryo research. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists believe that studying the human embryo -- at one week a 
cluster of cells no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence -- could 
yield infinite knowledge about nature's worst medical scourges. 
</P>
<P>
 But like any science involved with creating or manipulating human life, it has 
become the focus of an intense international debate, and has raised numerous 
ethical dilemmas that have yet to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 What, for example, is the moral status of a human embryo? Is it acceptable to 
make an embryo in the lab only to use it for research -- especially when there 
are at least 12,000 unwanted embryos now frozen in storage and countless others 
that get tossed away? 
</P>
<P>
 How far should research embryos be allowed to develop? At what point does an 
embryo become a fetus? Moreover, what kinds of research are appropriate -- and 
inappropriate? 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institutes of Health last year asked a panel of outside experts 
to wrestle with these questions, and its members are scheduled to release 
guidelines for federally funded embryo research Tuesday. Their report will 
undergo further scrutiny within NIH and be the subject of a public meeting in 
December. NIH Director Harold E. Varmus will then make the final decision on 
what areas of research are acceptable for federal funding, and which guidelines 
should govern the work. 
</P>
<P>
 While the panel is expected to endorse human embryo research generally, it 
will likely propose certain limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably will sanction the idea of pre-implantation diagnosis, for example, 
so parents worried about genetic risks can choose IVF and learn in advance 
whether an embryo carries an inherited disease. But the panel is expected to 
deem it unacceptable to use such a technique only to determine sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also is likely to oppose cloning, or "twinning," experiments, and 
research that uses human-animal combinations. It may, however, conclude that 
parthenogenesis -- a process that uses chemicals or electrical current to 
stimulate the development of an egg in the absence of sperm -- may be valuable 
in understanding egg development. These so-called parthenotes die several days 
after they are generated, and do not develop into real embryos. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the panel's recommendations, they almost certainly will be 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing the view of many scientists who are among the chief advocates of 
the research is Roger A. Pedersen, professor of radiology, anatomy and 
obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen contends that "a deeper understanding of the biological events of 
early human development will ultimately have profound implications for 
virtually all major areas of human health." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, arguing with equal passion, maintain that tampering with human 
life is morally unjustified, regardless of the ultimate medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "spooky and Frankenstein-esque," says Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove), who is leading a congressional effort to derail federal funding for 
such research. He charges that the NIH "will give rise to a new cottage 
industry in spare baby parts for its macabre experiments." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is similar in some respects to one over the use of fetal tissue in 
medical research. Opponents argued that tissue obtained through abortion, which 
they deem the destruction of human life, should not be used toward the 
advancement of medicine, no matter how promising. Upon taking office, President 
Clinton lifted a ban on federal funding for such research that had been in 
place since the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The current controversy, however, differs in one vital aspect: A major 
argument put forth by opponents of fetal research was that it would encourage 
more women to undergo abortions, which is not an issue here. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the discussion of human embryo research concerns only the study 
of the embryo outside the uterus, that is, one that is produced in a laboratory 
by mixing sperm and egg. Such research is conducted on very early embryos, 
usually those less than one week old -- and certainly no later than 14 days. 
That is the point at which the so-called "primitive streak" appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The "primitive streak" is an advancing line of cells that determines the 
embryo's head-tail, right-left orientation, and indicates the beginning of the 
development of individual organs. It is regarded as the transition to a more 
sophisticated level of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the question of when human life actually begins, many scientists do 
not regard an embryo as a fetus until it is at least eight weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
 In this country, most research involving human embryos has been an adjunct to 
the clinical practice of in-vitro fertilization and other techniques for 
helping infertile couples become parents. Most other embryo research has 
involved the use of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists believe that an increasing emphasis on human embryo research 
can enhance success rates for reproduction procedures. At present, fewer than 
one-fourth of the women who undergo in-vitro fertilization will give birth to a 
child, and then usually only after repeated cycles of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond reproduction, many in the field also believe that human embryo research 
can provide new opportunities for understanding the mechanisms of cancer -- by 
studying the ways cells divide -- and genetic disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 New insights into genetics, for example, could prove critically important both 
in basic knowledge about how genes work and in determining, before an embryo is 
implanted into a woman's uterus, whether it carried a serious genetic disorder. 
Thus informed, couples could decide whether or not to implant the embryo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential benefit of human embryo research is as a source of cell 
lines. Certain cells in the early embryo are stem cells, meaning they have the 
potential to become any kind of body cell. 
</P>
<P>
 This phenomenon raises the possibility that they could be grown and maintained 
indefinitely in culture in the lab, or even allowed to develop into more 
specialized types of cells -- such as blood, muscle and nervous system cells -- 
which could be used in numerous therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation, 
repair of spinal cord injuries or skin replacement for burn victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these potential clinical applications, the field evokes numerous 
troubling questions. If parents decide, for example, against implanting a 
defective embryo for genetic reasons, couldn't a couple decide against 
implantation on the basis of sex, which also could be determined in advance? 
</P>
<P>
 And what are the boundaries of such research? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, researchers at George Washington University Medical 
Center here caused an uproar in scientific and ethical circles after they 
announced that they had experimentally cloned human embryos -- that is, divided 
them into identical twins or triplets. The announcement marked the first time 
such a feat had been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment raised the specter that, since human embryos could be frozen 
and used later, parents could have a child and then, several years later, have 
that child's identical twin. Critics also raised the most extreme example of 
such work -- that parents could have an identical twin years later to serve as 
an organ donor for the older child. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry response caused the researchers to announce they would abandon any 
further attempts at cloning embryos. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most pressing overall questions is whether embryos should be 
created solely for the purpose of research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think an embryo is the moral equivalent of a person -- but having 
said that, I do think the human embryo is deserving of some special ethical 
status," says Arthur Caplan, director of the center for bioethics at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should treat it as if it were a rock, or an insect, or a 
leaf," he adds. "I don't think you should make them for research. I'm real 
uncomfortable with that -- I wouldn't create something just to do research on 
it and destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he believes that research should be conducted -- but only on embryos 
that already exist, such as those in frozen storage or destined to be 
discarded. "You've got a lot of embryos around that no one wants," Caplan says. 
"That is the place to do the research." 
</P>
<P>
 Current regulation of the field is a patchwork of statutes, according to 
Andrea Bonnicksen, a political science professor at Northern Illinois 
University who has done research on the subject. Several countries and 10 U.S. 
states have laws that monitor human embryo research, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 California has no such regulations. Louisiana has the most restrictive 
statute, providing that "no in-vitro fertilized human ovum will be farmed or 
cultured solely for research purposes or any other purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway explicitly forbids any human embryo research, other than allowing that 
fertilized eggs be utilized only for implantation in women, and imposes fines 
and imprisonment on violators. Other countries, such as Germany, Austria, 
Switzerland, France and Denmark, strictly regulate the research but do not 
prohibit it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, Spain and Sweden have more permissive regulations. Britain, where the 
first "test tube" baby was conceived in 1978, licenses clinics practicing IVF, 
and each research proposal involving human embryos must be approved by a 
national-level body. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. guidelines, when final, will apply only to human embryo research 
projects that seek federal money and will not affect whatever work is being 
done privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "public funding could bring such research into a realm where it 
would receive peer review and be subject to consistent regulation," says 
ethicist Lisa Sowle Cahill, professor of theology at Boston College. "This is 
an important consideration in view of the fact that this research is likely to 
continue, no matter what future policies are established for government 
funding."

10 HAITIANS DIE, U.S. TRANSLATOR WOUNDED AS GUN BATTLES ERUPT; CARIBBEAN: 
MARINES RESPOND WITH FORCE AS SHOOTING BREAKS OUT AT POLICE STATION IN NORTHERN 
PORT OF CAP HAITIEN. A CROWD OF ANGRY ARISTIDE SUPPORTERS IS CAUGHT IN THE LINE 
OF FIRE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten Haitians were killed in a series of firefights late Saturday night in this 
northern port after a large group of supporters of ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide tried to push their way into police headquarters, 
according to preliminary reports from Marines and civilian witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The first gun battle occurred around 7 p.m. when the Aristide supporters, 
numbering as many as 1,000, started heading toward the police station in the 
center of town in what police officials believed was a very threatening matter. 
One police official started firing into the crowd, witnesses say, killing two 
Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, members of the Marines' Echo Company heard the gunfire and rushed to 
the scene. Some of the gunfire was close enough to them that they returned 
fire, a top Marine official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for sure that the Marines received fire and returned fire," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the crowd was so large, the Haitians were in the line of fire and 
eight were killed, officials said. Among the eight was at least one Haitian 
police official. During the exchange, a Marine support person, a translator, 
also received a superficial wound from a ricocheting bullet and was evacuated 
to the amphibious helicopter ship Wasp, a Marine official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were very sketchy, and officials were tight-lipped on the incident, 
saying that they will issue a full statement this morning. "This is the closest 
understanding that we've got at what happened at this point," an official said. 
"We're going to wait until daylight until we say anything more. We need more 
time to sort this thing out." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, a military spokesman said: "Military officials are 
investigating the incident. No further details are available at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began, witnesses said, when the crowd gathered around the 
stationery store of an American-born Haitian, Michel Paret, who apparently does 
not support Aristide. Paret reportedly pulled a gun to ward off the crowd and 
fired, witnesses said. One person was shot in the leg and was taken to the 
hospital, and Paret was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, Marines shot up flares to light the scene and ordered the 
demonstrators to raise their hands over their heads and to move back into their 
homes. Within an hour, the streets, darkened by a lack of electricity, were all 
but empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Maj. Mark Milley of the newly arrived 10th Mountain Light Infantry 
Division from Ft. Drum, N.Y., had predicted that there wouldn't be any 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Milley said many of his units served in similar roles in Somalia. "But," he 
said earlier, "we don't anticipate in Haiti anything approaching the problems 
we had in Somalia. There seems to be no anti-America sentiment or violence so 
far up here. I think everyone's going to get along." 
</P>
<P>
 But should the area erupt into violence, Milley said, and should President 
Clinton order an evacuation, the 300 Americans who live in the city, Haiti's 
second largest, would be asked to assemble at the local hospital or soccer 
field to await flights out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that is so unlikely, it's beyond comprehension," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th Mountain infantry troops started arriving Saturday to replace the 
Marines, who secured the northern coast Tuesday and had been scheduled to begin 
fanning out to the countryside. There was some speculation that the Marines' 
departure could be delayed by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode marks the first exchange of fatal gunfire between Americans and 
Haitians since U.S. troops landed in Haiti a week ago in an effort to restore 
democracy to the island nation, and it is certain to further escalate tensions 
there. It underscores the uncertainty and danger that are likely to continue to 
plague the U.S. military operation, despite the presence of more than 10,000 
U.S. troops on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence marred the first visit to U.S. forces in Haiti by Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As Perry and Shalikashvili arrived, hundreds of demonstrators marched through 
the streets of Port-au-Prince in a show of support for Aristide and were 
attacked by police, witnesses said. A group of police officers shot tear-gas 
canisters from the back of a pickup into the crowd, the witnesses said, and 
took away at least five of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks came after the demonstrators were out of sight of U.S. troops at 
the city's port and international airport. A U.S. military spokeswoman said 
that there were no U.S. personnel in the area and could not comment on or 
describe the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 And Perry, questioned later at the airport, said: "I have no indication that 
our troops saw that. I do not have that information." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said "that U.S. troops can and should take action if the situation 
warrants" when they encounter police attacks on Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military's "rules of engagement" for its troops in Haiti include the 
order, "Do not hesitate to respond with force against hostile acts and signs of 
hostile intent." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of continuing Haitian-on-Haitian violence has posed the most serious 
political problem for U.S. commanders here and in Washington since American 
forces first landed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing Tuesday of a pro-democracy demonstrator by Haitian police within 
sight of U.S. soldiers guarding the port prompted a controversy over the rules 
of engagement for U.S. troops, as well as over the agreement reached by the 
Clinton Administration and the military dictators that allows the leaders to 
stay in power until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. troops have disarmed the most powerful units of the Haitian army 
and American commanders have ordered Haitian leaders to stop all acts of 
violence against the Haitian people, lightly armed Haitian police and other 
paramilitary forces loyal to the military junta are still in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian police are hardly visible on the streets of Port-au-Prince near 
U.S. troops, but many Haitians on the capital's streets insisted Saturday that 
paramilitary groups and police are still harassing them in neighborhoods not 
yet patrolled by U.S. military police. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramilitary groups "still (give) us problems," said Louis Amonnon, who 
was waiting in a U.S. government office downtown Saturday afternoon in an 
attempt to ask American officials to start military police patrols of his 
neighborhood. "There are no American patrols there, and the (paramilitary 
groups) come every day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have more American patrols; (the Haitian) police are still out 
there," said Frantz Valcaint, a pro-Aristide demonstrator who saw the police 
attack in Port-au-Prince on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in his weekly radio address, confirmed reports that U.S. 
forces have begun not only to confiscate heavy weapons controlled by the 
Haitian military but also to buy back light weapons from the paramilitary 
groups and civilians. Many Aristide supporters had warned that without some 
effort to disarm Haiti's paramilitary attaches and other backers of the Haitian 
military, civil unrest would erupt soon after U.S. forces leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Shalikashvili arrived in Haiti on Saturday morning and conducted a 
quick tour of U.S. forces in the Port-au-Prince area and in Cap Haitien before 
the violence broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said that while U.S. Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton has been meeting with Haitian 
leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the meetings are not " 'negotiations' about 
Cedras' status." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether the military leader will have to leave the country after 
he gives up power Oct. 15 has been one of the main sticking points of the 
last-minute agreement hammered out between the Haitian leaders and an American 
team of negotiators led by former President Jimmy Carter. That accord averted a 
U.S. military invasion just hours before it was scheduled to begin and led to 
the awkward status of coexistence between U.S. forces and the military junta 
they were supposed to evict. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry insisted that while the Carter agreement "did not demand that he 
(Cedras) leaves the country, we believe he should and will." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide has not yet fully endorsed that agreement, but U.S. officials still 
expect him to return to Haiti from his U.S. exile soon after Oct. 15 in order 
to reinstall his government. But U.S. officials and Haitians alike continued to 
debate whether the priest-turned-politician will be able to unify Haiti's 
deeply divided society in time to avert a return to chaos and bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," Aristide critic Raymond Joseph, editor 
of the newspaper Haiti Observateur, called the ousted Haitian president "a man 
who sends double messages. . . . I don't know whether he's not having a special 
message for Americans and another for his people." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, an Aristide supporter and a member of the 
ousted government, told CNN, "The rejoicing will be peaceful" when Aristide 
returns to Haiti. Declaring that Aristide is ready to reach out to affluent 
Haitians who have not supported him, Jean-Juste said, "We need skilled 
Haitians, talented Haitians, from all walks of life to come together and work." 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit, Perry refused to say how long U.S. troops will remain in 
Haiti. He noted that the Clinton Administration has "set the end conditions" 
that it wants to achieve in Haiti, but "we have not set the end date." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his radio address, Clinton repeated assurances that U.S. forces will 
not stay long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission . . . is limited," Clinton said. "We must remember, as I plan to 
tell the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, that it is up to the people 
in those countries, ultimately, to ensure their own freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Shalikashvili noted that small units of the multinational force now 
being trained to take over many functions in the Haiti operation should begin 
arriving in the next week or two, with a larger buildup later in October and in 
November.

<P>
 Listening to the car radio one morning last fall, Hazel Thornton heard callers 
to a talk show belittle the jurors in the Reginald O. Denny beating trial, 
which had just ended. The "stupid idiots," she heard them say. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton shuddered. She was a juror in the trial of Erik Menendez, who was 
accused with his brother of murdering their wealthy parents. As she drove to 
the courthouse, she worried that "people might say the same thing against us." 
</P>
<P>
 When she met her fellow jurors that day, she made a point of polling them to 
find out how many had college degrees. It was a defensive gesture -- to prove 
they were smart. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, when her jury deadlocked many weeks later, Thornton and fellow 
jurors became the butt of jokes across the country. Their failure to convict 
prompted people to ask: Is there something wrong with the jury system? 
</P>
<P>
 Now O.J. Simpson will be tried in the murders of his former wife and her 
friend, providing the world with a forum for examining the flaws of juries in 
yet another Los Angeles case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors do make lots of mistakes. They err most often in understanding and 
applying the letter of the law and may bend it when their sympathies or biases 
favor a particular outcome. In criminal cases, for instance, one survey showed 
they are more likely to acquit a guilty person than to convict someone who is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all their faults, juries usually manage to produce verdicts that are 
defensible, if not perfect, according to social scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on what your tolerance for error is," said forensic psychologist 
Elizabeth Loftus. "We have a system that works well a lot of the time, but it 
also makes mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The imperfections of jurors reflect the frailties of human nature: 
</P>
<P>
 * They can be capricious, swayed by emotional appeals or prejudice, and will 
ignore the law if they believe its result would be unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 * Juries sometimes just cannot agree and deadlock, a problem that appears to 
be more acute in parts of California than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jurors have trouble understanding judges who give convoluted instructions 
and become overwhelmed by complex evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * In long trials, which often are the most highly publicized, jurors can be 
influenced by the unusual pressures, and the composition of the panels tends to 
be different. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their most ardent defenders believe jurors should be given a more active 
role during trials to improve their comprehension. In the tradition-bound 
judicial system, jurors usually are not allowed to ask questions or even take 
notes. They are only instructed about the law at the end of a trial, after they 
may already have formed strong impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors complain that they had questions about key elements of the case 
and resent being forced to reach a verdict without obtaining the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with having ordinary people make 
important decisions," said Saul Kassin, a forensic psychologist at Williams 
College in Massachusetts. "But there is a lot wrong with the way jury trials 
are managed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the public unfairly blames jurors for unpopular verdicts that can be 
traced instead to key mistakes in rulings by judges or poor performances by the 
lawyers. The evidence jurors are allowed to consider also may be substantially 
different from what the public may know about a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe the prosecution was weak in the state trial in which the jury 
failed to convict four Los Angeles police officers accused of beating motorist 
Rodney G. King in 1991. The later federal trial, which produced convictions of 
two officers on civil rights charges, was starkly different from the first, 
from the evidence presented by the prosecution to the judge's instructions to 
the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors may have feared the possibility of unrest when they produced only one 
felony conviction against two men accused of beating truck driver Denny at one 
of the flash points of the riots that followed the initial King verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 But most legal experts believe the prosecution erred in bringing excessive 
charges against the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges are more apt to convict than juries, surveys indicate, but nevertheless 
agree with most jury verdicts in their courtrooms. Even when jurors become 
muddled by complicated evidence, their verdicts are usually sound, research 
shows, because the most capable member of the panel guides the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weakness is that there is always one bleeding heart in there who has to 
be convinced," said Long Beach resident Edith Downey, 56, who has sat on four 
Los Angeles County criminal juries. "But generally they come around because of 
logic." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming the jury for unpopular verdicts is nothing new: Until the late 17th 
Century, jurors in England could be fined or imprisoned for returning a verdict 
opposed by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 And just a decade ago such prominent Americans as then-U.S. Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Warren Burger were deriding the ability of juries to decide 
complicated civil cases. * When Jurors' Emotions Rule 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowed from the British, the early American jury system reflected the public 
distrust of judges from colonial times. When memories of the Revolution dimmed 
and competent judges became more plentiful, American courts began reining in 
juries, allowing judges to reverse decisions and instruct jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 What concerns many critics today is that jurors have not been reined in 
enough. They can allow their emotions and personal experiences to color their 
perceptions of the evidence, a fault acknowledged even by the system's 
strongest defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors will hang their hats on the most insane things," said John Tyre, a Los 
Angeles County criminal defense attorney for 13 years. Even though verdicts are 
by and large correct, he said, "they will look up at the defendant and say, 'He 
has a tattoo. He must be a bad guy.' It scares me sometimes to think about the 
stuff that goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 In a personal injury civil trial, Loftus said, a jury awarded little money to 
a woman who suffered horrible back pain because they noticed she had changed 
her toenail polish three times during the trial. The weather was hot, and the 
woman wore sandals to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figured her back couldn't have hurt that much if she could bend down to 
paint her toenails," said Loftus, a professor of psychology at the University 
of Washington. "So it is those kinds of things you do have to worry about. . . 
. Jurors bring in their personal stories and personal experiences all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 During Menendez trial deliberations, a man on Erik Menendez's panel told 
fellow jurors of wishing his parents had attended his football games when he 
was young. He argued that Jose Menendez could not have been as bad as his sons 
portrayed him because he had attended his sons' tennis games. The juror was one 
of five who voted for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers believe caprice may be to blame for an Aug. 19 jury award of 
$2.9 million to a New Mexico woman who was scalded by coffee at a McDonald's 
restaurant. (A state judge recently reduced the award by more than 75%.) 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's serves unusually hot coffee, and the elderly woman who spilled it 
suffered third-degree burns. The jury learned that other customers had also 
been burned, but the corporation had failed to post warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the jury gets mad," said jury consultant Thomas Beisecker, who 
teaches about juries at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. "Usually there is 
someone in the courtroom they don't like. It could be the behavior of . . . the 
corporate representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathy, like anger, also may color a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Skillful defense lawyers often try to put someone other than the defendant on 
trial. Many years ago Texas defense lawyer Percy Foreman did this when he 
defended a woman who confessed to shooting her husband to death. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, described by jury experts Valerie Hans and Neil Vidmar in 
their book "Judging the Jury," the flamboyant defense lawyer presented evidence 
that the husband had poisoned dogs, stomped a puppy to death and wrung the neck 
of a parakeet. The jury acquitted the wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury was ready to dig up the deceased and shoot him all over again," said 
Foreman, who also represented the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. 
Foreman died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This tendency to blame victims is part of the American psyche, according to 
Hans. She said it is reflected in some tabloid reports that suggest Nicole 
Brown Simpson may have been promiscuous. Another consultant said such coverage 
may be sparking sympathy for the ex-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a defendant who is attractive in some form to the jurors, there 
will be some degree of sympathy and it will tend to overcome the evidence," 
Beisecker said. "But if the evidence is clear, it probably will not." 
</P>
<P>
 Prejudice also can creep into deliberations. Sharon Danley, a 45-year-old 
medical transcriber, was called to serve on a jury in Santa Monica several 
years ago and anticipated a quick verdict. Two men had been accused of 
committing a sex act in a restroom. They denied the charge, and the defense 
challenged the integrity of a security guard who claimed to have seen them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most jurors wanted to acquit, but one woman refused to budge, making 
derogatory comments about gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in the theater," Danley quoted her as saying. "I know what these 
people are like." The jury hung. * When Juries Get Stuck 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlock, after a week of deliberations, was frustrating for Danley, but 
no match for what Jude Nelson went through. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was a juror in the Lyle Menendez trial. He reported for duty June 12, 
1993, and was not released until Jan. 29, 1994, when his panel deadlocked after 
five weeks of deliberations. Half the jurors favored convicting Menendez of 
murder, the other half of voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 25 days there just hollering and screaming and yelling to no avail," 
said Nelson, who voted for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was so frustrated that he called 
on Californians to consider dropping the unanimous verdict requirement for some 
kinds of criminal cases. Statistics on deadlocked juries compiled by The Times 
suggest the prosecutor may indeed have cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts believe about 5% of juries nationally deadlock, forcing retrials 
at considerable expense, compromises, or, in criminal cases, dismissal of 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But deadlock rates reported by prosecutors in five large California counties 
range from 13% in Los Angeles in 1993 for felony trials to 6% in Alameda 
County, which includes Oakland and Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, 2.3% of felony trials in New York's Manhattan borough 
deadlocked in 1993, and 1.88% in Florida's Dade County, which includes Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The national rate for criminal trials in federal court was 2.65%. Federal 
juries in California deadlocked at about twice that rate -- 4.59% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics suspect juries in California may be more erratic because of the 
state's cultural climate. Harvard law school professor Alan Dershowitz -- 
months before he joined Simpson's defense team -- condemned California as "the 
laughingstock" of the nation because its juries fail to convict "obviously 
guilty" people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I want to be quoted on this," said one prominent jury 
researcher, "but maybe you have more crazy people out there in California. One 
of the ways juries get hung -- it is not frequent, but it happens -- is that 
people think God tells them this is a guilty or innocent person, and they 
refuse to deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said the higher rates in California might be explained by Proposition 
115, the 1990 ballot measure that limited the ability of attorneys to screen 
prospective jurors. Many attorneys contend that judges, who can now do all the 
questioning, fail to probe deeply enough for biases that could deadlock a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also cite a variety of other possible explanations for the 
disparity: different charging practices among counties, more diverse jury pools 
for some courts and differences in jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries usually deadlock when the evidence is evenly balanced. Those that vote 
before deliberating or by secret ballot tend to deadlock more often than juries 
that vote openly after discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, most juries reach consensus because the pressure of the group is 
usually too strong. Unlike Henry Fonda in "Twelve Angry Men," jurors whose 
views are in the minority usually cave in. The smaller the jury, researchers 
believe, the less likely it will deadlock because there will be fewer minority 
jurors to support each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes dissenting jurors give up just so they can go home. Jurors have even 
been known to toss a coin, according to Cal State Dominguez Hills law professor 
Franklin Strier, author of a new book on juries. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco U.S. Atty. Michael Yamaguchi, explaining the fewer hung juries 
in federal court, noted that California law requires jurors in state trials to 
find guilt "beyond a moral certainty," whereas federal jurors are given a less 
precise -- and easier-to-meet -- definition of "reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal judges are also allowed to exert more pressure than California judges 
to break deadlocks. By giving what is known as the "dynamite" instruction, 
federal judges urge the minority on the juries to re-examine the case and try 
to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The strains of serving on notorious cases also may exacerbate divisions on the 
panel, although jurors usually feel even greater pressure to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nelson, the Menendez case meant sitting around day after day, confined in 
close quarters, always at the beck and call of the court. "It was stressful in 
that we had these responsibilities put upon us," said Nelson, who said he lost 
his job as a rock band manager because of the trial's length. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot of pressure to reach a verdict. I was incredibly frustrated and 
angry." * Who Serves on Long Trials 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known whether juries in notorious cases like the Menendez killings 
actually deadlock more than others. What is known is that their makeup is 
probably different because few people can afford to serve on long trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although spot surveys indicate that people who show up for jury duty are more 
educated than the general population, jurors who serve in cases longer than 20 
days may be an exception. Those panels tend to have fewer college graduates and 
more unemployed, retired, female and unmarried members, according to a 1987 
study of federal civil trials by the Washington-based Federal Judicial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In jury questionnaires obtained by The Times, jurors in recent Los Angeles 
death penalty trials lasting one to two months were overwhelmingly retirees or 
employees of the Post Office or other government agencies or aerospace firms 
that pay for extended service. Attorneys complain that both lower-income and 
upper-income residents rarely serve in protracted cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain occupations may be overrepresented on such juries. This may happen 
when a major employer in town has generous jury benefits. Engineers -- "people 
who want to make the pieces fit" -- sit frequently on juries in Seattle because 
Boeing pays well for jury duty, Loftus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such imbalances can be a factor in the outcome of some cases. An engineer may 
be more likely to evaluate scientific evidence properly -- or to balk at a 
conviction if the evidence does not neatly fit together, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors' age can also play a role. For example, a majority of the King jurors 
in the state trial were 50 or older -- the kind more likely to be sympathetic 
to the police, experts said. The jury in the second trial had only three jurors 
over 50, according to a jury consultant for the defense. * Trouble With the Law 
</P>
<P>
 When jurors err, it is often because they do not follow directions. They have 
enormous trouble understanding the judges' instructions, a problem social 
scientists blame on legal mumbo jumbo, not on jurors' intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most serious problem that jurors encounter in their efforts to get things 
right appears to be an inability to apply instructions correctly," said Richard 
Lempert, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes jurors are given too little direction. In one major civil trial, 
jurors unknowingly denied the plaintiff money because they could not understand 
the verdict form. The judge had never bothered to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also asks jurors to do what experts contend is nearly impossible -- to 
wipe from their minds facts they are not legally supposed to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 When the men accused of beating truck driver Denny went on trial, the news 
media and community leaders expressed fears that harsh verdicts might spark 
renewed unrest. The judge told the jurors not to consider the ramifications of 
their verdicts, but some did. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, the Pasadena trial consultant who was hired by the Denny 
defendants and now works for Simpson, said one juror went to the blackboard 
during the last day of deliberations and wrote the words "Compassion," "Unity" 
and "Future." 
</P>
<P>
 The juror later explained that he wanted panelists to have compassion for each 
other and hoped the verdict would bring unity to Los Angeles' future. The Denny 
jurors "hated one another," Dimitrius said, threatening and swearing at one 
another during deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the juror insisted he had not considered the verdict's ramifications, 
the possibility of unrest "subconsciously" affected him, said Dimitrius, who 
interviewed the jurors after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denny jurors returned one felony conviction out of 15 counts filed. The 
felony, a mayhem conviction against 20-year-old Damian Monroe Williams, was the 
lesser of two options and carried a maximum prison term of eight years instead 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 (Even judges can't help but consider facts they should ignore. In one 
experiment, judges awarded a person injured in a burning accident more money 
when they knew that the corporation had tried to recall the responsible device 
-- despite being told to ignore that evidence.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the evidence is too complex for most jurors, or so dry and technical 
that they tune out, counting the light fixtures overhead to relieve their 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of evidence that will be critical in the Simpson trial particularly 
stumps jurors, according to jury experts. Jurors tend either to overestimate or 
undervalue the importance of such scientific evidence as DNA because the error 
rates and statistical probabilities are confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, research suggests that the more educated the jury, the more 
likely it is to interpret the evidence correctly and produce a sound verdict. 
But requiring a minimum level of education could deprive panels of people with 
an understanding of issues gained outside the classroom, some experts argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury benefits from diverse perspectives," Lempert said. "So you don't 
want all jurors to reach a certain magic standard because the janitor may know 
some things about how pipes work, or somebody else might know something about 
how the police work." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel Thornton's fellow jurors in Erik Menendez's trial included blue-collar 
workers and a Ph.D. Several had college degrees. After her panel deadlocked, 
she said she heard someone on talk radio declare that it looked as though "they 
had just moved the stupid Denny jury over to the Menendez case." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her early angst, Thornton, who voted for manslaughter instead of 
murder, is bearing the ridicule well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know what they are talking about," said the 37-year-old telephone 
company engineer. "They weren't there." 
</P>

 Next: Manipulating the jury. About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 In this four-part series, The Times examines the strengths and flaws of the 
American jury system and the need for reform.  
</P>
<P>
 * Today: Deadlocks in recent high-profile cases have thrown the spotlight on 
the U.S. jury system, raising questions about whether it deserves to survive.

reforms. Unable to Decide 
</P>
<P>
 Hung juries have long infuriated the public because of the expense required to 
stage a new trial. Experts estimate that about 5% of all trials end in a 
deadlock. Los Angeles is among several California counties that have high rates 
of hung juries in felony trials at the state court level. Riveting Juries 
</P>
<P>
 America is fascinated by a good jury trial. Here are five that riveted the 
public and reverberated long after they ended. One case brought about a change 
in the law. Two set off riots. Some were characterized by bitter arguments 
among jurors that continued, in one instance, for months after the trial had 
concluded. Most raised questions about the impact of massive pretrial publicity 
on jurors' attitudes towards the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney G. King 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: On March 3, 1991, motorist Rodney G. King was stopped by law 
enforcement officers after a chase. Several officers were captured on videotape 
kicking King, an African American, and beating him with batons. Sgt. Stacey C. 
Koon and Officers Laurence M. Powell, Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind, 
all of the LAPD, were charged with 11 criminal counts including assault with a 
deadly weapon and assault under color of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION: The trial was moved to Ventura County. The 
jury of six men and six women was seated after one month of questioning. There 
were 10 whites, one Latina and one Asian American but, notably, no African 
Americans. Jurors' identities were kept confidential. They were evenly divided 
between Democrats and Republicans, ranged in age from 38 to 65 and included 
retirees, professionals and blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * DELIBERATION TIME: The sequestered jurors deliberated for seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY CONDUCT: The jury was bitterly divided over many of the charges. Some 
jurors who spoke to reporters demanded anonymity. Some feared retaliation; some 
reeived death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESULT: The jury found the officers not guilty on 10 counts and was 
deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of acquittal on one count against Powell. Reaction 
was swift, with many calling the verdicts racist. Hours after the verdicts, 
angry citizens torched buildings and looted stores in became three days of the 
worst urban rioting in U.S. history. Powell and Koon were convicted in a 
federal civil rights trial and are now serving prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik & Lyle Menendez 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: The brothers were charged with first-degree murder in the 1989 
shotgun slayings of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. The 
prosecution portrayed them as coldblooded killers motivated by greed. The 
defense claimed they killed in self-defense after years of emotional, physical 
and sexual abuse. The charges carried the death penalty. They were tried 
together, before separate juries. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION: Selection was complicated by intense 
pretrial publicity, which the defense contended jeopardized the brothers' right 
to a fair trial. Jury selection took approximately three weeks for Lyle 
Menendez's jury and a week longer for his brother's. Prospective jurors filled 
out a 34-page questionnaire which probed issues of sexual abuse, family 
violence and self-defense. Lyle's jury had five men and and seven women; seven 
of the jurors were parents. Erik's jury had six men and six women; nine were 
parents, seven were over 50. 
</P>
<P>
 * DELIBERATION TIME: The jury for Lyle Menendez deliberated 25 days before 
announcing that it was hopelessly deadlocked. The Erik Menendez jury 
deliberated for 19 days before deadlocking. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY CONDUCT: Jurors were not sequestered. In the Erik Menendez jury, votes 
were split largely along gender lines, with the votes for first-degree murder 
verdict in the killing of Jose Menendez all cast by men. One juror recently 
accused another in a lawsuit of slandering her on a TV talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESULT: Both trials ended in hung juries. The case spawned book and movie 
deals. The brothers remain in custody without bail awaiting retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhard Goetz 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: Goetz, who is white, shot four black teen-agers on a New York 
subway in 1984. He claimed they were about to rob and beat him; the young men 
said they were only panhandling. Goetz was seen by some as a hero acting in 
self-defense and by others as a trigger-happy vigilante and racist. He was 
charged with 13 criminal counts, including four counts of attempted murder, and 
faced up to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSTION: After 10 days of jury selection, 12 jurors 
and four alternates were seated. Six of the 12 had been victims of crimes, 
three in the subway. There were eight men and four women, two blacks, nine 
whites and one Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 * DELIBERATION TIME: The sequestered jurors deliberated 30 hours over four 
days. They voted 35 times before reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY CONDUCT: At least one juror appeared on "Larry King Live" after the 
trial. None voted to convict Goetz of the more serious crimes, according to 
several jurors' reports. Two jurors sold their stories to newspapers in New 
York and one wrote a book. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESULT: After a seven-week trial, Goetz was found guilty only of illegal gun 
possession. He was sentenced to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine. He served 
250 days. One shooting victim who was paralyzed from the waist down filed a 
$50-million lawsuit against Goetz, which is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 William Kennedy Smith 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: The nephew of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was charged with raping a 
woman at his family's estate in Palm Beach, Fla. in 1991. The Kennedy name, as 
well as the senator's testimony, drew hundreds of journalists. The extensive 
coverage ignited debates about pretrial publicity and the right to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION: Both sides attempted to use massive pretrial 
publicity to influence potential jurors. Jurors were questioned about their 
attitudes toward the Kennedy family and about pretrial coverage. One 
prospective juror, called a "walking mistrial" by the judge, was dismissed 
after she revealed that members of the media had contacted her. It took three 
weeks to seat the six-person jury of four women and two men. The jurors were 
sequestered; their average age was 52 and none were college graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 * DELIBERATION TIME: After 10 days of trial, jury deliberation took only 77 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY CONDUCT: Two female jurors wiped away tears as the verdict was read. 
One appeared on the Phil Donahue TV show with Smith's attorney after the trial. 
The attorney, Roy Black, and the juror began dating a year after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESULT: Smith was found innocent on the rape charge and a misdemeanor count 
of simple battery. His accuser shed her anonymity and agreed to be interviewed. 
Most, but not all, news organizations had withheld her identity when she 
testified because of policies against publishing the identity of accusers in 
rape cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan White 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: In November, 1978, White, a former police officer and a 
conservative law-and-order San Francisco supervisor, shot and killed liberal 
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, San Francisco's first openly 
gay public official. White, who had resigned his seat 17 days earlier, shot 
Moscone after the mayor refused to reappoint him. Milk had reportedly argued 
against his reinstatement. The murders changed the political landscape of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION: The jury of seven women and five men, mainly 
white, middle-class and Catholic, like White, was selected from a panel of 250 
people. Six of the 12 jurors wept openly when a tape of White's sobbing 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
 * DELIBERATION TIME: The panel deliberated 36 hours over six days, reaching 
unanimous guilty verdicts, first on the Moscone slaying and three days later on 
Milk's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 * JURY CONDUCT: Jurors, who were sequestered, received death threats. Some 
changed jobs and some moved out of the Bay Area. One said it was "the worst 
thing that ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * RESULT: White, who was facing the death penalty, was found guilty of the 
lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. The defense had argued that White was 
suffering from a deep depression aggravated by eating sugary junk food and was 
acting with diminished capacity. This became known as the "Twinkie defense." 
The verdict touched off a night of rioting in San Francisco. In 1981, the 
diminished-capacity defense was abolished. White served a little more than five 
years in prison, was paroled in 1984 and committed suicide in 1985.

ATTACKER'S UPCOMING PAROLE TESTS GALANTER'S RECOVERY; CRIME: COUNCILWOMAN HAS 
MADE GREAT STRIDES SINCE 1987 STABBING. NOW SHE MUST CONFRONT NEW ANGER, FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seven years is long enough for wounds to heal. It's long enough for a voice 
that had been ripped away to regain much of its old strength. It's even long 
enough to reach an accommodation with fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, it is not nearly long 
enough to accept the impending freedom of the man who nearly killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mark Allen Olds will complete his prison sentence for the attempted 
murder of Galanter and be paroled to an undisclosed location in Northern 
California. And Galanter will be forced to find a new equilibrium with her old 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it gets closer, I am reliving lots of what happened," Galanter said of 
Olds' release. "I don't like it any more this time than the last time. It is 
very painful." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be hard for some to recall -- in a city that has since been bombarded 
with the videotaped images of the Rodney G. King beating, the 1992 riots and 
the ongoing O.J. Simpson murder case -- but the stabbing of Galanter in 1987 
was one of the most stunning crimes of its time in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in the spring of that year, in the pre-dawn darkness of Galanter's 
bedroom in Venice. Olds, a drug user and onetime gang member, cut through a 
screen and entered an open kitchen window before plunging a knife twice into 
Galanter's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the victim had just emerged from her relative obscurity as an 
urban planner and environmentalist to become the upstart challenger for a seat 
on the Los Angeles City Council. She amazed police and paramedics by surviving 
her wounds, then inspired voters by staying in the race. In the end, she would 
upset one of the city's most powerful and enduring political figures, City 
Council President Pat Russell, without ever leaving her hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, strangers still approach her in the supermarket to ask 
Galanter about her health. A policeman who was the first to find her that night 
stops to wish her well. And a young woman at a reception praises Galanter for 
her courage, then breaks down and cries. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter has been approached this way time and again, but "it still shakes me 
up and comes at me sort of unexpectedly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking reminder of the crime, though, will come with Olds' release. 
Officials at the state Department of Corrections declined to say exactly where 
the 34-year-old felon will be paroled, and Olds, through a prison spokeswoman, 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections officials said he will be under their supervision for three years. 
He will be forced to report regularly to a parole officer and be subject to 
random home visits. Drug and alcohol tests will be administered. He will have 
to be home each night by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicts are typically paroled into the county where they were convicted, but 
Olds will be released in Northern California, in part because Galanter has 
invoked her right as a victim of violent crime to have her attacker kept at 
least 35 miles from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Galanter, 53, a hard-earned sense of balance will be challenged by Olds' 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 She has taken all the standard precautions. She owns two dogs and a more 
sophisticated alarm system, installed after she joined the City Council. She 
never leaves her windows unlocked at night. Los Angeles police officials have 
assured her they will be closely monitoring Olds' progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emotional weight of her attacker's freedom is still troubling. "I have 
no reason to believe that he has it in for me," Galanter said. "But on the 
other hand, I have a friend who was attacked and raped. . . . When her attacker 
was let out of jail she had no reason to think he would come back, but it was 
very upsetting anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Olds confessed to the attack, but told a jury that he had not intended to harm 
Galanter. He said he came to her two-bedroom bungalow -- across the street from 
a house he shared with a landlady and several other young men -- in search of 
money or merchandise that would get him drugs. He said that he panicked when 
Galanter began to scream and stabbed her to stop the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the jury found that Olds had not planned the attack -- a crucial 
determination that meant he could only be convicted of second-degree attempted 
murder and not a premeditated, first-degree charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference meant that Olds was sentenced to 14 years and four months in 
prison, instead of life. With standard credits for good behavior and work 
assignments, he served a little more than half his time -- an outcome that 
Galanter still finds hard to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing was stolen from the house that night and Galanter told the jury she 
did not scream until after she had been attacked. She still finds it hard to 
believe that Olds did not come to her house intending to hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Galanter said she is not sure why she was attacked. But on one 
point she is clear: "I deeply resented that they didn't find premeditation. And 
the other issue that comes up now, that is getting a lot more attention, is why 
people don't serve all the time they get sentenced to." 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said she is no latecomer to her tough view on criminals. Although she 
is a liberal on most issues, she became a supporter of the death penalty many 
years before her attack, after reading about the kidnap, rape and murder of a 
2-year-old in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been a victim once before. When she was a 24-year-old graduate student 
at Yale she was forced into her car at knifepoint and raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter says: "I thought I had already had my hit in life. When this second 
(attack) came, that made it seem extra unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rape nearly 30 years ago left her without serious physical 
injuries, the marks of the stabbing are ever-present. A small crater behind 
Galanter's left ear marks the spot where the knife was first thrust. A patch of 
white skin remains where a second stab pierced a spot at the top of her 
esophagus. Thin white lines run down both sides of her neck, tracing where the 
surgeons went in to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors' work was remarkably successful, stopping the bleeding of a 
severed carotid artery and patching the tube that takes food to the stomach. 
But four cranial nerves could not be repaired. The result is that half of 
Galanter's vocal cords and the left side of her esophagus remain permanently 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice is thinner and raspier than before, although it has gained much of 
its old strength. When she swallows, there is the odd sensation that only half 
of her gullet is working. And the loss of another nerve has made it impossible 
to raise her arm to vertical or to swim the crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the diminution of her voice that hit Galanter the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had this great resonant voice," said onetime aide Jim Bickhart. "It 
projected really well and it had been a real tool for her in her public life. 
She felt crippled when that was taken from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite frequent throat clearing and some apparent exertion, Galanter 
pronounces her voice now "much better" than before. 
</P>
<P>
 As Olds' release approaches, Galanter said, her emotional condition is harder 
to assess. She said she still gets twinges of anxiety when she sees her 
attacker's identical twin, who was never a suspect in the case, near the 
boarding house where the two once lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The white-haired landlady who owns the house, just across the street, once 
assured the world that Olds was innocent and she still glowers from her front 
step at Galanter. Eugenia Easton said she blames the councilwoman for unwanted 
police attention, then quickly slammed her door in a reporter's face, saying: 
"You people just want to stir up trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Galanter has made many friends in the neighborhood and seen "the best 
side of people," she also can feel suddenly "saddened and disillusioned" 
walking in her neighborhood. It was here, after all, that she almost lost her 
life and that she can no longer open her windows, even on hot summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
 With the days growing shorter, she finds herself hurrying home from walks with 
her dogs, fearful of being caught out after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sometimes makes me nervous," she said, referring to Olds' release. "But at 
the same time, I am going to try to live my life as normally as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Many friends and acquaintances ask why she simply didn't move away. "That was 
something, just to walk back through that door into that house," said Marcela 
Howell, who ran Galanter's campaign against Russell. "It showed a level of 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter has had passing thoughts of moving, but there is an abiding anger 
that keeps her there. "I paid for that house," she said. "I earned the right to 
be in that neighborhood. And I deserve to live there." 
</P>
<P>
 Her perseverance continues to resonate, particularly among women. They are 
most often the ones who stop her to offer their good wishes -- like the young 
woman from Vermont who recently stopped Galanter at a reception to say she 
admired her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what happened to me is the nightmare of every woman who lives 
alone," Galanter said. "So many of the people who talk to me and say they 
prayed for me are women who lived alone." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything positive came out of the attack, Galanter said, it is this quiet 
alliance with people she had never known. "That is really nice. It makes me 
feel like there really is a community here."

HANDWRITING EXPERT THE LAST WORD ON TAGGERS; GRAFFITI: FORENSIC SCIENTIST HELPS 
POLICE CATCH VANDALS BY MATCHING SAMPLES OF THEIR WORK. HIS SERVICES ARE 
INCREASINGLY IN DEMAND IN THE SOUTHLAND AND BEYOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 James (Jay) Black is the taggers' unseen enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Little do they know that the shy man in jeans and running shoes could one day 
take the stand against them and put them away, without ever having met them. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, 47, is a forensic scientist whose work the past dozen years has 
involved forgeries and fraud. But as a handwriting analysis expert, he finds 
himself increasingly used in prosecuting graffiti vandals, otherwise known as 
taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently testified in two trials in Orange County, including one in which 
"Kaya," one of the region's most infamous juvenile taggers, was convicted and 
given a three-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Black is employed by six law enforcement agencies in Orange County, three in 
San Bernardino County and, increasingly, by others around the country. He 
recently was asked to testify in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last two years, he has worked primarily for the Orange Police 
Department in 36 cases involving graffiti, or as Black calls it, "visual 
terrorism, constituting both a property crime and a social crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay is a recognized, court-tested examiner of 'questioned documents,' or to 
paraphrase, he's a handwriting expert," said Orange Police Detective Jack 
Nanigian, who works closely with Black. "Our agency had used him for years on 
forgeries and written document fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, about two years ago, when graffiti vandalism -- especially tagging -- 
exploded, Jay conceived of the idea of using his skills in handwriting analysis 
to identify the authors of graffiti vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Black has proved consistently, Nanigian said, that the characteristics of 
handwriting are the same "for a questioned document as they are for 
spray-painted vandalism on walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Nanigian routinely provides Black with schoolbook covers, folders, lunch 
boxes, backpacks, practice pads, tennis shoes, hats -- any item suspected 
taggers have scrawled on. 
</P>
<P>
 It is primarily the vandal's tag that opens the door for Black. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spelling (of the tag) is one of the first things," Nanigian said. "The 
shape of the letters, the proportionality, the frequency of it being written in 
various locations. . . . If it appears similar to that of other writing 
samples, Jay can usually establish a connection." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "Kaya," a 17-year-old high school dropout suspected in numerous 
acts of graffiti vandalism, Black was able to show that in 45 out of 100 
locations, "the author was ('Kaya')," Nanigian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaya's" work appeared on freeway signs, buildings and signal boxes and often 
was etched in glass throughout central Orange County, Nanigian said. He even 
was suspected of leaving his tag outside the Federal Building in Santa Ana and 
on a sign along the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Black's skill at linking "Kaya" to as many as 45 incidents propelled the 
amount of damage to more than $5,000 -- meaning he could be prosecuted for a 
felony and not just a misdemeanor, a critical factor in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only four ways to nail a tagger," Nanigian said. "You've got to see 
'em do it, somebody else has to see 'em do it, the guilty party confesses, or 
you have a scientific handwriting analysis done to pin it down to a single 
suspect. . . . We don't get too many of the first three, which is the reason 
Jay's so valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs are Black's best pieces of evidence. But on occasion, he checks 
out the markings himself. On a recent muggy morning, he walked stealthily along 
a rutted, gravel road under an overpass, making his way past wary transients 
amid a clutter of broken glass and stolen shopping carts to examine every 
available surface. 
</P>
<P>
 He found plenty of graffiti and several spent cans of spray paint, including 
one with a bullet hole straight through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was put up by gangs," he said, pointing to undistinguished markings that 
read "dark side" -- the name of a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 More scrawlings under the same bridge were the work of taggers, Black said, 
explaining that what the public knows about graffiti is oddly limited, 
considering the millions of dollars in damage it inflicts on property, both 
public and private, and the level of attention it commands from law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers, Black said, tend to be nonviolent and not affiliated with gangs, 
whereas the public assumes that most, if not all, graffiti is the work of 
gun-toting gang members. If graffiti are evident, Black said, the public 
frequently -- and mistakenly -- concludes that gangs are taking over the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Another misconception: That graffiti are the province of the underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the worst tagging is going on in affluent areas of Irvine by affluent 
kids who live in Irvine," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 A father of three who lives in a bucolic area of Lake Forest, Black finds 
himself cast in an unlikely role: He's suddenly well-versed in the culture 
known as hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hip-hop or tagger graffiti is far more artistic than gang graffiti, which I 
don't work with very often," he said. "Members of the hip-hop culture, which 
began in New York in the 1970s and spread west, subscribe to rap music and 
break-dancing and love to spray-paint graffiti, usually in places more visible 
than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fame, artistic expression, power and rebellion are the major motivators of the 
hip-hop culture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Black most enjoys the work for "helping to establish out of a murky situation 
what the truth really is." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also enjoys helping to acquit someone, if the evidence leads him there. 
He also works for defense attorneys, although usually he's helping to convict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like getting somebody off the hook if that's where it takes me," he said. 
"Somewhere in those markings, you can usually find the truth. And, really, all 
I'm after is the truth."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN WEIGHING USE OF HER OWN FUNDS; 
INCUMBENT SAYS THAT DESPITE IMPRESSIONS, MANY FAMILY ASSETS ARE IN HER 
HUSBAND'S NAME AND THEREFORE INACCESSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With signs that Republican Mike Huffington is planning a financially 
unprecedented finish for his U.S. Senate campaign, incumbent Dianne Feinstein 
conceded at a weekend fund-raiser that she probably could not keep up with her 
opponent unless she uses some of her own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein added, however, that her resources are still limited, despite 
impressions that her wealth is comparable to Huffington's. She said federal 
campaign laws prohibit access to most of her family assets because they are in 
her husband's name and not community property. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband cannot contribute to my campaign any more than anyone else can," 
Feinstein said at a fund-raiser Friday evening featuring Vice President Al 
Gore. "What I have is really my half of our home and our beach house and what 
we're looking at is really re-mortgaging that." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein contributed about $3 million to her losing campaign for governor in 
1990 by leveraging the same properties. She said Friday that she is still 
trying to determine how much she can contribute to her Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's need to use her own resources reflects the extraordinarily high 
price of this Senate race, because she is already one of Washington's biggest 
fund-raisers. After nearly two years of raising money for this election, 
Feinstein is on a pace to spend at least 50% more than she needed to unseat 
appointed Republican Sen. John Seymour in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is still being vastly outspent by Huffington, a freshman Santa Barbara 
congressman who is paying for his campaign with a personal fortune gained in 
the sale of his family's Texas oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 With new polls indicating the U.S. Senate candidates are in a close match -- 
if not a dead heat -- the financial strength of the two candidates looms as a 
potentially decisive factor in selecting California's next senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on spending estimates already in, there is little doubt that 
California's race will be the most expensive congressional contest in U.S. 
history, surpassing the previous record of $25 million.

<P>
 By the Nov. 8 election, Feinstein's campaign is expected to spend $12 million 
to $15 million. Huffington, observers say, appears likely to exceed $20 
million, possibly by a significant amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The calculations are based on the last finance statements filed by the 
candidates June 30 and media observers who monitor television stations 
throughout the state to determine how much money the campaigns are spending on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is perhaps the most competitive race in the country and definitely the 
most expensive," said Ken Klein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial 
National Committee in Washington. "We are intensely interested in the 
California race and we are going to do everything we can to help Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein is likely to need the help, despite the fact she has raised more 
money in the last three years than any non-presidential candidate. On Friday, 
media observers around the state reported that Huffington's campaign has been 
purchasing time on television for the last weeks of the campaign at a level 
they have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers estimated that he could spend as much as $2 million in the 
final week alone and almost $5 million in a bit more than the last three weeks. 
One source said that for the last week before the Nov. 8 election, Huffington 
has already spent $400,000 at a single Los Angeles television station. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like, 'We will buy whatever we want to buy and money is no object,' " 
the source said. "The analogy I would make is that Feinstein is driving a Chevy 
and these guys are driving Rolls-Royces. And she's no putz." 
</P>
<P>
 Media observers also said Huffington is buying much more prime time than 
political campaigns can usually afford since each spot costs about triple the 
amount of regular time purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of prime time can be significant for a candidate because it 
takes a much shorter time for the campaign to get its message to a substantial 
number of voters. If the ad is an attack, it can also force the opponent to 
respond with a similar level of spending or take a significantly longer time to 
reach those same voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign officials said the estimates were overstated, but declined 
to say how much they will spend. Kathy Farrell, the media buyer for Huffington, 
said Huffington's buys would be larger than Feinstein's. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has defended his expensive campaign by saying it was necessary 
because he was an unknown congressman at the beginning of the year, while 
Feinstein had spent more than $30 million on her last two statewide campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have complained that Huffington is trying to buy the race with a 
personal fortune estimated at $75 million. Huffington has responded that his 
personal money allows him to be independent from the special interests that 
traditionally influence Washington and politicians like Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said Friday that they are confident they will 
have enough money to be competitive with Huffington, although they expect to be 
outspent throughout the race. The Democratic senator has been saving money for 
a final push when she hopes to substantially close the financial gap with 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser with Gore Friday night was among Feinstein's largest of the 
campaign, taking in more than $200,000. The event for about 250 people included 
a dinner and reception in San Francisco's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has also attended two California fund-raisers for Feinstein, 
raising a total of almost $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to be close to his overall spending (for the campaign)," 
said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata. "But I think we are going to be on 
TV enough that we can drive home our message."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROP. 190; MEASURE'S OPPONENTS ENLIST JUDGE WAPNER'S 
AID; SWEEPING REFORM INITIATIVE WOULD OVERHAUL WIDELY CRITICIZED AGENCY THAT 
METES OUT JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presented with the case of the judges judging other judges, Judge Joseph A. 
Wapner of "People's Court" fame has, of course, reviewed the evidence 
carefully: 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 190, on the Nov. 8 ballot, would dramatically overhaul the 
Commission on Judicial Performance, the judge-dominated state agency that is 
supposed to discipline wayward judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every legal group in California has been pressing for reform of the 
commission, an agency widely criticized as ineffective and overly secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the far-reaching reform proposal sailed through the Legislature, 
earning a sole no vote in both the Assembly and the Senate on its way to the 
ballot. There have been newspaper editorials backing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, is Judge Wapner's opinion: Proposition 190 stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad, bad bill that should not be passed," Wapner said, referring to 
the initiative. "It undermines the independence of the judiciary. It's against 
the separation of powers. I'm very happy to speak out and I sincerely believe 
it's a bad bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Plain-spoken, no-nonsense, blunt, a succinct summing up of the anti-190 
argument -- that's just what opponents of the sweeping judicial-discipline 
reform plan were hoping for when they enlisted Wapner, once voted the most 
recognized judge in America, in their campaign against the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles Superior Court judge who became a TV star during 12 years 
on "People's Court," Wapner is no longer active on the bench. The TV show is in 
reruns. But his star quality immediately swung the spotlight to Proposition 
190, one of three initiatives that were late starters on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 All three, added by the Legislature in the final days of its August session, 
focus on the courts. Proposition 189 would allow judges to deny bail to anyone 
accused of felony sexual assault. Proposition 191 would convert the state's 47 
Justice Courts in rural counties to more-prestigious Municipal Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 All three need only a majority to pass. The Libertarian Party has mustered the 
only opposition to Proposition 189, emphasizing that judges already have the 
authority to jail violent criminals. The only opposition in the state ballot 
pamphlet to Proposition 191 was written by a San Jose attorney who often 
submits contrary ballot arguments when no one else comes up with one. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wapner entered the fray a couple of weeks ago, it was generally agreed 
that Proposition 190 was a sure bet. It still is seen in legal and political 
circles as a likely winner -- but backers, acknowledging Wapner's appeal, have 
taken to downplaying their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I win, it's like Slippery Rock beating Notre Dame, me beating Wapner," 
said Marc Poche, a justice on the 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco 
and a vocal backer of Proposition 190. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Judges Assn., the 1,500-member trade group that recruited 
Wapner to be the front man for the opposition, lacks campaign funds. So Wapner 
is making the rounds of the editorial boards and the radio call-in shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all the judges have," said Warren Ettinger, a former Pasadena 
Municipal Court judge now in private practice in Los Angeles. "They don't have 
credibility. They don't have much money. But they've got Joe Wapner." 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, the San Francisco-based commission is made up of nine 
members -- five judges, two lawyers and two members of the public. It operates 
in the strictest secrecy, purportedly to protect judges from unfounded charges. 
It is authorized to admonish judges privately or recommend to the state Supreme 
Court that a judge be censured or removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 190 would increase the membership of the commission from nine to 
11 -- six members of the public, two lawyers and three judges. The change would 
give the public, not judges, a majority on the panel. The measure would require 
all proceedings to be open after formal accusations are filed against a judge. 
And it would give the commission the authority to remove a judge on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition is not likely to have any significant fiscal impact, according 
to the state's legislative analyst, because the changes are largely procedural. 
</P>
<P>
 But those procedures would radically restructure what was the first judicial 
discipline commission in the United States, created in 1960 and once regarded 
as a model for the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no longer uniformly viewed with such high regard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's job is to investigate misconduct. Some is obvious -- racial 
or gender bias, drug abuse or the taking of bribes. Judges, however, are 
supposed to stay free from even the appearance of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 And although records indicate that the number of complaints soared from 260 in 
1980 to 950 in 1993, the number of cases in which disciplinary action was taken 
increased only from nine in 1980 to 16 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission has not been vigilant and much too willing to tolerate 
improprieties by judges," said USC law professor Edwin Chemerinsky, an 
authority on judicial ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it recommended Sept. 13 that San Diego Superior Court Judge G. Dennis 
Adams be removed from office, the commission had not voted to publicly censure 
or remove a judge for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, accused of improperly accepting gifts, said in a statement that he 
intends to fight for his job. He also said he was "being sacrificed by the 
commission so it can justify its existence to a very critical Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has, indeed, been very critical in recent years of the 
judiciary -- a friction that apparently goes back to the California Supreme 
Court's 1991 decision upholding Proposition 140, a 1990 initiative that imposed 
term limits on elected officials and slashed the Legislature's budget by 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 The next spring, the Legislature threatened to cut the Supreme Court's budget 
-- by precisely 38%. But those threats were not carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 This fiscal year, after years of modest annual increases to the commission's 
budget, the Legislature abruptly increased the panel's budget by $1 million, to 
about $2.4 million -- with the obvious expectation, several experts said, that 
there would be results. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in December, Peter Keane, the chief assistant public defender in San 
Francisco, wrote a scathing article about the commission in a legal newspaper, 
the Daily Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the commission had not voted to remove a single judge in years, 
Keane, a member of the State Bar's board of governors, called it "dead in the 
water." He added that the commission gave the "appearance of being in the 
pocket of the judges whom they are supposed to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the piece were soon circulating in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, in January, the commission announced that it had found "no 
basis" for disciplining Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, who had been under 
investigation for traveling extensively and accepting reimbursement for his 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics, this came as no surprise. The state Supreme Court -- headed by 
Lucas -- appointed the five judges currently on the commission. Another member 
was appointed by former Gov. George Deukmejian, who had appointed his former 
law partner, Lucas, to be the chief justice. Still another member was appointed 
by another Republican governor, Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Keane had written in December: "The California judiciary is a close-connected 
network of people intensely loyal and empathetic to each other as members of 
the same unique club." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the measure Keane helped write shot through both houses. The vote 
in the Assembly was 74-1. In the Senate it was 31-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes, Wapner included, understand the momentum for reform. And judges profess 
not to be bothered by the provision that would open the commission's 
proceedings to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what alarms opponents is that Proposition 190 would give politicians 
-- the governor, the Speaker of the Assembly and the Senate Rules Committee -- 
the power to appoint eight of the 11 members on an expanded commission, with 
three appointments left to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A better plan, judges say, is the one adopted last month by the American Bar 
Assn. that would create a 12-member commission -- four judges, four lawyers, 
four members of the public. The courts would nominate the judges, the State Bar 
would select the lawyers and the politicians would appoint the public members. 
</P>
<P>
 That would eliminate opponents' "separation of powers" concern with an 
11-member panel, that a majority of eight would "take it out on the judicial 
branch of government any time they're displeased with the actions of the 
judiciary," said Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), who cast the sole vote in 
the Senate against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 190 have one more objection -- an ultra-legalistic 
one. The initiative would give the commission the power to write its own rules 
and decide who and how, under those rules, to prosecute, judge and punish. 
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement raises constitutional worries because in the state's trial 
courts, the functions of prosecutor and judge are separate, said Santa Monica 
Superior Court Judge David Rothman, an expert on judicial ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 190 passes, a lawsuit challenging it on such constitutional 
grounds is all but certain, judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Wapner. "I am not a wallflower going to sit idly by and see principle 
going down the drain, and not speak up," he said.

ON CALIFORNIA: BIZARRE! SHOCKING! AND TRUE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a tale of true crime, with slashed throats, courtroom intrigue, 
forensic mysteries and not a single football player. It begins in the night, 
with a dog barking. The dog barks and barks. No one knows why. The barking cuts 
through the quiet of the Gold Rush foothills, bouncing down canyon and ravine, 
invading the sleep of neighbors. It goes on for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "That dog might have stopped to take a breath or two," one neighbor will say 
later, "but it pretty much went throughout the night." 
</P>
<P>
 This recollection is offered in the context of a court case, and not just any 
court case. This is case No. 94-01773, the People of the State of California 
vs. Terry and Susan Lorusso, who, according to the complaint, "did own, keep, 
harbor or maintain dogs, to wit, 'Joshua,' a neutered adult male black lab 
cross, and 'Charity,' a female black lab cross, which by habitual barking, 
howling, crying, baying, whining or any combination, disturbed the rest, sleep, 
quiet or peaceful enjoyment of life of reasonable persons of normal 
sensitiveness residing in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the Lorussos stand accused of owning two bad dogs. In the last 
two years, Joshua and Charity have been cited for violating Tuolumne County's 
dog noise ordinance 36 times. This is believed to be a record for canine 
malfeasance, and it also gives rise to a mystery: Most of the barking citations 
have come after the dogs had their throats cut open by a vet and their voice 
boxes removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something," Terry Lorusso says ominously, "is rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lorusso house sits on a five-acre lot dotted with old oak. It's Sierra 
foothill country, semirural. At the driveway gate, two black dogs bound toward 
a visitor. Charity, the bigger, younger one, uncorks a squeaky bark. She sounds 
like a dog with a sore throat. That she can manage even this amazes the 
Jamestown vet who has operated on her twice, once to remove the voice box, and 
again to scrape away any scar tissue that might help her create sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes Joshua, the more pathetic creature. Joshua, now 11 years old, once 
was top dog. Since the operation, he meekly follows Charity's lead. His 
debarking operation was, it would seem, a complete success. He stands at the 
gate, opens his mouth, and this is what comes out: 
</P>
<P>
 " . " 
</P>
<P>
 Lorusso shakes his head: "That's all he can do. Just blow air." Lorusso is a 
42-year-old antique dealer. He moved here 16 years ago from Cerritos, seeking 
the rural life. Lately, he's seen many new people follow his path. He figures 
this is his main problem -- too many city people jamming into the foothills. 
They complain about his dogs. They complain about his church music. He wonders 
how they'll take his chain saw when it comes time to cut wood. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dog complaints started, Lorusso says, he tried to be a good neighbor. 
He got the dogs "debarked. It was sad to see them, their throats all swollen 
and stitched up." In a short while, however, the citations began to pour in 
again -- most identifying Joshua as the culprit. Lorusso couldn't understand. 
The animal control officers seemed to believe whatever the neighbors said. He 
does not deny that Charity can yelp a little, but not Joshua, and, anyway, 
isn't this supposed to be the country? 
</P>
<P>
 "This land is zoned for animals," he says. "My goats make more noise than 
those dogs. And if I want, I can have 100 peacocks on this property. I can have 
cows, pigs, ducks, donkeys. Do you know what 100 donkeys would sound like?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complainants won't talk to the press, but in court papers they have 
painted Lorusso as a man of "vengeance," who humiliates them and even tries to 
run them off the road in his truck. The dogs, they say, are worse. He counters 
with accusations of harassment, conspiracy and attacks on his dogs with 
shovels. This is a mean one, folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to be railroaded anymore," Lorusso says. "I have spent $1,600 
fighting this junk. I have spent hours in court. I love my dogs, and I am not 
going to get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He has called Oprah, Geraldo, Phil -- everyone who might conceivably help him, 
except maybe Robert L. Shapiro. Lorusso notes happily that the case has become 
an issue in the district attorney's contest, with a challenger accusing the 
incumbent of going harder after dogs than human criminals. So far, though, 
Lorusso has lost most court battles. The latest citations go to trial in 
November. Lorusso promises a new tactic: He will put his dogs on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs," he says, "are the best evidence. They speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Or don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Joshua? 
</P>
<P>
 " . " 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, yeah, tell it to the judge.

SERBS DELAY BOSNIA AID CONVOYS, THREATEN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs delayed aid convoys and refused permission for U.N. helicopter 
flights Saturday. U.N. forces throughout Bosnia were put on alert following 
warning of a rebel attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' moves appeared to be in response to Thursday's air strike by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization on a Bosnian Serb tank near Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb anger was heightened Friday when the U.N. Security Council 
imposed sanctions, banning travel abroad by the rebels' leaders, freezing their 
foreign bank accounts and prohibiting commercial ties with Bosnian 
Serb-occupied areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, threatened Saturday to strike a U.N. 
target after 8 p.m., said Maj. Koos Sol, a U.N. military spokesman. He 
acknowledged that the rebels had issued "a kind of ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate attack, but U.N. troops remained on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Flights into Sarajevo were suspended earlier after the Bosnian Serbs warned 
that they could not guarantee their safety. Bosnian Serb potshots taken at two 
aircraft Friday -- the planes were not hit -- underlined the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs refused to permit U.N. convoys to go through territory they 
control and suspended flight clearances of U.N. helicopters throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of the humanitarian airlift, along with the obstruction of 
relief going to Muslim-dominated regions by road, demonstrated the control 
Bosnian Serbs exercise even in the one-third of Bosnia they do not hold. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sarajevans left without natural gas, electricity and running water for 
the 10th day Saturday -- Bosnian Serbs control utilities into the city -- the 
suspension of the airlift added to the psychological pressure on residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Sarajevo's airport was idled, preparations picked up for the opening 
of Belgrade's main airport for the first time in nearly three years. Seeking to 
reward Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia for its seeming embargo on war supplies to 
Bosnian Serbs, the United Nations on Friday decided to ease some Yugoslav 
sanctions, including a ban on international flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultranationalists in Belgrade said the price for easing sanctions was betrayal 
of the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which is to take effect after a report of monitors on the 
Serbian-Bosnian border is presented to U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, was made despite protests by the Bosnian government, which says 
Serbia continues to supply Bosnian Serbs.

AZERBAIJAN ACCUSES RUSSIA OF MEDDLING; DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT ALIYEV HEADS FOR 
TALKS WITH CLINTON, SEEKING SUPPORT FOR HIS NEW NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moscow has stepped up its meddling in Azerbaijani affairs, Azerbaijani 
President Heydar Aliyev complained as he flew off to Washington for a meeting 
with President Clinton where he hopes to win U.S. support for his new nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev, the 71-year-old former member of the Soviet Politburo, accused Russia 
of interfering in an Azerbaijani oil deal, helping opposition leaders escape 
from jail in Baku, the capital, and demanding that its own troops patrol 
Azerbaijan's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Russian troops pulled out of Azerbaijan in mid-1993, leaving only a 
missile-tracking and electronic-warfare base. Russian border guards now patrol 
nearly every other border in the former Soviet Union, but Aliyev said that the 
Turkish-speaking Muslim republic will refuse to allow Russian soldiers to be 
garrisoned along its frontier with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia wants to put soldiers back on our borders, but we will protect them," 
the president said in an interview Friday. "We will not give up on our 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev hinted that he expects a favorable reception at his meeting with 
Clinton, which is scheduled for Monday. A cease-fire with Armenia in the war 
over the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh has been holding for four months, 
and both sides say prospects for peace are brighter than they have been at any 
time during the six-year conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, last week Azerbaijan signed an $8-billion oil exploration and 
production agreement with a consortium of Western companies. Four U.S. oil 
companies, including Los Angeles-based Unocal, will take part in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats say more active Western support for Azerbaijan would be natural now. 
</P>

 "The balance has changed very fundamentally. It's very positive," one Western 
envoy said. "Azerbaijan has taken a major step to tie itself to the West, to 
cast its economic future in the direction of change toward a market economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The West has done little over the past year as Russia has regained influence 
in its former Caucasian territories, particularly Azerbaijan and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia had objected to the Azerbaijan offshore oil deal, saying the landlocked 
Caspian Sea's oil deposits belong to all the bordering nations. The deal went 
through after the Russian national oil company, Lukoil, was given a 10% share, 
but on the day of the signing the Russian Foreign Ministry repeated its 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after the oil contract was signed, four leading opponents of Aliyev's 
regime broke out of a prison on the sixth floor of Azerbaijan's local KGB 
headquarters in what appeared to be an unusually well-planned escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev was so unnerved that he cleared all the country's television channels 
for a live speech to rally his nation of 7 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those responsible were the same outside forces that helped Armenia in the war 
against Azerbaijan," the president said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course he meant it was Russia," a senior Azerbaijani official said. "They 
still control people in the KGB, even the army here. The Russians were very 
unhappy about the oil contract being signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is trying to re-create the Soviet Union," the official said. "We are 
under huge pressure. If the West does not resist, they will find a new 
confrontation. The Americans will find themselves with a strong nuclear Russia 
once again." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said he suspects Russia will seek to arm or support loyalists of 
the four escapees -- one of whom is the rebel leader of Azerbaijan's ethnic 
Talysh region -- to undermine the Baku government. He said Russia has used such 
tactics before in attempts to regain control in Georgia, Tajikistan and the 
breakaway southern Russian republic of Chechnya.

 Officials stopped trucks and handed out antibiotics Saturday to people fleeing 
a deadly plague outbreak in western India in an effort to keep the disease from 
spreading to the country's major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumonic plague, a strain of the bubonic plague, or "Black Death," that 
ravaged 14th-Century Europe and Asia, has so far killed at least 51 people in 
Surat, a city on India's Arabian Sea coast about 600 miles southwest of New 
Delhi.Surat's civil hospital was treating 359 cases Saturday, and officials 
declared the city a disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government flew 8 million capsules of antibiotics to Surat, Indian 
television said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bombay, officials stopped 4,000 trucks and sprayed them with anti-flea 
insecticides, an official said. The plague is spread to people by fleas that 
have bitten infected rats.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; CHRISTOPHER, CARTER MEET IN BID TO EASE TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Saturday with former President Jimmy 
Carter in a 2 1/2-hour session in Plains, Ga., designed to ease tensions 
between the two men and between Carter and the Clinton White House over foreign 
policy issues -- particularly the situation in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who has occasionally come under criticism for his handling of the 
Administration's foreign policy, was said to have been critical of Carter's 
involvement in negotiating the recent settlement with Haiti's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the secretary was said to have been deeply hurt when Carter 
lashed out at the State Department last week, calling it incompetent and 
suggesting -- incorrectly -- that U.S. officials had not been talking to 
Haiti's military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, State Department officials and foreign policy experts in 
Congress had expressed some concern that Carter had not hewed closely enough to 
U.S. policy in negotiating the terms of an agreement in which Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras and other Haitian military leaders would step down to allow the return 
of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said Saturday that the meeting between 
Christopher, who once served in the Carter Administration, and the former 
President had been cordial and constructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher expressed the Administration's gratitude to the former President 
for "his help in negotiating the arrangements that allowed the U.S.-led force 
to land in Haiti without opposition," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the discussions, both men indicated that there will be an improvement 
in future communications and coordination between Carter and the 
Administration, the official said.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; IN THE CAPITAL, U.S. SOLDIERS KEEP TO THEMSELVES; 
MILITARY: SOME LOCAL DENIZENS, LIKE PROSTITUTES, ARE DISAPPOINTED. BUT MOST 
RESIDENTS HAVE BARELY NOTICED THE OCCUPATION.

 The women standing in front of the waterfront hotel had put on bright 
lipstick, tight miniskirts and big smiles. The soldiers were in town and 
business was going to be great. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Americans weren't calling on the Roxy Hotel prostitutes, even though 
thousands of the troops were living and working at Port-au-Prince's main 
seaport just across Harry Truman Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for brief forays into the streets to move equipment or just to make 
their presence known, the 10,000 U.S. troops who have been arriving since 
Monday are living, working and playing in near-invisibility at their temporary 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been that way for most of Haiti; the U.S. soldiers have been largely out 
of sight if not out of mind and have interfered only indirectly in the lives of 
ordinary Haitians, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, having thousands of foreign soldiers suddenly descend is bound to 
change lives, even if they are welcome soldiers who have come to eliminate a 
military dictatorship and restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there are the working girls at the Roxy and the nearby My Dream 
Hotel, who thought the invasion was like having gold fall on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out and bought these new clothes," said Monique, a shiny-faced girl of 
perhaps 17, who, along with many prostitutes here, comes from the neighboring 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there would be a lot of boys, that I would make a lot of money," 
said Monique, who Frenchified her name from Maria because "it sounds sexier to 
an American, no?" 
</P>
<P>
 A companion, another Dominican who calls herself Teri, said: "I'm going back 
to the Jaragua (a Las Vegas-style hotel in Santo Domingo, the Dominican 
capital) as soon as I can. These Americans can't even go out at night, and the 
Haitian men are either afraid or don't have any money. For me, this invasion is 
a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses, mainly those run by or catering to the wealthy, are 
suffering, but not from any American plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo, a well-appointed jewelry store that sells baubles from Tiffany's and 
perfume from Chanel to the elegant women of the wealthy suburb of Petionville, 
has closed for the duration because its clients are afraid to go into the 
streets. "The ladies think the Americans or the poor will bother them," said a 
Russo employee, so "they stay home." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Saturday morning that a three-vehicle Army patrol drove the 
seven miles from its airport base to Petionville. They drove with far more 
caution, patience and skill than almost any Haitian, and traffic flow actually 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the occupation of the northern city of Cap Haitien by 1,800 
Marines, the U.S. forces have yet to move outside the Port-au-Prince area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to establish a secure environment," said one Army captain, 
using military-speak for keeping order, "not interfere with people's lives. If 
we didn't seem so unusual, I doubt that most people would know we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not exactly the case, even if the foreigners are treading lightly. 
Thousands of people still gather every day outside the U.S. facilities, mostly 
to gawk at the troops and watch the arrival and departure of the large military 
planes and ships. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no curfews, no closed areas other than the three main bivouac 
and work bases, no stops and searches. Also missing are the bar fights, the 
boisterous shouting in restaurants, the insensitive remarks about the local 
people and culture -- behavior often found when young and bored soldiers 
congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be like England during the war," said a onetime Haitian 
diplomat, referring to the old chestnut about U.S. soldiers during World War 
II: 
</P>
<P>
 "Overpaid, oversexed and over here." 
</P>
<P>
 But "it seems different here," the diplomat said. "They are polite, smile and 
go about their business." If the presence of the soldiers has one way or 
another closed some Haitian stores, many businesses that have reopened did so 
to applause and patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," said a U.S. Air Force colonel who has witnessed other occupations. 
"The main impact right now is psychological and emotional, and that does affect 
people. But life will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to worry about is down the road a few weeks and months when just 
our presence will start to irritate people. Ask me then how we've changed lives 
here. It'll be a lot."

MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATH OF U.S. STUDENT IN MOSCOW; RUSSIA: POLICE CALL IT 
SUICIDE, CORONER CALLS IT MURDER. CLASSMATE WHO FOUND THE BODY THINKS IT WAS AN 
ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An American exchange student from Brown University has been found dead outside 
his Moscow dormitory, and although police insist that the death was a suicide, 
the coroner's report calls it murder. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports quoting unnamed faculty members and other sources at the Russian 
State University for the Humanities suggest that the death of Anthony Riccio, 
21, may have been the work of local gangsters who had been renting out space 
from a university that has a reputation for financial improprieties. But a 
classmate who found the body said he thought it was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police insist that the outgoing and energetic young man who had been studying 
Russian since grade school hanged himself from a balcony two floors above his 
dormitory room just 10 days after arriving in Moscow. Riccio's family and 
classmates call that an unlikely scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Riccio loved Russia. When he was in grade school, he told his father, 
"How can we have peace with Russia if we can't speak to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Riccio's death comes on the eve of a U.S.-Russian summit at which Russia's 
efforts to combat its soaring crime and lawlessness are sure to be on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin hopes to convince the West that Russia is now 
stable, ready for full economic partnership and ripe for Western investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Western governments need assurances that Russia can stop the 
dangerous leakage of nuclear materials from the creaky former Soviet military 
complex. And Western businesses need assurances that Russia is curbing the 
organized crime that has become a serious threat to economic development here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is only one problem: the bandits. The gangsters," Izvestia economics 
columnist Mikhail Berger said in an interview last week. "Neither the taxes nor 
the political risks create problems as serious as the gangsters do. . . . This 
is a real national problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Riccio's father, John Riccio, said he would not want his son's death to 
discourage travel and exchange programs in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have happened in New York City or Boston," Riccio said in a 
telephone interview from his home in Glastonbury, Conn. "We would support these 
programs. If we had to do it again, we'd do it again -- and Anthony certainly 
would." 
</P>
<P>
 Riccio described his son, who was a junior in the Russian studies program at 
Brown University in Providence, R.I., as "very effervescent" and "unique." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not dismiss the possibility of suicide but said that was a side 
of his son's personality he had never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Riccio arrived in Moscow on Sept. 10 to study under a program run 
by the American Collegiate Consortium and moved into the dormitory on the 
southern outskirts of Moscow on Sept. 14, the Moscow Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
 John Riccio said he had a telephone conversation with his son Sept. 12 and 
that he sounded "normal." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very nice guy," a dormitory suite-mate named Maxim said Saturday. 
"He liked listening to (the rock band) Queen and was very joyful. He liked 
jokes and to laugh." He said Riccio had been homesick a day or two before his 
death but said he thought the death was accidental, not murder or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Investigator Rafik M. Khuseinov said Riccio went from his 
14th-floor room to the 16th floor Tuesday and tried to hang himself from the 
balcony but was too tall. So he climbed onto the balcony railing and threw 
himself off, Khuseinov said, breaking the rope as he fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely not a murder case," the investigator said. "Nobody heard 
any noise or struggle or shouts." Moreover, Riccio had little money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, authorities said a rope was found around Riccio's neck. But Maxim, 
who said he was among the students who found Anthony's body in a pool of blood 
about 6:45 p.m. Tuesday, said there was no rope, and the coroner's report, 
which calls the death a homicide, does not mention one. In the Russian army, 
where hazing deaths are not uncommon, the official cause of death is nearly 
always listed as suicide by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxim said Riccio had been in the dorm only six days, knew no one, had no 
enemies and was not even expensively dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a smoker and used to go to a balcony to smoke," he said. "I really do 
not know why he did not go to our balcony." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maxim disputed media reports that "strangers" were living in the 
dormitory, and he said police and university officials make security spot 
checks on the dormitory in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other American students who lived in the dorm were moved to another 
dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 John Riccio said the family intends to have an autopsy performed in the United 
States.

DEMOGRAPHICS FAVOR RACIAL PARITY FOR O.J. SIMPSON JURY; COURTS: THE DISTRICT IN 
WHICH THE CASE IS TO BE HEARD HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BLACKS THAN THE 
COUNTYWIDE POPULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Juries in many Los Angeles County courthouses are disproportionately white, 
except in the court district where O.J. Simpson will be tried, according to a 
demographer and a former county jury official. 
</P>
<P>
 The central court district, where Simpson's case will be heard, has a larger 
percentage of African Americans than the countywide population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a defense attorney I would fight tooth and nail to keep the case in 
the central district," said Edgar Butler, a demographer and professor of 
sociology at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes the racial disparity to competition for jurors among Los Angeles 
County's 11 court districts and a requirement that jurors be allowed to serve 
within 20 miles of home. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys of actual jurors in the central district show they are about 46% 
white, 25% black, 19% Latino and 10% Asian, according to Richard Gabriel, an 
associate of Trial Logistics, the Pasadena jury consulting firm hired by 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Of county residents who are eligible to serve on juries, 58% are white, 20% 
Latino, 14% black, 7.5% Asian and Pacific Islander, according to 1990 figures 
from the office of the jury commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal defendant has the right to be tried in the court district in which 
the crime occurred. Even though Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman were killed in Brentwood, prosecutors decided to try Simpson in the 
central district in Downtown Los Angeles, making it substantially more likely 
that African Americans will be on his jury. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, juries are supposed to be racially representative of the court 
district in which the defendant will be tried. Racial representation can vary 
according to how the district is defined. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County judges have held that juries must only reflect the racial 
makeup of legislatively defined judicial districts, which allows juries in the 
outer districts to be dominated by whites, said Raymond F. Arce, retired deputy 
executive officer for Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a court in Malibu, for example," said Arce, who oversaw juror 
services until he retired in December, 1992. "I would very seriously doubt the 
court in Malibu gets anywhere near the county demographic figures with respect 
to blacks or Latinos -- ever." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 county survey of people who reported for jury duty showed one 
courthouse on the Westside had a jury pool that was 79% white, compared to 48% 
white in the central courthouse Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 25 years, juries across the nation have undergone major 
changes. Before the passage of a 1968 federal law, most jurors were chosen by a 
jury commissioner from a select group of upstanding citizens in the community. 
They were mostly white, middle-class men. Today's juries contain more women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 17% of the adult American public has served on a trial, according to the 
1990 study, and only 45% have been called to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County selects jurors from voter registration and Department of 
Motor Vehicle lists. The county mails out more than 3 million questionnaires a 
year to determine who is eligible to serve. Jurors must be citizens, 18 or 
older, and have no felony record. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Gomez, manager of juror services for the county, said only 15% to 18% 
of the residents mail back the questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 The office of the jury commissioner then mails out about 400,000 to 500,000 
summons a year. About half of those who are summoned perform jury duty, 
according to Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who are excused claim financial hardship because their employers 
do not pay for jury service, Arce said, or they obtain medical excuses from 
their doctors.

new Transportation Department rules.In addition, the department is launching an 
investigation of airline ticket marketing practices. The new on-time 
performance rule takes effect Jan. 1, requiring that airlines include delays 
due to mechanical problems in their monthly reports. And the department 
proposed to increase the limit on compensation to travelers whose baggage is 
mishandled to $1,850. The current limit, set a decade ago, is $1,250. In

FORMER NASA RESEARCHER TO BE DEPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former NASA researcher has been ordered deported as a suspected North Korean 
agent following a hearing at which he was not allowed to see all the evidence 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jong-Hun Lee denied any wrongdoing Saturday and said he is being punished for 
refusing to spy on the communist country.Lee, 48, a Canadian citizen, said he 
is of North Korean descent but was born and raised in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been in this country since 1990 on a temporary work visa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was ordered back to Canada on Friday by federal immigration Judge Michael 
Suarez, partly on the basis of classified FBI information that Suarez refused 
to divulge to either Lee or his attorney, Herbert Gee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said neither he nor his lawyer was allowed to attend the government's 
closing statements Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Lee initiated the hearing himself when he petitioned for permanent 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he was shown no evidence that Lee actually collected 
information for North Korea. But Suarez cited Lee's past relationship with 
Korean scientists living in Japan and said he could be subject to pressure from 
the North Korean government because he has a brother who moved there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee first came to the United States in 1983, and conducted research on 
high-speed flight for NASA until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee claims the FBI agents asked him in 1985 to spy on North Korea for the 
United States and Canada and he is now being punished for his refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials could not be reached on Saturday. An FBI 
spokesman said he could not comment because his office was not involved in the 
matter.

AMES CASE PROMPTS KEY CIA MEETINGS; ESPIONAGE: DIRECTOR WOOLSEY MEETS WITH TOP 
STAFF BEFORE DECIDING ON POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE FOR THOSE WHO FAILED TO STOP THE 
SOVIET SPY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey has been meeting with his top staff for the past 
three days to decide what to do about the counterintelligence failures that 
allowed Soviet spy Aldrich H. Ames to operate for nine years, according to CIA 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope and depth of those failures were outlined in a classified 400-page 
report by CIA Inspector General Frederick P. Hitz after an eight-month inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed that Ames, a veteran agency counterintelligence officer, 
gave information that enabled Moscow to identify up to 34 U.S. -- or allied -- 
paid Russian agents, and exposed 55 clandestine operations. At one point, 
according to the report, Ames' disclosures, beginning in 1985, virtually closed 
down intelligence operations involving Russian agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh E. (Ted) Price, the deputy director for operations and the CIA's 
third-ranking official, is not participating in Woolsey's sessions because he 
is one of several veteran, high-ranking officers who face possible censure 
because of their roles in the Ames case, according to sources inside and 
outside the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988-89, when the agency's internal hunt for a possible Soviet mole was all 
but halted, Price was deputy director and then director of the CIA 
counterintelligence center that had prime responsibility for the internal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Present and former senior officials from the CIA security office, whose early 
investigations into Ames' excessive spending bogged down in bureaucratic 
infighting, were sharply criticized in the report and also face disciplinary 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials, including Woolsey, are sensitive to the impact any personnel 
actions could have on the already low morale at the agency, where budget cuts, 
concern about the post-Cold War mission, the Ames case and charges of racial 
and sexual harassment have contributed to an atmosphere of tension and 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's report accepts statements by Ames that he began spying 
in early 1985 because he was divorced, wanted to remarry and needed money. Over 
the next nine years, he received more than $2 million and had been promised 
another $1 million or more by the new Russian government before his arrest in 
February. In April, Ames pleaded guilty to espionage and tax charges and was 
sentenced to life in prison.

 A jury in Anchorage awarded $9.7 million on to six Alaska Native corporations 
and a borough that sued over land damages caused by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil 
spill.The verdict in Anchorage Superior Court disappointed the plaintiffs, who 
sought more than $120 million. "It doesn't come anywhere close to what's been 
damaged," said Charles Totemoff, president of the Chenega Corp. He testified 
during the three-month trial that people in his village are still reluctant to 
eat fish and game taken from the spill area. Other testimony focused on whether 
the oil affected the value of remote, sparsely populated land that produces 
little or no income.

 Gerry Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, began 
a nine-city U.S. tour in Boston, the most Irish of American cities. The Sinn 
Fein leader appealed to British Prime Minister John Major to work for peace in 
the wake of the cease-fire declared by the IRA in its guerrilla war against 
British rule of Northern Ireland.Adams will tour the United States for two 
weeks, primarily seeking to raise support among Irish Americans. About 100 
cheering Sinn Fein supporters greeted Adams at the Boston airport where he was 
met by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). The trip is Adams' second to the 
United States this year and the first since the IRA called the cease-fire Aug.

 A Santa Monica police sergeant, shot twice in an exchange of gunfire with an 
alleged hit-and-run driver in Van Nuys on Friday, has been released from a 
hospital in good condition, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ralph Bauer, a 23-year veteran of the Santa Monica Police Department, was 
released from Northridge Hospital Medical Center just a few hours after he was 
shot in the neck and back Friday evening.Authorities said Bauer's bulletproof 
vest saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, 49, had been returning to Santa Monica on his motorcycle after 
completing an accident investigation in North Hollywood when he was flagged 
down by motorists at the scene of a hit-and-run accident. He was shot while 
looking for the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police booked Brian Goff, 30, as a suspect in the shooting.

MAN KILLED BY TRAIN IN APPARENT SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley man in his early 20s apparently killed himself Friday 
night by walking into the path of an oncoming Metrolink train in Northridge, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that as the Moorpark-bound train neared Louise Avenue 
about 6:20 p.m. a man was seen walking along the center of the track, Metrolink 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. Repeated soundings of the train's horn did not 
deter the man, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains have struck and killed 26 people since operations began in 
1992. Nine of those fatalities were determined to be suicides, according to 
Metrolink.

U.S. VOLCANO EXPERTS STAGE DRILLS IN MAMMOTH LAKES AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of eight U.S. Geological Survey volcano experts has completed a 
weeklong training exercise at Mammoth Lakes to check on emergency procedures in 
case of a volcanic eruption in the vicinity. But the team leader said the 
exercise did not mean the scientists expect an eruption soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an exercise to test our response should something happen," said David 
Hill of the Geological Survey's regional headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. "We 
wanted to be sure we would be able to operate locally, to test our personal 
computers and our monitoring technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Seismicity, often a precursor of volcanic activity, rose slightly last year, 
he said, but this year has declined. Still, he said, ground deformation in 
Mammoth in recent years has been 10 times that noted on California's most 
prominent fault, the San Andreas, so Mammoth is a natural place to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geological Survey has closely monitored the Mammoth area since 1980, when 
a cluster of four magnitude 6 earthquakes sparked fears of volcanic activity in 
an area where it had occurred as recently as 500 years ago. Mammoth Mountain is 
a volcano, and the adjacent Long Valley Caldera was the site 700,000 years ago 
of one of the most powerful eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said total surface uplift just east of Mammoth Lakes, where studies have 
indicated an eventual eruption would be most likely, has been about two feet 
since 1980. But even greater uplifts have occurred elsewhere in the world, such 
as near Naples, Italy, over the same period, with no eruption, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing slow changes in subterranean pressure in the Mammoth area which 
could go on for decades as far as we know without anything happening," he said. 
"This bears watching, and we are watching, but there is no cause for alarm at 
this point."

CHILDREN CALLED KEY POLITICAL ISSUE; REPORT: ADVOCACY GROUP URGES VOTERS TO 
BACK CANDIDATES WHO FOCUS ON YOUNGSTERS' NEEDS. PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION, SAFETY 
AND HEALTH DETAILED. 
</P>

<P>
 A nonpartisan children's advocacy group on Saturday urged voters to select 
political candidates who make the interests of California's children their top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now of Los Angeles issued its fifth annual report outlining various 
critical problems many children face in education, safety, health and economic 
security. The report will be submitted to the Wilson Administration and the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must elect leaders who will create policies that put the interests of 
children first by investing in the right start for every child," said Lois 
Salisbury, executive director of the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only then will we get the return on the investment that California needs to 
remain a thriving and unique state." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which consists of educators and business leaders from 
throughout California, urged voters to ask candidates at the local, state and 
national levels where they stand on children's issues before going to the polls 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's statewide findings, which were mostly based on 1992 
statistics collected from various state and federal agencies that track the 
well-being of children in California's 58 counties: 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty-four percent of fourth-graders could not fully understand a basic 
reading assignment, while 20% of eighth-graders could not write a basic essay. 
In Los Angeles County, the percentages were 29% and 26%, respectively. They 
were 17% and 14% in Orange County, and 18% and 15% in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although the high school dropout rate has fallen in recent years, fewer than 
one-third of students who finish high school are adequately prepared for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 * The largest number of children killed by guns die in the seven major 
counties where gun sales are the highest. The counties are Los Angeles, Orange, 
San Diego, Alameda, San Bernardino, Riverside and Sacramento. A total of 432 
children were killed by guns in Los Angeles County in 1992. In Orange County, 
there were 37 such deaths, and there were five in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Every year more than 4,000 California babies die before their first 
birthday, including at least 1,421 in Los Angeles County, 280 in Orange County 
and 72 in Ventura County. The group blamed many of these deaths on the lack of 
proper prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly 1.7 million California schoolchildren cannot afford to buy lunch and 
are enrolled in the school free lunch program, including 616,711 in Los Angeles 
County, 96,325 in Orange County and 27,541 in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture for all children is grim, but it is particularly disturbing for 
African American and Latino children," said the report, noting that California 
is the first state to have a majority of its children, or 56%, be African 
American, Latino, Asian or Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mostly critical, the document cited signs of improvement in some 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are heartened by the improvements that we can identify," said James P. 
Steyer, president of Children Now. "Although they are not as extensive as we 
would like, they prove that good programs do exist and conditions can be turned 
around. But it requires constant pressure from the public to demand that our 
elected officials do right by our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Improvement was in the decreasing high school dropout rate and in the number 
of students who are prepared for college on a statewide basis, Steyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's political platform calls for proper health care for every child 
and family, early childhood education, quality care for needy children, 
economic security for all children and their families, quality education, and a 
safe and nurturing environment for all children.

CLINTON VISITS 4 STATES IN CAMPAIGN SWING; POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO 
RAISE $1 MILLION FOR DEMOCRATS. BUT SOME CANDIDATES GO TO LENGTHS TO DISTANCE 
THEMSELVES FROM HIM AND HIS POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, flexing his presidential fund-raising muscle, set out on a 
four-state tour this weekend designed to boost the Democrats' campaign war 
chest and bolster any beleaguered candidates willing to accept his help. 
</P>
<P>
 With his own poll ratings in a swoon, many candidates in this fall's midterm 
elections have decided to distance themselves from Clinton and the struggles of 
his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly aware that he is unpopular in some quarters, the President is making 
appearances on candidates' behalf only when asked and is otherwise confining 
himself to fund-raising events among the party faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 This trip -- his first major campaign tour of the season -- is expected to be 
a fruitful one, raising more than $1 million in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other presidents have raised far more in similar fund-raising swings. 
Indeed, some have raised $1 million at one event. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stop in Chicago on Friday night, the President headed Saturday for two 
fund-raising events in Minneapolis -- one for the Minnesota Democratic Farm 
Labor Party and another for U.S. Senate candidate Ann Wynia. He was scheduled 
to attend a fourth event, for Senate candidate Alan Wheat in Kansas City, 
before flying to New York today, where he will make one more pitch for funds 
and meet with foreign leaders gathering for the opening of the U.N. General 
Assembly. The President will address the assembly Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even candidates who appeared with the President over the weekend were somewhat 
cautious in their embrace of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Wynia, the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate in Minnesota, lives in one of 
the most consistently liberal states in the union and is vying for the seat 
once held by Hubert H. Humphrey. The Senate seat is now held by Republican Dave 
Durenberger, who is retiring. An earnest, low-key campaigner in the tradition 
of the state's Democrats, Wynia is running against conservative Rep. Rod Grams 
and offers the Democrats one of its best chances to gain a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wynia apparently gaining in a close race -- a new WCCO-TV poll Saturday 
showed her leading 44% to 38% -- her campaign aides saw a Clinton visit as a 
moneymaker with minimal political risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's much of a help, nor does he do much harm -- but he does 
help raise money," said Kevin Chandler, Wynia's communications director. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, in her remarks at a fund-raiser that drew about 1,500 people, Wynia 
made a point of putting some daylight between herself and the President. 
</P>
<P>
 While she and Clinton are strongly united in their fervent opposition to 
Washington gridlock, "there are issues on which he and I will not always 
agree," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, John Marty, skipped Clinton's 
appearance at a $1,000-a-plate luncheon, saying it conflicted with his 
principle of avoiding big-money contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheat, the candidate for retiring Missouri Sen. John C. Danforth's seat, also 
insisted on some distance. "I hope people understand that members of Congress 
are not robots. We do not blindly do what the President says." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheat, who has the strong backing from organized labor in Missouri, split with 
Clinton last fall on the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheat has several good reasons to invite a President who makes some Democrats 
uneasy. With little name recognition, he is trailing far behind his rival, 
former Gov. John Ashcroft, and needs the attention and money a presidential 
visit can generate. 
</P>
<P>
 In his stump speeches, Clinton focused on progress he has made in 20 months in 
office. He mostly cited economic issues, saying 4.3 million jobs have been 
created, $250 billion is being cut from the federal deficit and taxes have been 
cut for 15 million working families while only the wealthiest 1.2% is paying 
higher income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech in Kansas City, Clinton turned up his denunciation of Republicans 
as a party of politicians who denounce government but won't give up their jobs, 
and who prefer obstruction to looking for solutions to the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have peddled fear and division and diversion, with unconscionable 
distortion, for so long that they feel no guilt whatever in whatever they say," 
Clinton said.

HIGH COURT OKS VOTE IN BLACK DISTRICT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the November election in a specially drawn, 
black-majority congressional district to proceed by staying a lower court 
ruling against the voting plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of white plaintiffs who live in the 11th Congressional District sued 
the state earlier this year, accusing the state Legislature of racial 
gerrymandering in drawing its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this 
month declared the Georgia district unconstitutional and blocked the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court order issued late Friday stays that ruling until the full 
court can hear the appeal. Larry Chesin, one of the plaintiff's lawyers, said 
he didn't expect the full court to rule until June.

<P>
 Pacific Bell's Message Center malfunctioned for the second time in a little 
more than a month Friday, losing thousands of customers' messages. 
</P>
<P>
 PacBell officials were still trying to determine the cause of Friday evening's 
outage, which affected customers in area codes 415, 510, 408 and 707. Since its 
debut in 1991, the Message Center has been plagued by problems, generally due 
to call overloads or computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Message Center has about 400,000 customers statewide. Many customers were 
without service for more than four hours Friday, PacBell spokeswoman Judy 
Peterson said.

1,000 TURN OUT TO RALLY AGAINST PROPOSITION 187; POLITICS: A LATINO LEADER

REGISTRATION DRIVE BEGINS.

 A thousand opponents of Proposition 187 paraded down the main street of this 
heavily Latino community in the Valley's first mass rally against the state 
initiative that would cut public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was staged by a new coalition of churches and Latino leaders who 
said they formed to counter the anti-immigrant message being promoted by the 
measure's backers, including Gov. Pete Wilson. One said passage of the 
proposition would "kill the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they were trying to counteract a sense of defeatism about the 
measure, which polls show is heavily favored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just sit back and let the polls and news articles lull us into a 
sense of defeat," said Bert Corona, executive director of Hermandad Mexicana 
Nacional, a North Hollywood immigrant assistance organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, dubbed the Save Our State initiative by its proponents, seeks 
to discourage illegal immigration by denying publicly funded benefits to those 
who cannot prove legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 It would bar illegal immigrants from enrollment in all public schools and 
colleges, deny them non-emergency health care, cut off a host of other 
state-funded and locally funded programs and require law enforcement agencies 
to turn in suspected illegal immigrants for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents contend that the measure would cripple the state's economy by 
cutting off millions of dollars in federal assistance and that it would 
inhumanely deprive hundreds of thousands of children of their hope for a better 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said that the priests of several Catholic parishes in the Valley 
proposed the anti-187 campaign and that the coalition now includes about 12 
churches and eight community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona said Saturday's rally, which took the form of a community parade, was 
the launch of a voter registration drive that will take volunteers to 
supermarkets, swap meets, churches and door to door over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As the march got under way, several hundred people carrying signs, pushing 
baby strollers and chanting "Wilson No, Raza Si," followed the Pacoima 
Elementary School drum corps down Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Festive onlookers joined the procession that included a mariachi band, 
costumed Mexican Indian dancers and a child folkloric group as it made its way 
a mile and a half from the Boys & Girls Club of Pacoima to Mary Immaculate 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Several priests and community businessmen marched at the head of the line 
along with the 76-year-old Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Blending with the usual Saturday morning throng of marriage entourages in the 
church parking lot, the crowd chanted slogans in Spanish and cheered half a 
dozen speakers who exhorted them from atop a truck bed podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the speakers, Northeast Valley Councilman Richard Alarcon, the grandson 
of Mexican immigrants, called Proposition 187 "paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to recent studies concluding that illegal immigrants absorb more in 
public services than they pay in taxes, Alarcon said, "The studies are against 
us, but history is on our side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson and supporters of 187 want to live in the past when they put 
Mexicans in their place and the blacks lived in one part of the city," Alarcon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the finale, Corona led a chant and then delivered a fiery speech in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't allow this proposition to pass because to do so would be to kill the 
American dream," he declared. "If 187 passes, this would not be a free country 
for all." 
</P>
<P>
 * A SEPARATE PATH: Despite leadership opposition, grass-roots liberals and 
Latinos support Prop. 187. A1

FINAL SCENES NEAR IN BATTLE OVER ESTATE OF FILMMAKER TOBY HALICKI; COURTS: 
DEBTS HAVE EATEN AWAY AT THE WEALTH. WIDOW SAYS THE FIVE-YEAR DISPUTE HAS 
BANKRUPTED HER FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. 
</P>

 She comforted O.J. Simpson after his wife's murder. She was there when he 
bolted from the Encino home she shares with Simpson confidant Robert 
Kardashian. And she delivered an emotional, televised defense of the men she 
credits with saving Simpson's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, like Simpson, Denice Shakarian Halicki is going to court in what promises 
to be the legal climax of a convoluted and bitter fight over the estate of her 
late husband, filmmaker and car-crash king Henry B. (Toby) Halicki. 
</P>
<P>
 Halicki, Kardashian's tall, graceful fiancee, said the five-year legal dispute 
has bankrupted her financially and emotionally, leaving her dependent on 
Kardashian for everything from gifts to groceries to legal contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to me is a horror," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her late husband's vast, multimillion-dollar legacy included film and video 
rights to his B-grade cult classic "Gone in 60 Seconds" -- which cost less than 
$100,000 to make and produced $40 million; about 200 acres of ranch land; eight 
acres in Palos Verdes, and a huge collection of vintage toys, cars and 
memorabilia, once reputed to be among the largest of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially valued at $14.7 million, the court-appointed administrator has 
stated that the estate could end up insolvent once debts are paid -- including 
an estimated $600,000 in administrative and legal fees so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about how it dwindled to that point have consumed more than 10 
volumes of court records and an estimated 100 hearings, and may be resolved in 
a series of related trials that began last week. All involve the 38-year-old 
widow, a former model and actress, in a three-sided battle against two 
brothers-in-law and the estate's administrator, lawyer J. Patrick McCarroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of an estate consumed by costs and fees had occurred to Toby 
Halicki, who wrote by hand in a margin of his one-page will: "Split the money, 
guys, and have a good time. No probate." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Halicki came to Los Angeles at age 15 with nothing but a knowledge of 
cars and auto salvaging gained from the family business in New York that had 
fed him and 12 siblings.  
</P>
<P>
 He built up his own junkyard, then started making and starring in low-budget 
films whose titles reflected his background, such as "The Junkman," and 
"Deadline Auto Theft." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone in 60 Seconds," released in 1974, chronicled the world of auto theft and 
chop shops, and its massive car-chase scene foreshadowed the one in "The French 
Connection." Though thin on characterization and other subtleties, it became an 
instant hit with car-crazy teen-agers and, according to one of Denice Halicki's 
attorneys, grossed $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He married Denice, his girlfriend of six years, three months before he was 
killed while filming and co-starring with her in a sequel to his greatest hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone in 60 Seconds II" was to have been a car-stealing, car-crashing 
extravaganza featuring a Bonnie-and-Clyde-like couple. But Toby Halicki, 48, 
died in a key stunt when he was crushed by a falling utility pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Denice Halicki grew up in Los Angeles, attended Oral Roberts University, the 
conservative Christian school in Tulsa, Okla., and came from a family so 
traditional she says relatives on her Armenian father's side (her mother was 
Norwegian) tried to arrange her marriage when she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she met Halicki, she relied on him so completely she had no need to carry 
a purse. Even when they traveled, she said, he kept her passport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my entire world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He willed her his 1987 Rolls Royce; the eight acres on Palos Verdes where they 
had planned their dream home, valued at $6 million to $8 million; and $1.5 
million in either "cash, cars or property." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother Felix, meanwhile, was willed the filmmaker's modest, suburban home 
in Gardena, an Aston Martin Lagonda, and $450,000 in "property, cars or money"; 
a sister Theresa got $100,000 under similar terms, and several old friends and 
colleagues were to receive lesser sums ranging from $50,000 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Denice Halicki never received the $1.5 million part of her legacy 
(indeed, Felix's attorney says he has yet to receive any part of his 
inheritance), she did, for nearly two years, draw a spousal allowance that 
averaged $10,000 a month and totaled more than $250,000 in cash. Then McCarroll 
stopped the payments, stating that the estate might be insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 The frozen allowance was among several blows to the widow that have formed the 
crux of her legal battle, including creditor's claims by her brothers-in-law 
Felix and Ronald Halicki. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Halicki, who runs a family towing and auto-salvage business in Dunkirk, 
N.Y., and was written out of the filmmaker's will, has claimed $2.3 million for 
work he says he and his company did on the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that he co-wrote "Gone II" and helped develop a custom, 
car-hurling vehicle called "The Slicer," among other contributions. Denice 
Halicki dismisses his claims as phony and alleges in court records they are 
based on forged contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Halicki would not discuss the case, saying only, "On behalf of the 
Halicki family, we just put our case in the hands of the California justice 
system and are waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix, the other brother-in-law, says he loaned Toby as much as $350,000 for 
"Gone II." He and his wife Crystal have demanded $700,000 from the estate to 
repay that loan and for their work as financial managers for the unfinished 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix -- who briefly served with Denice as co-executor of the estate before 
their fighting prompted a judge to remove them -- has lost an earlier claim, 
that his brother deeded him ranches worth up to $750,000. A judge ruled that 
the property was being used as loan collateral, not a gift, and that a 
change-of-ownership form had been backdated by Felix. 
</P>
<P>
 And complicating the already complex case are allegations by both Felix and 
Denice Halicki that McCarroll waited so long to try to sell some assets that 
their market values plummeted in a changing economy. Both heirs also oppose the 
legal fees racked up by two lawyers representing McCarroll, who is paid a 
percentage of the estate's value to manage it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, they were in charge for four years and now they're saying 
it's bankrupt. Something went wrong," said Brian Lysaght, one of Denice 
Halicki's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 A central issue in McCarroll's accounting will be the auction of Toby 
Halicki's massive vintage toy and car collection. Everyone seems to agree it 
captured the spirit of the quirky filmmaker, who spent every weekend shopping 
for cars and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, after numerous disputes and attempts by Denice to keep it intact, 
the collection was auctioned and brought the estate $204,000 in cash -- a 
fraction of its appraised worth. McCarroll is suing the auctioneers for 
mishandling the event and for an additional $153,000 in unpaid sales receipts. 
But because they are bankrupt, the money will probably never be collected, 
according to one of his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarroll himself would not discuss the case, but one of his lawyers, Valerie 
J. Merritt, said a key problem has been Denice Halicki's overvaluation of many 
of her husband's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't worth what she said and that's caused a number of problems," 
Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Merritt said, Denice Halicki had estimated the value of a 
five-acre industrial site in South Los Angeles, where Halicki had warehoused 
his toy collection, at $4 million to $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But toxic waste on the Vermont Avenue property and cleanup costs, combined 
with a slide in real estate prices, will probably diminish its market value to 
closer to $1.5 million, Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt acknowledged that the fees amassed by her, an assisting attorney and 
McCarroll have so far run up a bill of more than $600,000 (which they have yet 
to collect), but she denied they were at fault for prolonging the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's ridiculous," she said. "I don't mean that every penny wasn't 
earned. Every penny was earned, believe me. What it is a reflection of is that 
this estate has been very litigious."

CSUN STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAM FACES ANOTHER BIG DEFICIT; UNIVERSITIES: OFFICIALS 
SAY THE QUAKE HAS DELAYED EFFORTS AT STEMMING THE FLOW OF RED INK. THE LOSSES 
MAY CONTINUE FOR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite the sale of a campus parking structure, the vacancy-plagued student 
housing program at Cal State Northridge will run a multimillion-dollar deficit 
again this year and may continue to lose money for another four years, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's housing was already the biggest money loser in the 20-campus Cal State 
system even before the January Northridge earthquake. But campus administrators 
said damage from the quake has delayed their efforts at stemming the housing 
program's flow of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent move, the Cal State University system's board of trustees on 
Sept. 14 approved the sale of a 559-space campus parking structure for $3.9 
million. That money will help reduce the housing deficits over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is an attractive but costly 15-building complex of apartments planned 
in the mid-1980s amid a healthy economy and rising enrollments. But by the time 
the final buildings opened in 1991, the recession had begun and enrollment 
declines had translated into meager occupancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would even deny we're in a predicament," conceded Ronald Kopita, 
CSUN's vice president for student affairs. He and CSUN President Blenda J. 
Wilson inherited the fiscal mess upon their arrival in 1992, when former CSUN 
President James W. Cleary retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the parking structure funds, Kopita said CSUN expects to borrow up 
to $2.4 million from the Cal State system for 1994-95 to cover housing 
deficits. And the university has told Cal State officials it may run 
additional, though hopefully smaller, deficits for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have called this year's aid a loan, repayable at some future date. 
But CSUN's prior bailouts by the system -- $4.7 million in 1993-94, $1.5 
million in 1992-93 and $2.7 million in 1991-92 -- were simply funds taken from 
other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the three- and four-story buildings south of Lassen Street -- known 
as the University Park Apartments -- are  
</P>
<P>
 housing only 1,073 students of the 2,400 they were built to accommodate. 
Technically, that is a 45% student occupancy rate, the lowest in the Cal State 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the earthquake, Kopita said, occupancy might have hit 1,500 to 1,600 
students, a 60%-plus occupancy rate that still would be toward the bottom of 
all Cal State schools. Because of the vacancies, several entire dorm buildings 
have been converted to other uses, such as offices for university employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The main financial problem is that the campus continues to be responsible for 
a 30-year bond debt on the apartments and related projects that total more than 
$5 million a year, officials said. The financing assumed near full occupancy, 
but actual levels have never come close. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to close the gap and end the deficits, university officials have 
tried a series of gambits to reduce costs, shift housing costs to other parts 
of the university, fill the student housing with non-student renters and boost 
student occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jan. 17 earthquake dealt a major blow to the latter goal. Seven of the 
15 apartment buildings were closed for the entire semester last spring due to 
quake damage, and several of those still have not fully reopened. Repairs also 
turned the entire area into a construction zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other problems, Kopita said the still lagging economy continues to 
encourage cost-conscious students to live at home. And because of its original 
high costs, the campus housing complex continues to be more expensive than 
off-campus apartments in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The University Park Apartments, built in three five-building phases between 
1987 and 1991, cost more than $60 million, campus officials said. As a result, 
even after cutting rents two years ago, the campus is still charging nearly 
$1,400 a month for two-bedroom apartments occupied by four students. By 
comparison, a study conducted by the university in 1993 estimated rent for a 
two-bedroom off-campus apartment to be less than $750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in recent years, the campus' overall enrollment has fallen from a peak of 
31,531 in fall, 1988, to a low this fall of under 24,000, a decline of more 
than 25%. Even last fall, before the earthquake, the decline since 1988 had 
been about 14%, well above the Cal State system's average 8% loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outlook was much different in the mid-1980s, when university 
administrators were planning an ambitious $200-million public-private sector 
partnership to develop 100 acres of CSUN's North Campus with a 20,000-seat 
stadium, 2,050-seat auditorium and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments, built by a division of Watt Investment Properties Inc. of 
Santa Monica, were to be the first part of the project. But when Watt pulled 
out of the so-called University Park project in 1992, it left the apartments 
alone with no other facilities to help support them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fairness, you have to step back in time and look at what the environment 
was like then," Kopita said, citing the strong economy and enrollments that 
grew steadily through most of the decade. At one point, university officials 
were projecting growth to 40,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, is a different world and the campus is trying to cope. By 
selling the three-level, 154,073-square-foot parking structure on Zelzah Avenue 
to the university's parking program, the housing program will receive extra 
cash of about $780,000 a year over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 With office space on campus minimal now because of earthquake damage to 
permanent buildings, campus officials this fall opened two dorm buildings to 
office space for the first time. Kopita said various on-campus users are 
expected to pay about $1 million annually this year and next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And a third building has been set aside this fall for university employees to 
rent as housing. The monthly rental rate for employees is $825, substantially 
less than the student rate. And Kopita said about 25 of the 35 apartments 
available in the building have been rented thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 In other moves, university officials -- as part of an estimated 
$15-million-plus effort to repair earthquake damage to the 15 dorms -- wired 
them for cable television reception, which they had previously lacked. Once a 
provider is found, campus officials hope that will generate revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the university's foundation, which operates the University Village 
Apartments nearby, has increased its contributions to the campus housing fund. 
Wilson has issued an order that departments paying to host guests must put them 
in the apartments instead of in off-campus accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the campus began charging students separately for their electricity 
and natural gas use, which previously had been included in their basic rent. 
Kopita said the university's housing program has shed six jobs and taken other 
steps to cut its operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after all that, CSUN and Cal State officials continue to project housing 
deficits for the campus in coming years. Kopita said another possibility could 
be the sale of some buildings or conversion to condominiums, something a 
consultant is expected to consider this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few bright spots on the housing scene, university officials said, 
is that delinquent rents owed by students, which at one point had ballooned to 
$2.8 million, have declined significantly in recent years. The amount still 
owed for the period 1986-93 is now down to $1 million.

WOUNDED OFFICER RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL; SHOOTING: A SANTA MONICA POLICE 
SERGEANT IS IN GOOD CONDITION AS AUTHORITIES CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION.

 A Santa Monica police sergeant, shot twice in an exchange of gunfire with a 
hit-and-run suspect in Van Nuys on Friday, has been released from a hospital in 
good condition, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ralph (Tim) Bauer, a 23-year veteran of the Santa Monica Police 
Department, was released from Northridge Hospital Medical Center just a few 
hours after he was shot in the neck and back Friday evening. Authorities said 
Bauer's bulletproof vest saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Los Angeles police officers continued to search for the gun they 
say was used by Brian Goff, 30, who was arrested shortly after the 8:15 p.m. 
shooting Friday on Magnolia Boulevard near Coldwater Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, 49, was returning to Santa Monica on his motorcycle after completing an 
accident investigation in North Hollywood when he was flagged down by motorists 
at an accident near the intersection of Coldwater Canyon and Magnolia, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said a man driving a gray Ford Mustang north on Coldwater Canyon at 
a high rate of speed had collided with another vehicle and then fled on foot 
down Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told Bauer that the suspect, later identified as Goff, had been 
spotted near a phone booth. As Bauer tried to find the suspect, he came under 
fire from a shadowy area on Magnolia, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer was grazed on his throat by one shot and hit once in the back by another 
shot. Bauer returned fire, but police said Goff was not struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Six to eight rounds were fired in all, police said. Three shots struck Bauer's 
motorcycle: in the fuel tank, the windshield and a baggage carrier toward the 
rear of the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer took cover and used his walkie-talkie to radio for assistance, police 
said. Goff was apprehended by Los Angeles police several blocks away, near 
Fulton Avenue and Magnolia. He was booked on suspicion of attempted murder. 
Police declined to release additional details on the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center and was released in good 
condition at 11:30 p.m. Friday. He could not be reached Saturday.

 An early-morning fire devoured a medical supply company building Saturday, 
injuring two firefighters and setting off a series of oxygen tank explosions, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the 5:52 a.m. fire at Continental Hospital Supply and Home Care 
is under investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like a bomb," said Nicholas Chiarello, a neighbor who was awakened 
by three consecutive blasts about 6:15 a.m. The explosions were caused by 
pressurized gas tanks, which pumped oxygen into the fire and fanned the flames, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven fire companies from the Glendale and Burbank fire departments were 
dispatched to the scene in the 1500 block of West Glenoaks Boulevard. The fire 
was brought under control by 8 a.m., witnesses said, but by that time most of 
the one-story building was destroyed and its roof had caved in. 
</P>

 Two firefighters were treated at Glendale Adventist Hospital for minor 
injuries, including a back injury and cuts to the hand, and released, officials 
said.

 No damage estimate was available. Representatives of the supply company could

 "A lot of people thought it was an earthquake at first," said Chiarello, who 
joined a crowd of residents gathered outside after the explosions. "The house 
shook, and there were three big booms. The flames were at least 50 feet high."

CHAMBER'S COMMUNITY CLEANUP DRAWS A CROWD; ACTIVISM: VOLUNTEERS AND PEOPLE 
ORDERED BY THE COURTS WORK SIDE BY SIDE, PAINTING, SWEEPING AND PICKING UP 
TRASH.

 Some felt it was their civic duty. Others said the judge made them do it. 
Whatever the motive, more than 50 people showed up Saturday to paint, sweep, 
weed and pick up garbage during a community cleanup sponsored by the Woodland 
Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it sounds kind of corny, but it feels good to help your community," 
said Jessica Brauner, a senior at El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills. 
Jessica and her friend, Marissa Hecker, also a senior, spent the morning with 
other volunteers applying a coat of cream-colored paint on the walls of the 
Corbin Avenue underpass beneath the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce combined forces for the day with George Heytens, 
director of Woodland Hills' Neighborhood Beautification Program. Heytens 
supervises people ordered by the court to perform community service by helping 
clean up communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several adults convicted of misdemeanors worked side by side with half a dozen 
students from Chaminade College Preparatory School in West Hills, painting 
another Ventura Freeway underpass at Shoup Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually at this time on Saturdays I'm snuggled deep in sleep," said Doris 
Price of Canoga Park, working off the first day of her 20-day community service 
sentence. Price said she got into trouble after somebody tried to snatch her 
purse in a store. During the ensuing scuffle, a knife fell out of her purse, 
and she was charged with assault. 
</P>
<P>
 But Price traded in her knife for a paint-roller Saturday and said she won't 
be carrying weapons in her purse anymore. "This could be a good thing, to 
beautify a community," she said, paint dripping from her roller. "It think it's 
good to be a real part of where you live." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Williams, chairman of the chamber's anti-graffiti and beautification 
committee, says the cleanup program is designed to get all types of people 
involved. Williams began conducting twice-annual community cleanups three years 
ago. A special hot line has also helped reduce the amount of graffiti in the 
community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Oxnard Street near De Soto Avenue, another team of volunteers, led by 
retiree Gloria Mogul, who also works with Heyten's Community Beautification 
Program, hacked down a 50-yard swath of weeds next to a sidewalk near an 
undeveloped lot. "When we do this, we do it well," said Mogul, snipping away at 
more weeds in the gutter.

LANCASTER ACCEPTS 2 FIRMS' OFFER OF PROMOTIONAL TOUR TO ASIA; BUSINESS: THE 
TRIP WILL BE PAID FOR BY DEVELOPERS OF A PROPOSED COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL CENTER, 
WHO WANT CITY LEADERS TO DRAW FOREIGN INTEREST TO THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to lure new industries and retail shops to town, Lancaster officials 
have accepted a developer's offer to take three city leaders on an 
all-expenses-paid 11-day promotional tour of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Property 14 Investments and Lancaster Development Co., co-owners of a 458-acre 
parcel of open desert at the north end of the city, extended the invitation. 
The companies said they want Lancaster officials to help them attract overseas 
investors to their property. 
</P>
<P>
 A local businesswoman questioned the propriety of the trip, scheduled to begin 
Oct 5., and one council member voted against accepting the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Frank Roberts, who will go on the Asian tour with Councilman George 
Runner and City Manager Jim Gilley, insisted Friday that the excursion will not 
influence his vote when the developer is ready to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my election campaign, I was sponsored and supported by a lot of people 
with a significant amount of money," Roberts said. "And I've been known to vote 
against their projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the mayor said Friday that he wasn't entirely certain what will be 
expected of Lancaster officials during the tour and whether the trip will 
attract any Pacific Rim investors to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of uncertainties," he said. "If we come back with nothing more 
than a little knowledge about the intrigue of dealing with that area, it will 
be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 To expand his knowledge of Pacific Rim business practices before the trip, the 
mayor said he has arranged for a briefing by the director of the Center for 
International Trade Development. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers sponsoring the trip have an ambitious plans for their barren 
desert acreage on the west side of the Antelope Valley Freeway, between avenues 
G and H. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conceptual plan calls for construction of an international shopping 
complex, a 30-acre family oriented amusement center, a five-acre hotel and 
restaurant project and a 160-acre business and industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the developers have suggested that the remaining 210 acres -- 
almost half of their property -- could become the new home of the Antelope 
Valley Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the current fairgrounds at East Avenue I and Division Street have 
complained about traffic and noise, and some city leaders believe a more remote 
location would solve these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are uncertain whether the developers want to build a new 
fairgrounds themselves, sell the land to the fair or donate it in exchange for 
infrastructure improvements, such as new streets and sewer lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all iffy," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tsai, the property owners' representative who invited city leaders to 
join the Asian tour, said even he isn't certain how the new fairgrounds might 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just in the discussion stage right now," he said in a telephone 
interview from his office in San Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tsai said the Lancaster acreage has been owned by a group of investors, 
primarily from the United States and Taiwan, for the past 10 years. The owners 
believe the time is finally right to develop the land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written invitation, Tsai said the purpose of the upcoming trip would be 
to promote Lancaster among overseas investors, to promote the developers' 
project and to help city officials learn more about the developers' proposal 
and their potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tour, Tsai said, Lancaster officials will join the developers at 
seminars that may be attended by up to 500 business leaders. He said the 
Lancaster delegates will also be able to promote the city during meetings with 
Pacific Rim trade groups and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote Sept. 19, the City Council, as directors of the city's 
redevelopment agency, accepted the donation of the trip, including air fares, 
meals and hotel bills. As of Friday, city officials were still uncertain how 
much the gift was worth, but Assistant City Manager Dennis Davenport said the 
city staff had determined it was legal to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster resident Nancy Arrache objected to the tour at the recent council 
meeting. In an interview, she said she was afraid that council members might 
only promote their hosts' property to the Asian investors, even though 
Lancaster has plenty of other vacant industrial land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they're going to feel comfortable saying something positive 
about any location other than this piece of ground," said Arrache, who runs a 
custom home-building business with her husband. "My concern is: What are the 
developers expecting from the city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tsai said he and his associates will not stop the council members from 
promoting other industrial sites in Lancaster. But he added: "Hopefully, they 
will say some good things about our project." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Deborah Shelton cast the lone vote against the Pacific Rim tour, 
saying residents may view it with suspicion. "I was concerned that it would be 
perceived by the public as being a gratuitous gift," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said the developers never told her about their building proposal and 
caught her by surprise with the tour invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilwoman also said she was uncertain that Lancaster officials were 
ready to engage in complex international trade talks. "I'm just having a little 
trouble with it," Shelton said. "It seems a bit too sophisticated for our 
little local government."

THE DEFENDERS; BEYOND THE GLITZ OF CELEBRITY TRIALS, CRIMINAL LAW IS A 
GUT-WRENCHING BUSINESS THAT THE PUBLIC DISDAINS. AND NOW, ECONOMICS ARE MAKING 
IT A DEAD-END CAREER FOR ALL BUT DEFENDERS OF THE RICH. 
</P>

<P>
 They can trace their lives through a succession of grisly subtitles: the 
Hillside Strangler, the 54th Street Massacre, the Ninja Murders, the Halloween 
Ambush, the Chinatown Shoot-out. . . . They can recall, in anguished detail, 
each case they've lost, each time a client has been sentenced to life 
imprisonment or, God forbid, death. 
</P>
<P>
 They are criminal defense attorneys -- not the celebrity lawyers who squeeze 
past ogling camera lenses on the way to represent the likes of O.J. Simpson and 
Michael Jackson, but the everyday lawyers who champion the causes of anonymous 
men and women accused of heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 They've never been asked for an autograph, never posed for People magazine. 
They dine, not at hoity-toity places, but with the hoi polloi in a corner of a 
dingy courtroom cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the Robert Shapiros of the world, people like me are not getting 
rich," said Tustin defense lawyer Donald G. Rubright. "I don't have a Mercedes; 
I have a Maxima with 122,000 miles on it." 
</P>
<P>
 And even as their profession takes center stage this week in Simpson's trial 
on double-murder charges, they worry that the kind of high-stakes criminal law 
they practice is becoming a dead-end career for all except the few whose 
clients are the very, very rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers are not alone in their fears. The same sense of impending 
extinction is permeating the ranks of specialists and sole practitioners 
throughout the professions -- from medicine to accounting to architecture -- as 
economic and social realities corrode layers of tradition and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Private attorneys will always pick up drunk driving and misdemeanor cases. But 
for specialists in major felonies, "there's no future," laments Rickard 
Santwier, a criminal defense attorney for 25 years. "The only lawyers who will 
be private practitioners will be those who are hired by people with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Court appointments to represent clients who couldn't afford their own defense 
used to keep the private defense lawyers busy. But this year, Los Angeles 
County opened a second public defender office -- as many municipalities have 
done -- and cut by more than half the number of cases spun off to outside 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where the idea of a second public defender's office has been 
around for a while, court administrators are clamping down on fees paid for 
expert witnesses and investigators that private defense lawyers say they need. 
A Superior Court judge was assigned earlier this year to hear complaints from 
lawyers who feel they were wrongly denied funds by court bureaucrats -- who 
keep their eyes on the purse strings, not defense needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of judges like to say that an indigent defendant is not entitled to a 
Cadillac defense," Rubright said. "But as one judge said: 'It'd better be a 
Chevy that starts when you turn the key.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just as significantly, the cost of a felony criminal case, especially a murder 
trial, has soared past middle-class affordability, further concentrating work 
in the hands of public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For private lawyers like myself doing murder cases, there are fewer and fewer 
cases," said defense attorney Michael Yamaki. "People just can't afford the 
kind of defense they need in such a case. . . . Everybody deserves the same 
kind of defense that O.J. is getting, but how many people are going to get it? 
That's the question." 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer cases coming their way -- and the realization that the economics 
will only get worse -- many of the region's best criminal defense attorneys, 
including those who have specialized in death-penalty cases, are putting their 
skills to work on white-collar crime cases, family law, environmental issues 
and even an occasional drunk-driving charge. Others are looking at retirement, 
calculating how much longer they can go on if they don't want to branch out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough choices, these are, for a breed of attorney that seems locked in the 
embrace of a grinding, gut-wrenching, all-consuming job. For the unlucky, 
murder trials and death-penalty cases can lay waste to physical health, deplete 
emotional reserves, sunder marriages and friendships and make a mockery of the 
most earnest of personal commitments. They're all unlucky sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Jones knows who and how, and rattles off a list of wrecks as easily as if 
he were reciting his own resume. This one is in a wheelchair, another is using 
a cane after a stroke, a third suddenly dropped dead. Jones knows from his 
inside out the toll a death-penalty trial can take on an attorney. He's been 
doing them for nearly three decades now, and colleagues say he's one of the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've frequently said I can't find any death-penalty trial lawyers over 65 
years old who are in good health. . . . Check around. You'll find people with 
vision problems, heart problems, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems we bury somebody every month or so. It's a killing profession. In 
trying to save lives, we're all killing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And for whom? Accused murderers, rapists, hate-crime perpetrators -- 
individuals whose names are more obscure than the where, when and how of the 
crime. Defendants feared and reviled by a public that is baffled, even 
appalled, when lawyers willingly take their cases. A public that's quick to cry 
"technicalities" if the defense is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy being a defense attorney," Rubright said. "You're not beloved 
by the public, by prosecutors or police, and often not by your own client." 
</P>
<P>
 For this, courts typically pay attorneys $50 an hour -- $75 an hour in a 
capital case -- while colleagues in large law firms bill their corporate 
clients four or five times as much, senior partners charge $600 an hour and the 
biggest-name lawyers get $1,000 or even $2,500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county pays $300 or $400 an hour to a civil lawyer to handle a landslide 
or fight voter reapportionment. Then they pay us $75 an hour for a 
death-penalty case," Jones said. "We're only handling life and liberty." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract with a panel of private attorneys, Los Angeles County now 
pays a flat rate for defending indigents in major felony cases. The rates are 
based on a number of factors, including the seriousness of the charge and 
complexity of the case, with four tiers of payment: $60,000, $90,000, $120,000 
and $200,000 and higher. High-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson, who collected 
$650,000 from the now-depleted estate of Jose and Kitty Menendez for defending 
their son Erik on murder charges, will be paid $125,000 a year by the county 
for Erik's retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 (Lawyers expect Simpson's defense to exhaust his net worth, estimated to be 
$10 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, flat fees govern all non-homicide cases. Private lawyers on 
panels receive from $360 for a misdemeanor case to $1,160 for a felony case 
that is bound over for trial, plus up to $360 a day for felony trial work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County courts have reviewed and rejected proposals for a second 
public defender office, though county managers continue to consider it. "We 
felt that our contracts (with private lawyers) were more cost-effective than a 
second public defender's office," said Alan Slater, the Superior Court's 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 From their fees, criminal defense attorneys -- who most often practice alone 
or with a small group of partners -- have to pay the office rent, utility bills 
and clerical salaries. And unlike public defenders, who make $42,500 to $96,800 
a year in Los Angeles County, they don't have paid benefits -- vacations, 
health insurance, retirement plans and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, criminal defense attorneys don't claim to be impoverished. Most say 
they live comfortable lives. But not lavish. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at the top make an OK living," said Charles Lindner, a defense 
attorney in Santa Monica and former president of the Criminal Courts Bar Assn. 
"But nobody who's really good does it for the money. Carl (Jones) is not rich, 
Leslie is not rich. I'm not rich. Our civil counterparts are probably making 
$800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I comfortable? Yes. I'm supposed to be," Lindner said. "I've been a lawyer 
for 20 years. To have a 2,000-square-foot house on a decent lot on the Westside 
of town, that's comfortable. But what are you supposed to have after 20 years 
of work . . . and still pulling 60 hours a week?" 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Santa Ana defense lawyer Marshall M. Schulman says practitioners 
aren't going to become multimillionaires, and that fact also has led to the 
erosion of members in the criminal defense bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see the younger lawyers getting into the field," Schulman, 67, 
said. "Criminal law was very popular in the 1960s and '70s, but in the '80s and 
continuing in the '90s, young lawyers have become much more mercenary. They now 
are more interested in material wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six years, since leaving the Los Angeles public defender's office, 
Mark S. Kaiserman has spent most of his time on five or six death-penalty 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned more money in private practice. But not enough. This past week, 
Kaiserman went to work for the new second public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I was making more, substantially more," Kaiserman said. "But that 
doesn't mean I was happier. The quality of my life was not better. I was 
working harder during those years, with one death-penalty case after another." 
Harder even than having 30 or 40 cases to juggle at any one time in the public 
defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 While in private practice, Kaiserman skipped work on weekends only once or 
twice a year. "That's not the kind of life I wanted. Other things are important 
to me," he said. The other things are his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed my life more with what I was making as a public defender than with 
what I was making in the years of private practice," Kaiserman said. "I had 
more of a life and I felt better about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys who specialize in death-penalty cases know about not having 
a life, about having their lives consumed by the peril of another's, about 
being terrified to take any time for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just not you picking up a briefcase and coming to work," said 
attorney Yamaki, a former member of the Los Angeles Police Commission. "Your 
entire life is entrenched with the case. . . . People talk about the high costs 
(of) legal representation, but I think most lawyers are charging an amount that 
takes into consideration what this is going to take out of them by the time 
they finish the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a dilemma between having a personal life and really doing your best 
work. I don't really know if you can balance the two," Yamaki said. "I try to 
give as much commitment to my personal life as to a case, but while you're in 
trial, your trial becomes more important than your personal life at that time. 
It sounds sick, but when given the responsibility of defending someone's life, 
it . . . requires a full-time commitment. You can't be a part-time lawyer when 
you're doing a death-penalty trial." 
</P>
<P>
 This awful burden of someone else's life leaves defense attorneys with little 
energy for anything else. "You are it for your client," said Santa Monica 
defense attorney Michael V. White. "Your client has nobody else to rely on but 
you. You are the last stop. If you can't do your best for your client, if you 
can't save your client, the client's gone. That's a pretty awesome 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 So they obsess on their cases. They choose an office because it's near the 
courthouse, then make it into a cocoon. They bark at their secretaries, skip 
meals and, after a 16-hour workday, wake up at 2 a.m. to scribble more notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every personal plan gets tossed aside, Yamaki said. "I would be hard to live 
with, if I went on vacation and didn't do that last bit of interviewing and it 
might have helped the case," he said. "In your mind, you think that everything 
you do might make or break the case, and you have so much fear that, even in 
questioning (witnesses), that you can blow your case, just by one wrong 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you make (clients) pay for," he said. "It's more than hours; it's 
the emotional toll. You never, ever recover. I can tell you every case that I 
lost, what I thought happened in the case, what I would have done differently. 
. . . You carry it with you." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Pasadena office, attorney Jones can shut out just about everything when 
he's working on a life-or-death case -- everything but the regrets of a loss. 
"You agonize, second-guess yourself, beat yourself up bad," he said. "You 
wonder, dammit, why did I go to that movie, take that afternoon off, go to 
lunch? Would it have been different if I had worked that weekend? It's 
horrible. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 25 years of practice, Santwier never has had a client sentenced to 
death. But whenever he takes on another capital case, he has to steel himself 
for that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 With each case, Santwier said, "I see a substantial change in me. Each time 
you try one of these cases, you give up a little bit of your person, your 
humanity. You try not to make the highs too high or the lows too low, else, how 
can you go on to the next case?" 
</P>
<P>
 Going on to the next case is becoming harder and harder for private defense 
lawyers. Santwier, who co-chairs the county panel of attorneys who take on 
indigent clients, said about 50% of his caseload now comes from court 
appointments. By next year, he figures, about 20% of his cases will be 
court-appointed; in two years, that will drop down to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the sad things about the law I'm practicing now is that I won't be 
practicing it in the future," Santwier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is 56, doesn't want to practice any other kind of law. "I'm 
watching the calendar until I can get the hell out of here," he said. "I'm 
going to retire. I'm going to finish the three cases I've got, and then I'm not 
taking any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "With people dropping dead and committing suicide, having heart attacks and 
strokes, I think it's the wise alternative," Jones said. "I want to retire. I 
want to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two-year-old H. Elizabeth Harris wants to go on practicing forever, she 
says. But she wants to stay off Jones' list of wretched lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She was headed there a few years ago, her blood pressure a barometer of her 
growing caseload. So she made some changes. She's a vegetarian now and fits a 
four-mile walk into each 12-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she took two months off and went to Africa. She knows now that "I 
have to take care of all parts of me," Harris said. After her current capital 
cases are finished, she is not likely to take on any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's hard for criminal defense attorneys to watch their practices 
metamorphose into civil law. The love of the fight -- the belief that they're 
making a difference -- burrows into their souls and stays there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times," said White, "when I have represented somebody who's 
never ever had anybody in their corner before. They see me fight with 
everything I've got and they know I care. Win or lose, they've at least found 
somebody who has been there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite everything, added Jones, "there is one saving grace to all of this: 
when the court clerk reads the verdict 'not guilty,' or, in a hopeless case, 
when the clerk instead of reading a verdict of death reads a verdict of life 
imprisonment. That's why we do it."

HOPE TEMPERS FEAR IN FACING HUGHES LAYOFFS; AEROSPACE: THERE'S MORE RETRAINING 
MONEY, A STRONGER JOB MARKET. STILL, REBUILDING CAREER WILL BE DAUNTING TASK 
AFTER FULLERTON PLANT CLOSURE.

 Just before Christmas, scores of workers from Hughes Aircraft's complex here 
are expected to be sent out the door for good as part of the first wave of 
layoffs that will total 800 to 1,000 by the time the plant closes at the end of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the idea of pre-holiday joblessness is grim, those soon to be laid off 
can take heart. There is more federal training money available for dislocated 
workers than ever before. The Southern California job market is improving. And 
many former Hughes workers say that, despite struggling with despair and long 
periods of unemployment, they have emerged with new jobs, additional education 
and, in some cases, their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a blessing in disguise, I think. I'd always wanted to quit," 
said Elmer Batac, who was laid off in May from his job as a machine operator 
after 13 years at Hughes in Fullerton. Now living with relatives in Tustin, 
Batac is training to be a medical technician. "I'm kind of hurting for money, 
but I figure that I'm doing the best that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12,000 Hughes employees in Southern California, including hundreds 
from the Fullerton plant, have been laid off in the past few years. No surveys 
have been done to track how many of them have found new jobs or have left the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, however, about two dozen people who held various jobs at Hughes 
before they were laid off or retired described a wide range of successes and 
frustrations. Some, like Batac, said the changes have been healthy, forcing 
them to switch to new careers or to become entrepreneurs. Others, still 
unemployed, working outside their fields or in lower-paying jobs, said they see 
no immediate end to their struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many former Hughes workers, Roy Robbins had a flashback when the company 
announced earlier this month that it will close the 37-year-old Fullerton plant 
and transfer most of the 6,800 workers there to other Hughes sites, mainly in 
El Segundo and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little bit of turn in my stomach, and it brought me back to a year 
and a half ago," when Robbins was laid off from his $53,000-a-year engineering 
job. Robbins, who now owns and operates a book store in Costa Mesa, said, "I 
had to refocus and get retrained." 
</P>
<P>
 Retraining has long been promoted by government and company officials as one 
way that laid-off aerospace workers might find new jobs, and Congress has 
appropriated increasing amounts of money for such programs. More than $6 
million is available in Orange County this year, twice as much as a year 
earlier, plus there's retraining money from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Such funds have been used to pay workers to enroll in programs ranging from 
university degree programs to 10-week technical classes in storefront schools. 
But just as younger college graduates are finding that their degrees are no 
guarantee of employment, many Hughes employees are viewing completion of their 
own academic work as a leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mazzola, formerly a Hughes test engineer, had been taking evening classes 
at Cal State Fullerton during his 11 years with the company. When he was laid 
off in August, 1993, his separation package included a $5,000 training 
reimbursement plan, and Mazzola used it to spend a year at Fullerton as a 
full-time student, earning a bachelor's degree in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzola is still looking for a job and says he needs more computer programming 
classes, which he cannot afford. The courses in programming and in 
computer-aided design that he would like to take would cost about $1,300 at 
several local computer training companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what (employers) are looking for, it's just that I can't get myself to 
that level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzola spent July looking for work in his home state of Michigan and plans to 
continue searching there, he said. Meanwhile, he and his wife have been living 
off their retirement savings, his severance package and her salary as an 
insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former Hughes employees have given up looking for work, and they remain 
bitter about being laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Govindan, 62, who was laid off in 1991, filed a lawsuit in Orange County 
Superior Court alleging that Hughes discriminated against him because of his 
age. But the suit was dismissed earlier this month. Meanwhile, Govindan said he 
has sent out 25 to 30 resumes but has not received one interview. He and his 
wife are living off their savings, and Govindan is now thinking of starting his 
own business. 
</P>
<P>
 Govindan says his two sons, one in his 20s and the other in his 30s, have a 
different perspective on their relationship with the aerospace companies they 
work for: Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. "Their generation has to 
face downsizing," he said. "Emotionally, they're more balanced than me. If they 
were to get laid off, I think they'd say 'OK, goodby, so long.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The one formal study to track laid-off aerospace workers in Southern 
California was conducted by UCLA researchers last year, and the results were 
bleak. The survey found that half of the aerospace workers laid off in 1989 
were jobless two years later or had left the state. A separate analysis of 
aerospace workers laid off in 1991 and 1992 found that just 16% found new jobs 
quickly, the UCLA report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the market has improved slightly in the past year, "the prospect of 
finding comparable work is still poor," said Paul Ong, the UCLA professor who 
authored that report. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ong sees a difference in the more recent throng of laid-off aerospace 
workers. "There's greater acceptance" of the realities of the job market in the 
defense industry, he said. "And that means there's greater willingness now to 
find other work or try something new," such as going through retraining or 
starting up a business. 
</P>
<P>
 Retraining wasn't an option that everyone embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Yaklyvich, a driver and warehouse worker for Hughes for 13 years, is now 
employed by a Corona liquor delivery company. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaklyvich has a commercial driver's license and was trained at Hughes to 
handle hazardous chemicals. He thought the combination would exempt him from 
the layoffs, so he was taken by surprise when he was handed a pink slip in 
1992. "It was an awful feeling," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaklyvich's job search, which he didn't begin until he was laid off, lasted a 
year and a half. Jobs were easy to find, he said, but not at the rate of $18 an 
hour that he earned at Hughes. Perseverance paid off, however, and Yaklyvich 
eventually landed a job with Southern Wine and Spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make more money now than I did at Hughes," he said, "and I work a four-day 
week and get to wear shorts to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hinds, 40, also bypassed training and sought work in a completely 
different field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds was a quality assurance supervisor at Hughes for 15 years until he was 
laid off last year. After taking two months to rest, Hinds began a job hunt 
that he thought would lead him to a small electronics company or another firm 
that would draw on his engineering background. But he now works as a consultant 
for Unisearch Inc., a recruiting firm in Orange. Hinds says he stumbled into 
his current job after contacting Unisearch to help him find employment. "It's a 
good change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinds said he may have stayed at Hughes too long. "Money is perhaps the No. 1 
reason people stay at those aerospace jobs," he said, "but I can't say the job 
itself was a cushy one." Hinds said one reason he was glad to leave was that he 
found himself taking on many of the responsibilities of those who had already 
been laid off. "Eventually you're not doing what you were hired to do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most satisfied of the former Hughes employees are those who took 
the riskiest route and started their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Grogan, 34, was laid off in March, 1992, from his $35,000-a-year job as a 
purchasing agent at Hughes' now-defunct plant in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
Initially, Grogan wasn't worried. He sent off resumes, worked occasionally on 
his weekend hobby -- photographing weddings for a few hundred dollars here and 
there -- and relied on $30,000 that he had saved in his company's 401(k) plan 
over his 10 years at Hughes. "It seemed like a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tax bite in cashing out his savings was big -- about $12,000 -- and 
Grogan, his wife and their three young children went through the rest in no 
time. And even with 10 years' work experience, Grogan learned quickly about the 
market value of a high school graduate working in the purchasing department of 
most companies: about $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," he said. "Many nights I woke up at 2 in the morning. My 
stomach was in knots, and I'd be thinking, 'Oh, my God, how am I going to feed 
my kids and keep my house?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After a year, Grogan quit sending out resumes and began putting more effort 
into his photography. He completed 10 weeks at a Rancho Santiago 
College-affiliated entrepreneurial training program for laid-off aerospace 
workers, called Business Ownership Service System, or BOSS. 
</P>
<P>
 He started to hustle for more business, advertising in the phone book and 
bridal magazines. In 1993, Grogan shot 13 weddings at between $500 and $1,500 
each. This year, he expects to do 40 weddings plus other family portraits and 
commercial photography. "It's sustaining us now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grogan works out of his garage in his three-bedroom house in San Juan 
Capistrano, putting in 15 hours some days. He says he wishes he had gone into 
business for himself earlier, but he admits he was afraid. "I was told all 
along that most people do it and fail." Today, Grogan has no regrets. "I 
realize I'm living the life I want to live and doing the things I want to do. 
I'm completely in charge of what's happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers like Grogan are "living out their dreams," said Susan Fox, director of 
the entrepreneurial training program, which is funded largely by federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 79 laid-off aerospace workers, including some from Hughes, have 
completed Fox's 10-week program. Of those who established their own businesses, 
she said, 72% are still operating. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, some laid-off workers have moved out of the region to find 
work. And more expect to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Elliott Baltuch, who hasn't worked since he was laid off in 
1993. Baltuch thinks he will have to leave the area to support his two children 
who are still at home. Baltuch said he reads classified ads daily and also gets 
leads from friends and former colleagues. He has taken courses in business 
administration and met with a recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has come up dry. Most of the employers he approaches tell him he is 
overqualified or too specialized, he said, a common problem for aerospace 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltuch, a lawyer, worked in Hughes' business management department. During 
his 14 years with the company, he pursued a business management degree, paid 
for by Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an interesting situation for us," said Baltuch's wife, Emily. She 
hasn't worked since 1965 but is now looking for a job.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before this we were always in a position where we could give," she said. "Now 
we need to receive."

ASIAN GROUPS UNITE TO EDUCATE RESIDENTS ON IMPACT OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the November election draws near, a coalition of community groups has been 
pushing to inform, educate and register Asian American voters to oppose 
Proposition 187, the "Save Our State" initiative endorsed by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations representing the Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Thai, 
Vietnamese and Cambodian communities have united as Asian Pacific Americans 
Opposed to Proposition 187. The group aims to counter a misconception among 
some Asians that the proposition -- which would bar anyone without proof of 
citizenship or legal resident status from attending public schools, using 
medical facilities or receiving public funds and social services -- would not 
affect them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people are beginning to become aware of S.O.S., but not so much 
aware of how it's going to affect the Asian community," said Chandler Im, a 
coordinator for the Korean American Inter-Agency Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is somewhat of a split within the Asian community," Im said. "Those 
people who are legal residents . . . feel it's not going to be detrimental to 
them. Since they are legal residents, they feel their rights won't be 
violated." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Acosta, a retired Filipina immigrant who serves on the California Senior 
Legislature, is among those who feel that Asian immigrants have no need to 
worry so long as they are here legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asians who are legal residents will not be affected by Proposition 187," 
Acosta said. "I do not feel we will be discriminated against just because we 
are Asian." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the proposition calls for school, hospital and social services 
administrators to verify resident status and report those who are suspected of 
being undocumented -- including the parents of American-born children -- to 
immigration authorities, its opponents believe that anyone who appears foreign 
could face discrimination in seeking public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Miya Iwataki, a third-generation Japanese American who co-chairs Californians 
United Against Proposition 187 and helped found the Asian coalition in July, 
believes that greater outreach efforts are needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our community does not realize how this will affect them," she said. 
"They have not read the initiative themselves, so they don't know the language 
is vague and actually states 'reasonably suspect.' Because 'reasonably suspect' 
is not defined, that means anyone who is foreign looking and speaks with an 
accent could be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Ancheta, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant 
Rights of Los Angeles, said many Asian Americans fail to see their connection 
to the initiative because they are misguided by campaign television images. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a misconception that is widespread, unfortunately," said Ancheta, an 
attorney who is a second-generation Filipino American. "Proposition 187 
directly affects Asians, but the image they see in the mass media is that of 
Latinos sneaking across the border, so the image they associate with it leads 
them to think it doesn't affect them." 
</P>
<P>
 As a citizenship outreach worker for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, 
Catherine Pedroza has been involved in education efforts regarding Proposition 
187 within the Asian community since midsummer. Many of those she has 
approached have been indifferent about the proposition, she said. Some have 
even said they are in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedroza, the daughter of Filipino immigrants, said she believes that as in the 
similarly divided Latino community, the split is partly explained by a 
combination of misinformation and perceived class differences between longtime 
immigrants and recent arrivals. But Pedroza says she feels there is an even 
stronger factor -- the desire that some Asian immigrants feel to blend quietly 
into mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
 "What many Asian Americans tend to think is that once they come to this 
country, they are supposed to assimilate into American society," Pedroza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The model Asian immigrant does what is expected of him. So they distance 
themselves from immigrant culture and immigrant issues because that's something 
they don't want to be associated with anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn La, a staff attorney for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, says 
that Asian immigrants with limited English skills could be especially subject 
to racially generated red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't have their residence documents, if they've lost them, they 
wouldn't be able to articulate this," La said. "They wouldn't have the language 
skills to defend themselves."

A SHOPPING PLAZA RISES FROM ASHES; BUSINESS: THE CRENSHAW CENTER, WHICH 
SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE IN THE 1992 RIOTS, WILL REOPEN NOV. 5 AFTER 
OVERCOMING BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two-and-a-half years ago, touring the smoking ruins of the Crenshaw Center 
shopping plaza in the aftermath of the civil unrest, Richard Heller said the 
road to recovery seemed too bumpy to consider traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was indeed a long journey -- one that took a year longer than expected to 
complete -- but Heller, vice president of Watt Commercial Development Corp., 
went the distance and is on the verge of reopening 30 stores that were burned 
or extensively damaged.  
</P>
<P>
 "We waded through a lot of bureaucracy, a lot of red tape," said Heller, 
surveying the bright new storefronts at Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue 
last week. "When I first saw stores burning on TV, I thought, 'Oh no.' But we 
did it. We came back." 
</P>
<P>
 The 137,000-square-foot center was the largest shopping plaza to be hit in the 
riots and one of the most extensively damaged. Toured by then-President George 
Bush and many others in 1992, it became emblematic of the rage that sparked the 
unrest and the ensuing destruction that leveled commercial property throughout 
Los Angeles. Of the 40 spaces housed in the Crenshaw Center, only five -- The 
Boys supermarket, Burger King, Super Trak auto parts, Thrifty Drugs and 
National Dollar Store -- have been operating since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 That will change on Nov. 5 when the center will hold a reopening with all the 
hoopla that Heller says the $6-million effort deserves. About half the original 
tenants are returning, and new ones include Union Federal Bank, Subway sandwich 
shop, Crown Diamonds and a First Interstate Bank home loan office. All tenants 
got structural face-lifts -- new storefronts and improvements such as 
individual sprinkler and security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller said the development corporation's leasing department also reduced 
rents to attract tenants and ensure that nearly all the stores would be leased 
by November. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some hesitancy among some people about locating here, but not a 
lot," he said. "People did good business here before. That business is still 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Optometrist Craig Carter, whose office on Manchester and Vermont was gutted by 
fire during the riots, moved his Universal Eye Care Center into the plaza two 
months ago because he said it was the just community location he had been 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in L.A. my whole life. I grew up in the neighborhood," Carter 
said. "They've done a lot of good improvements here . . . people have been glad 
to see me move here." 
</P>
<P>
 Watt Commercial Development Corp. was the managing general partner in the 
joint venture with the Slauson/Crenshaw Associates Partnership, a group of 
local limited partners. With community rehabilitation in mind as well as 
building refurbishment, Watt hired Curtom Construction, a black female-owned 
general contractor, and used contractors that were wholly or partially 
minority-owned. RECONSTRU

HOG WILD; ROARING INTO CONSERVATIVE LITTLE TOKYO, A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN'S 
HARLEY-DAVIDSON SHOP IS TURNING HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suenori Takayama was born to be wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Easy Rider" movie buff and motorcycle enthusiast from Kyoto, Japan, gave 
Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo an offbeat look with the recent opening 
of a Harley-Davidson shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Takayama, who owns two Harleys and a dealership in Kyoto, said he decided to 
expand his business to Little Tokyo in hopes of drawing not only Japanese 
tourists, but the Downtown business crowd as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have more Japanese people in Japan ride Harleys," the 39-year-old 
businessman said through an interpreter by phone from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Takayama also sees his shop, Gem USA, as a way to develop friendships with and 
welcome American bikers or motorcycle hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by clothing stores, sushi restaurants and a bakery, the dealership 
stands out in the plaza like a Harley on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Neon lights with the company name and an "Easyriders" logo decorate the front 
window of the store. Harley cruisers are on display inside, and leather jackets 
line the side walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Gem USA also sells motorcycle parts and accessories and biker souvenirs, such 
as T-shirts and stickers. A permit to sell Harleys is pending approval from the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop's unusual location at 335 E.  
</P>
<P>
 2nd St., in the heart of Little Tokyo, has caught the eyes of some customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed strange, but interesting," Howard Gantman, press deputy to 
Councilwoman Rita Walters, said about his first visit there. "I guess it fits 
in that whole theme of selling Americana items to tourists who come in from 
Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chinatown resident and ex-Harley rider Don Toy dropped by after some of his 
biker friends told him about Gem USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird," Toy said. "Normally, shops like that would not be in 
Little Tokyo's Japanese Village Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 That's true, said Tom Kurai, spokesman for the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza managers had debated whether to take the unprecedented step of renting 
out available space to a Harley-Davidson shop in Little Tokyo, Kurai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had visions of Hell's Angels coming down here," he said. "In Little Tokyo, 
being a conservative community, we have your old guard, second-generation 
(Japanese) who've been here 30 to 40 years. What would they think if we opened 
such a shop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Takayama's carefree, biker image didn't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mr. Takayama first approached us, he looked like a typical biker -- long 
hair, jeans and T-shirt," Kurai said. "We were kind of like wondering what his 
background was, if he was credible." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, plaza managers reviewed the businessman's financial statements, 
saw pictures of his two-story Harley dealership in Kyoto and concluded that Gem 
USA could attract higher-income customers from Downtown to the plaza, he said. 
Gem USA then took over space that had been vacated by Magic Radio, which moved 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its Aug. 7 opening, the shop has attracted an average of 50 customers a 
day, said sales assistant Willi Chiao. Most have been Japanese tourists, some 
from other parts of Downtown and only a few bikers, Chiao said. And despite 
initial fears among plaza managers, there have been no problems with idle 
bikers loitering around the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harley-Davidson products and biker garb have increasingly grown in popularity 
among the Japanese, said Gem's owner, Little Tokyo merchants and residents and 
motorcycle experts. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they said, Japanese society doesn't perceive bikers and their Harleys the 
same way Americans have stereotyped them -- as hoodlums and rebels. In fact, a 
Harley-Davidson is considered a status symbol among some in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents more of the Western culture to them, whereas to us it 
represents a certain element of our Western culture," said Keith R. Ball, 
editor of Easyriders magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley-based publication's Easyriders motorcycle clothing and 
tattoo shop on Melrose Avenue has also drawn a large number of Japanese 
tourists seeking Western memorabilia, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the motorcycle industry in Japan consider the Harley "king of the 
motorcycles," said Brian Kito, who owns a pastry shop in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've seen Charles Bronson reruns . . . so the Harley always has that image 
of being cool," Kito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the motorcycle business may be slow, Takayama said he plans to ride it 
out for six months before reviewing whether to continue with his U.S. 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is beyond business," he said through an interpreter. "It's building a 
better image of American bikers."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PRIVATE SCHOOL TRIES TO FILL EDUCATION 
GAP

<P>
 When Sanubo Toeque moved to the United States from Liberia about 20 years ago, 
he brought with him an idea that would link this country with his: education. 
</P>
<P>
 Toeque (pronounced, TOH-kwee), founder of the Toeque Technical Christian 
Academy, wanted to create a private institution to prepare inner-city children 
for college, modeled after the schools in Liberia, where curricula are strict.  
</P>
<P>
 The academy, in a former medical building at 5944 S. Avalon Blvd., offers 
computer programming, Spanish classes that begin in the first grade, and 
journalism, economics, electrical drafting and advanced biology for older 
students. African studies course are taught in the grades seven through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five graduating classes from the small, 11-year-old academy, all 25 
students have gone on to a college or community college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea was to have a base here and start a program in Liberia, so 
that we could have a student-exchange program," said Toeque, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Toeque's dream could be realized, political instability in Liberia 
stalled the idea, which he had entertained even while an undergraduate student. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at New York's Bronx Community College and later at Pepperdine 
University, obtaining degrees in physical science and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the problem in South-Central is that there's an educational gap 
from school to school, especially in areas of mathematics and science," said 
Toeque, who earned his master's in education at Cal State Dominguez Hills and 
teaches mathematics classes at Drew University. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy, which has applied for accreditation from the Colorado-based Assn. 
of Christian Schools International, has a paid teaching staff of just three, 
plus three or four volunteers on any given day. Toeque's wife Mona, 38, another 
Pepperdine graduate, assists as a teacher, and his 75-year-old father, James, 
helps with after-school child care. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which has $20,000 in monthly expenditures, struggles to survive -- 
its only income coming from tuition of $225 per month for children in 
kindergarten through sixth grade and $250 per month for seventh through 12th 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Toeque has built an eight-cubicle computer lab and even converted a 
closet into a chemistry lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Classrooms can hold as many as 20 students per class, although the entire K-12 
enrollment is just 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, local parents who send their children to the academy measure 
Toeque's success by their children's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Wash enrolled her son, Patrick, in the academy after his grades fell 
so low that he was asked to leave his previous school as a sophomore. She said 
Toeque's efforts may have saved Patrick from a path that would have led him to 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Toeque and the staff took a lot of time with him, time that most big 
schools don't have," said Wash, whose son went on to Harbor College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upon graduation, (Patrick) told Mr. Toeque, 'Thank you for guiding my behind 
in the right direction.' " ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; LOW-RENT HOUSING IS RELIEF TO FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting on a bench near a recreation area in his South-Central apartment 
complex, Jorge Mercado remembers the living conditions that he and his family 
faced just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showered with buckets because there wasn't any water pressure. We felt 
extremely unsafe because the gas water heater was in the kitchen next to the 
stove with no ventilation," said Mercado, 32, who is married and has three 
children younger than 10. "And we were one of the families that lived under the 
best conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 1, Mercado and his family moved into a three-bedroom apartment in the 
new, low-income Villa Esperanza Apartments on 28th Street near Maple Avenue and 
Adams Boulevard. Villa Esperanza is a project launched by Esperanza Community 
Housing Corp., a nonprofit development agency formed by a coalition of 
community groups led by Sister Diane Donoghue of St. Vincent Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, funded through loans and grants from a variety of lending 
institutions and government agencies, took two years to complete. Donoghue 
would not reveal the cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the housing corporation will celebrate the grand opening of Villa 
Esperanza with a party in the apartment complex's main patio. The celebration 
will also mark nine years of community efforts to thwart construction of a 
garment factory, which was to stand where the housing project is today.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the families that moved into Villa Esperanza, which has 33 units of 
three or four bedrooms and two bathrooms, lived in single-room apartments, said 
Melanie Stephens, project director of the housing corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The families were chosen from 600 applicants. Villa Esperanza primarily 
selected families that had lived in extremely overcrowded conditions in the 
immediate area, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 33 families who have moved or will soon move into the apartments, all 
but three lived in the area, with 26 of the families coming from within a 
10-block radius. Fifteen families moved from single-room units, another 15 from 
one-bedroom apartments and three lived in two-bedroom apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents for Villa Esperanza units range from $355 to $525. Most of the families 
have six to eight members and have a monthly household income of $1,200 to 
$1,500.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homes in the area are dilapidated houses originally constructed as 
duplexes around the turn of the century. Most of these homes were converted 
into eight- or 10-unit apartments or boarding houses, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always lived in this area, and now our standard of living has increased 
by at least 90%," said Mercado, a garment worker. The last apartment he and his 
family lived in, he said, had a grimy, 12-year-old carpet and there was no 
running water in the toilet or bathroom sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his family enjoys the amenities of a modern home, including an ample 
kitchen with proper ventilation and a garbage disposal, he said. Most of the 
apartments are furnished with "granny suites," units designed to accommodate 
members an extended family, such as a grandparent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to offering affordable housing, Villa Esperanza will serve as a 
gathering center for the surrounding community. The complex includes a child 
care center, classrooms for adult education and a large community room. Last 
Thursday, villa tenants met to select 500 books donated by the Los Angeles 
Public Library for the center's reading room.  
</P>
<P>
 The child care center will be operated by USC's School for Early Childhood 
Education, serving 40 children ages 3 to 5. It will also offer Head Start and 
full-day care. The education center will offer classes in literacy, English as 
a second language, parenting and home ownership.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal with this project is not to be a stand-alone project but to have a 
larger impact in the community, whether they live in our building or in 
buildings surrounding the neighborhood," Stephens said. "We don't want to be a 
fortress."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; PANEL SEARCHES FOR EL PUEBLO MANAGER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A seven-member panel overseeing operations at El Pueblo de Los Angeles is 
starting a nationwide search for a new general manager to run the city's 
birthplace, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners are scheduled to discuss and finalize the manager's job 
description at a meeting Thursday, said chairwoman Lydia Lopez. That 
information will then be passed along to the city personnel department, which 
will advertise the opening nationwide. The search could take six to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the job to be a general manager position that allows us on an annual 
basis to review that person's work," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will also look for an interim director for the El Pueblo 
monument, home to merchants who run tourist shops and restaurants along Olvera 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Mollinedo, assistant general manager for the city's recreation and 
parks department, has been assigned to supervise El Pueblo's staff until an 
interim director is appointed. Mollinedo replaces Anthony Gonzales, who ran 
business operations at the monument for three years when the El Pueblo 
commission was formed. Because no one was appointed to the seven-member panel 
until this summer, the parks department has continued to manage El Pueblo and 
its merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Olvera Street merchants who complained about Gonzales' effectiveness saw 
his removal as a top priority for the new commission. But before that board 
could take any action, parks officials decided earlier this month to transfer 
Gonzales to work at a service yard as an analyst -- his regular job title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense was that it would be good to have a fresh start because it's no 
secret that Mr. Gonzales was controversial," said Elliott Porter, parks 
personnel director. "This wasn't disciplinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter added that while Gonzales earned $49,235 a year, the permanent El 
Pueblo general manager could receive at least $75,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Barth, associate director for history at El Pueblo and director of 
Travel Town in Griffith Park, said the need to promote and increase visitors to 
the monument are key concerns for the El Pueblo director. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; POLICE SUBSTATION PLANS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City building officials last week approved the long-awaited plans for Little 
Tokyo's first police substation after several delays, but construction may not 
be completed until January, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the start of construction hasn't been scheduled, "it's going to be done 
in a hurry," said Doc Nghiem, a city structural engineer. "We have the support 
of the mayor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's staff agreed in May to renovate the 5,000-square-foot 
city-owned property at 303-307 East 1st St. and turn nearly half that space 
into a police substation for the Greater Little Tokyo Anti-Crime Assn. The 
building permit obtained Wednesday finally allowed work to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The building at 307 East 1st St. will house the koban, similar to the small 
police booths found on street corners in Japan, Nghiem said. Two other small 
brick buildings at 303 and 305 East 1st St. will be remodeled for a retail 
store and restaurant, he said. All three lots, which are in a nationally 
recognized historic block, sustained damage in the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake and have been closed for seismic upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Though city officials originally told the anti-crime association that 
construction on the koban could begin by June, problems with county health and 
city building codes arose, Nghiem said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the kitchen in the restaurant space needed to be wider, and 
bathrooms to accommodate the disabled and 500 square feet of storage space had 
to be added to the plans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects also successfully obtained a variance for a five-foot-wide 
back-door exit in the koban because city building and safety codes require a 
10-foot exit for offices with 50 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks have frustrated some members of the Little Tokyo Anti-Crime 
Assn., which comprises merchants and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think it was that big of a problem," said Brian Kito, vice 
president of the public safety group. "We were originally looking at a 
September or October opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Kito said merchants have asked city officials for more than a decade for a 
place where Japanese tourists and Little Tokyo residents would feel less 
intimidated to report crimes. "We're being neglected as far as this project is 
concerned," Kito said. "But we haven't given up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral spokeswoman Tanya Mishell said Riordan's office intends to keep its 
promise. "We're doing all we can to move this process forward and helping out 
in any way," Mishell said. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; GRAFFITI PROJECT TURNS INTO A SCREEN TEST

<P>
 Almost invisibly, a group of students rose as early as 5 a.m. this summer to 
paint out graffiti before the spray-paint, in many cases, was dry. But their 
work has not gone unnoticed by residents and has even received the attention of 
a British production company that will return in November to film them for a 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Case Television contacted the Madres del Este de Los Angeles, Santa Isabel 
chapter, after reading about its 10-week program in a small article in a New 
York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were surprised because all they ever hear about East Los Angeles is 
gangs and police making the criminals get down on their knees," said Elsa 
Lopez, a member of the organization. "I told them: 'That's how they make them 
pray.' I was kidding, but they didn't understand it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 The film will be shown in London schools as part of a geography curriculum to 
show urban life in a positive light, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 high school and three college students also created six murals and 
cleaned up dozens of trees and freeway walls, even under the East 6th Street 
Bridge, where they found graffiti dating back to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought, 'Should we be painting over this? It might be historic,' " 
Lopez said. "I said, 'Nah, just paint.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 clean walls sport the round, blue logo of the Madres, a woman in a 
shawl with her arms wrapped around a baby. Although some walls have since been 
defaced, no tagger has spray-painted over the logos, Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere now, (taggers) know what our group does. They know our group hires 
students," she said. "They know that what we've done has been positive for the 
community. I guess they feel that they take a little bit of pride and they 
respect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer David Torres of the Hollenbeck Division agreed: "They have made a big 
difference and a lot of people now recognize their emblem." 
</P>
<P>
 Money to fund the program was raised through a Department of Water and Power 
project that traded old toilets for new, water-saving ones. With that money, 
the Madres have given out scholarships -- $17,000 this year to 30 graduating 
high school seniors, informed neighbors of free immunizations for their 
children, educated about lead poisoning and hired the part-time painters at $6 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 With donations of paint -- 50 gallons from Ellis Paint Co. in Boyle Heights 
and 700 gallons more from the Police Department -- and because the group found 
that few of their newly painted walls were being defaced, the project was 
expanded this year, its second.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, workers painted the walls of businesses and homes on Boyle and 
Euclid avenues between 6th and 7th streets. This year, the territory was 
extended from Boyle Avenue to Lorena Street, and 4th to 8th streets. The 
students also swept sidewalks and cleaned out alleys and yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to give them credit because it's certainly nothing that I was 
able to do," said Lionel Hernandez, owner of Farmacia Profesional at Whittier 
Boulevard and Euclid Avenue. Hernandez, whose father started the business in 
1939, had hired painters over the years to wipe out the graffiti, but the 
symbols, names and profanity soon returned, he said. Customers would complain 
not only about the spray-paint, Hernandez said, but also about taggers' abusive 
behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Twice, the students painted out the graffiti and put the Madres logo up before 
the taggers stopped altogether. It has been two months since Hernandez's 
pharmacy has been hit. "That's really amazing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighborhoods have asked the Madres to help them with their own 
paint-out projects, and students from Watts and South-Central have taken paint 
home over the weekends to start murals in their own neighborhoods, Lopez said. 
Other students have volunteered to be part of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids sometimes come on the weekends to see if they can help us," she 
said. "To be here at 5 o'clock, not one kid was late and not one missed -- 
ever. They were dedicated, and once they were out there, they had fun." MARY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; COUNTY REWRITING ADULT BUSINESS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent temporary move by the County Board of Supervisors' to restrict adult 
businesses in residential neighborhoods did not specifically address a Whittier 
Boulevard shop that has been the target of protests, but a new county ordinance 
may put restrictions on it and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the county are devising a permanent ordinance that will restrict 
adult businesses from operating within a certain distance of schools, churches 
and residential areas, said Carole Thomas-Fajardo, director of field operations 
for Supervisor Gloria Molina. In the meantime, the protest at Andy's Adult 
Books, 4624 E. Whittier Blvd., has dwindled to about five neighbors. Although 
discouraged by the number of fellow protesters who have dropped out, they vow 
to continue picketing until the store closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first the community's all gung-ho and then they turn their backs on you," 
said Martha Cooper, president of the neighborhood group More Advocates for 
Safer Homes. "We try to tell them, 'It's not political. It's a moral issue,' " 
</P>
<P>
 The group says they hope the county will eventually hold that store owner 
Craig Tucker is operating his business without required permits and fine him so 
much money that the store will be driven out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker did receive a business license, but he maintains that he did not need 
approval from the County Regional Planning Commission or the Board of 
Supervisors to open his store. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Roger Diamond, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The store) opened when this other . . . ordinance was on shaky ground, and 
he opened without any permits," said Thomas-Fajardo. If a permanent ordinance 
is put in place, she said, the store would probably fall under its restrictions 
when conditional use permits are up for renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's previous ordinance restricting adult businesses from locating 
within 500 feet of churches and schools was struck down in April and May in 
decisions by state and federal courts after a topless bar in unincorporated La 
Puente protested that the law was vague and violated the business owner's right 
to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance now being prepared would also govern hours of operation, signage 
and public display of merchandise. It would mandate the hiring of security 
guards. But first, Thomas-Fajardo said, the county must determine whether the 
proposal would prevent such businesses from operating at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do have a certain amount of rights to run their business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her fellow protesters meet Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays in front 
of the business to shout to passing drivers about preventing Andy's and other 
adult businesses from operating in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, she said, they receive insults in return. But Cooper is undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether the community gets out there or not, I will still be there," she 
said. "I live in the community and it affects the children." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; MAYOR SEES CRISIS IN SMOKING DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to a state report that placed the city among the top 20 California 
cities in smoking-related death rates, Mayor Ric Loya last week declared a 
health crisis in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report published in August by the California Department of Health 
Services, the city had the 16th-highest rate for males, with 593 smoking deaths 
per 100,000 people per year, and 11th for females, with a rate of 261 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is desperately wrong in this area and something needs to be done," 
said Loya at last week's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Loya cited cigarette billboard ads as one of the main causes for the city's 
high smoking-death rates: "We have a humongous Marlboro sign right next to our 
middle school. No wonder there's an increase in the number of adolescents that 
are smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, "The Local Burdens of Tobacco," said that statistical variations 
suggest that local anti-smoking efforts may require different techniques and 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loya said the city's next steps would include an effort to curtail tobacco 
advertising near schools, a crackdown on merchants selling tobacco products to 
minors and increased enforcement of the city's tobacco ordinance, which 
prohibits smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park was one of only seven cities in Los Angeles County with 
significantly higher rates of smoking-attributable deaths for both males and 
females than the state averages. The state's rates were 450 deaths per 100,000 
for men, and 201 for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring South Gate also made the list, with a rate of 555 for males, and 
255 for females. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which based its findings on death certificate records, said that 
smoking is related to 19% of all deaths in California, despite decreased 
smoking rates in recent years. The report cited smoking as the primary 
avoidable cause of death in the United States. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; SHE'S A MODEL BUSINESSWOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Sylvia Lozano began charging a few dollars for haircuts out of her living 
room nine years ago, she had high hopes and little money. A longtime resident 
of Mexico, Lozano came to California thinking of the state as a place where a 
woman could succeed in the male-dominated world of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico at that time, men didn't respect a woman with ambitions," said 
Lozano, 46, the mother of five, who was born in the United States but raised in 
Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here and saw so many women working, I knew it was the place for 
me," she said, "but my family thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after much hard work and some pro bono advice from an East Los Angeles 
professor of business, Lozano's foray into the beauty business has flourished. 
She now employs 10 and owns and operates the Rizo Beauty Salon and the 
Ellechante Modeling Studio and Talent Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I can't believe our rise," said Lozano in a crisp Spanish she 
occasionally tempers with terms such as cash flow and marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just two years ago I was on the verge of tears. I wanted to take advantage of 
opportunities but didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano said her break came about two years ago when she received a mailing 
announcing the services of the just-opened Business Assistance Center in 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 That letter was written by Roger Holguin, who teaches business classes at East 
Los Angeles College and moonlights as a pro bono consultant for the Los Angeles 
Business Development Corp., a nonprofit consulting company that provides 
entrepreneurial training and management assistance to businesses in 
economically disadvantaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by an $87,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, the center is part of the San Fernando Valley-based Business 
Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation has served more than 3,000 companies with technical assistance 
programs since 1987, creating more than 400 jobs in the process, according to 
Jonathan Goldhill, the center's program director. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin's first step was to help Lozano devise a 12-month business plan to 
track her salon's revenue and expenditures. Along with the plan came a budget, 
complete with realistic projections and forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Sylvia had a dream that needed to become a goal," said Holguin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We helped her to make that goal a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 After consulting Lozano on the principles of bookkeeping, Holguin invited her 
to free seminars on sales and advertising where she learned the importance of 
image in the fashion industry, and the need to cater to each client's 
particular needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out about an entirely different language -- the language of 
business," Lozano said. 
</P>
<P>
 From her second-story office along Pacific Boulevard, her well-groomed staff 
banters in Spanish while receiving faxes from such fashion hubs as New York, 
London and Tokyo, all requesting some of the 500 models represented by 
Ellechante. 
</P>
<P>
 Business is going well, Lozano said, because of the changing trends of the 
fashion industry and new trade opportunities in Mexico after the passage this 
year of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're seeing the apogee of Latinas in modeling -- you open any 
fashion magazine and you'll see lots of Mexicans, Venezuelans, Brazilians. . . 
. Our exotic looks are in high demand," Lozano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you go to Mexico, blondes are all the rage. Fortunately for us, we can 
provide them with what they want since we represent models with all types of 
backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she is bothered by what she perceives as a lack of respect 
for working women in Mexico, Lozano said she pursues every chance to work 
there, in the past year providing talent for commercials, magazine shoots and 
rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunities are just too good to pass up." 
</P>

<P>
 Following a fire last week that ripped through a rental guest house, killing 
four people and injuring four others, the City Council unanimously passed an 
emergency ordinance requiring smoke detectors in all residential rental units. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires smoke detectors in all multifamily dwelling units, but the 
new city ordinance requires that detectors approved by the county fire marshal 
be installed and maintained in all rental units except those that are owner 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have known smoke detectors were required, they would have been 
there," Felipe Soto, 18, one of the co-owners of the fire-gutted rental unit, 
told the council. The single-family unit was not covered by state law. "This 
ordinance would be a reassurance that something like this wouldn't happen to 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 13 fire started after 6-year-old Eddie Hernandez, playing with a 
lighter, ignited the guest home's lace curtains, said Juana Hernandez, 39, who 
survived the blaze that engulfed the $500-a-month unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie was pronounced dead at the scene by county fire officials. In the days 
that followed the blaze, Maria Castillo, 35, her daughter Erica, 8, and 
Hernandez's daughter Jessica, 2, also died from their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire inspectors said they were unsure last week whether smoke detectors 
would have made a difference in such a quick-spreading fire. SIMON ROMERO

<P>
 The draft of a five-year implementation plan will be considered for two 
redevelopment zones at a public hearing Monday by the city Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6 p.m. hearing in the auditorium of 10th Street Elementary School, 1000 
Grattan Ave. at the corner of Olympic Boulevard, will solicit public comment on 
proposals for the area, project manager Maxine Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year proposal for the zones designated Pico-Union I and II includes 
plans for commercial corridor revitalization; a large-family development with 
community space at Connecticut and Albany streets; a residential rehabilitation 
program; a supermarket near Pico Boulevard and Alvarado Street, and a mixed-use 
project at 1115 Alvarado St. that will house offices for the Central American 
Resource Center, Chavez said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pico-Union I redevelopment zone is bounded by Olympic Boulevard on the 
north, the Santa Monica Freeway on the south, the Harbor Freeway on the east 
and Union and Burlington avenues on the west. Pico-Union II shares the same 
north and south boundaries, but is bounded by Union and Burlington avenues on 
the east and Hoover Street on the west.

<P>
 The frustrations of living and working in one of the city's most crowded and 
crime-ridden neighborhoods have propelled a group of residents, merchants and 
parents to unite as the area's newest community improvement group. 
</P>
<P>
 The New City/Pueblo Nuevo Prevention Project held its first meeting last week 
in the auditorium of Esperanza Elementary School, attended by about 50 Westlake 
locals and city representatives, including personnel from various civic 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is targeting essentially the same problems -- including violent 
crime, drug abuse, homelessness and crowded, often-substandard housing -- as 
other neighborhood alliances in the area. Even so, co-founders Cathy Lee and 
Bert Saavedra hope to continue attracting representatives from law enforcement 
and from city departments such as housing, building and safety, sanitation, and 
street use to address citizens' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In an activity the group calls "circles of change," police and city 
representatives break into small circles with members for question-and-answer 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals are not as intimidated talking in a circle," said Saavedra, who 
is on the staff of the Los Angeles Alliance for a Drug Free Community.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez stressed the importance of clear communication 
between the community and city agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 "Community-based policing alone is not going to do it," he told the crowd. "We 
have to talk about community-based city services." 
</P>
<P>
 A priority for the group is to clean up a drug-dealing hub near 7th Street and 
Burlington Avenue, a block from Esperanza Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," said Lee, who is trying to clean up the neighborhood on 
behalf of her family real estate firm whose properties are all in Westlake, 
several near the school. "You just drive up and get it (drugs). It's like 
getting cash out of an ATM." 
</P>
<P>
 New City/Pueblo Nuevo meetings will be held regularly at the school, 680 
Little St. The next meeting is Oct. 6, at 8:30 a.m.

 For the first time in its 17-month history, the Los Angeles Urban League 
Automotive Training Center hit on all cylinders: All 14 of its recent graduates 
have been placed in full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crenshaw center, a partnership between the Urban League and Toyota Motor 
Sales, has been training students and finding them jobs since opening in April, 
1993, but until this month could not claim 100% employment for a graduating 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled about it," said Toyota spokeswoman Nancy Hubbell. "The center 
is certainly coming into its own. It's developing a very good reputation among 
employers as well as students." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Lopez, 47, said his air-conditioning repair training and subsequent 
employment at DSL Transportation in South Gate was something of a godsend. "I 
came out of jail in April and was looking for something exactly like this," he 
said enthusiastically. "When I saw an ad for the center on cable TV, I thought, 
'Wow, this is just what I want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since its opening, the center has schooled 116 students in a variety of 
automotive repair techniques, including air conditioning, brakes and 
suspension, emissions and smog check, exhaust, accessory installation and 
detailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota committed more than $3 million to the project after the 1992 riots to 
help mitigate local unemployment. The free, full-time training program is 
offered continually and is open to all Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For Karen Williams, 29, the sole female graduate this month, the center 
afforded the opportunity to make good on a longtime wish to be a mechanic. "I 
was working in security, but that's not what I really wanted to do," said 
Williams, who installs brakes, tires and batteries at the Sears Automotive 
Center in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. "This is an excellent program. You 
learn a lot in a short amount of time." ERIN J. AUBRY

COVER STORY; A VIEW FROM THE BUS; AS THEY ANXIOUSLY AWAIT RULING ON PROPOSED 
FARE HIKES AND ELIMINATION OF MONTHLY PASSES, MANY POOR AND MINORITY RESIDENTS 
ARE ALREADY CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF WHATEVER DECISION IS 
REACHED.

<P>
 By 5:45 a.m., Pearl Daniels is waiting for bus No. 206 at Normandie Avenue and 
6th Street so she can head to work in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniels, 60, the daily routine includes a transfer to another bus at 
Normandie Avenue and Sunset Boulevard so that she can get to her job as a 
telephone operator at the Hyatt Hotel on Sunset by 7 a.m. When she gets off 
work at 3 p.m., Daniels hustles across the boulevard to catch the No. 3 bus and 
begin her hourlong ride back home. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, buses have meant as much to Daniels as do cars to the throngs of 
solo motorists who clog the Southern California freeways each rush hour. But 
these days her reliance on public transit has Daniels so fearful of a proposed 
25-cent bus fare hike and the possible elimination of monthly bus passes that 
she rarely spends money riding a bus for anything other than work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can help it, I don't go out," said Daniels, who lives on Ardmore Avenue 
in Koreatown. "I don't hop on the bus like I used to. " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, remarks from people whose livelihoods depend almost 
entirely on buses show that Daniels is far from alone. Several riders, of whom 
transit officials say there are an estimated 475,000 daily in the metropolitan 
area, said they are on edge because their lives would become significantly more 
difficult under the proposed hike by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 
which calls for one-way fares to increase from $1.10 to $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 While the fare hike issue is still in legal limbo, it has raised fears that 
the higher fares may cause some poor residents to miss medical appointments, 
cut back on grocery shopping, jeopardize job opportunities or become reclusive. 
The fears already have manifested themselves in cries of protest at MTA 
meetings from advocates for the poor and even resulted in a hunger strike that 
left two men seriously ill during the summer before it was called off. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for riders emphasize that about six in 10 regular riders have 
household incomes of less than $15,000 a year, and therefore any increase would 
prove a financial burden on the majority of riders. Most riders board buses 
more than once each day, resulting in a total of nearly 1.2 million boardings 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials, meanwhile, are trying to convince anyone who will listen that 
the authority's first bus fare hike in six years is essential to combat a 
$126-million operating deficit that if left unaddressed is bound to result in 
service problems down the road. Besides, they say, tokens would remain 
available to bus riders at 90 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides are anxiously awaiting a decision by U.S. District Judge Terry J. 
Hatter Jr. on whether the fare hike would unfairly burden poor and minority 
residents, who make up the vast majority of bus riders. A hearing is scheduled 
Oct. 17 on whether a trial should be held on a lawsuit accusing the MTA of 
discrimination in pushing for the fare hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, many poor and minority residents in Los Angeles already are 
convinced they are being taken advantage of regardless of Hatter's ruling. 
Lawsuits and spreadsheets aside, many riders believe they will bear the brunt 
of whatever decision is made. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, waiting for a bus home from work near social hot spots such as The 
Comedy Store and House of Blues, said she thought the impact of the bus fare 
issue would be better understood if officials paid attention to the problems 
riders face each day. Indeed, the faces of those who depend on public 
transportation can be forgettable for those who zip past bus stops in cars. One 
moment, you see people waiting, then the stoplight changes from red to green 
and you are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to forget the tired elderly woman who sits on a bench in 
South-Central surrounded by plastic shopping bags, one or two of them serving 
as pillows for the young boy with her. There is no way to know without asking 
that the young mother who is waiting for a bus with her infant is trying to get 
to a baby-sitter and then to her job as a seamstress Downtown. The serious, 
middle-aged man standing in the shade is heading for a medical appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 And once on a bus, riders can lose virtually all individuality. For many, it 
is the vehicle that people normally focus on from outside, not the riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bus riders attributed what they say is second-class treatment of 
riders to the notion that individual car ownership is an ingrained part of the 
Los Angeles culture. In other words, there must be something wrong with you if 
you do not own your own car and must ride a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Daniels said, there are probably many riders who feel worried or 
trapped and are saving every quarter for their most important rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I feel. You can't get out when you want to," Daniels said. 
"They isolated me a lot already." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who decried the filth of some buses and the criminal activity that 
sometimes occurs on buses, said nonetheless that she normally feels comfortable 
riding them. But lately, stops at the market for milk, shopping trips, weekend 
rides to the park and visits to friends or family have been scaled back 
drastically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The upkeep of a car is too expensive," said Daniels, who makes about $17,000 
a year at the Hyatt. "The bus is the only way I can go because the old car I 
had was always going down and I was on the bus anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Ameer Rashid, who was waiting for a bus recently on Jefferson Boulevard off 
Crenshaw Boulevard, said he does not own a car and that those seeking a fare 
hike should be more concerned with improving mass transit services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who ride the bus think it's high enough already," said Rashid, 
56, who relies on buses about three times a week to get to medical appointments 
or to do research for a local developer. "The fare would be OK if the buses ran 
more often. Right now they don't run that frequent in this neighborhood. To 
talk about a fare hike is ridiculous. They ain't had better service in six 
years. You've got to get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was echoed by Kim Hyun Kyung, 18, who was among about a dozen 
people waiting for a bus at Western Avenue off Olympic Boulevard one day last 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's too hard for the citizens," she said, referring to higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The reliance many residents have on the system is most obvious at bus stops 
like the one at Spring and Temple streets by City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, as buses came and went, the number of people waiting for their 
rides never seemed to get below a dozen or so. The flow was steady as buses 
headed for different parts of the county pulled up, loaded passengers, and 
pulled away every few minutes.

 Janet Gonzalez, 22, stood holding her 3-month-old daughter, Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the proposed fare hike is frightening to her and her husband 
because they are struggling to make ends meet. Both earn low wages mending 
clothes, and their daughter requires a baby-sitter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worries me a lot," Gonzalez said in Spanish. "It is a big problem because 
salaries are low, especially for us Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Greene, a spokeswoman for the MTA, said officials sympathize with 
residents who may face hardship if the fare hike goes through, but options such 
as buying 90-cent tokens in packets of 10 are designed to ease the impact on 
the poor. A balanced MTA budget is mandatory by law, and although the proposed 
fare hike has drawn the most public attention, plans involve other cost-cutting 
measures such as reducing services on lines carrying few passengers and cutting 
administrative positions within the agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people are afraid of the unknown," Greene said. "Our 
passengers would be saving money by buying tokens. All we can do is keep on 
talking to community groups and spreading the word at schools and at public 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Some riders, however, fear that using tokens would become too expensive if 
frequent stops and transfers are necessary -- a common occurrence for the 
thousands of riders who make one or more connections to get across the city. 
Bus riders who make frequent transfers tend to rely on the $42 monthly pass, 
which allows for an unlimited number of rides and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the basic fare increase, the MTA proposal includes the elimination of 
regular monthly passes and increasing the fares on special monthly passes -- 
from $10 to $12 for monthly passes for senior citizens and the disabled, 
including blind passengers who formerly traveled at no charge; from $25 to $30 
for college and vocational school students, and from $18 to $20 for 
schoolchildren. Zone charges of 50 cents would apply on express bus lines and 
the Blue Line trolley. Transfers would remain at 25 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly understand. Just the sound of a fare raise is scary to 
people," Greene said. "But we are in line with what is happening across the 
country. What else can you buy now at 1988 prices?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, selling the plan to those who sit waiting for buses when they are dead 
tired, sick, late for a job interview or just eager to visit a friend is tough. 
It is not as though all riders want the same thing. For example, some 
vehemently oppose the higher fares while others are more interested in making 
sure the regular $42 monthly passes are not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't begrudge them an increase, but keep the passes," said Michael Pell, 
44, a senior clerk typist for the Los Angeles Police Department who rides buses 
regularly from Melrose and La Brea avenues to Downtown and back. "It's good for 
the rider and it's good for the system. It's good for keeping buses on time." 
</P>
<P>
 After a Sept. 12 hearing on the case in U.S. District Court, about 30 people 
gathered outside to oppose the fair hike and criticize authorities for their 
financial support of a new, expensive regional rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bus riders and community activists are convinced that racial bias is a 
key factor influencing the call for higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Various activists and riders insist the transportation authority has funded 
rail projects that largely benefit affluent white commuters, rather than poor 
or minority riders. MTA officials dispute that accusation and now it appears 
that the discrimination will be decided in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, MTA figures show that nearly 47% of all bus riders are 
Latino, about 23% are black, about 19% are white, close to 9% are Asian and the 
remainder are of other ethnic backgrounds. In addition, more than 61% of all 
riders have household incomes under $15,000 a year; about 23% earn between 
$15,000 and $30,000, and a little more than 10% have household incomes between 
$31,000 and $50,000. Less than 5% bring home more than $50,000, the figures 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Llorente, who earns a total of about $9,000 a year and shares an 
apartment in Hollywood with his brother, travels from bus to bus in order to 
work two jobs and remain an active community volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Llorente, 22, works helping develop housing, business and youth services, and 
each day travels first to one local organization in Inglewood for a few hours 
and then to another local group in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Easygoing and quick with a smile, Llorente said any increase in bus fares 
could jeopardize one of his part-time jobs and would undoubtedly reduce the 
amount of volunteer work he could do to help youths in troubled neighborhoods. 
Tokens may be an option, he said, if the MTA comes through with its plan to 
create more purchase sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Llorente said he believes he could land higher-paying work, but for now is 
willing to sacrifice better wages for the satisfaction of working at improving 
urban conditions at the grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to struggle a lot but I'm working for the community right now," he 
said. "My thoughts are that the people of the MTA should understand that there 
are a lot of people like me who cannot travel at these higher prices. We just 
cannot afford it."

VOICES: CHANGING THE IMAGE OF PUBLIC HOUSING; LONGTIME ALISO VILLAGE RESIDENT 
STRIVES FOR RENTER EMPOWERMENT AS NEWLY APPOINTED COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DINA GONZALEZ, Dina Gonzalez, 37, was recently appointed to the board of 
commissioners of the Los Angeles Housing Authority. A native of El Salvador, 
Gonzalez has lived in the Aliso Village housing project since she arrived in 
the United States with her parents in 1971. Aliso Village, bordering Downtown 
and the Eastside, houses 3,000 residents in 683 units. For three years, 
Gonzalez has been a volunteer secretary, treasurer and sergeant-at-arms for the 
Aliso Village Resident Advisory Council. In 1993, she served on the city's 
Affordable Housing Commission. She was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1960s, my father came here from El Salvador and worked in a factory 
assembling forklifts. He was a hard-working man who had worked in a bottling 
company in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, my three sisters and I came to the United States to join my father 
in the early 1970s. My mother went to work in a garment factory. 
</P>
<P>
 We all grew up in Aliso Village. My parents eventually moved out into their 
own home, but I still live here. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't intend to move out until I see the changes here that I want to make 
happen. I want to see more programs for the kids and I want to change the image 
that people have about public housing. Everyone thinks that people who live in 
public housing are dumb or something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I want us all to come together and show the rest of the people that we can do 
things for ourselves -- that we don't need help. It's going to be a hard thing 
to do, and I don't know how to do it, but that's my dream. 
</P>
<P>
 I started working with the president of the Aliso Village residents' group in 
1991. We both worked in a local school cafeteria. One day I got a flyer from 
the residents' group and the Spanish translation was misspelled. I took it to 
her at work and told her it was poor. I said I couldn't understand it. So, she 
asked me if I could help out by doing the translation for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Aliso Village are 90% Latino. When I started spending time in 
the office and they found out I spoke Spanish, a lot more people started coming 
to the office. Pretty soon I found I was working there 10 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 I was appointed to the Housing Commission by the mayor on City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre's recommendation. It is a volunteer position, but it takes a 
lot of my time. I am representing 21 developments from East Los Angeles to 
South-Central to San Fernando, plus a small site for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 I have found that if people have a problem, I have to go there and work on 
solving it with them. Mostly, people don't want to come forward with their 
problems. They're afraid to report it because they don't want other people to 
find out. They have more confidence if we go to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial tensions are bad at some of the developments, though not at Aliso 
Village because there almost everyone is Latino. Once I helped a South American 
family whose apartment was torched because of a racial dispute. We got them 
moved into another building in a different development. 
</P>
<P>
 I find I have to be a negotiator in family disputes and neighbor disputes. 
They call me every day, probably because many people feel more comfortable with 
me  
</P>
<P>
 because of my Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very interested in seeing the youth become more involved in the 
community. They need more education, they need job training so they can be more 
productive than destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 At Aliso Village we have some programs for the youth that are working well. I 
hope these programs can spread to some of the other developments. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, I supervised 15 kids in a summer youth program. They beautify the 
community and remove graffiti. It keeps them busy and out of trouble and gives 
them a job.  
</P>
<P>
 I have a lot of faith in these kids. They trust me and I trust them, and I 
know they're not going to let me down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We just created a Youth Advisory Council for kids 14 to 21 years old. Their 
goal is to create a day-care center and a playground for Aliso Village, and 
they want to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the people in this development, we don't have a playground here. 
There's a park across the street, but most of the younger children are too 
little to cross the street and their parents are afraid to send them over there 
because of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are going to write a proposal and hopefully they're going to get some 
money to start the project. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time we are also establishing youth groups, like a 4-H Club and 
a Boy Scout troop, here at Aliso Village. The teen center at Aliso Village used 
to be open from 2 p.m. to 9 in the evening, but it had to be closed because we 
didn't have enough volunteers. I want to see that reopened. It gives the kids 
something positive to do after school. 
</P>
<P>
 We are using the teen center now as an alternative school, so some of the kids 
who have had problems in the local school won't drop out but can take their 
classes at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's time to get the parents more involved and educate them about what's 
going on with their teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many things I want to do. I am in this job until 1996, and I hope 
I can really make a difference over the next two years.

HIT PARADE; AS PART OF THE PHYSICAL SOUTHERN PACIFIC CONFERENCE, DORSEY'S 
FOOTBALL REPUTATION IS ALWAYS ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late Bankouadagba left Dorsey High football practice early Monday after making 
a punishing block. He didn't have the intestinal fortitude to continue smashing 
his 6-foot-2, 300-pound body against other seemingly immobile objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticing Bankouadagba was beaten, assistant Rick Mull asked Coach Paul Knox: 
"Should I call AAA to pick up Late?" 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Knox to a reporter: "Late is the type of guy who can get out of 
shape over a weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey can ill afford to lose Bankouadagba or any other lineman of his stature 
-- and not because of what his name might be worth, triple-points, in Scrabble. 
Bankouadagba is the key ingredient for the Dons, who play in a conference that 
can turn beefy linemen into soup bone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Southern Pacific is the most physical conference, from top to bottom, 
than any other conference in the City," Knox said. "The biggest problem is not 
losing games, but getting beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Friday, the 1993 City Section 4-A finalist will play Washington, 
followed by Crenshaw and 4-A champions Carson in Southern Pacific Conference 
games. Perennial power Banning and 3-A champion San Pedro also belong to the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dorsey wins more than its fair share of conference games, the Dons 
prepare in daily practice to take a beating. "You have to be physical in both 
lines or you will get run over," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons are rebuilding their offensive line, mixing veterans with rookies to 
protect quarterback Roderick Brown and to open gaping holes for the talented 
Don running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bankouadagba, a Division I-caliber player, cannot alone guarantee 
protection for Brown. The Dons have also come to rely on 6-2, 280-pound tackle 
Chris King, and 6-1, 215-pound tackle Anthony Tinsley. 
</P>
<P>
 "To play in our conference, you have to be physically and mentally ready," 
Tinsley said. "You have to practice hard every day, including the day before 
the game. If you don't, you will feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 By high school standards, Tinsley is not a small player. But neither is Dorsey 
defensive end Che Britton, a 6-2, 221-pound defensive end, nor David Genyard, a 
6-1, 235-pound defensive tackle. But the Southern Pacific Conference 
historically has produced players big beyond their years. In the 1980s, Banning 
and Carson, on the average, had a few teams with bigger offensive linemen than 
the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys are bigger than me," said Britton, who estimates the average 
offensive lineman to be 6-3 and 280 to 300 pounds. "I have to use my speed to 
get by most of the guys and out-think them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bankouadagba and Britton were among the unsung heroes in Dons' 44-0 
season-opening romp over Jefferson. However, Bankouadagba did not play in the 
second game because he missed four days of practice. And Britton suffered a 
dislocated left knee during the 14-13 loss to Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 As rough as Dorsey's nonleague schedule is, it's nothing compared to Southern 
Pacific Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learn to be physical and play a physical style of football in conference," 
Knox said. "It's either: You learn to beat up and get beat up, or lose and get 
hurt in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, as a Dorsey assistant, Knox quickly learned the difference between 
dominating the 3-A Division and competing at the 4-A level in the Southern 
Pacific Conference. In one season, the Dons went from a 3-A semifinalist to a 
4-A doormat with a 2-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Knox became head coach and Dorsey had its first winning season in the 
4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest positions to fill are your linemen," Knox said. "Most of the 
skill players are able to play Pop Warner football. But because of the weight 
limit, your bigger guys can't play because they are too heavy. Most of them 
haven't put on pads until they get to high school. And it takes a good year or 
two to develop them as football players." 
</P>
<P>
 While his backs and receivers run track or play baseball in the spring, Knox's 
linemen have begun conditioning, lifting weights three days a week and running 
two. When fall practice begins, Knox and his coaches teach blocking 
fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be patient," he said. "It takes a lot of repetitions. Most 
linemen have never played before and you have to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons won their first City 4-A title in 1989 and won their second two years 
later. A seven-game conference schedule will determine whether these Dons are 
fit to carry the winning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our conference schedule helps us prepare for the playoffs because we play 
tough teams week after week," Knox said. "We will be ready to play physical, 
intense football. There will be no letdown."

 The Locke High School football program has been placed on a year's probation 
for making contact with athletes outside the school attendance area, a 
violation of California Interscholastic Federation rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 14, the City Section's Interscholastic Athletic Committee placed 
Locke on probation, which serves to warn the school against possible other 
infractions that may lead to stiffer penalties, including barring the team from 
playoffs or suspending the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Angeles Unified School District school made allegations against 
Locke, said City Athletic Commissioner Barbara Fiege. The committee also placed 
Sylmar and Woodlands Hills Taft on probation for various rules infractions.

 Birtcher Medical Systems Inc., an Irvine surgical products manufacturer, 
posted a loss of $20.9 million, or $2.28 a share, for its fiscal year ended 
June 30.Most of the loss was recorded for the third quarter as a result of a 
divestiture and restructuring program. That compared to a loss of $2 million,

</P>
<P>
 Sales fell 18% to $34.3 million from $42 million. For the fourth quarter, the 
company lost $1.8 million, or 19 cents a common share, compared to a loss of 
$2.2 million, or 24 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.
