 Pop of Fame: We mentioned that the removal of some stars from the Hollywood 
Walk of Fame for Metro Rail construction had prompted calls from far-flung 
reporters who thought the attraction was being discontinued.

 It's not, of course. But other celebrity patches seem to be stealing the

FBI MAKES CASE FOR DECENCY; HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT AND OTHER ACTS DISPLAY A 
SPIRIT OF REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his short tenure, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh has taken quick aim at 
discrimination within the agency and made it clear that he expects employees, 
including those in supervisory positions, to observe high standards in every 
area of conduct. It is heartening to see that Freeh's guidelines apparently 
represent something more than just words in an agency that has been buffeted by 
charges of discrimination and retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for two female agents in Orange County who alleged that they were 
fondled and taunted by their supervisor has reported a settlement of nearly 
$350,000 with the FBI -- and personal attention from the top of the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations in the case cover what has become familiar ground in the 
depressing litany of harassment tales coming out of various law enforcement 
agencies around the country. The plaintiffs, Agent Heather Power-Anderson and 
Boni Carr-Alduenda, say their supervisor, who denies the charges, grabbed them 
and made lewd remarks over several months in 1992. Among the accusations was 
that the supervisor kissed one on the back of the neck while she was sitting at 
her desk and that on another occasion he tore her dress while forcing his hand 
onto her upper thigh. The women, both recipients of commendations for good 
work, say they were discouraged from filing complaints and continue to endure 
cold-shoulder treatment from some colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
 The swift settlement of the case and the transfer of the supervisor to another 
office, along with proceedings initiated recently to terminate him, send an 
important signal. The FBI is saying it intends to back its commitment to ending 
sexual harassment with action and money if need be, however deeply ingrained 
some of the nonsense may be in parts of the institutional culture.

SADLY, PROP. 1A IS NEEDED; BONDS ARE REQUIRED BECAUSE STATE REJECTED 
PAY-AS-YOU-GO METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of the $9.5 billion in federal earthquake recovery aid allocated to 
California since Jan. 17 is contingent on the state's paying part of the costs 
of repair and retrofitting. For example, California is responsible for 10% of 
the costs for repairing or rebuilding schools and other public buildings, 
utilities and streets and roads damaged in the Northridge quake, and 25% of the 
costs of upgrading public buildings in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties 
to withstand seismic shaking. Proposition 1A, a $2-billion bond issue on the 
June ballot, would provide funds to meet these and other earthquake-related 
needs. Is the money needed? Of course, without question. Is yet another 
general-obligation bond issue the best way to provide funds? Decidedly not. 
</P>
<P>
 The clearly preferable way to pay for earthquake repair is a small, temporary 
increase in the state sales tax and a small, temporary boost in the state 
gasoline tax. That is the course we urged earlier this year. It is the option 
that Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature recoiled from in political horror. So 
now, instead of a fiscally sound and low-cost pay-as-you-go method of financing 
needed work, Californians are being asked to approve a bond issue that, when 
estimated interest is taken into account, would cost taxpayers not $2 billion 
but about $3.6 billion over the anticipated 25-year life of the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it make sense? No. It pushes debt off into the next generation even as it 
needlessly raises California's total bonded indebtedness, with a potential 
adverse effect on the state's bond rating and the interest it must pay to sell 
its bonds. Noting that, California is still left with the urgent need to 
finance its share of earthquake repair and hazard-mitigation costs. This 
measure is now unhappily the only feasible way to do that. In the face of that 
compelling necessity, we reluctantly recommend a "yes" vote on Proposition 1A.

AND NOW A CONTRACT FOR POLICE REFORM; TENTATIVE DEAL STANDS TO LIBERATE LAPD 
AND CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police union appears ready to approve the city's new contract 
offer on Thursday, and that's reason to sigh in relief. The police officers 
have been without an employment contract for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, after handing water and power workers a nice raise, had pleaded 
poverty. In anger, the police union went a bit off the deep end, putting up, 
and then taking down after a public outcry, billboard posters advertising the 
city's crime problems. From there, matters could have gotten a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with a new contract under their belt, the police could go about their 
work with a measure of assurance and respect. Also, City Hall must go about its 
work, and that includes Mayor Richard Riordan continuing to put all possible 
support behind the Christopher Commission's still-endangered reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the new contract in some ways could make achievement of some of the 
reforms more difficult. The mayor, rightly in our view, had wanted the deal to 
include bonus money for patrol work (the kind of police work emphasized in the 
proposed reforms) and greater assignment flexibility for Chief Willie L. 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 When Williams took over the LAPD two years ago, he inherited not only a 
tradition-bound agency not wholly openhearted to outsiders but a bureaucracy 
saddled with inflexible civil service rules. The police union -- unwisely, we 
think -- resisted the patrol-bonus idea as being somehow unfair to detectives 
(who are paid better anyway); the flexibility rules got shot down, too. Both 
ideas are good ones that should be revived later. 
</P>
<P>
 Having made plain these reservations, we nonetheless are pleased that a 
contract tentatively has been agreed on and that the work of the police seems 
about to be freed of distraction. Under Williams, the LAPD has an improved 
public image and greater public confidence, but it must work hard to maintain 
the momentum. Many officers do not oppose the general thrust of the Christopher 
reforms and in fact could provide the energy needed to carry them out. That 
energy must not be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors appear crucial to us. One is the relationship between the 
mayor and the chief, which must remain positive and creative. Neither side must 
lose patience with the other. The mayor needs to realize that getting control 
of a long-established bureaucracy like the LAPD will take years; the chief has 
to understand the pressures on the mayor, especially in a time of rising 
citizen fears about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key factors are the City Council, which holds the purse strings, and the 
Police Commission, which is the civilian overseer of the department. Commission 
members -- all so new to the job -- need to accelerate their learning curve so 
they can strike the right balance: neither intervening and trying to 
micro-manage the department nor staying so aloof that they fail to hold the 
chief and his top people accountable to basic public policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Once signed, the LAPD contract should mark both the end of labor troubles and 
the beginning of the new era of reform. There is much about the LAPD that can 
make the city proud. The goal of the Christopher reforms is not to diminish the 
Police Department's stature but to help it protect and serve the people even 
better.

EXECUTION OF GACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The execution of John Wayne Gacy (May 10) was a sad spectacle. People marched 
the streets of Chicago demanding Gacy's execution, a prosecutor declared that 
it would be "a privilege to see him draw his last breath," and law enforcement 
officers threw a party to celebrate the extinguishment of life.These people 
have succumbed to hatred, becoming killers just like Gacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi said that "an eye for an eye makes us all blind." We need to open our 
eyes and see that state-sanctioned killing cheapens the value of life for all 
of us. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT M. MYERS

</P>
<P>
 What a strange world we live in! 
</P>
<P>
 A killer like Gacy who brutally murdered 33 young men and buried them under 
his house is put to death in the most peaceful way imaginable -- an injection 
to induce sleep. Followed by two more to stop his cardiac and respiratory 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet someone like Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who in my eyes is an angel, has been 
taken into police custody and battles with the law for simply trying to help 
people with terminal illnesses die with dignity and without pain. 
</P>
<P>
 How ironic that decent human beings must be forced to suffer the daily 
tortures of living with long, debilitating diseases, when there is not any hope 
of recovery. While the Gacys -- who inflict suffering -- suffer not at all!

YITZHAK RABIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I agree wholeheartedly with Abba Eban's comments on the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement signed in Cairo (Commentary, May 4). I would add, however, that while 
enlightened self-interest may explain the parties' willingness to negotiate, 
the tenacity demonstrated in the bloody months following the Washington 
handshake is a tribute to courage and vision -- particularly as regards Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember how tense and uncomfortable Rabin appeared at the Washington 
ceremony. Here was a man who had devoted his life to serving the state of 
Israel, as statesman and soldier. Rabin stood at the podium and admitted how 
painful it was for him to be there. He acknowledged his many countrymen and 
women who had perished over the years. Nonetheless, despite his personal pain, 
he had the courage and vision to imagine a peaceful and prosperous future for 
Israelis and Palestinians.

 * Reacting to the signing of agreements between Israel and the PLO in 
Washington and Cairo, I found PLO leader Yasser Arafat in military garb on both 
occasions disconcerting. We don't need this symbol of aggression. To accomplish 
the inevitable peace that both peoples need, we need more constructive symbols. 
The best will be scenes and stories of people living and working together, 
albeit each in one's their own environment, but together in spirit, trust and 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 As there are many chauvinistic spirits at work to thwart this noble end, 
American Arabs and Jews have to encourage and support those political forces 
that can make peace possible.

CRITICISM OF CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien's ruling on the CLAS testing program ("Judge Finds No 
Privacy Invasion in CLAS Tests," May 11) makes clear that those opposing the 
writing and problem-solving on the tests are really opposing education itself 
-- at least education defined as helping students to develop their thinking 
skills. Like many of the voucher proponents, these opponents of the California 
Learning Assessment System tests want education to serve as indoctrination into 
their own belief systems; failing that, they want to ensure that students do 
not get much chance to think for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is shame that the testing and scoring were bungled so badly the first time, 
giving an opening to those who want education to close down minds rather than 
open them up. We should make the tests work better, not yield to those who find 
thinking to be a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 EDWARD M. WHITE 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial support ("A Key Question for Any Test," May 7) of Sen. Gary 
Hart's (D-Santa Barbara) proposal to correct shortcomings in the management of 
the CLAS tests is sensible. Protecting privacy, providing independent review, 
and offering samples of previous tests should allay concerns. The test samples 
that I have seen in news stories indicate to me that the exams use a logical 
system of assessing a student's reading, questioning, discussing and writing 
skills -- all of which are essential in the information age that is already 
here. The CLAS tests are not the problem. Underestimating the complexity of 
scoring the tests, failing to provide positive, public awareness, and not 
opening the test pages for review have created a problem. Hart's bill should 
rectify the flaws in the delivery system. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the age-old debate over appropriateness. I want my children to 
value their own traditions, but I also want them to read the literature of 
diversity, to experience women authors, to engage in discussion, to write about 
controversial issues. I want them to respond; I don't want them to simply vomit 
a list of 500 significant names, dates and places. Who decides what is 
significant? I honor those who have concerns; I hope they will respect my view 
by seeing Hart's amendments as a sensible solution. I also hope that business 
leaders, university officials, school board members, scholars, teachers, 
parents -- anyone who values open discussion and critical thinking -- will 
publicly support the CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I am a retired English teacher and currently a member of the local school 
board, speaking for myself and hundreds of parents. These are not academically 
rigorous tests -- in fact, not academic at all. I speak of the reading and 
writing parts of CLAS. The real objections are to the quality of the prompts 
and the very elementary nature of the writing required. Surely when students 
reach 10th grade they should be expected to write good, expository prose based 
on judgments made -- and supported -- from the text. CLAS does not expect that. 
It asks for touchy-feely personal responses, written in first-person narrative, 
the simplest kind of writing. "Telling a story" is what students have done 
since kindergarten and CLAS should be exacting more than that, especially since 
those who support these tests claim such high standards for them. Nonsense! 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy demanded for these tests -- to the point of threats of fines, 
pulling of credentials, etc., should raise red flags to parents and teachers 
alike. The further threat to local control, the cornerstone of public 
education, is another deep concern.

UNDERWATER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Beneath the Not So Silent Sea," May 3: 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Defense Department and the shipping and oil industries don't think 
whales and other sea life are affected by human-induced noises reaching to 230 
decibels underwater. After all, they say, there isn't any evidence of this.Has 
anyone researched why whales, seals and dolphins beach themselves on our 
shores; why whales are found swimming in our inland rivers? I doubt very much 
that these industries would spend the time and money to research information 
that could be downright detrimental to their causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric of these industries sounds like that of the building and 
development industries concerning the gnatcatcher -- there's just no evidence 
that human encroachment really affects these creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing there's plenty evidence of -- big $$$ is making lots of noise!

CAMPAIGN WATCH; OPENING THE CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many local ballot measures are of purely local importance. One that is of 
statewide and potentially nationwide importance is Proposition M in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a campaign reform measure that would sharply reduce the influence of big 
money in Long Beach government and sharply lower the financial hurdle that a 
candidate for public office has to clear. The measure would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limit contributions to $250 per election per City Council candidate; to 
$500 per candidate per mayoral candidate. The period when money could be 
solicited also would be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limit overall spending on a voluntary basis to $40,000 per City Council 
primary ($20,000 in a runoff); to $200,000 per mayoral primary ($100,000 in a 
runoff). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provide limited public funding by matching small private contributions with 
public money, up to one-third of the expenditure limit in a primary or one-half 
in a runoff; this would cost each resident about 50 cents per year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Impose strict rules of contribution disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Proposition M, if passed, will be only the second public financing 
measure in effect in California, it has a path-breaking potential. The sad loss 
of public confidence in American political institutions arises from the often 
all-too-accurate perception that elected officials function as an insiders' 
club, serving private interests at taxpayer expense. Modest public funding, a 
cap on expenditure and strict rules of disclosure would serve the public by 
throwing open the doors of the club. The Times warmly endorses Proposition M.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; DEBATE MAKES IT A RACE; FOR THE FIRST TIME, A TELEVISED 
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE LETS PEOPLE THE JUDGE CONTENDERS FOR THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In one fell swoop, the first presidential debate in Mexico's history has 
altered the country's political prospects. Well-armed with an acerbic tongue 
and a combative style, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the 
right-wing National Action Party (PAN), won the debate and emerged as a 
contender in the August election. His victory has transformed into a 
three-party contest what pundits had predicted would be a two-way race between 
Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party 
(PRI) and left-leaning contender Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the population watched transfixed as Fernandez went straight 
for the jugular of his two main opponents, leaving them reeling under the 
onslaught of his verbal jests. Fernandez poked fun at Zedillo's technocratic 
background, calling him "a good boy who got good grades, but who failed the 
democracy test." He dug out documents linking avowed democrat Cardenas to 
authoritarian decisions in his incarnation as PRI governor of the state of 
Michoacan. His biting tongue and self-assured, aggressive demeanor won praise 
from a population trained to admire men with a heavy hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the debate, Fernandez had been trailing far behind in the polls and was 
perceived by many as politically irrelevant. His aristocratic bearing, his 
habit of collecting expensive cars, his social conservatism and his willingness 
to endorse the PAN's legislative marriage of convenience with the PRI 
throughout the Salinas term made him a controversial figure. Fernandez knew 
that the debate was his last window of opportunity to leap back into the 
presidential race, and he seized it. His support in the polls jumped from 14% 
to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI's hastily chosen candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, revealed one serious 
Achilles' heel: his incapacity to react as a politician. Zedillo arrived with a 
well-constructed, prefabricated speech. He arrived ensconced in the typically 
arrogant attitude of a member of the PRI, feeling that he owed no explanations, 
nor did he have to debate anyone. Confronted with Fernandez's attacks, he 
behaved as his party usually does: He ignored the opposition and came off as an 
insecure, inexperienced and cornered candidate. He fell from 45% to 38% in the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the big loser of the debate was Cardenas. Armed with his most 
powerful weapon -- moral authority -- Cardenas also believed that he could win 
merely by appearing presidential. He gambled on the power of his personal 
integrity, without realizing that in a debate, even moral superiority is up for 
grabs. Cardenas seemed wooden, sullen, ill-prepared and perhaps worst of all, 
surprised: shocked that his political foe on the right would call his PRI past 
into question and condemn him as a Janus-faced, hypocritical leader not to be 
trusted. Once Fernandez's sword slashed through the garments of Cardenas' moral 
superiority, Cardenas was left defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican political scenario has become so volatile that public preferences 
can change overnight. But the debate has undoubtedly affected the presidential 
race in a long-term, structural manner, and has revealed to PRI, PAN and PRD 
that public support is not a given. Even more so than before, the three parties 
will have to behave as though the electorate really mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez will have to devise an effective campaign strategy that goes beyond 
televised blows. Zedillo will have to realize that being a member of the PRI 
does not guarantee automatic victories or unconditional support. And Cardenas 
will have to understand that he is not the Mexican messiah and learn to rely 
less on his moral certitude and more on a clear alternative-governance 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The televised debate also placed the three main contenders on equal footing 
for the first time and thus contributed to Mexico's political evolution. 
Instead of standing passively by, the population participated, observed and 
judged. Politics reached peoples' homes and psyches. The government did not 
announce the winner; the public did. One debate does not democracy make, but 
the candidates' first cross-fire may have shown the Mexican people -- for the 
first time -- the stuff of which democracy is made.

INFLATION FEARS? HEED TOKYO'S EXPERIENCE; INTEREST RATES: THE U.S. CAN TAKE 
LESSONS FROM THE DISASTER THAT FOLLOWED JAPAN'S RATE HIKES. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton's two recent nominees to the seven-member Federal Reserve 
Board should add weight to arguments against further interest-rate increases. 
Their confirmation by the Senate is urgent, given that the Fed has again taken 
action to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's measures could dampen the recovery that we have seen recently in 
California and return the state to the economic doldrums of the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of monetary policies is brutally evident in the Japanese recession 
that has now entered its fourth year, having shaken a once-booming economy to 
the core. It is a recession exacerbated by mistakes in economic policy at the 
hands of the Bank of Japan -- Tokyo's counterpart to the Federal Reserve 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the Bank of Japan's governor is Mieno, which literally means 
"threefold" in Japanese. There is irony in the name, for Mieno actually made 
three major errors in his handling of monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, having experienced the runaway inflation of the early to mid-1970s, 
when consumer price increases at their peak reached 30% per year in Japan, 
Mieno was obsessed by the prospect that inflation might rekindle. Although high 
inflation was not imminent, he raised the discount rate sharply after taking 
office in late 1989. That key rate rose by almost 2 percentage points within a 
few months in 1990. Mieno kept interest rates at high levels until mid-1991, 
when the economy had already fallen into a recessionary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieno, for his second error, did not recognize the importance of the stock 
market to the overall economy, and ignored the warning sounded by the collapse 
of the Tokyo stock market in 1990. He even regarded these market declines as a 
desirable correction from the so-called "bubble economy" of the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 And finally, Mieno apparently believed that unlike other advanced economies, 
Japan's economic health was so robust that his high interest policy could not 
substantially retard the growth of the real economy. He never expected that a 
tight monetary policy would lead Japan to the worst recession in the postwar 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mieno came to realize in 1992 that his fight against inflation was 
stifling Japan's economy, he was reluctant to cut the discount rate for fear of 
being accused of reversing his stand against speculation in the securities and 
real-estate markets. As a result of his tight-money policies, the Japanese 
economy is still suffering from major declines in asset values and from very 
high "real" interest rates. Even though the nominal interest rates may appear 
low, the current Japanese deflation rate is about 2% a year on the wholesale 
level. The "real" rates are therefore about 2% above the percentage actually 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieno's mistakes have taken their toll, and Japan has had near-zero growth for 
some time. While U.S. conditions are not the same, there are enough comparisons 
to cause concern. Rapid interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have spooked 
the financial markets and triggered substantial declines. Perhaps they would 
have occurred anyway, but that is surely no reason for the Fed to lead the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The national economy is poised for a major recovery. But this expansion can 
quickly be halted by a dose of monetary restraint. With the example of the 
Japanese recession in mind, President Clinton's new appointees, White House 
economic adviser and Princeton professor Alan Blinder and UC Berkeley economist 
Janet Yellen, would do well to curb the Fed's excessive fears of inflation.  
</P>
<P>
 California is still poised for recovery -- if only the Fed can restrain its 
own hand.

WHY I ENVY SOUTH AFRICA; OUR UNEQUAL SCHOOLS, PLAYGROUNDS, NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
STREETS HAVE CREATED AN AMERICAN APARTHEID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world rejoiced last week when Nelson Mandela, erect and elegant, was sworn 
in as the first black president of a reborn South Africa. As the haunting 
strains of the new national anthem, "God Bless Africa," floated across the 
multi-hued crowd, I was acutely aware of my envy. Because as tortured as South 
Africa's past has been, the nation as a whole seems to be moving forward. Its 
residents have decided, as Ben Franklin is said to have pronounced at the 
signing of our Declaration of Independence, "we had better all hang together or 
we'll surely all hang separately." With the exception of the fringe element on 
both sides, South Africans have decided to invest in their collective future by 
taking the huge risk of agreeing to work with their fellow citizens. They 
decided that their differences were less important than their similarities, 
that their common nationality transcends their individual races. 
</P>
<P>
 I was envious because South Africa made a decision that we here in the United 
States apparently cannot or will not make. De jure desegregation does not de 
facto integration make. We have made progress, but so much more needs yet to be 
done, for we are still suffering from American apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. If a magic bubble could transport you to any major city in 
this country, you would see: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospitals on one side of town with organized waiting rooms, adequate staff 
and first-class supplies, and across town hospitals clinics and waiting rooms 
in chaos, with outdated equipment and scant staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Schools on one side of town with smaller classes, helpful extras provided by 
affluent parent-teacher-student associations and well-equipped playgrounds, 
gyms and libraries, while schools in other neighborhoods have larger classes, 
less equipment in worse shape and less help from economically pinched parents.  
</P>
<P>
 * Well-maintained parks and recreational facilities in some neighborhoods and 
scruffy bare fields in others.  
</P>
<P>
 * Markets in some neighborhoods brimming with fresh produce and meats, but 
fewer, less well-kept markets in other places with higher prices and less 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 We live with these inequities daily, but we focus on them only after some 
tragedy has been the angry catalyst. (When Los Angeles blew up two years ago, 
for instance, a lot of people's vision was clarified overnight.) We see this, 
we know this and yet we cannot process it. Far too many of the people who run 
things in this country operate under the blithe and utterly incorrect 
assumption that because there are a few African Americans in positions of power 
and influence in government, politics and commerce, the race problem has been 
licked. They want so badly to believe that because a gilded neighborhood with 
600 households can count among it a black family, or because a corporation that 
never even hired black clerical staff now has a black vice president of 
community affairs, that we have overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't, and part of why is simple: We still have not, as a nation, come to 
grips with our slave-holding past. White Americans have not, as have white 
South Africans, taken a deep breath and admitted that there is a certain 
privilege associated with living inside white skin, even when the person inside 
that skin is keenly sympathetic to issues involving other cultures, and that 
this privilege almost always comes at the expense of people who are not white. 
The connection between our past and present is often lost on white Americans. 
"I didn't enslave you -- that was 400 years ago," they point out. "It's 1994 -- 
get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 But American slavery doesn't only affect the descendants of chattel, it also 
scars the descendants of chattel owners. And South Africa has realized that a 
nation cannot come together without some cathartic acknowledgment that to face 
our future, we must honestly acknowledge our past. So I watched with envy as a 
blond, bearded young father swayed to the rhythm of a township band in the 
square before the Parliament building with his 2-year-old daughter perched on 
his shoulders. "I wanted her to see this," he told a reporter. "I wanted her to 
see the day we all became one." 
</P>
<P>
 Black South Africans will, after the euphoria wears off, discover that 
declaring oneself free does not automatically make one so. Some basic things 
will have to improve if anger and disillusion are to be kept at bay. I wish our 
South African cousins well, and hope that they will learn from our country's 
mistakes. And that we, in turn, will learn from their example.

 Judge Orders Bank, FDIC to Pay Landlord $115 Million: NationsBank Corp. and 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been ordered to pay $115 million to a 
Texas landlord after a judge ruled they bullied the landlord and improperly 
broke a lease. U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall wrote that the Charlotte, 
N.C.-based bank and the FDIC had operated in an "outrageous" manner with a 
"lack of regard for the rights of others" in trying to get rent breaks from 
Burnett Plaza Associates, the main owner of the building in question, a

 USAir Postpones Boeing Delivery: In a cost-cutting move, the airline delayed 
delivery of 40 jets and canceled options for another 76.Arlington, Va.-based 
USAir, which had planned to take delivery of 40 737s between 1997 and 2000, is 
delaying receipt until 2003 and 2005, according to documents filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. It's too soon to say what effect USAir's 
decision will have on Boeing production rates and employment, a company 
spokesman said. While the USAir move was "somewhat disappointing, I don't think 
it's a major blow for Boeing," said analyst Robert Toomey with Piper Jaffray 
Inc. The airline canceled options for 63 737s, 11 757s and two 767s.

FED HIKE SENDS DOW UP 49.11; YIELDS PLUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's long-awaited hike in interest rates sent stock 
prices soaring and bond yields plummeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial markets had been anticipating the move by the Fed, which has 
been trying to hold down inflation by increasing interest rates to cool 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up about 12 points in midafternoon 
before the central bank announced its decision, surged 49.11 to close at 
3,720.61. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield plunged to 7.26% 
from Monday's 7.44%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rocketed 
up 1 31/32 points, or $19.69 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury securities rose 3/16 point to 3/8 point, and intermediate 
maturities rose 23/32 point to 1 11/32 points, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks soared, while a range of other issues posted solid gains in 
brisk trading following word that the Fed was increasing the discount rate for 
the first time in more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank announced it was increasing its discount rate, the interest 
it charges for direct loans to banks, to 3.5% from 3%. The increase is the 
first in this key rate in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank also moved to boost the federal funds rate by half a point, 
sending the target for overnight loans between commercial banks to 4.25% from 
3.75%. Its three previous increases had been a quarter of a point at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Fed said the economy is now close to the neutral point that 
central bankers had been seeking -- the point at which interest rates are 
neither spurring economic growth nor retarding it. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the fourth rate rise this year. Previously, the markets had reacted 
negatively to the news because of uncertainty about when the increases would 
end. This time the increases were expected, and investors felt more confident 
about Fed policy in that they believe the board has finished raising rates for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors also welcomed the Fed's statement that the rate increases 
"substantially remove the degree of accommodation" that prevailed through 1993. 
The announcement suggests the Fed may now pause from raising rates for now as 
the economy's prospects unfold in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the reaction of the financial markets, the rate hikes will help 
rather than hinder the economy and corporations, at least in the near future, 
said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the time being, the message of the stock and bond markets is that the Fed 
has hit the bull's-eye," he said. "The Fed administered medicine strong enough 
to kill off worries about inflation but not harsh enough to hamper growth in 
the economy and corporate earnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's broad-market indicators heavily weighted with New York Stock 
Exchange-listed issues also advanced strongly. The NYSE composite index added 
2.35 to finish at 248.13, while Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 4.88 to 
449.37. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainers outpaced losers by about 8 to 5 on the NYSE, and trading activity 
picked up on the Big Board's floor. Volume came to 311.68 million shares, up 
from Monday's subdued level of 234.70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, many computer and related stocks remained depressed and 
prevented the Nasdaq composite index from gaining ground. It ended off 0.39 at 
711.52. 
</P>
<P>
 * The market's rate-related euphoria benefited banking stocks, with 
BankAmerica buoyed 1 7/8 to 48 3/8 and Citicorp boosted 1 3/4 to 38 7/8 in 
heavy NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM broke through technical resistance at the 60 level, jumping 2 7/8 to 61 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hewlett-Packard fell 1 5/8 to 76 5/8 despite higher earnings for the fiscal 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nasdaq, where many technology stocks are listed, the lineup of active 
issues was studded with losers. Conspicuous among them was Lotus Development, 
which tumbled 4 1/8 to 51 3/4, and Xilinx, which lost 7 to 39 1/2. Reports of 
lower growth in the computer field weighed down the sector. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wal-Mart Stores gained 7/8 to 23 5/8 after the retailer announced higher 
first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home Depot, which also posted higher first-quarter earnings, rose 1 7/8 to 
42 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In stock trading overseas, markets were mixed and were held in check while 
awaiting word on U.S. interest rate policy. In Europe, London's Financial Times 
100-share average ended 7.9 points higher at 3,123.5, while Germany's DAX 
30-share average ended at 2,259.71, down 11.40 points. In Tokyo, the 225-share 
Nikkei average ended the session down 54.91 points at 20,133.53. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index tracked the Dow Jones gain to finish up 48.75 points 
at 2,288.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar ended lower against most major currencies, though it 
recovered from its worst point of the day following the Fed's move. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices fell, closing down $1.60 at 381.40 on the New York Comex. Silver 
also declined.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A PUBLIC FORUM FOR A PRIVATE HORROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The paradox of offensive public art is a rich one. 
</P>
<P>
 You put up a provocative sculpture -- say, the figure of a woman who has 
apparently just been raped with the two rapists suspended eerily above her, 
dangling by the offending parts of their anatomies -- then sit back and hope it 
causes a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 You want people not to want it. You want them to demonstrate, to demand it be 
removed, to scream and yell that it might belong in a museum, but it certainly 
doesn't belong here . 
</P>
<P>
 And you want people to want it. You want them to counterdemonstrate, to scream 
and yell that if we are to address the issues raised by the piece -- say, the 
vile nature of the crime of rape -- then we must not hide from the ugliness of 
the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, I guess, you sit back and see how many reporters and TV news cameras 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rather like baiting a trap. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Peg Yorkin, of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and the money 
behind this particular piece of public art, sounded anything but upset on 
Friday, the day after a crowd of about 60 turned out at the intersection of 
Wilshire Boulevard and 15th Street in Santa Monica to debate the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," Yorkin said. "I'm glad. The whole purposes was to start a discussion 
about rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I stood on the corner last week, listening to some of the debate. No one was 
defending rape. Most of the acrimony centered on whether the sculpture, 
"Morality/Mortality," by artist Ed Massey, belonged on a public corner, visible 
to any passersby, including children. There is a middle school a block away, 
but this is hardly a corner where children play. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who defended the presence of the sculpture seemed inclined to discuss 
the impact of rape on women and the importance of imparting this message to 
boys. Some women who identified themselves as rape survivors had taped moving 
handwritten messages to the plate glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opposed it suggested that it would be more appropriately placed in a 
museum or gallery, away from the inquisitive gazes of children. 
</P>
<P>
 And where almost no one, I dare say, would see it. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the sculpture offers parents -- particularly the parents 
of older boys -- something valuable. Sex is an awkward subject, especially for 
adolescents, and for that reason, sex educators often tell parents to be alert 
for "teachable moments," times when the issue can be broached in a natural, 
non-threatening way. 
</P>
<P>
 A child's reaction -- horror, disgust, fright or mere curiosity -- can be 
turned into a rational discussion of a particularly terrifying and prevalent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture and discussions of sexual violence are obviously not appropriate 
for small children, but the smaller ones will surely not be wandering down 
Wilshire by themselves. Adults with tykes in tow can hurry them past or cross 
the street. A moment's exposure will not produce a trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 As Yorkin points out: "This cannot be more violent than what kids see on 
television. And what they see in movies is far worse than this." Not to mention 
violence-drenched video games. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lesson here for older children, no matter how unpalatable. It's up 
to parents, though, to take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Show me something similarly redeeming in the horror films so loved by middle 
school kids. And I'll show you "Freddy Krueger's Enchanted April." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder about parents who turn out in droves to protest a brutally honest 
piece of art about rape, while barely blinking at the barrage of messages -- in 
ads, in music videos, in movies -- that impart to children the notion that 
women are good for only one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive along Sunset Boulevard, and you can't miss the huge billboards of a 
certain clothing company featuring women in various states of undress and 
sexual readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Open any fashion magazine and see the extraordinarily sexual content of most 
of the ads. The March issue of Vogue features a photo of a nude woman on a 
pedestal. Her eyes are closed, one hand covers her groin, the other holds a 
purse. It's a handbag ad. On another page, a sneaker ad shows a boy kissing the 
shoe of a young woman and this caption: "He tried for her lips, but she 
suggested he go much lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanton female sexuality permeates the culture. Most of it is imaginary, of 
course, but a girl flipping though a fashion magazine may have a struggle 
separating fantasy notions of womanhood from reality. How do we counteract this 
message for both boys and girls? 
</P>
<P>
 I respect parents who want to protect their children from the terrible things 
that happen around us every day, and I don't think they are prudes for not 
wanting to expose their children to this sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is, it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike rape, though, it's going away soon.

 New Yorkers Watch Leno: New York viewers extended their welcome to Jay Leno 
Monday night, as ratings for the start of his five-day New York stand rose 69% 
above average in the Big Apple and topped rival David Letterman on his home 
turf. Letterman dropped 18% locally on his first night back home but still won 
the major market competition overall. Leno's "Tonight Show" drew 441,698 New 
York viewing homes, while Letterman's "Late Show" attracted 374,774 homes. In 
the nation's top 31 markets, overnight ratings showed Leno up 13% and closing 
the gap on Letterman. Leno drew an estimated 13% of available viewers in those 
markets while Letterman drew about 18%.

 County Arts Cuts: The proposed Los Angeles County Budget for next year 
includes a 36% cut to the already struggling Music & Performing Arts 
Commission, which would be forced to eliminate one of its grants programs and 
severely cut back another if Monday's proposed budget is approved by the Board 
of Supervisors. "It's terrible," said Laura Zucker, the commission's executive 
director. "This comes on top of a 7% cut this year and a 13% cut last year. The 
fat's already been trimmed, so this will cut into bone." As proposed, the 
agency's 1994-95 budget would dwindle to $481,000, down from $754,000. The 
Board of Supervisors will address the commission's budget at a 9:30 a.m.

MUSIC REVIEW; MODERN PROGRESS UNDER SALONEN'S GREEN UMBRELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A ll impartial musicians and music lovers were in perfect agreement that 
never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 I confess. Silly me. My mind did some wandering Monday night at the Japan 
America Theatre where Esa-Pekka Salonen led members of the Philharmonic elite 
and a couple of knowledgeable guests through a program of thorny modernist 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final Green Umbrella program of the season. Salonen -- a composer 
himself -- was in his element. 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't always concentrate on the complex music at hand. I kept thinking 
about a Counterpunch essay that appeared in these pages last week. An unhappy 
reader lamented the pervasive ugliness of most modern music and, worse, the 
fact that many critics applaud it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Counterpuncher probably would not have liked much about the pieces that 
were basking here in the shade of Salonen's umbrella: progressive compositions 
by Chen Yi, formerly of Beijing, by an all-American named Fred Lerdahl and by a 
Scandinavian visitor called Jouni Kaipainen. The reader probably would have 
found little to soothe the savage breast even in some golden oldies of Igor 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reactions might have matched those of the writer quoted at the top of this 
review: a Berlin critic covering the premiere of Beethoven's "Fidelio." The 
source, of course, is that redoubtable centenarian Nicolas Slonimsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasive problem is simple. Audiences in general want to hear the sort of 
comfy music they know and love. They don't want to expand their hand-me-down 
concepts of sound, form, harmony, melody or rhythm. They don't want their ears 
stretched, much less their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 They want today's music to sound like yesterday's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But yesterday's music disturbed yesterday's audiences. It's a sobering 
thought. If contemporary composers did nothing but look backward, music would 
become very boring. And perhaps very dead. 
</P>
<P>
 A famous Berlin critic in the 19th Century heard his first Chopin etude and 
came up with this notable judgment: 
</P>
<P>
 "Excruciating cacophony."  
</P>
<P>
 OK. OK. You want to know about Monday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a 12-minute perpetuo mobile study in rhythmic ripples and sonic 
swirls, colorfully and cleverly scored by Chen for a few winds, percussion, 
strings and electrified piano. I found it exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 Another listener might have had a different reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strident phrases pounded out by hitting each note a blow on the head."  
</P>
<P>
 That was how a major New York critic described his city's first "La Boheme." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stravinsky survey that followed began with the sweet, exotic melismas of 
"Pastorale," a vocalise begun in 1907 and revised in 1923. Janice Felty sang it 
with melting sensuality. Then her miniature vocal recital turned dry and 
abstract with three Shakespeare songs (1953), starkly whimsical with "The Owl 
and the Pussycat" (1966), folksy primal with "Pribaoutki" (1914). The 
mezzo-soprano performed with pungency, charm and guts, as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest bluffer of the century and of all future millennia."  
</P>
<P>
 The composer who inspired that critical label, incidentally, was Brahms. Not 
Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerdahl's mercurial "Marches" of 1992, which followed, sounded a bit thick and 
cluttered in context. Still, one had to be fascinated by the overlapping ideas, 
the constantly evolving textures, the subtle quotations and the sometimes 
cataclysmic climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot going on in this intimate 16-minute escapade for clarinet, 
piano, violin and cello in varying combinations and permutations. Most of it 
sounds devastatingly difficult, and some of it sounds novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The harmonies are so obtrusively crude that no number of wrong notes could be 
detected by the subtlest listener."  
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, was a London critic's response to Schumann's Variations for 
two pianos. 
</P>
<P>
 The purported piece de resistance came after intermission with the U.S. 
premiere of "Carpe diem!," a concerto for bravura clarinet and matching 
mini-orchestra by Salonen's 37-year-old countryman, Jouni Kaipainen. It is a 
highly propulsive mood study that swings from nervous reverie to feverish dance 
to violently percussive climax, all of it dominated by virtuosic sliding and 
slurping and doodling for the dauntless soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 On first hearing, it is difficult to separate the cliches from the 
inspirations, but there is no denying Kaipainen's craft, or his sense of drama. 
In case anyone cares, the Latin title, untranslated by the anonymous annotator, 
means "seize the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorin Levee, whose high school yearbook photo adorned the program, seized it 
to play the convoluted solos with non-stop nonchalant brilliance. Salonen and a 
very busy, very able instrumental ensemble provided a dazzling expressive 
framework. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is music of the future that, in its hydrophobia, scorns logic, wallows 
in torpor . . . and collapses in dissonant convulsions."  
</P>
<P>
 Kaipainen may indeed have written music of the future. But unlike poor 
Tchaikovsky, whose first piano concerto was thus assessed, the visiting Finn 
seems to harbor no fear of water.

THEATER REVIEW; KRAMER TURNS INWARD WITH 'DESTINY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The destiny of Larry Kramer has been to disturb. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturb his family with the revelation of his gay identity. Disturb gays with 
his clarion calls, long before the AIDS crisis, for monogamy. And disturb 
presumptions of those who assume that any play by America's Angriest Gay Man is 
going to be just, well, angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Destiny of Me," Kramer's follow-up to his earlier, very angry "The Normal 
Heart," is much more interesting precisely because it is not a polemic. (It is 
also not mandatory to have seen the previous play.) Too often in the first 
installment of his story of AIDS activist, writer and alter-ego Ned Weeks, 
Kramer was pointing the finger at others, like Ronald Reagan and the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Destiny," Kramer is frequently pointing the finger at himself. He does, 
in essence, just what many of his critics believed him incapable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In its West Coast premiere at International City Theatre under Shashin Desai's 
direction, this translates into a sometimes deeply felt thoughtfulness -- as 
if, with all of the people dying, we have time to consider Ned Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In this theater, at least, we do, because both Kramer and Desai's cast are 
serious about presenting the Weeks family without the customary cheap laughs, 
cheaper stereotypes or unearned pathos. "The Destiny of Me" is consciously in 
the American tradition of the family/memory drama, deep in the soil cultivated 
by Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the play's several ironies, Ned (a plain, stalwart Thomas Tofel, 
HIV-positive, has volunteered as a guinea pig for a new treatment devised by 
his nemesis, Dr. Anthony Della Vida of the National Institute of Health 
(Michael Tomlinson, in a role based on AIDS researcher Dr. Anthony Fauci). 
</P>
<P>
 While ACT-UP protesters raise a ruckus outside and inside the hospital as he 
debates with the acerbic nurse (a witty Peggy Blow, Ned's memories of growing 
up gay, and of his younger self as a character, Alexander (Jonathan Slavin ), 
begin to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin informs Alexander -- who renames himself Ned at age 18 as an act of 
liberation from mom and dad -- with a gawky adolescent giddiness that gradually 
and brilliantly transforms into desperation. Looming over him is a father 
(Richard Voigts) uncontrollably angry at Alexander's effeminacy, and a mother 
(Dianne Turley Travis) who tries to compensate for her neglect of older son 
Benjamin (Kelly AuCoin) by doting on Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing explosions take a lifetime to come to terms with, but the power 
Slavin, Voigts, Travis and AuCoin generate is curtailed by some extremely fake 
fight choreography. (Jamieson K. Price did the "fight scene consultation.") 
Kramer also seems to undermine his own agenda against the psychoanalysts who 
tried to "cure" gay men by filling the Ned-Benjamin confrontation scenes with 
psychoanalytic banter. 
</P>
<P>
 A turn in the dialogue, though, shows that Kramer is aware of the 
contradiction, almost making fun of his playwriting tastes for psychological 
realism. Ramsey Avery's '90s-deco set isn't real at all (except for a ton of 
real medical equipment), and Tom Ruzika's shifting light moods bring us inside 
Ned's head. Which is what Kramer has done so much more affectingly this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Destiny of Me," International City Theatre, Long Beach City College, 
Clark and Harvey Way. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends

TV REVIEW; 'JAZZ MASTERS' SALUTE ON PBS SWINGS AT VARIABLE SPEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The jazz jam, a time-honored tradition in the world of improvisational music, 
takes on grand dimensions during "Carnegie Hall Salutes the Jazz Masters," 
tonight's installment of PBS' "Great Performances" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Held April 6 in New York's fabled recital venue, the salute, honoring the 50th 
anniversary of Verve Records, brings together a host of distinguished artists, 
mostly pulled from the Verve roster, in mix-and-match sessions that sometimes 
finds them searching unsuccessfully for common ground. Case in point: guitarist 
Pat Metheny's failure to equal the contributions of saxophonist Jackie McLean 
and trumpeter Roy Hargrove as the three trade licks on Sonny Stitt's "The 
Eternal Triangle." 
</P>
<P>
 The oddest grouping comes early, when co-host Vanessa Williams sings "Tea for 
Two" with backing from fellow host and keyboardist Herbie Hancock, saxophonist 
Joe Henderson, trombonist J. J. Johnson and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band. The 
instrumental ensemble is fine, but Williams' phrasing lacks for want of that 
central jazz ingredient: swing. Her efforts pale even further after fine 
performances from vocalists Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Williams' between-tune patter, forced and insincere, gives the 
90-minute concert the air of a cheap beauty pageant. Hancock fares better, 
especially when narrating clips honoring departed or retired jazz legends. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical footage of Art Tatum, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Dizzy 
Gillespie, Stan Getz, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis and others 
make for the salute's best moments. But it's also studded with fine musical 
presentations, notably pianist Hank Jones' solo rendition of "Willow Weep for 
Me," Joe Henderson's suave tenor solo on "Desafinado" (with composer Antonio 
Carlos Jobim at the piano), Jimmy Smith's whining organ blitz on Elmer 
Bernstein's "Walk on the Wild Side" and almost anything that includes 
aggressive young trumpeter Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the jams click, as happens on the contemporary-minded "Call It '94" 
with an ensemble led by Hancock, and Charlie Parker's be-bop anthem "Now's the 
Time," which features a wild exchange of phrases between Carter and Hargrove, 
the improvisational art of jazz breathes with life. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Carnegie Hall Salutes the Jazz Masters" airs tonight at 8 on KVCR-TV 
Channel 24 and at 9 on KCET-TV Channel 28. It airs at 2 p.m. Saturday on 
KPBS-TV Channel 15.

DREIFORT ALLOWS ONE TO SLIP AWAY; DODGERS: RELIEVER GIVES UP THREE CONSECUTIVE 
HITS IN NINTH AND 6-4 LEAD TURNS INTO A 7-6 LOSS TO ROCKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Dodgers have vowed to make games interesting this season, and they kept 
that pledge Tuesday night, this time blowing a two-run lead in the bottom of 
the ninth inning and losing, 7-6, to the Colorado Rockies at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped the Dodgers' winning streak at seven, turned a blissful 
clubhouse into an angry one and allowed the San Francisco Giants to tie them 
for first place in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just mad; we should have won this game tonight," said Brett Butler, who 
was three for five, scored a run and drove in another.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you get more frustrated because of the mistakes than anything else. 
We have done well lately (in that area) but we made some mistakes early 
tonight, then we came back and went ahead and said, we're OK. But it got to us 
in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead, 6-4, after another solid start by Pedro Astacio, Darren Dreifort was 
brought in topitch the ninth. Dreifort, who had worked the final inning in 
Monday night's 9-2 Dodger blowout, gave up three consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies made it 6-5 when pinch hitter Mike Kingery doubled and Howard 
Johnson singled him in. Walt Weiss followed with a grounder up the middle 
before Dreifort was relieved by Jim Gott. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who has pitched the most innings of any Dodger reliever (23), was 
used sparingly during the recent home-stand, as were the team's other 
relievers, because of lengthy outings by the starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda said he brought Dreifort into Monday's night's blowout to 
close the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the closer, and we still have to get them out," Lasorda said. "This is 
different than college. He can pitch one inning and come back the next night." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dreifort, who retired three of four batters the previous night, couldn't 
do it again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come in and expect to do the job, and I just didn't do it," said Dreifort, 
who is 0-3 with five saves and a 4.30 earned-run average.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows (about pitching back-to-back)? I felt fine when I went out there so 
it's not a real good excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 With runners on first and second and no outs, Joe Girardi laid down a perfect 
bunt to advance the runners. Dante Bichette hit a sharp grounder that Tim 
Wallach back-handed and the third baseman threw to the plate to get Johnson. 
But Johnson slid around the tag to tie the score at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga, whose home run in the third inning had tied the score at 
4-4, hit a line drive off Gott to center field, scoring Weiss for the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the things you hate about being in the bullpen, you walk that fine 
line, " said Gott, who was charged with none of the runs but suffered his third 
blown save.  
</P>
<P>
 Fielding blunders early were costly to both teams, who each scored three runs 
in the first inning. A double by Henry Rodriguez scored Butler and Wallach 
before Rodriguez scored on a bad relay throw to the plate by Weiss. But the 
Dodgers countered with generosity in the bottom of the inning, when all three 
of the Rockies runs were unearned due to two errors on a routine grounder by 
Cory Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was a last-minute replacement at shortstop for Jose Offerman, who 
strained his back during batting practice. He is the only player on the Dodger 
bench who can replace Offerman at shortstop. Lasorda is always looking for a 
way to put Snyder in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 In Snyder's 13 starts this season, he is batting .432 (19 for 44), with six 
home runs, 12 runs scored, 16 RBI and two doubles. And after he bobbled 
Galarraga's routine grounder and then overthrew first base, he came back in the 
second inning and homered to put the Dodgers ahead, 4-3.  
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's 14th homer in the third tied the score again, before Eric Karros 
hit his fifth homer in the fourth inning to put the Dodgers ahead, 5-4. 
Butler's double in the seventh inning scored Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last 24 games, Butler is batting .382, with 23 walks and 23 runs 
scored. Still in the leadoff role in place of DeShields, Butler has reached 
base with a hit or a walk in 37 of 39 games. He has gone five for eight with 
two walks in the two-game series, reaching base eight of 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flat out mad," said Butler, who is batting .341. "The guys who are mad, 
this will drive them harder."

ANGELS WILL MANAGE WITHOUT RODGERS; BASEBALL: BAVASI FIRES HIM, HIRES MARLIN 
PITCHING COACH MARCEL LACHEMANN TO GUIDE STRUGGLING CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN PETERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers, his team holding the second-worst record in the American League 
but only two games off the division lead, was fired Tuesday as manager of the 
Angels and replaced by Marcel Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann was the pitching coach for the Florida Marlins, managed by his 
brother, Rene. The Lachemanns become the first brothers to manage in the majors 
since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the team's three-game losing streak and 16-23 record entering Tuesday 
night, the dismissal was unexpected. Rodgers, in his fourth season with the 
club, is extremely popular with the players. He is the first manager in the 
majors to be fired this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surprised him, I think," said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, who broke 
the news to Rodgers in the clubhouse around noon. "I don't think he was 
expecting it right now. . . . He was very professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, in his first year as the Angel general manager, said the decision to 
fire Rodgers and hire Lachemann was his, with the approval of team president 
Richard Brown and team owners Gene and Jackie Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my responsibility,' Bavasi said. "It began with me and ended with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Brown: "He's a quality individual and a quality manager. But at this 
time, it didn't feel like he was the right manager for this club." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, 52, will begin managing the team Thursday when the Angels play the 
Kansas City Royals at Anaheim. Meanwhile, first-base coach Bobby Knoop will 
fill in, then will become the bench coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, a pitching coach with the Angels for nine years ending in 1992, 
worked in that capacity the past two seasons for the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to change managers may have been linked to the team's weak 
pitching, particularly the starting rotation. California has a team ERA of 
5.31, and the staff -- other than Mark Langston and Chuck Finley -- is largely 
made up of castoffs from other clubs and youngsters from their minor league 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels blew a 7-0 lead in a 10-7 loss to Seattle on Saturday, then lost 
9-5 the next day. In an 8-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Anaheim Stadium on 
Monday night, the Angels led 5-4 going into the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi said he expects Lachemann to get the most out of the young players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's into wringing the rag dry of the talent of each young player," he said. 
"In today's financial climate, you must do that. You cannot waste a drop of 
young talent and this (move) is very attuned to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what made him attractive to an expansion franchise, and that's 
what made his brother attractive to an expansion franchise. They're both cut 
from the same cloth." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 55, is one of the original Los Angeles Angels. He was first with the 
organization as a catcher from 1961-69. Since he returned as manager for the 
1991 season, the Angels had a 179-222 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been at or near the top of the AL West much of the season 
because the division is baseball's weakest. As recently as last weekend, they 
were in first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi said he would have fired Rodgers if the Angels had been in first place 
after Monday night's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been no harder to do it," he said. "It would just have been 
harder to explain it to you guys (reporters)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' 91 losses last season marked the most in Rodgers' professional 
managing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers missed a large chunk of the 1992 season because of injuries stemming 
from a team bus crash May 21 of that year during an East Coast roadtrip. 
</P>
<P>
 He was riding in the front seat and was by far the most seriously injured when 
the bus careened down an embankment and struck a tree off a New Jersey highway. 
He fractured his left knee and right elbow, and remained in a wheelchair until 
July. He did not return to the dugout until Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who becomes the Angels' 16th manager, pitched for seven seasons in 
the minor leagues, and made his major league debut with the Oakland Athletics 
in 1969. He was with them from 1969-71, with a 7-4 record, fives saves and a 
3.44 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann briefly was the Angels' interim manager in 1992. John Wathan, 
managing in place of Rodgers, took four games off when his father died, and 
Lachemann went 3-1 during that time. A Growing List

 Bobby Rahal knows he and Honda teammate Mike Groff will almost certainly be 
bumped from the Indy 500 field, so he has come up with a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are bumped, Rahal and Groff will use 1993 Penske-Ilmor cars to try to 
get back into the field.They were originally entered by Roger Penske in case 
his Mercedes engine program ran into problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal tested one of the cars Tuesday and went 222.833 m.p.h., faster than he 
has run all month in his Honda-powered Lola. Groff will test his car Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was smiling today for the first time since I got here," said Rahal, who was 
bumped from the field last year on the final day.

 Adrian Fernandez, the second-fastest rookie in the 500, has his sights set on 
winning rookie-of-the-year honors for the Galles Racing International team. It 
would be the fifth such honor for the 29-year-old driver from Mexico City. 
Fernandez was top rookie in 1982 in the Mexico Formula Vee series, in 1983 in 
the Mexico Formula Ford series, in 1984 in the Mexico Formula K series and in 
1992 in the Firestone Indy Lights series.

 Twenty-nine cars practiced, with Emerson Fittipaldi once against fastest with

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; RANGERS BACK IN FORM, DOMINATE DEVILS, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, the New York Rangers made sure they wouldn't lose a third-period 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After allowing New Jersey to come back and beat them Sunday night in Game 1, 
the Rangers closed out the Devils with a strong finish for a 4-0 victory in 
Game 2 of the Eastern Conference final series Tuesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we didn't play our best game (in Sunday's 4-3 double-overtime loss to 
the Devils) but still were 42 seconds away from winning," Ranger center Mark 
Messier said. "We knew we had to play harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, the Rangers led, 3-2, when Claude Lemieux tied it for New Jersey 
with 42.7 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Stephane Richer won it for the Devils in the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Rangers' first loss in 45 games this season when they led after the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, they reverted to form. 
</P>
<P>
 They led, 1-0, after two periods on a first-period goal by Mark Messier, then 
added three goals in the third period by Sergei Nemchinov, Glenn Anderson and 
Adam Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Richter finished his fourth shutout to tie a playoff record held by six 
other goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-of-seven series now shifts to New Jersey for Games 3 and 4 Thursday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers played desperate hockey from start to finish, overwhelming New 
Jersey with a 41-16 shot advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers looked more like the team that dominated the Devils during a 6-0 
run in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Coach Mike Keenan was unhappy with his team's play in the opener of 
this series and hoped it would come out with more fire Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers did, as Messier scored in the first two minutes. Richter did the 
job the rest of the way as he recorded his fourth shutout of this year's 
playoffs, tying a record held by six other goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The last to do it was Montreal's Ken Dryden in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the first for the Devils after a club-record five straight. The 
Rangers improved their playoff record to 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who had the third-best penalty-killing unit in the NHL during the 
regular season, held the Devils to only one shot on a two-man advantage for 
1:25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a couple of bad choices, bad passes (on the two-man advantage), but 
still it was a one-goal game (after two periods)," New Jersey defenseman Bruce 
Driver said.

 Players criticize coaches for all sorts of things, but forward Ken Norman of 
the Milwaukee Bucks had an unusual evaluation of Mike Dunleavy: He's too nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is a beautiful person, but he needs to jump down players' throats more," 
Norman told the Racine (Wis.) Journal Times. "If they say something to him, he 
should just tell them to shut up."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who do the Angels think they are, the Clippers? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are making their 14th managerial change in the last 26 years -- 
compared with nine coaching changes in the last 15 years for the Clippers -- 
and this is the most unnecessary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I have nothing against Marcel Lachemann. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But I do have a lot to say in favor of Buck Rodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He is a strong leader. He is a sound strategist. In Milwaukee, Montreal and 
Anaheim, he has gotten the most out of the available talent. He is honest with 
his players, the fans and the media. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He showed uncommon determination when he returned to the dugout on Aug. 28, 
1992, after suffering serious injuries in the crash of the Angel team bus in 
Maryland on May 21 that season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't his fault that he worked for an organization that has no idea of the 
meaning of the word stability . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He cannot be blamed for trades, free-agent defections and other cost-costing 
moves that might be the most damaging in the major leagues if it wasn't for the 
San Diego Padres. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland Athletics of 1994 are proof there isn't much a good manager, such 
as Tony La Russa, can do with a mediocre cast. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe one day the rest of the Southern California sporting enterprises will 
learn something from the Dodgers, who have had two managers in the last 41 
years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann pitched for Dorsey High when I attended what was then 
Southern League rival L.A. High. He was a tough competitor. Still is. But so is 
Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is too bad the salary cap caused the Raiders to release Steve Smith. He was 
ol' reliable at fullback. But if you have to decide whether to keep Smith or 
perennial Pro Bowl center Don Mosebar, you pick Mosebar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The movement of NFL quarterbacks hasn't ended. Still unsigned are free agents 
Browning Nagle, Billy Joe Tolliver and Jim McMahon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gino Torretta, who has yet to throw a pass in the NFL, is helping to teach the 
Minnesota Vikings' offense to Warren Moon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference was second in the number of NFL draft choices this 
year with 25. The Southeastern Conference, which has two more teams, had 31. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 If a deal Bob Arum is negotiating with one of the three major networks is 
completed, two Friday night boxing shows a month at the Olympic Auditorium will 
be televised at 12:30 a.m. live in the East and on a delayed basis locally. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be huge for us," said Arum, whose last three cards at the Olympic 
have averaged only about 1,000 fans. "It will take a while for the crowds to 
build, but we'll get that done.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goossen has a copy of a letter from Jose Sulaiman stipulating that World 
Boxing Council super-featherweight champion James Leija must negotiate within 
30 days for a mandatory title defense against Gabriel Ruelas, who will tune up 
against Paris Alexander at the Olympic on Friday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Can USC win in South Bend? The Trojan tennis team is seeded first in the NCAA 
Championships that begin Saturday at Notre Dame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Toronto Maple Leafs are solid from A -- Dave Andreychuk -- to Z -- Peter 
Zezel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gourmet Pat Burns refused to use the "icing on the cake" cliche when talking 
about the goals scored by the Zezel line, noted for its checking, Monday during 
the overtime victory over the Vancouver Canucks. Instead, Burns called it 
"gravy on the potatoes.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Florida Panthers, who didn't make the playoffs, have been 
nominated for three of the NHL's seven major awards. No members of the New York 
Rangers, who are in the Eastern Conference championship series, were nominated. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 News item: Dick Motta is hired by the Dallas Mavericks. Reaction: That's one 
less retread available to the Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best hitters in college baseball is Rice sophomore outfielder Jose 
Cruz Jr., son of the former Houston Astro outfielder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Boone, son of Bob, has tied the USC single-season stolen base record of 
24 that was set by Don Buford Jr.. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is ridiculous that none of the eight NCAA Division I regional baseball 
tournaments will be played in the West this year. Of the 47 College World 
Series, 26 have been won by teams from the West. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Cub pitcher Anthony Young (2-3) is well on his way to earning 
comeback-of-the-year honors.

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE; BLAYLOCK COMES ALIVE TO KEEP HAWKS ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock did it all Tuesday night to keep the Atlanta Hawks alive in 
the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock turned in his second triple-double of the series with 14 points, 13 
assists and 10 rebounds as Atlanta defeated Indiana, 88-76, trimming the 
Pacers' series lead to 3-2. Game 6 is Thursday night at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock also had four steals and a blocked shot, sparking an Atlanta defense 
that held the Pacers to 35 percent shooting for the game and just 15 points in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we did a pretty good job on Danny Manning, but Mookie turned the 
game around, especially with his defense, picking up loose balls and 
rebounding," Pacers Coach Larry Brown said. "It was like Game 2, Mookie 
dominated the game." 
</P>
<P>
 In that game, Blaylock had 11 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists to help 
Atlanta even the series at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Ehlo came off the bench to score 22 points and Manning added 20 for the 
Hawks, who pulled away late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller led the Pacers with 22 points, including five three-point 
baskets, and Derrick McKey added 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers were held scoreless in the final 2:39 as they failed to get the 
ball into Miller's hands, opting instead for tough attempts that didn't go. 
Haywoode Workman ended up 0 for eight from the field and Byron Scott was two 
for 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pressured people tonight," Blaylock said. "The Pacers had to work for 
their shots. We kept our hands in their faces. Craig kept us in the game in the 
third, then we got the defensive stops and got into our game early in the 
fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta played the final quarter without leading scorer Kevin Willis, who 
sprained his right thumb in the game. He started despite having hyperextended 
his right knee in Game 4 in Indianapolis on Sunday. Willis finished with 10 
points, eight of those in the first five minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be ready to go on Thursday," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tremendous win for us," Hawks Coach Lenny Wilkens said.

METHODICAL ROCKETS PUT SUNS ON BRINK; NBA PLAYOFFS: HOUSTON OPENS 21-POINT 
HALFTIME LEAD EN ROUTE TO 109-86 VICTORY AND 3-2 SERIES LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The team from "Choke City" didn't gag this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, dominating from the opening tip, opened a 21-point halftime lead and 
poured it on in the second half Tuesday for an easy 109-86 victory over the 
Phoenix Suns, giving the Rockets a 3-2 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory for a home team in the series, and it was nothing 
like the last game in the Summit -- the Rockets' Game 2 loss in which they blew 
a 20-point fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That dreadful performance inspired Houston headline writers to plaster "Choke 
City" across the front pages of the local papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been a blessing in disguise when we lost the first two games," 
said center Hakeem Olajuwon. "We forced ourselves to come back together as a 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe each scored 20 points and Kenny Smith had 16 for 
Houston, which finally shut down Kevin Johnson and won its third straight game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dug that big hole for ourselves and it could have been over and it would 
have been a horrible summer," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "We took it 
from the opening tip and they just kept going at it and going at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets had a pair of early 9-0 spurts, the second of which gave them a 
27-13 lead in the first quarter. They didn't let up in the second period, 
opening the quarter with a 10-1 run en route to a 58-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't our team out there tonight," Phoenix Coach Paul Westphal said. 
"That's one of the worst games we played all season and we know we have to play 
better and we're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets were running and hitting from inside and outside, and the Suns 
just couldn't keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, stretching his aching back during timeouts, scored 20 
first-half points. He finished with 30 and sat out much of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played with a lot of emotion and energy," Barkley said. "They jumped on 
us and we were never able to recover. I don't ever worry about a basketball 
game. That's my job, not my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who scored 38 points in each of the two previous games, cooled off 
with 10 points. "We have to applaud the Rockets," Johnson said. "They put forth 
a great effort. I'm very embarrassed but we're fortunate that we still have a 
chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 All the news wasn't positive for Houston, however. Vernon Maxwell had to sit 
out briefly with a wrist injury.

NUGGETS REFUSE TO FOLD, DEFEAT THE JAZZ AGAIN; NBA PLAYOFFS: DENVER HANGS ON 
AND BREAKS THROUGH IN SECOND OVERTIME TO WIN, 109-101. 
</P>

<P>
 At the moment Brian Williams dunked in double overtime, he knew the Nuggets 
would avoid playoff elimination once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, we knew we had the momentum with us," said Williams, whose 
dunk midway through the second extra session gave Denver a lead it never 
relinquished in a 109-101 victory Tuesday night that trimmed Utah's series lead 
to 3-2. "We had everything going for us. We knew we could definitely do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Denver's third overtime victory in 10 playoff games and its fifth 
straight success in a must-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Stith and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 22 points each and Robert Pack and 
Williams added 19 apiece for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dikembe Mutombo's seven blocks gave him 31 for the series, breaking Hakeem 
Olajuwon's record of 30 set last year against Seattle. Mutombo also had seven 
points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 No team has ever won an NBA playoff series after trailing 3-0, but Denver 
still has a chance to be the first. The series returns to Denver for Game 6 on 
Thursday. Game 7, if necessary, will be back in Utah on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of character and they have a lot of heart -- they don't know 
when they're beat," Denver Coach Dan Issel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied 87-87 at the end of regulation and 94-94 after one extra 
period before Williams' jam off a pass from Pack sparked a 7-0 run that gave 
the Nuggets a 101-94 lead with 2:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz trimmed that to 103-99 on Tyrone Corbin's three-pointer with 52 
seconds left, but got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said his team was ready to play, but the Nuggets simply 
refused to fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz owner Larry H. Miller scuffled with two fans just before the second half 
began, and then left the arena, team spokesman Dave Allred said.

<P>
 * Last year's champions: Boys -- Van Nuys Birmingham; Girls -- Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Kristine Quance of Granada Hills dominated the City Section in 
swimming for several years, setting numerous records. Quance is at USC, but 
sophomore Gretchen Ballard of Van Nuys Birmingham hopes to take her place. 
Ballard has been unbeatable all year and has the fastest qualifying times in 
the 200 and 500 freestyle. Her 200 preliminary time of 1:54.07 last week was 
close to a meet record. She hopes her efforts can help Birmingham stop 
defending champion Palisades. The boys' competition is wide open. Junior 
Russell Perkins of Eagle Rock recorded impressive preliminary times in the 50 
and 100 freestyle of 21.80 and 48.55 seconds, respectively. ERIC SHEPARD

VICTORY FOR SOME FOLLOWED BY DEFEAT; ANGELS: MANY OF THE PLAYERS ARE GLAD TO 
SEE RODGERS GO BECAUSE OF HIS PUBLIC CRITICISMS. THE WHITE SOX ARE OBLIVIOUS, 
WINNING BY 10-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels were pounded, 10-2, Tuesday night by the Chicago White Sox in yet 
another dismal defeat before 15,684, but the players were able to go home with 
one comforting thought. 
</P>
<P>
 They wouldn't have to wake up this morning and read any caustic comments from 
Manager Buck Rodgers about the pitching staff or any other facet of their game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers was fired Tuesday, and as unpopular a move as it might have been 
publicly, many players weren't choked up with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 They respected him as a manager, but he was never popular with many of his 
players. They resented reading comments from him in the morning newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a reporter's dream, but he could be a player's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't have to worry about getting real close to him," Angel starting 
pitcher Phil Leftwich said, "because you couldn't. I didn't think it was fair 
because he said a lot of things through the media that shouldn't have come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just not a real good communicator with the players." 
</P>
<P>
 If Rodgers had been around Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium, he might have bolted 
out of the dugout a few times, chewed out starter Mark Langston and reliever 
John Dopson, and wondered how they could allow White Sox designated hitter 
Julio Franco to drive in a career-high fives runs. After all, Langston (2-1) 
yielded eight hits and seven earned runs in four innings, and Dopson yielded 
five hits and three runs in 2 2/3 innings and the Angels trailed by 8-2 by the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But those days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann, who was hired to replace Rodgers and will begin his new job 
Thursday against the Kansas City Royals, is considered a pitcher's best friend. 
He was instrumental in developing starter Chuck Finley and former Angel Bryan 
Harvey, and the pitching staff couldn't contain its excitement about his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one responsible for my success," Finley said. "There were times 
when they wanted to ship me out of here, but he fought to keep me around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never experienced him as a manager, but I know how good he is as a 
pitching coach. I just want to get into his head before he tells us the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Rodgers' critical comments about player performance really have such an 
adverse effect? 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't care for that," Finley said. "There's certain rules that 
are not written, but ones you live by. I think it's just a sense of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing so bad, up and down, you don't have to tell anybody you're 
playing that way. We could figure that out ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Rodgers' criticism bothered players to such an extent that several 
would voice their displeasure to the front office, others thought it was 
immature of players to take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have nothing but respect and great memories of the man," said Angel 
second baseman Rex Hudler, who also played for Rodgers in Montreal. "I know 
there were guys who didn't like what he said in the papers, but hey, a lot of 
guys have to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these guys are crying about what he says about them, try a different job. 
This is the big leagues. Our job is to perform. If we deserve the bashing, 
bring it on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck should not be hanging his head over this, we're the ones who should be 
hanging our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, 16-24 after losing four consecutive games, could not have saved 
Rodgers' job even if they had been in first place. Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi and President Richard Brown would not divulge the specific reasons for 
the firing, and Rodgers isn't planning on talking until today. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's no secret they had conflicting ideas, and the bottom line was that 
although Bavasi has been on the job for only four months, he still is the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of us are still in shock," said left fielder Dwight Smith, who 
was informed of the decision at a 2 p.m. team meeting. "I liked his style 
because he was straight up with you. He believed in us. To me, this is a sad 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Said left fielder Bo Jackson: "There were a lot of us who liked him, but what 
can you do, this was out of our hands. He was a good manager. No one can say 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels now will be managed by a man who has four games' experience. 
Lachemann was an interim manager for four games during the 1992 season in the 
aftermath of the bus crash in which Rodgers was injured, going 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But for this game, and tonight, first base coach Bobby Knoop was responsible. 
He still remained in the first-base coaching box while the Angels were at-bat, 
but he still could tell the Angels weren't ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are distractions when something like this happens," Knoop said, "and I 
can honestly say there was a distraction."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FORMER LONG BEACH ST. STAR POWERS TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first full season in the majors, Chris Gomez, the former Long Beach 
State All-American, had driven in 12 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In one memorable night in Toronto, Gomez increased that total by 50%, driving 
in six runs to lead Tim Belcher and the Detroit Tigers past the Blue Jays, 
13-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez got a two-run double in the second inning, a sacrifice fly in the third, 
and a three-run homer, his fourth, in the fifth after two walks by losing 
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "When I looked around the league last season and saw all the guys who were 
lifting weights, I figured I had to get into it more seriously," Gomez said. 
"Last year I hit a ball to right at Tiger Stadium with all I had and it hit the 
wall. I think that same shot today would go out." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gomez was satisfied with his performance, he was more pleased about the 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this one for Tim (Belcher)," Gomez said. "We just needed to get him 
a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Belcher (1-7) got his first victory in his ninth start to snap a four-game 
Tiger losing streak. He avoided becoming the first Detroit pitcher to lose 
eight straight decisions at the start of a season since 1953, when Ted Gray 
began 0-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be honest," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson said. "In my 25 years in 
baseball, there have been maybe three or four times when I've been truly 
concerned about trying to get a win for a pitcher. Tonight, I was going to let 
(Belcher) die out there before I went and got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter, drove in three runs, and Roberto Alomar homered for Toronto, 
losers for the sixth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 8, Oakland 7 -- Will Clark singled home the winning run in the 10th 
inning and the Rangers won in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's overcame an early 5-0 deficit, took a 7-5 lead and then saw Dennis 
Eckersley give up a two-out, two-run single to Junior Ortiz that tied it in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Lee singled off Steve Ontiveros (1-2) to start the 10th. He was 
sacrificed to second, Jeff Frye walked and Jose Canseco flied out before Clark 
singled to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, New York 4 -- The Twins stopped the Yankees' 10-game winning 
streak when Shane Mack capped a three-run rally in the eighth inning with an 
RBI double at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, who earlier hit an inside-the-park homer and a double, helped the Twins 
win for the eighth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack is batting .422 and has hit in 11 of 12 games since coming off the 
disabled list. He has at least two hits in seven of the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (19-19) is at .500 for the first time since April 24 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 3, Boston 2 -- Rafael Palmeiro extended his hitting streak to 19 
games, longest in the majors this season, and scored the go-ahead run in the 
eighth inning as the Orioles beat Roger Clemens at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina (7-1) pitched eight strong innings to enable Baltimore to end a 
season-high three-game losing streak. Mussina gave up eight hits, walked one 
and struck out seven. In his last four starts, he has a 1.64 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith pitched the ninth for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Baines homered and had a key hit in the eighth, setting up Cal Ripken's 
go-ahead sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (4-2) struck out 11 and pitched a five-hitter. He has a 1.02 ERA in 
his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Seattle 0 -- David Cone pitched a four-hitter to win his 
seventh straight start and notch his second consecutive shutout at Seattle in a 
game that featured a seventh-inning tantrum by Lou Piniella, the volatile 
manager of the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone took a bid for his first career no-hitter into the sixth, when Eric 
Anthony singled to center with two outs. Cone struck out a season-high 10 and 
walked two in his 18th career shutout. He is 4-0 in May with a 1.91 ERA and has 
a 2.83 ERA this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Piniella was ejected by home plate umpire Dale Scott for arguing balls and 
strikes in the seventh. It was Piniella's first ejection of the season and the 
first time he has been thrown out in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Milwaukee 3 -- Kenny Lofton hit two home runs in a game for the 
first time, enabling Cleveland to win its season-high fourth straight, at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle hit a three-run homer and Carlos Baerga added a two-run shot as 
the Indians sent Milwaukee to its sixth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Martinez (2-4) beat Cal Eldred (3-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton homered to lead off the third and sixth innings. He has a career-high 
six home runs, including three in two games. He also has a 15-game hitting 
streak. And he was also spectacular on defense, making a leaping catch at the 
center field fence against John Jaha.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; DISTRACTED BONDS HOMERS TWICE IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neither physical nor mental distractions seemed to bother Barry Bonds on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants' superstar withstood both the pain of a sore right 
elbow and sore left shoulder and the intrusion of a legal problem, hitting two 
home runs in a 5-2 victory over the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' first homer was a two-run shot in the fourth that barely cleared the 
left field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one to left field hurt; the one to left-center (in the eighth, his 11th) 
didn't," said Bonds, who was struck on the right elbow by a pitch from New 
York's Eric Hillman on May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's game, Bonds was subpoened for a deposition arising from a 
family dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no big deal, really," Bonds said. "It's no big deal at all. If I 
wasn't who I was, hitting .100, it wouldn't even be in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting out of Candlestick helped," Bonds said of the Giants' chilly home 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too much Barry Bonds," Astros Manager Terry Collins said. "But 
everybody's seen that at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Swift (6-3) picked up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnisch (2-4), who missed his last start because of a nagging shoulder 
injury, got the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, Pittsburgh 0 -- Cardinal left-hander Tom Urbani, who had won only 
once previously in the majors, held the Pirates to one hit over 7 2/3 innings 
at Pittsburgh in a record-tying shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals used six pitchers to get the final five outs, tying the National 
League record for most pitchers used in a shutout. Florida had used six in a 
3-0 victory over Chicago on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I didn't have any left," said St. Louis Manager Joe Torre, who was down 
to his final reliever -- Rene Arocha -- when Brian Hunter flied out to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Garcia singled twice for the Pirates' only hits. Pittsburgh has already 
been shut out six times in 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbani (1-3) was 1-5 in his career and hadn't won since beating San Francisco 
last Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh starter Zane Smith (4-4) lost for the third time in four decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 11, San Diego 4 -- Sammy Sosa homered to cap a seven-run third inning 
at Chicago and the Cubs went on to hand the Padres their ninth consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego led, 3-0, before Scott Sanders (1-3), activated from the disabled 
list before the game, lost his control. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, so did the Padres, whose losing streak is their longest since a 
nine-game skid from Sept. 24-Oct. 3, 1987. The Padres have lost 14 of their 
last 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning pitcher Jose Guzman (1-2) was activated off the disabled list before 
the game. He hadn't pitched since April 10 because of shoulder tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Florida 3 -- Joe Orsulak, who had earlier hit a game-tying home 
run, drove in two runs with a two-out, bases-loaded single in the ninth inning 
to give the Mets the victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Orsulak had led off the sixth with a solo homer, his fifth, to tie the score 
at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 John Franco (1-2) was the winner, Jeremy Hernandez (2-2) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins had won 11 of their previous 16 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, Montreal 5 -- Third baseman Sean Berry threw wildly to the 
plate in the bottom of the ninth inning at Philadelphia, allowing the tying and 
winning runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Hollins and Darren Daulton walked to open the ninth and advanced on Jim 
Eisenreich's sacrifice bunt off John Wetteland (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Hollins broke for home when Ricky Jordan hit a hard grounder to third. Berry 
fielded the ball going to his right and threw past catcher Darrin Fletcher into 
the Phillies' dugout, allowing Hollins and Daulton to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Jones (2-1) pitched the ninth to gain the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, Atlanta 3 -- Jacob Brumfield's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the 
10th inning gave the Reds a come-from-behind victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati overcame a 3-0 deficit against Greg Maddux and Greg McMichael 
(1-2), who failed to hold a one-run lead in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Larkin's two-out single tied the game and gave McMichael his second 
blown save in 10 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brave pitcher gave away the game in the 10th when he committed two errors 
on Kevin Mitchell's comeback grounder, one for letting it go off his glove and 
another for throwing the ball into the dugout after recovering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brantley (3-1) got the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders was ejected in the third inning after being called out for 
interference at first base by umpire Bob Davidson. After arguing on the field, 
Sanders went into the dugout and threw a water cooler onto the field, drawing 
the ejection.

OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS: IF YOU CATCH A PERCH, IT COULD BE A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a world-record fish at Crowley Lake begging to be caught. It's not a 
trout but a Sacramento perch, and Scott Slamal of Mammoth Lakes might have 
caught it. And thrown it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like an idiot," he said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Perch are a favorite of Eastern Sierra residents, who catch them by the 
bucketful. But they are virtually unknown to visitors, who come for the trout. 
They are so prolific there is no limit, and operators of the Crowley Lake Fish 
Camp have run a perch derby the last couple of years to capitalize on the 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the world record listed by the International Game Fish Assn. is 2 
pounds 12 ounces, by Arnold Darrell in Sonoma County in 1991, but the state 
record recognized by the Department of Fish and Game is 3 pounds 10 ounces, 
caught by Jack Johnson of Crowley Lake in 1979. Apparently, Johnson didn't 
submit his catch for world-record recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the betting is that the record will come from Crowley, perhaps soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sacramento perch have moved into the shallows to spawn and are taking 
anything thrown their way," said Fred Rowe, an Eastern Sierra fly-fishing 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McPherson at the lake's tackle store said: "I've been out fishing for 
trout and I can't get past the perch." 
</P>
<P>
 Slamal wasn't fishing for perch, either. He was in a float tube around the 
Green Banks area near the mouth of the Owens River, throwing Hornberg streamers 
for trout when the perch bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing didn't fight too well," Slamal said. "I thought it was a snag." 
</P>
<P>
 But after he dragged it in, the fish measured 18 inches by the scale on his 
tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a mouth like a bass," Slamal said. "It looked like a bass." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't weigh it or photograph it, but Rowe said, "(At 18 inches), I'd say 
it had to go at least four pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody else was around, and Slamal let it go. Later, a friend, Mike Erickson, 
stopped by to see how he was doing, and Slamal said he'd caught an 18-inch 
perch. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson got excited -- until Slamal told him he'd released it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" Erickson said. "That might have been a world record." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowe thinks many Sacramento perch world records have been thrown back -- or 
eaten -- at Crowley, simply out of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody seems to be aware that the (California) record is only 3-10," Rowe 
said. "There are probably three or four records caught (at Crowley) every year. 
If somebody is interested in (claiming) a state-record fish, now would be the 
time to do it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Persistence and a hunch paid off with the first big yellowtail strike of the 
year within one-day range of local boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Tanaka's Fortune out of Skipper's 22nd Street Landing in San Pedro was 
the only boat around when its 17 anglers took 93 yellowtail near San Clemente 
Island last Sunday, a day after getting skunked there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday, we didn't have the conditions . . . didn't have good current, but 
it looked fishy," Tanaka said. "It was just a hunch." 
</P>
<P>
 He collected squid on the backside of Santa Catalina both days before 
continuing the long trip. The yellowtail ranged from 8 to 19 pounds, averaging 
about 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 MEXICAN FISHING -- CABO SAN LUCAS: Angler loads are light, but after a slow 
month, striped marlin 110 to 150 pounds made a comeback as close as a mile from 
the harbor. Gaviota fleet reported 46 catches (34 released) and Pisces fleet 
claimed 17 (13 released). Limits of yellowfin tuna have been common. Most 10-15 
pounds, some up to 65. EAST CAPE: The Let's Talk Hook Up group at Palmas de 
Cortez took six striped marlin in four days, topped by 145-pound catch by Dave 
Auger, Van Nuys, and 140-pounder by pro bass fisherman John Ed Wilder. LORETO: 
Yellowtail have been erratic, cabrilla excellent. MAZATLAN: Sailfish action has 
been excellent, running 88-118 pounds. 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea Hero, last year's Kentucky Derby and Travers winner, ended an eight-month 
layoff by winning the $40,000 allowance feature at Belmont Park on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Hero, ridden by Jerry Bailey and assigned high weight of 119 pounds, 
showed no signs of rustiness.The 4-year-old son of Polish Navy raced within 
easy striking distance of leader Dominant Prospect until the field turned for 
home, then pulled away to beat Rocking Josh by 1 1/4 lengths in 1:22 3/5 for 
the seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, originally to be run on turf, was moved to the muddy main track. It 
was Sea Hero's sixth victory in 17 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Hero, the favorite, returned $5.40, $4.20 and $2.40. Rocking Josh paid 
$4.80 and $2.40 and Dominant Prospect returned $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over," trainer Mack Miller said of the layoff. "I liked (the 
victory) very much because he's really not a sprinter, he's a router."

 "Yes," the majority leader replied.

 "And you're engaged to a woman who's 35, right?" Leno asked.

 "Yes," Mitchell conceded.

 Back Story: Michael, Alice and the girls seem rapturously happy in their San 
Francisco Victorian house. But Michael's job keeps him away from home, so he is 
slow to realize how much Alice drinks. Her drinking precipitates a family 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuse Time: As bad as the drinking was, the trouble between Alice and Michael 
really begins when Alice faces up to her addiction and gets treatment. Instead 
of solving their problems, Alice's sobriety seems to compound them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: "It was so much more fun in the old days," Alice sarcastically 
tells Michael in the midst of a screaming argument. "I'd get drunk, I'd fall 
apart, and you'd put me back together." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: Sobriety doesn't guarantee a happily-ever-after marriage, 
said Martha Rogers, a clinical forensic psychologist whose practice in Tustin 
frequently involves problems that arise from drug and alcohol addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol serves as a way of avoiding dealing with certain problems," Rogers 
said. "And when you come out with sobriety, there is often going to be enormous 
pain and difficulty from those things that have been avoided for so long. 
That's why many people fall off the wagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholism can also define how a two people deal with each other in a 
relationship, she said. As in the movie, spouses of alcoholics are often not 
aware of how they've accommodated the addiction.  
</P>
<P>
 "There may be problems in shifting the balance after the need for 
accommodation is gone," Rogers said. "If people can't negotiate a change in the 
power and dynamics, they can go down in flames, even after they're sober."

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; NEW DR. SEUSS BOOK, CARTOON TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cat in the Hat is back -- with a book in a nook. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-year-old manuscript by Dr. Seuss, the beloved children's author, was 
discovered after his death, his publisher said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daisy-Head Mayzie" will be published next winter by Random House and will be 
made into an animated cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Geisel, the author's widow, found the script in the bottom of a drawer 
as she was preparing to renovate her house in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Seuss, the pen name of Theodore Geisel, wrote the story as a screenplay. 
He used typically whimsical verse, but made only a few loose drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the cartoon's animation will be created by artists working with 
the Seuss drawings, and the book's illustrations will be based on the 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrated by Seuss' most famous character, the Cat in the Hat, "Daisy-Head 
Mayzie" is the story of a girl who suddenly finds a daisy growing from the top 
of her head. She is taunted by schoolmates, chased by bees and scrutinized by 
those eager to solve her "problem." 
</P>
<P>
 After an agent talks her into cashing in on her notoriety, Mayzie discovers 
the perils of overnight success and concludes love means more than fame and 
glory. Baltimore Rejects Domestic Partnerships 
</P>
<P>
 After months of emotional debate, Baltimore's City Council rejected a proposal 
last week that would have granted legal recognition to gay couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, defeated 10 to 7, would have set up a municipal registry for 
domestic partnerships. Under the bill, gays living together could register as 
families and be guaranteed hospital visitation rights. Hospitals usually allow 
only close relatives to visit critically ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In Austin, Tex., voters recently repealed a policy that provided insurance 
benefits to the companions of city employees. Putting Household Items to 
Child-Care Use 
</P>
<P>
 Your child is teething and all the bibs are dirty. Quick, what do you do? Use 
a bandanna scarf to catch the drool, suggests Vicki Lansky in "Don't Throw That 
Out!" (Book Peddlars of Deephaven, Minn.; 1994).  
</P>
<P>
 The 98-page, softcover book describes practical child-care uses for such items 
as berry baskets (use them in the dishwasher to hold bottle nipples and prevent 
them from falling into the bottom of the dishwasher); marshmallows (drop a 
large marshmallow into a flat-bottomed ice-cream cone before adding ice cream 
to minimize leaking), and wax paper (rub it over tray runners on highchairs to 
make the tray slide easily into place). 
</P>
<P>
 The tips are organized in alphabetical order. Lansky is the author of 26 
books, including "Feed Me I'm Yours," "Baby Proofing Basics" and "The Taming of 
the C.A.N.D.Y. Monster."

 GOOD KARMA: "Little Buddha," a new movie directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, 
makes its U.S. premier Saturday night at The Ojai Playhouse. . . . The film 
relates the story of a Seattle boy believed to be the incarnation of a revered 
Buddhist monk. Ojai landed the movie's first showing as a benefit for the 
Ojai-based American-Bhutan Council, which wants to educate Americans about the 
tiny Buddhist nation near Tibet. Much of the film takes place in Bhutan.

 COLD ACT: Three Dog Night will play this weekend's Strawberry Festival as one 
of the headliner bands. . . . Ironically, the name Three Dog Night represents 
the kind of weather that threatens the delicate crop. The term comes from 
Australian aborigines who bed down with their dogs, adding more pooches as the 
weather grows harsher. A three-dog night is the coldest. Meanwhile, Oxnard 
officials consider turning over the festival to a nonprofit group (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 GOP HUMOR: Ronald Reagan knew how to tickle America's funny bone. . . by 
poking fun at himself. But Reagan didn't make the conference at his 
presidential library on political humor. And, other than quoting Reagan, there 
was precious little self-deprecating humor. Strikingly, Dan Quayle figured out 
the formula. Referring to his own time as the butt of jokes, Quayle said: "You 
see where President Clinton said he was the most assaulted American leader? 
President Clinton, read my book. " 
</P>
<P>
 UP IN SMOKE: No matter how delicious, you know that french fries, doughnuts 
and other deep-fried foods aren't good for you. And, studies show that 
barbecued chicken or steaks cooked over an open flame can become coated with 
cancer-causing smoke residue. . . . Given the evidence, you suspected that 
government someday might crack down on deep-fat fryers and charbroilers. County 
supervisors are considering it, but not for reasons you'd think (B1). They want 
to cut back on the 220 tons of air pollutants emitted from restaurants each 
year.

PRUNER AMBULANCE DECIDES TO SELL BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA and CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of a battle over the lucrative business of transporting patients, 
the owners of Ventura County's primary ambulance company are selling their 
business to the second-largest provider of ambulance care in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner Ambulance Co. announced late Tuesday that it will sell the 31-year-old 
business to CareLine, an Irvine-based company that has purchased nine ambulance 
operators in five states since its founding in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Don and Jackie Pruner "were quite concerned about the quality of their 
successor," Pruner spokesman Steve Murphy said. Pruner chose CareLine "because 
they have a strong presence in Southern California and because they have a 
strong history in maintaining a local work and management team." 
</P>
<P>
 The move came just one week after the Board of Supervisors decided to extend 
for two years Pruner's contract, despite protests from angry county 
firefighters, who had asked for a chance to bid on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pruner has been battling with the city of Ventura, which is 
considering a plan to allow city firefighters to take over paramedic and 
ambulance services now provided by Pruner. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard said she learned of the sale late Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not surprised," Howard said. "Businesses are very frequently up for 
sale. But I can't remember hearing anything about this company being sold."  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom said the sale reaffirmed his belief that the 
ambulance company is not being upfront with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The firefighters told the city that major conglomerates are buying up small 
ambulance companies," Tingstrom said. "But Pruner said it would not happen 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the company did not inform city and county officials sooner about 
its plans to sell to CareLine because of business confidentiality.  
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the company continues to provide the same level of service, I 
don't think that the county will have any problems," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner Health Services was launched in 1963 by Thousand Oaks residents Don and 
Jackie Pruner. 
</P>
<P>
 The company provides ambulance service for Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Simi 
Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo, Fillmore and Santa Paula. Ambulance service for 
Ojai, Port Hueneme and Oxnard is run by other private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The private firms receive a subsidy from the county, totaling $238,700, but 
earn most of their revenues from fees charged to patients and insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors regulates Pruner's fees within Ventura County. For 
basic runs, prices range from $250 to $400. For runs using advanced life 
support, costs range from $500 to $800. 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine, the fastest-growing ambulance company in the nation, owns 
subsidiaries in California, Alabama, Colorado, Georgia and Massachusetts.

STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL TO PASS TO PRIVATE GROUP; OXNARD: ACTION IS PART OF CITY'S 
MOVE TO CUT COSTS AND BALANCE BUDGET. NONPROFIT ENTITY WILL RUN THE EVENT 
STARTING NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Strawberry Festival will soon be run by a nonprofit corporation 
approved Tuesday by the Oxnard City Council as part of its continuing an effort 
to put city programs in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 With the annual event just days away, council members voted to privatize the 
city-sponsored attraction that celebrates one of the area's most abundant 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event, now in its 11th year, will be held this weekend at Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the direction the city has wanted to go in for some time," said 
Tsujio Kato, chairman of the festival's executive committee. "This is 
recognition that the city isn't in the festival business, it's in the business 
of providing public services." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the city has looked for ways to scale back city government 
in an effort to cut costs and balance the budget. Late last year, the council 
agreed to put the city's economic development program in the hands of a private 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing that trend, the City Council agreed Tuesday to allow the California 
Strawberry Festival Committee to form a private, nonprofit corporation to 
orchestrate the event starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also agreed to loan $600,000 to the new corporation to help it 
produce and operate next year's festival. The one-time loan will be repaid with 
interest over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to reduce the city's liability by making the festival 
self-sufficient, an idea that Councilman Mike Plisky has wanted for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been our feeling all along that one day we would privatize this event," 
Plisky said. "We have gotten nothing but lip service up to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the city's investment in the event has been repaid by corporate 
sponsorships and revenues generated by the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The strawberry festival has generated more than $500,000 in each of the past 
five years, with much of that profit directed to a variety of local nonprofit 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, with the council set to permit the formation of the nonprofit 
corporation, business leaders stepped forward and asked city leaders to delay 
their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Facciano, executive director of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, told the 
council that the chamber and other groups wanted to explore the possibility of 
running the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to see what's involved in running the strawberry festival," said 
Facciano, adding that the chamber gets about 50 calls a day at this time of 
year from people interested in attending the event. "The end result is that we 
keep it a very good, successful event." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kato argued that the festival should remain in the hands of the group that 
has produced it since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the organization that puts on the festival has a (good) track 
record," Kato said. "The main thing we would like to see is the continued 
success of a festival that brings recognition to Oxnard and to Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, farm worker advocates asked the council for a larger role in 
helping to plan the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would like to ask from this council and from the California Strawberry 
Festival Committee is the opportunity for greater involvement in the festival 
preparations from the group who really makes this festival possible, the farm 
worker community and specifically farm worker women," said Irma Avila, a 
representative of California Rural Legal Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-thirds of the crews harvesting the strawberries are women," Avila added. 
"This is dangerous, back-breaking, low-paying work done with dignity by farm 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar concerns prompted farm workers and their advocates to picket the event 
two years ago.

CONSERVATIVE COMICS; QUAYLE IS AMONG SPEAKERS DISCUSSING POLITICS OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With impish glee and acid wit, ex-Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative 
humorist P.J. O'Rourke lobbed verbal spitballs at the Clinton Administration on 
Tuesday in a daylong humor conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington rumor says Roger Clinton now feels embarrassed by his brother, 
Quayle said, while O'Rourke skewered the President's health care reform 
proposal as the bloated product of a pre-exam "dorm-room bull session." "They 
think that if they just stay up late enough, there'll be human rights in 
China," O'Rourke said of Clinton and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I should take health advice from a President with a waistline 
like a Beautyrest mattress, the jogging gait of a beached sea lion and the 
sleeping habits of a teen-age slumber party," O'Rourke told more than 300 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Do Conservatives Have a Sense of Humor?" the conference answered its 
own question with lectures by O'Rourke, Quayle and former Reagan staff member 
Lyn Nofziger, and musical political spoofs by The Capitol Steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nofziger recalled quips by conservatives such as Herbert Hoover, who said of 
reporters, "Every President should be allowed to shoot two a year, without 
explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nofziger told the crowd that Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater once sought 
entry to a golf course that excluded Jews, asking, "What about if I play nine 
holes? I'm only half-Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan, who once defined status quo as "this mess we're in," was the wittiest 
conservative President, even in the face of peril, Nofziger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in a 1981 assassination attempt, Reagan bombarded the hospital staff with 
one-liners, and Nofziger recalled repeating them to an anxious press corps.  
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by emergency room doctors, Reagan had cracked, "I hope you're all 
Republicans," Nofziger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the remarks that would let the country know that President Reagan 
is OK and that everything would be fine," Nofziger said. "Because up till that 
point, everyone thought Al Haig was in charge," he said, referring to the 
then-secretary of state's take-power speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitol Steps took a more pointed approach to humor, aping Clinton as a 
potbellied philanderer, Hillary Clinton as a commodity-trading Lady Macbeth and 
Ross Perot as a jug-eared whiner in a watermelon-green 98-gallon hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suture yourself -- at home; suture yourself -- in front of the family," sang 
Brad Van Grack and Brian Ashe, satirizing the Clinton health care plan to the 
tune of "Consider Yourself . " "We'll do it for just -- a song, who cares if 
maybe we get it wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Quayle took the stage amid boisterous applause and a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pronouncing himself glad to be out of the public spotlight for now, Quayle 
hinted broadly at a 1996 run for the presidency and recalled how his time in 
office made him the butt of jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see where President Clinton said he was the most assaulted American 
leader? President Clinton, read my book, " Quayle said, referring to "Standing 
Firm," his autobiography, autographed copies of which were snatched up by the 
audience between speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle also joked about his career as second fiddle to the President, 
recalling that the vice president's office was decorated with the bust of Henry 
Wilson, Ulysses S. Grant's second vice president, whom Quayle said "died there. 
He took a nap and never woke up." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was O'Rourke's blistering attack on the Clinton presidency that served 
as a political rallying cry for the Republicans in the room hoping for a 
victory in coming elections.  
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton is a disaster for the rest of our country, but he is meat for our 
table," O'Rourke told the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to Clinton's attempt to re-create the Kennedy mystique, O'Rourke 
said, "He is Clown Kennedy. Look at the waistline, the hair, the family, the 
girlfriends -- it is Kennedy done by Bozo. . . . It is the New Frontier as 
re-enacted at a circus." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he didn't believe Paula Jones' allegations that Clinton sexually 
harassed her, but, "Who knows what happened behind closed motel doors -- even 
in Arkansas. . . . If only he had spent a little more time with Paula Jones, 
we'd be better off." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke also criticized term limits for incumbents, saying, "You want dogs 
who know where the bones are buried, not dogs who are going to dig up the whole 
yard."

WAR ON SMOG MAY REACH RESTAURANTS; AIR QUALITY: THE COUNTY WILL CONSIDER 
REGULATING BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE CHARBROILERS, DEEP-FAT FRYERS AND KITCHEN 
GRIDDLES. 
</P>

 Despite producing less than 1% of Ventura County's smog, the grease-filled 
fryers, griddles and charbroilers used in restaurant kitchens may be the next 
source of pollution targeted by air quality officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flabbergasted," said Michael Wagner, who owns Andria's Seafood at Ventura 
Harbor, one of hundreds of restaurants that would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just dumbfounded that the county can be so naive as to stick it to 
business," Wagner said. "If they're going after smoke from my deep-fryer or 
smoke from my charbroiler, what's the alternative to cooking?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to consider regulating businesses 
that operate charbroilers, deep-fat fryers and kitchen griddles to try to 
reduce the levels of smog-causing agents they emit locally each year. A 
recommendation to supervisors is due by August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Local air quality officials admit that commercial kitchens are relatively 
small smog producers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say their hands are tied by state and federal clean air laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants might end up being one of the more obscure (smog) sources we've 
come up with so far," said Keith Duval of the Ventura County Air Pollution 
Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board approved the study on a 4-0 vote, with Supervisor John K. 
Flynn absent, Chairwoman Vicky Howard said she worried about what its 
implementation would mean to restaurant owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things we can do to clean up the air, most of them having 
to do with automobiles," Howard said. "This is one of those areas we should 
probably back off (from) and find some other way to clean up the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard then voted to proceed with the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say Ventura County restaurants produce nearly 220 tons of the 
compounds that cause smog every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of those emissions -- about 120 tons -- are produced by the 
area's deep-fat fryers. Charbroilers and griddles account for another 50 tons 
each annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ventura County fails to meet federal clean air standards, local 
officials are required to enact measures to lower the amount of smog produced 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal ozone standard is a health-based standard," Duval said. "It's 
been designed to protect the public health. When we exceed that standard, there 
are people in Ventura County whose health is affected." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 tons of air pollutants -- about 80 tons a day -- are produced 
each year in Ventura County, making it one of the dirtiest metropolitan areas 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the county adopted an air quality management plan that targets the 
worst polluters -- cars and heavy industry. A federal plan unveiled in February 
calls for virtually every industry to set and reach new guidelines regarding 
their emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller polluters also will be called upon to do their part.  
</P>
<P>
 Under preliminary discussion is the notion of limiting the amount of food a 
restaurant could cook or requiring owners to install costly smog-control 
devices for their fryers, griddles and charbroilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're serious," Duval said. "In one shape, form or another, we will probably 
be proposing something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea does not sit well with most restaurant owners and managers contacted 
Tuesday. They fear government interference will threaten their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds very silly to me," said Dino Papanicolaou, manager of Roxy's Deli 
in Thousand Oaks. "Whether (food) is cooked at home or at a restaurant, you're 
going to use a grill or a broiler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have everything microwaved," he said. "It's just one more thing that 
this industry would have to deal with, and that provides for a very low profit 
margin." 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurant owners said they understand the need for stricter regulations. 
But they worry that the cost of a smog device would sink their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can come up with one that works, and they can make it affordable, 
then I'm all for it," said Charles Davis, owner of the two Buster's Barbecue 
restaurants in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they also have to make it so that everyone has to conform to the same 
rules," he said. "They need to make it economically feasible for us small guys 
to stay in business."

POLICY URGED FOR VENTURA COMMITTEES' VOLUNTEERS; ETHICS: SOME OFFICIALS WANT 
CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES ON WHEN APPOINTEES MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE PAID, 
PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTS WITH CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura needs a clear conflict-of-interest policy for city appointees, 
spelling out when citizens volunteering for municipal committees may or may not 
accept paid, professional contracts with the city, some council members said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose one day after Planning Commissioner Curtis Stiles accused the 
council of publicly embarrassing him by declaring he could not remain at his 
post and continue his work on a $25,000 city landscape contract.  
</P>
<P>
 "As of this evening, whether you say I have integrity or not, I feel 
humiliated," an emotional Stiles told the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Stiles abruptly announced his resignation as planning commissioner 
as well as his membership on the city's architectural review committee. He also 
turned down the contract on a downtown plaza after pouring three weeks into its 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that other council-appointed committees are filled with such 
potential conflicts, some council members said they want to draft a policy so 
in the future, appointees know what the rules are before they take a city 
contract.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need for everybody to be aware in advance that if you work for these 
commissions, you don't get any of these contracts," Councilman Steve Bennett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law states only that city officials who are making money off a project 
cannot discuss that project or vote on it when it comes before their board or 
committee. But council members say they are concerned with the public's 
"perception" of cronyism as well as the legality of the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 Some city committee appointees said the council must be cautious, however, 
when delving into the gray area of perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they go to a higher standard than the law, people will have to decide 
between their ability to earn a living in the city and their ability to serve 
the city" on committees, said Planning Commissioner Ted Temple, a local 
builder.  
</P>
<P>
 Stiles said in an interview Tuesday that Ventura may be too small for the 
council to make such rigid distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles, you can specialize," he said. "But in a small town, or even a 
small county like this one, you have to do as many kinds of projects as you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members dwelt particularly on the city's tourism committee, which 
some of them assert is packed with appointments that teeter on the line between 
acceptability and profiteering off of city service.  
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Woods, vice president and general manager of KBBY-FM, is among the 
appointees. Though her station does not enter into monetary contracts with 
Ventura, it regularly runs public service announcements on events like the 
annual beach party in return for sponsorship of the festival, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Woods and others on city-appointed committees say they do not understand what 
would be called a conflict of interest and what would not.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you this," she said. "If it was a choice between being on this 
committee or forgoing $25,000 worth of business, it would be very difficult for 
me to stay on this committee."  
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's meeting, Stiles found it impossible to do either. 
</P>
<P>
 An infuriated Stiles told council members that he did not apply for the 
contract to design California Street Plaza. Instead, he said, city planners 
approached him after the staff member in charge of the project resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the proposed California Street Plaza is now a cluster of vacant 
storefronts at the south end of California Street, next to the beach promenade 
and across from the Holiday Inn. The city hopes to redesign the plaza as part 
of an overall downtown redevelopment project, and plans call for including a 
new restaurant with outdoor dining. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles said he twice offered to resign his city appointments to accept the 
contract, but city staff repeatedly said that would be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's appropriate for me, because I didn't want to do anything to harm 
the city I grew up in, to resign the planning commission, resign my position on 
the design review committee, and turn down the contract for this project, which 
I've already put many hours into and gotten the design under way," Stiles said 
after the council made its decision. "It looks terrific, it's going to be great 
-- -- and somebody else can carry it on from here."  
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by Stiles' impassioned reaction, council members vowed to write him 
a letter of apology, pleading with him to remain on the plaza project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have felt really bad about things," Councilman Gary Tuttle said Tuesday 
morning. "That's not the way I wanted to see things go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, they wondered what they should do next. Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson said the council's decision on Stiles and the plaza project may have 
forced a de facto policy on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried that . . . we've set a precedent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, the lone council member to vote against the motion to 
deny Stiles the contract if he kept his city appointment, said his phone was 
ringing off the hook Tuesday with "people who really thought the council had 
egg on its face."  
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said he did not see why the council did not merely stick with the law.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; WOMAN OFFERS 
EX-CONS A 2ND OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claudia Ryan is a believer. She has been raped. Her daughter has been 
kidnaped. And she doesn't profit from helping ex-cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she does it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months ago, Ryan, 47, essentially turned her back on her own economic 
security and opened a residential home for parolees in North Hollywood so 
ex-cons will have a softer landing once they get out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the other stuff matters. Nor does it matter, says Ryan, that she 
doesn't understand precisely why she picked ex-convicts to care about in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know exactly," she admits. "It's something I don't really have an 
answer for. I know, it doesn't seem to make sense, but it makes perfect sense 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility, she said, is that her own bouts with the criminal justice 
system, particularly after her rape 26 years ago, brought less than 
satisfactory results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dealt with the system for years, so I know how frustrating it can be," 
she said. "It makes you feel like you're nothing. You're worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 The Claudia Ryan Center, occupying the site of the North Hollywood shelter on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard, houses about 25 male ex-cons. Among them is a 
murderer, a couple of people convicted of attempted murder, robbers and 
burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who sports several large turquoise and silver rings on her fingers and 
wears her fingernails painted pink, said she feels comfortable around them. 
</P>
<P>
 But being the lone woman among a group of men who in some cases haven't seen a 
woman in a decade makes it necessary for a few rules. "I explain to them that 
when I give them a hug, it's just that and nothing else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She calls them "my guys." Some of them call her "mom." 
</P>
<P>
 All are here voluntarily and pay about $200 a month to room at the center. 
They do chores, handle most of the cooking and adhere to a 9 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, they get security and Ryan helps find them work. So far, her guys 
have gotten jobs working in auto parts stores and doing construction, plumbing, 
retail and telemarketing work. A couple have even landed jobs at a major 
Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
 She also sets them up in mandatory counseling -- whether that means Narcotics 
Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous or Bible study. Drugs and alcohol are 
forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 The men also take part in discussion groups with kids at schools and erase 
graffiti on neighborhood walls. Because they want to avoid heat from the police 
and their own temptation, the parolees have also chased away the drug dealers 
who used to hang out in front when the building was still a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just an idea of living clean and sober and working, but also giving 
back to the community and working with kids," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In case anyone gets the wrong idea, Ryan says she is neither on a mission from 
God, nor does she have any interest in saving the world. "I'm no do-gooder," 
she says, with unconcealed disgust. "I don't want to save the world. I want to 
help the people that want to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, a graduate of Taft High School, grew up all over. Her grandfather, the 
warden at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan., used to bring inmates 
home, including one woman accused of hacking her husband to death.  
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather told me, 'Just because someone has done something wrong 
doesn't make them a bad person,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years before her mother died from drug and alcohol abuse, Ryan had begun 
to counsel substance abusers. She eventually became a job placement counselor 
at a prison.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Ryan was raped by a friend's boyfriend -- a crime she said made her 
hate the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put me through questioning like I was the one who raped him," she said. 
"Then the guy jumped bail and was never found. I had to watch my back for 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, Ryan, ever the survivor, is optimistic about herself and 
her guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things do work out," she said. "You just have to have a lot of patience . . . 
and believe in yourself."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LATE SPRING STORM MOVES THROUGH AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parts of Thousand Oaks were drenched in a downpour while Camarillo and Oxnard 
barely got wet during a late spring storm that passed through Ventura County on 
Tuesday, authorities said. More rain is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 "April showers are running a little late this year," said Jerrett McFarland, a 
rain analyst for the Ventura County Flood Control Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A storm that swept through the county dumped 0.39 inch on Thousand Oaks, but 
spared Camarillo and Oxnard, which had no recorded rainfall, Jerrett said. 
Ventura and Santa Paula each received 0.04 inch of rain. Rainfall in Simi 
Valley measured only 0.08 and in Ojai 0.12 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Morgan, meteorologist for the National Weather Service, forecast more 
showers today, with a chance of thunderstorms in the mountains. He said he 
expects a few sprinkles on Thursday as well, with some sunshine returning by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another one of those storms that comes out of the Gulf of Alaska 
and slowly tracks its way down the coast," Morgan said. "The only thing wrong 
with this thing is that it's about 30 days too late." PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STATUS REPORT ON PIPELINES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A status report on risks associated with oil and gas pipelines crisscrossing 
beneath county soil was postponed Tuesday by Ventura County supervisors at the 
request of John K. Flynn, who was absent from the board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors was also scheduled to discuss applying for a federal 
grant to pay for a costly inventory of the network of pipes to help prevent 
future leaks.Four serious oil spills have occurred in the past five months. 
</P>
<P>
 No such map exists, state and local officials concede. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Flynn said Tuesday that the supervisor, who represents the Oxnard 
area, was in Agoura Hills attending a water forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk assessment was ordered by supervisors within days of an 84,000-gallon 
oil spill at McGrath Lake near Oxnard in December in which hundreds of 
migratory birds and other species were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, three other pipeline-related spills have been discovered in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter is scheduled to be considered next week. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS BACK WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came Tuesday to support Colleen Toy White's campaign for a Ventura County 
Superior Court judgeship: police chiefs, the county sheriff, probation officers 
and a dog named Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from every major county law enforcement group attended a noon 
news conference to publicly pledge support for White's judicial campaign.White, 
an assistant district attorney, is competing with criminal defense attorney 
James M. Farley for the only open seat on the county Superior Court bench in 
the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unusual backer was 4-year-old German shepherd Duke Von Inglishaus. 
Duke accompanied Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Velez, who is training the dog for 
duty on the K-9 unit. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief speech, White thanked the officers for their support. White 
said she was especially appreciative of the backing from her four-legged 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, White said the endorsements from law enforcement 
should help her at the polls. "I think the people in this county respect what 
these men and women do," White said in a later interview. "I'm just honored to 
have them support me." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the groups endorsing White on Tuesday represent the opinion of top 
police brass and not "the cop on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of the support of all of the law enforcement officers who work the 
streets . . . . because they know and respect me for what I am," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 White received endorsement from the heads of every police organization in the 
county and unions representing county sheriff's deputies and police officers in 
Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Other endorsements came from Ventura County firefighters, corrections and 
probation officers and the state district attorneys investigators' association.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY BACKS PARKS, HABITAT BOND PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the objections of farm and taxpayer representatives, the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday adopted a resolution supporting a 
$2-billion bond targeting parkland acquisition and various wildlife programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution endorsing Proposition 180 was approved on a 4-0 vote, with 
Supervisor John K. Flynn absent. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters next month, the initiative would set aside more than $23 
million for specific property acquisition and habitat protection in Ventura 
County alone, including areas such as Ormond Beach and the Ventura and Santa 
Clara river sheds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems important to me that we be supportive of some of the goals this 
board has set in the past," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who brought the 
recommendation to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said the state cannot afford to spend $2 billion it doesn't have to 
buy parks it doesn't need. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 50% of the land in the state is already in government hands," said 
Rex Laird, the director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "The same goes for 
Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Laird said the state would do well to take care of the parklands it already 
owns. Michael Saliba, the executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers 
Assn., also opposed the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members, however, disagreed. Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said her 
husband still talks about his boyhood experience in the Colorado Conservation 
Corps, a youth program similar to ones that would be funded by Proposition 180. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way of putting a dollar figure on how important that (experience) 
can be to some youth who are at risk," VanderKolk said. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Water experts will converge on the Oxnard Hilton on Friday for a symposium 
titled "Diverging Water Interests: Striking a Balance" and sponsored by the 
county's Assn. of Water Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium will feature speakers from local water agencies, state resource 
officials, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, the agricultural sector 
and an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to present a program that brings out different and conflicting 
interests," said Dana Weber Young, the association's managing director. The 
symposium "does usually spark a debate among those attending," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Seraydarian, director of EPA's Water Management Division, will speak 
about that agency's vision for California's water supplies. Brad Shinn of the 
California Farm Water Coalition will discuss "Agriculture, How Much Water?" 
Otis Wollan, executive director of Public Officials for Water and Environmental 
Reforms, will discuss "How Will Water Transfers Restore the Environment and 
Solve Our Water Needs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weber Young said the symposium presents an opportunity for county officials 
and residents with an interest in water to meet state and federal water 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some large agencies in this county, but the majority of them are 
small to medium size, and they just don't get access to these people on a 
regular basis," she said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENTS GET A LOOK AT POSSIBLE 
CAREER PATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ditching classwork for a day, several dozen teen-agers in Thousand Oaks spent 
Tuesday testing future career options at various employers ranging from the 
phone company to a hospital and city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District, Student Shadowing Day matched high school students 
with career fields of their interest. And like the nationwide Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day, the Thousand Oaks event was intended to give the 
students a realistic look at the working world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great opportunity to experience (the workplace) firsthand," said Karen 
Levett, a senior at Thousand Oaks High School, who wants to become a doctor. 
Otherwise, she said, students are "waiting and going to school and thinking you 
know what you want to do, but not being sure." 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Robles Regional Medical Center, she and five other students toured the 
hospital, from the neonatal unit under construction to the emergency room where 
security has been tightened because of gang-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Levett watched in the cardiac catheterization lab as a doctor threaded a tiny 
camera through a patient's aorta to view a blocked artery. Watching on a 
monitor, she also viewed a video of an earlier angioplasty in which a patient's 
clogged artery was opened with a balloon-like instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hospital's blood bank, 17-year-old Summer Field, clad in a white lab 
coat, watched as a technician demonstrated how blood is sorted by type, and 
then tested for antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of familiar to me because we did a kind of blood typing in my 
anatomy class, but not with real blood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At GTE California Inc., another half-dozen students learned about the 
company's massive billing operation and what it takes to deliver phone service 
to new areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending several hours with Sharon Cooper, a traffic engineer for GTE, 
Westlake High junior Allison Littleford said she had a new appreciation for the 
dial tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot you don't even realize," she said. "When you pick up the phone 
and hear the dial tone, you don't think about how much work people have to do 
to get that dial tone to your house." JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MAN HELD AFTER POLICE STANDOFF IS 
CALLED LONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Port Hueneme man accused of holding his wife hostage and keeping Oxnard's 
SWAT team at bay for nearly four hours was described by neighbors as a loner 
who often had loud arguments with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Coates, 47, a former employee of the Cleveland, Ohio, Sheriff's 
Department, was arrested about 11:30 p.m. Monday after he had threatened to 
kill police officers, his wife and himself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates, who told neighbors he was on disability leave, had lived with his wife 
in the complex for nearly eight years.  
</P>
<P>
 Police had been called several times in the last two years to the couple's 
condominium by neighbors who had been disturbed by the couple's fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard them all the time getting into fights," said a neighbor who did not 
want to be identified. "Over the last four months their fights have been more 
prominent." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates' psychiatrist called police about 6:15 p.m., saying Coates was armed 
and could start shooting at any moment.  
</P>
<P>
 About 10 p.m., authorities spoke on the phone to Coates' wife, Donna, who 
managed to escape the condominium 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the SWAT team entered the apartment and arrested Coates while 
he slept in one of the condominium's two bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Coates was taken to Ventura County Jail, where he was held in lieu of $2,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found three rifles, a handgun and a police scanner in the condominium.

CITY OKS LOW-INCOME HOUSING LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer planning to build 70 houses for low-income Simi Valley families 
has been approved for a $700,000 loan from the city to help fund the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council agreed to the loan to help Griffin Industries pay 
the cost of including the low-cost units in a 280-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The development would be built on 26.7 acres at Los Angeles Avenue and Madera 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin plans to set aside 70 three-bedroom units to sell to low-income 
families for about $90,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like a good deal for the city and a good deal for the citizens," 
Councilman Bill Davis said. "We'll be watching closely to make sure it remains 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin had originally asked for a $1-million loan, but city officials balked, 
saying they did not want to commit so much money to one project. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is expected to apply soon for a permit to draft development plans, 
which would be reviewed by the Planning Commission and the council. SARA

CITY TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD HOMELESS SHELTER PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council agreed Tuesday to contribute $8,000 toward the 
creation of a regional homeless shelter, reinforcing the council's new policy 
that it can't cure homelessness on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members offered the money to a countywide housing and homeless 
coalition as part of a series of steps to reduce homelessness and help homeless 
people become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Those priorities include continuing efforts to develop low-cost housing and 
finding ways to give the homeless access to employment training and other 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless and housing coalition, made up of volunteers from throughout the 
county, will soon begin a study to determine how and where a regional shelter 
could be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan recognizes the fact that homelessness . . . is a regional issue and 
needs a regional solution and approach," Housing Director Sal Gonzales told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, Oxnard's efforts to aid the homeless have consisted largely 
of helping the financially troubled Zoe Christian Center pay its bills. The 
center, once the county's only year-round shelter for homeless families, closed 
its doors for good last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In January of last year, the council agreed to draft a new policy broadening 
those efforts, including taking a comprehensive, regional approach to the 
problem of Oxnard's homeless. FRED ALVAREZ

SIMI VALLEY OKS CONTRACT FOR ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The transformation of an old Simi Valley church into a cultural arts center 
will begin in two weeks, more than 10 years after advocates for the arts 
launched a battle to build a theater in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief but contentious debate, the Simi Valley City Council voted 3 to 
2 to award a $2.55-million construction contract to a Van Nuys building firm to 
convert the 1920s church into a 300-seat theater. The city has set aside the 
entire cost from community development funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monday night meeting, Councilwoman Sandi Webb reiterated her 
longstanding opposition to the project, saying taxpayer dollars should be spent 
on a new police station instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until I see the paperwork for the police station funding, I am going to hold 
off on this," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Webb was speaking, Councilman Bill Davis angrily burst in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are wrong," Davis said. "This project is not taking money from the police 
station and you shouldn't be talking about something you don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has set aside $4 million in community development funds to help fund 
construction of a new police station within the next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said the city expects to raise the rest of the estimated 
$12-million to $15-million cost of a police station through developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton and Councilwoman Judy Mikels voted in favor of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Barbara Williamson joined Webb in voting against the project, 
saying it should be funded by private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Mikels, an ardent arts center supporter, let out an elated 
whoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't normally do that," Mikels said. "But it's been 10 years of hard 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeling of the church, at 3050 Los Angeles Ave., is expected to begin 
later this month and to be completed by February. SARA CATANIA

<P>
 A Moorpark man has qualified as a write-in candidate in the race for Ventura 
County's 4th District supervisorial seat held by Vicky Howard, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Kalemkarian, who could not be reached for comment, will be the fourth 
candidate competing in the June 7 election.The other candidates are Simi Valley 
Council members Barbara Williamson and Judy Mikels and Moorpark Councilman 
Scott Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simi Valley parks official James Meredith dropped out of the 
supervisor's race last month, his name will still appear on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalemkarian, a 35-year-old Republican, collected the more than two dozen voter 
signatures needed to qualify as a write-in candidate, said Jenny Harrison, a 
county elections official. Kalemkarian's name will not appear on the ballot, 
but voters supporting him can simply fill out a form with his name, Harrison 
said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PRICE CLUB TO SEEK OK FOR NEW STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to keep potential customers from leaving the city to shop, the Price 
Club will ask the Planning Commission tonight to approve plans for a 
135,000-square-foot store on a 10-acre plot in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of sales tax leakage because we don't have a store like this 
in Simi Valley," said Laura Kuhn, a deputy city planner."Hopefully, this will 
be a step toward bringing sales-tax revenue back to our city." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which would be the first of its kind in the city, faced little 
opposition when brought before the Neighborhood Council earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found there to be a lot of support for this kind of store here," said Mike 
Antoun, chairman of Neighborhood Council No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The store would be built in an industrial area where Madera Road meets the 
Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the neighborhood group did express concerns about potential traffic 
increases, members agreed to support the project as long it included a 
condition to monitor traffic for six months and correct problems that arose, 
Antoun said. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff also recommended that the Planning Commission approve the project, 
although it disagreed with the company over the design of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials pushed for a less expensive design that would leave structures 
on the building's roof exposed, while the city asked that the building be 
constructed to mask air-conditioning and other units from view.  
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be held at 7 p.m. today at Simi Valley City Hall, 2929 
Tapo Canyon Road. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL BACKS LIMITS ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To applause from some anti-pornography activists, the Ventura City Council 
approved a law this week banning adult-oriented businesses from all but the 
city's industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the measure 6 to 1 Monday night.Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson opposed it because he felt some of the ordinance's language was vague 
and could allow "local citizens to be little vigilantes" in fighting all forms 
of nudity and obscenity around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will have to vote on the ordinance again next week before it 
becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would prohibit adult-oriented businesses from operating within 200 
feet of each other and within 500 feet of a church, school, residence or other 
place where children might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Rose, a Ventura man who said he used to work in the pornography industry, 
applauded the council for approving the restrictions but asked that it consider 
prohibiting such businesses entirely in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney has warned the council against doing so because it is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-3 vote, council members also asked city planners to consider crafting a 
law prohibiting churches, schools and other structures frequented by children 
from locating within 500 feet of a pre-existing adult business. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Jim Monahan and Jack Tingstrom and Mayor Tom Buford opposed 
the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar action, the Santa Paula City Council on Monday enacted an urgency 
ordinance that effectively blocks adult businesses from opening in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent inquiry about opening an adult business in Santa Paula prompted City 
Atty. Phillip H. Romney to recommend that the council give him 45 days to draft 
permanent amendments to the existing law, which he said was legally deficient.

AHMANSON RANCH GRANTED APPROVAL FOR ROAD EXTENSION; DEVELOPMENT: SUITS MUST BE 
RESOLVED BEFORE THE THOUSAND OAKS BOULEVARD CAN CROSS INTO THE COUNTY. BOTH 
SIDES CLAIM A VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hearing officer Tuesday granted the developer of the giant Ahmanson Ranch 
housing development permission to extend the Los Angeles County portion of 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard across the Ventura County line, but not until several 
lawsuits against the project are resolved.  
</P>
<P>
 The ruling left both opponents and supporters of the project claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased," said Steve Weston, an attorney for the Ahmanson Land Ranch 
Co., which wants to build 3,050 dwellings, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space southeast of Simi Valley near the border of Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a road to nowhere at this point," countered Steve Craig, the 
environmental coordinator for the city of Calabasas, which has joined the city 
and county of Los Angeles in filing lawsuits against the project. "This 
approval has no significance because the developer can't build anything and 
can't use it in court to show that progress has been made on the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including the environmental group, Save Our Space, said they may 
appeal Tuesday's decision by Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning 
hearing officer Ray Ristic to the Regional Planning Commission. "If this 
project goes through, the 101 will become worse than the 405 freeway," said 
Siegfried Othmer, a member of Save Open Space who lives in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief hearing, Ristic gave the Ahmanson company permission to extend 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Mountain Gate Drive in Los Angeles County across 
the Ventura County line, a distance of 1,000 feet. Ristic also approved the 
removal of 10 oak trees, but withheld the permit to do so until the litigation 
is resolved and the developer has gotten a separate permit to grade the road.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits have stalled the controversial Ahmanson development, which was 
approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors more than two years ago on 
the condition that the developer acquire and turn over to state and federal 
park agencies nearly 10,000 acres of mountain land, most of it owned by 
entertainer Bob Hope. Ristic said he was obligated to presume the environmental 
report on the project, also approved by the Ventura panel, is adequate unless 
the courts decide otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Boulevard extension, on the south side of the project, would 
be one of two main entrances to the development. The other, on the east side, 
would link Thousand Oaks Boulevard with Victory Boulevard in Woodland Hills, 
increasing daily vehicle trips on Victory from 1,250 to an estimated 19,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine plaintiffs, including Los Angeles County, sued to reopen the 
environmental review process. But on March 4, a Ventura judge upheld the Board 
of Supervisors' decision and ruled that the development's environmental impact 
report complied with state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County and the cities of Los Angeles and Calabasas plan to appeal 
the court ruling, said Ken Bernstein, an aide to Councilwoman Laura Chick, 
whose west San Fernando Valley district would bear the brunt of the traffic 
increases.

WOMAN, SON DIE IN FIRE DESPITE RESCUE ATTEMPT; SIMI VALLEY: HUSBAND SUFFERS 
THIRD-DEGREE BURNS IN HIS EFFORT TO PULL WIFE AND THEIR CHILD TO SAFETY.

<P>
 Despite her husband's rescue efforts, a Simi Valley woman died with her 
7-year-old son Tuesday when they were unable to escape their burning house, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband, identified as Joseph Booker, 36, suffered third-degree burns on 
his arms while reaching toward a second-floor window for his son, Brandon, 
authorities said. Booker, who had climbed atop the garage roof, tried at least 
twice to reach his son and his wife, Odette, 38, fire officials speculate. 
</P>
<P>
 But he eventually gave up, jumping off the garage roof and hitting a block 
wall as he fell, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County firefighters said they did not find a smoke detector in the 
ruins of the five-bedroom house in the 2800 block of Corto Street. The cause of 
the fire had not been determined, but a preliminary investigation did not show 
any signs of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that if there had been a smoke detector in there, they would not have 
died," fire Investigator Peter Cronk said after examining the charred remains 
of the house. "This is one of those things that slipped through the cracks, and 
this is the result." 
</P>
<P>
 Odette and Brandon Booker died after breathing smoke and carbon monoxide 
fumes, Ventura County Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said.

<P>
 "We found them collapsed close to the window where the mother was attempting 
to give the child to the father," Isaac said. "She was holding the boy in her 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Booker was in critical condition at the burn center at Sherman Oaks 
Community Hospital late Tuesday. He suffered burns over 25% to 30% of his body, 
primarily to his head and arms, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another son, Mathis Booker, 18, was not home when the fire broke out in the 
living room, authorities said. Police said they were trying to locate him 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said they found the house fully engulfed in flames after 
neighbors notified authorities at 2:21 a.m. Tuesday. Thirty-six firefighters 
fought the blaze for about 30 minutes before bringing it under control, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who were evacuated from nearby homes said they did not hear any 
smoke alarms and were not aware there was a fire until they were awakened by 
the sound of breaking glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a Ventura County ordinance passed in June, 1982, all property owners 
must install and maintain smoke detectors in houses, said County Assistant Fire 
Marshal Kevin Nestor. Since the law passed, fire officials have inspected all 
houses built in Ventura County after June, 1982, for smoke detectors, but 
Nestor said fire officials have not been able to inspect all houses built 
before 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the ordinance carries a maximum $500 fine and imprisonment for up 
to six months, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law passed in 1991 requires that all new houses have smoke detectors 
in hallways and in each bedroom, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors estimated that the Bookers had rented the house for about 18 years. 
According to 1993 property tax records, the house was built in 1963. A Simi 
Valley woman listed as the owner did not return phone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the family said they were surprised to hear the Bookers 
apparently did not have a smoke detector. 
</P>
<P>
 They described the couple as a responsible pair who kept candles ready for 
blackouts and other emergencies, and had jumper cables ready at a neighbor's 
request. They trimmed their landscaping and painted the house on a regular 
basis, neighbors said. Among their charred belongings, fire officials found 
pamphlets about earthquake preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very kind people," said Anna Schmidt, who lives across the street 
from the family. "They came over and brought candles to see how we were during 
a blackout. They checked on us after the (Jan. 17) earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers of the couple also described both as well-liked and responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Odette Booker worked as a customer service representative for Pru Care of 
California, a subsidiary of the Prudential insurance company. She was elected 
employee of the month in November, 1992, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Booker is employed by Simi Valley-based Bugle Boy, a clothing 
manufacturer. He works in the mail room and is popular throughout the company, 
officials said. Neighbors said Booker enjoyed playing baseball with Brandon, 
who was in Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they suspect many Ventura County residents have failed to 
install smoke detectors or neglect to check them regularly. Nationwide, an 
estimated 90% of homes in the United States have smoke detectors, but about 
one-third of them do not work because the batteries are old or were never 
installed, said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that homes with smoke alarms have death rates 40% less than homes 
without, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives people time to get out," Wells said. "This family had no time to get 
out. The fire had already reached them."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; UNSUNG EXCELLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the lesser-known offices on the June ballot is that of public 
administrator, a county position in which the incumbent, William A. Baker, has 
done a good job and served the public well. 
</P>
<P>
 The public administrator is assigned by judges to administer the estates of 
those who die without wills or known heirs.The office also helps administer the 
estates when those who stand to inherit request help. 
</P>
<P>
 Few voters know of the public administrator's office. That has not always been 
the case: About 30 years ago Orange County's public administrator was convicted 
of embezzlement and sent to prison. It's a position requiring someone who can 
be trusted to work in the people's interest out of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 The post of public administrator is one of three county jobs held by Baker, 
but it is the only one for which he must face the voters. The Board of 
Supervisors appointed him as head of the county Community Services Agency and 
as public guardian, who acts as conservator of the affairs of the mentally ill. 
These jobs pose no conflict, and he appears to have done all of them well. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was an accountant and staffer in the county administrative office before 
becoming public administrator in 1985, experience that has served him well. He 
wisely has used a combined accounting staff for the public guardian and public 
administrator jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of Baker's opponents has experience in estates, accounting or a 
position of fiduciary responsibility. Baker deserves reelection.

RUSSO DENIES LOCKING GIRL IN SPORTS COURT BATHROOM; TRIAL: WESTLAKE WOMAN 
CHARGED WITH CHILD ABUSE SAYS THAT HER DAUGHTER LIED, STOLE AND DISOBEYED 
ORDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soft-spoken but anxious to tell her story, Charlotte Russo denied on the 
witness stand Tuesday that she punched, pinched, bit or locked her teen-age 
daughter in a bathroom of a racquetball court outside their posh Westlake home. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying for the first time during her four-week trial on child abuse 
charges, the 52-year-old Russo described her daughter as a problem child who 
lied, stole and refused to follow her parents' commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo, who broke down in tears at one point during her three hours of 
testimony, also said the girl went out of her way to be noticed and often acted 
up at family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always had to be the center of attention," said Russo, adding that her 
daughter had as many problems in school as she did at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother acknowledged that she tried to rein the girl in by slapping her in 
the face. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, that only occurred when the girl "mouthed off." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said she and her husband, Richard, often tried to get the girl to behave 
by leaving her out of family vacations. They also required her to do extra 
chores when she received bad school grades or acted up.  
</P>
<P>
 But Russo maintained that she was only acting out of motherly love and not to 
be mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 By April of last year, her daughter was having trouble adhering to her 
salt-free diet, Russo testified. She said the girl would wait until other 
family members went to bed and then make popcorn or eat an entire jar of 
pickles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Richard Russo banned the girl from the family's nine-bedroom 
house at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband said, 'I can't trust you in here anymore,' " Russo testified on 
direct examination from defense attorney James M. Farley. " 'There's only one 
thing left to do: Go out and sleep in the racquetball court.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Russo denied locking her daughter in the racquetball court bathroom, as 
prosecutors and the girl have alleged in court. And she said the girl was 
provided the necessities for a good night's sleep, including a sleeping bag, 
blankets and pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo has served 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to one count of 
misdemeanor child abuse in the case. He was not in the courtroom Tuesday as his 
wife testified. 
</P>
<P>
 She is charged with one count each of felony child abuse and misdemeanor child 
abuse. The charges state that Charlotte Russo bit the girl once on the forearm 
and locked her in the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo testified that the girl had severe heart trouble when she and her 
husband adopted the child at age 1. The child, now 16, has had five heart 
surgeries, Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing anxious to tell her story, Russo often drifted into long detail on 
questions requiring a simple "yes" or "no" answer. One of her responses 
prompted Superior Court Judge Charles R. Campbell to admonish her against such 
elaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Russo began to cry when answering questions. She said she gave 
her daughter more attention than she gave her other six children. 
</P>
<P>
 During her testimony, the girl said she was scratched, pinched, slapped, 
bitten and punched by her mother. The girl also said she was locked in the 
bathroom for long periods of time, on some occasions a week or more, as a form 
of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo acknowledged that she once grabbed the girl's face when she 
lied about a math test. The incident occurred as the two of them were sitting 
at the family's kitchen table, along with Richard Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reached across the table with my left hand," the mother conceded. "Using my 
thumb and index finger, I squeezed her cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at La Reina High School, where the girl was attending summer school, 
noticed the bruise and reported it to authorities. A sheriff's deputy and 
social worker went to the home, but decided against trying to remove the girl 
from the custody of her parents, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl also testified that she was forced to eat the same meal three times a 
day -- either peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or oatmeal with raw eggs and 
water from a faucet. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said she did require the girl to eat a special diet that included 
oatmeal three times daily. But she denied putting raw eggs in it, as the girl 
alleged, and said the girl was allowed to heat meals in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the girl was fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for one week 
straight after she was caught shoplifting and told the grocery store manager 
that her parents made her eat such sandwiches regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, Russo testified, a form of punishment to teach the girl not to lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo told the jury that she was so adamant about the girl's diet because salt 
caused her daughter's feet to swell. 
</P>
<P>
 As for sleeping in the racquetball court, the girl was only required to do 
that for a few nights at a time at first, the mother said. But Richard Russo, 
50, made that a permanent arrangement after the girl did not improve her school 
grades by March, 1993, Russo testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband just said 'You stay out there all the time,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the girl was given complete access to the main house during the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she said the girl had become such a problem that she and her 
husband began looking for other places for their daughter to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russos were arrested May 24, 1993, after neighbors reported seeing the 
girl being physically abused by her mother. Russo said that plans had been made 
to send the girl to live with Richard Russo's sister prior to the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo will continue testifying this morning under direct examination and be 
cross-examined by Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona.

 Bobby Rahal knows he and Honda teammate Mike Groff will almost certainly be 
bumped from the Indy 500 field, so he has come up with a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are bumped, Rahal and Groff will use 1993 Penske-Ilmor cars to try to 
get back into the field.They were originally entered by Roger Penske in case 
his Mercedes engine program ran into problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal tested one of the cars Tuesday and went 222.833 m.p.h., faster than he 
has run all month in his Honda-powered Lola. Groff will test his car Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was smiling today for the first time since I got here," said Rahal, who was 
bumped from the field last year on the final day.

 Adrian Fernandez, the second-fastest rookie in the 500, has his sights set on 
winning rookie-of-the-year honors for the Galles Racing International team. It 
would be the fifth such honor for the 29-year-old driver from Mexico City. 
Fernandez was top rookie in 1982 in the Mexico Formula Vee series, in 1983 in 
the Mexico Formula Ford series, in 1984 in the Mexico Formula K series and in 
1992 in the Firestone Indy Lights series.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: UC RIVERSIDE STUMBLES INTO TOURNAMENT 
</P>

 UC Riverside's baseball team stumbled into good fortune last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing five of their last eight games to finish third in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Conference with an 18-12 record, the Highlanders 
are in the enviable position of playing host to the Division II NCAA West 
Regional starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo tied for first place at 
19-11, but Dominguez Hills was awarded the title because of its 4-2 record 
against Cal Poly SLO this season. 
</P>
<P>
 As the CCAA champion, Dominguez Hills received an automatic invitation to the 
NCAA West Regional, which also includes the Northern California Athletic 
Conference champion (UC Davis), the CCAA champion and an at-large team -- 
frequently the CCAA runner-up because of the conference's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't make the outlook promising for third-place UC Riverside, because 
Cal Poly SLO (32-20) seemed to have the inside track for the at-large berth. 
But the NCAA, considering UC Riverside's strong schedule and better overall 
record (38-18), chose the Highlanders instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of UC Riverside ensured that the West Regional would be 
conducted by a Southern California school so that only one team would have to 
travel by air instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills' field has a pleasant, park-like atmosphere, but the NCAA 
chose UC Riverside's stadium-like facility and higher financial bid. 
</P>
<P>
 So Dominguez Hills (38-17) will play top-seeded UC Davis (43-10) at 1 p.m. 
Thursday, and UC Riverside will meet the loser of that game at 7 p.m. The 
double-elimination tournament continues Friday with UC Riverside playing the 
winner of Thursday's first game. Then at 7, the two teams that have not lost 
twice will play. There will be a 1 p.m. game Saturday if needed.  
</P>

 Redlands won the first Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
women's water polo championship. It was also the first conference championship 
in the nation for the fledgling sport. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 20 schools that offer women's water polo as a varsity sport -- 
nine in California -- but the SCIAC is the only conference that awards a title. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the SCIAC's eight schools competed in the first season, with the 
championship being determined in a tournament two weeks ago. The other 
participating schools were Whittier, Occidental, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and 
Pomona-Pitzer. Redlands won all four tournament games to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased," Redlands Coach Tom Whittemore said. "But as gratifying as 
it is, hopefully it will have a longer impact in terms of organization and 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Whittemore, who also coached the men's team to a conference 
championship this season, some SCIAC schools have been playing each other in 
women's water polo for close to two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the growing number of participants and the lobbying of 
Pomona-Pitzer Coach Penny Dean, the SCIAC decided to make it a varsity sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Penny Dean has to get the credit -- she spearheaded the whole thing," 
Whittemore said. "There are other factors: U.S. Water Polo sponsored the vast 
majority of games and tournaments, the history of our conference playing each 
other for so long at a club level, and lastly, the coaches were already 
established as men's coaches or swim coaches. It used to be, when I first 
started six years ago, that a player from the men's team might be coaching the 
women's club team. It's not like that at all now." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittemore said his recruiting tactics have changed from merely coming across 
female water polo players to now actively seeking them out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some concern that Division I schools, such as Stanford, California 
and UCLA, will dilute the talent pool at the Division III level. UC San Diego 
also competes in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whittemore does not expect that to happen because of U.S. Water Polo's 
involvement in the growth of the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we're getting to a point where there are more and more players," 
he said. "There is no doubt that some of the highly developed players are going 
to be offered scholarships (to Division I schools), so we'll have to adjust. 
Some of the Division I teams already had club programs, so we were kind of 
recruiting against them anyway. But I'm encouraged. I see more women in the 
pool." 
</P>
<P>
 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont tied Point Loma Nazarene for the Golden State Athletic Conference 
baseball title and has been selected as the site of the NAIA District III 
tournament. If that sounds familiar, it's because Westmont has played host to 
every District III championship event this season that was not conducted at a 
neutral site -- men's and women's soccer, women's volleyball, men's and women's 
tennis, men's and women's track and field, and baseball. Men's and women's 
cross-country, and men's basketball were held at neutral sites. Westmont won at 
least a share of the District III championship in men's and women's soccer, 
women's tennis, men's basketball and women's cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona-Pitzer freshman Claire Turchi won the NCAA Division III women's tennis 
title Monday at Kalamazoo College in Michigan. . . .Pomona-Pitzer sophomore 
Emiliano Escandon was selected as the SCIAC baseball player of the year. He is 
the first Pomona-Pitzer player and the first sophomore at any school to be 
voted the award. Escandon batted .484 with six home runs and 32 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran won the SCIAC golf championship, and Redlands' Ron Stockton was 
voted the conference's player of the year. . . .Cal Lutheran took the SCIAC 
softball title with a 29-8 overall record, 23-1 in the conference, but was 
ranked sixth in the NCAA West Region and was not invited to the NCAA playoffs. 
. . .In track and field, the Claremont-Mudd men's team and the Occidental 
women's team were undefeated in conference dual meets and won the conference 
championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Los Angeles won the men's and women's track and field titles in the 
CCAA meet last Saturday.

PREP WEDNESDAY: SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFF PREVIEW; DIVISION I AT A 
GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defending Champion: Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: Fountain Valley (22-3-1), Lakewood (20-6), Nogales (19-6), El 
Dorado (18-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Mater Dei (16-8-1). The Monarchs have pitching, pitching, 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Bryan Barber (Nogales), Brian Bowles (Peninsula), Matt Carrera 
(Diamond Bar), Craig Daedelow (Huntington Beach), Brad Farlow (Encino Crespi), 
Luke Fitzpatrick (Lakewood), Ryan Fullerton (El Toro), Brian Greene (Servite), 
Ryan Hankins (Simi Valley), Adam Harris (Mater Dei), Mike Hessman (Mater Dei), 
Danny Hoppie (Fountain Valley), Steve Immel (Lakewood), Don Jamieson (El 
Dorado), Corey Martin (Lakewood), George Martinez (Nogales), Erik Mattern 
(Mater Dei), Jeff Moore (El Dorado), Jason Murrietta (Esperanza), Johnny 
Olivares (Channel Islands), Paul Orabona (Fontana), Jim Parque (La Crescenta 
Crescenta Valley), Chris Ponchak (Fountain Valley), Dave Rojo (Katella), Jeff 
Schultz (Long Beach Wilson), Jaret Wright (Katella), Deric Yanagisawa (Fountain 
Valley), Pete Zamora (Capistrano Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Fountain Valley. The teams standing between the Barons and the 
semifinals are living on reputation this season (Esperanza, Long Beach 
Millikan, Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Lakewood. The Lancers won the always-tough Moore League and, as a 
reward, find themselves in the same bracket as Katella and Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Right off the bat, Fountain Valley players must know that the 
top-seeded team has not won this division since Lakewood in 1970. Simi Valley 
came close last season but lost to Esperanza in the final. . . Katella's Wright 
(7-2, 2.99 ERA, 100 SO) remains the pitcher that scouts oooh and aaaah over, 
but the division has many other strong arms. Crescenta Valley's Parque (8-2) 
has struck out 107. Mater Dei's Harris has given up five earned runs and has a 
no-hitter and two one-hitters. Fitzpatrick (8-1, 1.00 ERA) and Immel (7-1, 1.40 
ERA) give Lakewood two effective starters. Fountain Valley's Ponchak (6-2, 1.88 
ERA, six saves) has developed into an outstanding closer.

Paraclete), Danny Siratt (Lake Isabella Kern Valley), Shane Sullivan (Serrano), 
Jason Sutherland (Big Bear), Greg Wells (Baptist), Jake Williams (Brentwood), 
Lance Williams (Cerritos Valley Christian), Cory Woodman (Coast Union), Ed 
Zieman (Whittier Christian). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Serrano. Seems like clear sailing into semifinals. A very weak 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Baptist. Top-seeded team has to get past Brentwood and Coast Union 
(17-3) just to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Serrano's Sullivan and Big Bear's Halamicek are the two best all-around 
players in the division. Sullivan is hitting .488 with 11 home runs and 25 
RBIs. As a pitcher, he is 5-0 with a 2.24 ERA and 59 strikeouts. Halamicek is 
hitting .473 with seven home runs and 38 RBIs. As a pitcher, he is 9-1 with a 
1.00 ERA and 85 strikeouts. . . . What makes Serrano a better team is Anderson, 
who is 9-2 with a 2.77 ERA and 77 strikeouts. . . . Baptist doesn't have the 
marquee names, but the Knights are a solid team from top to bottom, which is 
why they are top-seeded. . . . Paraclete has 11 victories, O'Gara has won six 
and saved three. . . . Templeton has several solid hitters, led by Bergman 
(.500, 6 HR, 26 RBIs), but pitching has held the Eagles back this season.

ROUNDUP; CENTURY WITHSTANDS IRVINE'S LATE RALLIES TO ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Century got its first baseball playoff victory Tuesday by beating Irvine, 3-2, 
in a Southern Section Division III wild-card game at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions (17-8) took a 3-0 lead and thwarted a pair of late-inning 
Irvine rallies -- thanks to the pitching of Christian Duran (6-2) -- to advance 
to Friday's first-round game at West Torrance High.Irvine finished its season 
16-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Duran's) done well for us all year," Century Coach Rick Hayes said. "Today 
he really competed. When the score was 3-2, he really came back and battled." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran struck out two, walked one and gave up 10 hits, including five doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine rallied in the sixth inning when Eric Sobek doubled to right center and 
scored on Mike Walas' second double of the game. Walas took third on Eric 
Sonnenberg's sacrifice but was stranded when Centurion center fielder Alejandro 
Huizar caught Geoff Noisy's sinking liner and Matt Ward grounded out to first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros closed the gap to 3-2 in the seventh after Ethan Gragnano doubled 
and scored on two outfield flies. Shaun Wooley singled and moved into scoring 
position on Duran's wild pitch, but Eric Sobek flied to center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's hopes suffered in the fourth when Sonnenberg doubled to center with 
one out, overran second and was tagged in a rundown. Noisy reached first on an 
infield hit, but Duran got Ward to pop up to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran singled in the game's first run in the first inning. Ramiro Torres' 
run-scoring double in the first and Alejandro Huizar's run-scoring single in 
the third staked the Centurions to a 3-0 lead. TOM BIRSCHBACH

<P>
 Defending Champion: Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: Redondo Beach Redondo Union (21-4), Newhall Hart (19-5), Moreno 
Valley Valley View (19-4), Covina Northview (20-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Canyon (20-5). The Comanches are hitting a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Scott Albin (Redondo Union), Jimmie Bowen (Riverside North), Matt 
Brady (Villa Park), Mike Brambilla (Brea-Olinda), George Castillo (Cerritos 
Gahr), Mike Cosgrove (Cerritos), Kris Didion (Riverside Poly), Chris Draft 
(Valencia), Keith Ginter (Fullerton), Ryan Golisano (Fullerton), Josh Gutierrez 
(Canyon), Josh Hochgesang (Sunny Hills), Tony Jackson (Valley View), Brian 
Logan (Troy), Motne MacGillisray (Valley View), Aaron Myers (Santa Maria 
Righetti), Rick Parmenter (Troy), Bob Platt (Northview), Jeff Pickler 
(Foothill), Domonek Prince (Redondo Union), Steve Rawson (Redondo Union), Vince 
Roman (Oxnard Rio Mesa), Ambro Salas (Cerritos), John Salter (LaVerne Damien), 
Luis Sanchez (Hart), Jeremy Seipel (Hart), Peter Sousa (Lompoc), John Stoddard 
(Brea-Olinda), Gunnar Strunz (Canyon), Casey Wilson (Canyon). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Hart. Nothing but weak second- and third-place teams and a couple 
of so-so league champions on the way to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Northview. The fourth-seeded team opens with an underachieving 
Troy team, which is looking to salvage its season. And out there waiting is 
Canyon in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Redondo Union seems to have everything needed to win the title. The Sea 
Hawks have pitching in Albin (8-0, 2.15 ERA, 82 SO), power in Rawson (10 HR, 32 
RBIs) and hitting in Prince (.442) and Morgan Ensberg (.441) . . . The Sea 
Hawks could be severely tested in the second round, as they may have to travel 
to play Lompoc. A nasty drive, plus waiting will be pitcher/infielder Peter 
Sousa (5-2, .389 BA, 4 HR, 23 RBIs) . . . Fullerton's Ginter set the Orange 
County career home run record on March 30, then didn't hit another home run 
until May 10, when he hit three against Buena Park. He has 26 career home runs 
and five this season.

 Defending Champion: Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Teams: La Puente Bishop Amat (25-0), La Quinta (23-3), Palm Desert (21- 
3-1), Tustin (21-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark Horse: Corona. The Panthers have some punch. If the pitching comes 
around, look out. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Players: Richard Aguirre (Bellflower St. John Bosco), Derek Baker 
(Tustin), Brian Butcher (Lakewood Mayfair), Jose Cabrerra (Estancia), Chris 
Clark (Kennedy), Mike Darr (Corona), Joe Garcia (La Quinta), David Glick 
(Palmdale), Jeff Hallock (La Mirada), Dan Harkey (Lakewood Mayfair), Brian

(Ontario Chaffey), Ryan Schmidt (Alta Loma), Chris Tapia (Lancaster Antelope 
Valley), Eric Valenzuela (Bishop Amat), Ryan Winmill (Tustin), Jim Yates (West 
Torrance), Tony Zuniga (Saddleback). 
</P>
<P>
 Best Draw: Corona. Not much standing in the way of the Panthers and a shot at 
third-seeded Palm Desert in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst Draw: Palm Desert. The Aztecs get a gimme in the first round, then will 
probably beat a solid La Mirada team and Corona to get to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Bishop Amat, behind the pitching of Miranda (7-0, 0.17 ERA) and 
Valenzuela (10-0, 0.73 ERA), has been the class of this division since the 
season began. The Lancers opened with three consecutive shutouts and have 
closed even stronger, giving up only four runs in the last nine games. Seven of 
those were shutouts . . . La Quinta has also been streaking lately, but will 
need a big playoff from Livernois . . . Corona has the division's most 
dangerous duo in Darr (.513, 8 HR, 39 RBIs) and Hurtado (.419, 6 HR, 34 RBIs) . 
. . Take away the three Del Rey loses to Bishop Amat and St. John Bosco is 
18-3. The Braves also extended the Lancers in the season finale, losing, 9-3, 
in extra innings.

HUNTINGTON BEACH SWEEPS PAST MIRA COSTA IN BOYS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Beach eliminated Manhattan Beach Mira Costa from the Division I 
boys' volleyball playoffs for the third consecutive season with a 15-6, 15-10, 
15-12 second-round sweep Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion Oilers (18-2) relied on a sturdy block and outstanding 
back-row defense to wear down Mira Costa (15-5), which has only one senior on 
its team. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach advances to play fourth-seeded North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake in the quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors sparked the Oilers. Mike Grave led the attack with 16 kills and 
Nick Ziegler had 15 kills and eight blocks. Brad Simons had seven blocks and 
setter Josh Moss had 44 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to get it going right now," Grave said. "We have been in a bit of a 
slump since we lost to Laguna Beach (on May 2)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, ranked fifth in Division I, needed a fourth game to get past 
Irvine in the first round, but were in command from the start, never trailing 
by more than three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach scored nine consecutive points in the first game after it was 
tied, 4-4, then scored six of the last seven points in the second game after 
10th-ranked Mira Costa evened the score, 9-9. In the final game, the Oilers 
fought back from a 10-7 deficit and ended the match with a Ziegler block. DAN

SOUTHERN SECTION VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFF ROUNDUP; ARTISTS ESCAPE FROM DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a good reason why nobody in Orange County wanted to play Dana Hills 
in the playoffs, and Tuesday, the Dolphins pushed second-seeded Laguna Beach 
within one point of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Artists fought off two match points and outlasted Dana Hills to win, 
16-14, in the fifth game of a second-round Southern Section Division I boys' 
volleyball playoff match at Dana Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach's Dan Styles had 27 kills, and combined with Trevor Whalley to 
block Bob Hefty for match point in the 11-15, 17-15, 15-6, 15-17, 16-14 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Beau Bianchi, who had 23 kills, spiked for a side out with Laguna Beach 
trailing 14-13, and a net violation by Hefty gave the Artists another side out 
when the Dolphins were serving at another match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Styles spiked for a point to tie it, 14-14, and Szilard Kovacs blocked Jeremy 
Darner to make it 15-14 and set up the match-winning block. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (17-1) will play Santa Barbara in the the quarterfinals Friday. 
Dana Hills finished 12-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was our best match of the year," Dana Hills Coach Oz Simmons 
said, "so I think we can handle losing this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the match, it looked like Laguna Beach would be looking for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Darner had seven of his match-high 31 kills in the first game to help Dana 
Hills grab a 12-4 lead before finally winning the game, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Hewko (27 kills) and Hefty (19 kills, seven blocks) helped Dana Hills 
open an 11-4 lead in Game 2 before things started to go sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills led 14-8 before the Artists rallied behind Styles and Kovacs, who 
had 15 kills and four blocks. Laguna Beach won nine of the last 10 points to 
win Game 2, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a streaky game," Laguna Beach Coach Michael Soylular said. "I just 
wanted our guys to stay mentally focused down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Bianchi had five kills in Game 3, helping the Artists win easily, 15-6. Then 
Laguna Beach took an 8-1 lead in Game 4 and were poised to close out the match. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dana Hills fought back and won 13 of the next 14 points. Matt Clem, who 
had nine kills and nine blocks, blocked Whalley to give Dana Hills new life 
with a 17-15 victory in Game 4, but the Dolphins came up a point short. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I matches: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 3, Corona del Mar 0 -- Host El Toro, the top-seeded team, won, 15-8, 
15-6, 15-6. The Chargers (16-1) advance to play Palos Verdes Peninsula Friday.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FRONT OFFICE AWARE OF POOR TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angel front office might have been convinced it made the right move 
Tuesday in firing Manager Buck Rodgers, but officials braced themselves for the 
public's bashing. They already have been compared to the Clippers, and firing 
their manager one day after the Clippers fired Coach Bob Weiss, well . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It does fuel it," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We considered that 
for a few minutes. But does that make it right because if fuels scrutiny in the 
media? We realize we're not taking the safe route, and I realize I'll take some 
scrutiny, which is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels shook up their coaching staff after Rodgers' firing: Bobby Knoop, 
who will be the interim manager through Wednesday, will be moved from first 
base to the bench coach; Max Oliveras will be moved from the bullpen to become 
the first-base coach; and Joe Maddon, formerly the minor league director of 
player development, becomes the bullpen coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there was elation among the Angel pitching staff for the return of 
Marcel Lachemann, Marlin closer Bryan Harvey was not pleased. "I'm not real 
happy about this," Harvey said. "I'm happy for Marcel, but it really hurts us. 
He's been everything to me. This is the first time I'll be without him, so it 
really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, who's on the disabled list, was scheduled to pick up Lachemann at the 
Miami airport late Tuesday night and drive him to his home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel veteran starter John Farrell, whom Rodgers was pushing to be on his 
pitching staff weeks ago, will join the Angels today when they purchase his 
contract. The Angels will make room for him on the roster by placing reliever 
Scott Lewis on the 15-day disabled list with a strained neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell was 4-4 with a 3.25 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver with four 
complete games and a shutout. He will start Thursday in place of Mark Leiter, 
who has been moved to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are expected to call up Russ Springer, perhaps by the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox leadoff hitter Tim Raines, who was managed by Rodgers in Montreal, 
had the displeasure of seeing Rodgers fired twice in one career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate, surprising," Raines said, "I don't understand it. I talked 
to him (Monday), and it seemed to me like everything was going pretty good. 
Next thing I know, they're having a press conference." BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; LASORDA LOOKS BEYOND CURRENT JOB 
</P>

 Manager Tom Lasorda said he was "absolutely shocked" when he heard Buck 
Rodgers was fired. Lasorda, who has managed the Dodgers for 18 seasons, has the 
longest tenure among managers. But Lasorda says he has given some thought to 
what he would like to do when Dodger President Peter O'Malley changes the 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two things I would like to do, but only if I'm not managing" 
Lasorda said. "I would love to coach the Olympic baseball team because I would 
like to win a gold medal for this country. The other thing I would like to do 
is go all over Southern California looking at all the high school baseball 
players. Then I would like to take 30 of the best I see and go to their parents 
and say, 'How would you like your son to play for me?' We would play a 60-game 
schedule in the summer against other American Legion teams and I would work 
with them all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 But wouldn't Lasorda, who has worked for the Dodgers for 45 years, prefer to 
work in another capacity for the Dodgers? "Well, yeah, but I can't say I want 
somebody's job," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcaster Vin Scully realized quickly he erred when he told Lasorda that 
Orel Hershiser had been his golf partner on Tuesday. Lasorda, who doesn't let 
his players play golf on the road, immediately fined Hershiser $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Orel tells me he's giving me a check for $1,000, because he's playing 
three more times on this trip," Lasorda said.

 Raul Mondesi leads the league with nine outfield assists, already placing him 
among some of the notable L.A. Dodger outfielders. Frank Howard has the record 
with 19 during the 1962 season, Willie Davis had 16 in 1963-64, Reggie Smith 
had 15 in 1980 and Cory Snyder had 14 last season. . . . Ramon Martinez, who 
left Monday's game with lower back stiffness, was still sore Tuesday but 
believes he will be able to make his next start on Saturday against the 
Cincinnati Reds. . . . Jose Offerman suffered a mild strain in his upper back 
during batting practice and was replaced by Snyder to start the game. Offerman, 
who has started all but three games this season, was unhappy with the decision 
to rest him, and brooded in the clubhouse. . . . Todd Worrell threw on the side 
for the third time Tuesday and said he doesn't know if he will be activated on 
Friday. Worrell, who has been rehabilitating a strained rib-cage muscle, said 
he feels much improved. He will throw again Thursday. MARYANN HUDSON

 Right-handed reliever Edwin Nunez, who gave up three hits and two runs in 
pitching the final two-thirds inning of Oakland's 11-7, 10-inning loss to Texas 
Monday night, was released. Outfielder Ernie Young was called up from double-A 
Huntsville. . . . Boston pitcher Frank Viola, 34, had Tommy John surgery in Los 
Angeles, and is expected to stay here about a week before going home to Florida 
or to Boston to begin rehabilitation. Dr. Frank Jobe performed the 
tendon-transplant surgery on Viola's left elbow to repair a muscle group that

 Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants is scheduled to make a court 
appearance in Riverside today for a hearing regarding an incident in which he 
is accused of threatening a hair salon owner's son. Bonds is not expected to 
miss the Giants' game at Houston tonight. Bonds was born in Riverside and 
members of his family live there. . . . Toronto Blue Jay pitchers Dave Stewart 
and Todd Stottlemyre pleaded innocent to felony charges stemming from a scuffle 
with police outside a Tampa, Fla., nightclub Feb. 20. They were celebrating 
Stewart's 37th birthday when a dispute began, Stewart said, over wearing a 
wristband required by the nightclub to show they were of legal drinking age. . 
. . Cleveland traded right-hander Tom Kramer to the Cincinnati Reds for 
right-hander John Hrusovsky, who was assigned to the Indians' double-A team at 
Canton-Akron.

 Baseball's labor talks resume today in New York after a 1 1/2-month break, but 
union head Donald Fehr doesn't think much will come out of the session. "I have 
no reason to think we're going to get a proposal," Fehr said. "(Management 
negotiator) Dick (Ravitch) told me it would be three or four weeks yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr has said a strike during the second half of the season is possible to 
prevent owners from imposing a salary cap after the World Series. Owners agreed 
to a new revenue-sharing arrangement among themselves on Jan. 18, but made that 
agreement contingent on the players agreeing to a salary cap, which is 
unlikely.

SOUTHERN SECTION TENNIS PLAYOFF ROUNDUP; UNSEEDED WOODBRIDGE SHOWS IT CAN PLAY 
WITH THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Playing with a chip on its shoulder and an eye on Dana Hills, Woodbridge's 
unseeded boys' tennis team easily moved into the second round of the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs with a 13 1/3-7 2/3 victory over Edison Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to prove that we were given a bad rap," said Woodbridge's A.J. 
Thoryk, who felt his team should have been seeded."We wanted to show people 
that we're better than what they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Coach Tim Ball said he didn't have doubts about Woodbridge's talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were playing a good team and that we had to play outstanding 
tennis to beat them," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (15-5) played better than they did last year when they were 
beaten by Woodbridge, 14-4, but not nearly well enough to beat the third-place 
team from the Sea View League. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (16-6) led, 5 2/3-1 1/3, after the first round and never was 
seriously threatened, though Edison did win five of nine doubles sets. Freshman 
Jonny Biorkman and junior Yoshi Suzuki each won three singles sets and freshman 
Reza Farokhpay won two of three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous before the match because I had nothing to go on," 
Woodbridge Coach Joan Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Willett, she has more to go on in Woodbridge's second-round 
match Thursday against third-seeded Dana Hills (20-0). The Warriors were 
trounced by Dana Hills, 17 2/3-3 1/3, in a nonleague match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a huge upset if we beat Dana Hills," Willett said. "But I think 
our chances of winning are good. They had a great day against us the last time 
and other teams in our league have played them close." DAVE McKIBBEN

SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; FRANCE WORKS IN ANTICIPATION OF NEW 32-TEAM CUP 
FIELD IN '98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 France is ready, willing and apparently eager to stage a 32-team World Cup 
tournament in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on whether to expand the event from its 24-team format could be 
made as early as this week, but the France '98 organizing committee already is 
acting as if it's fait accompli.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are now working on the basis of 32 teams," said Fernand Sastre, who, with 
former French star and national coach Michel Platini, is co-president of the 
organizing committee. "We will have to organize 64 matches over a period of 32 
or 33 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference in Saint Denis, near Paris, where an 80,000-seat 
stadium will be built for the tournament, Sastre said a dozen French cities are 
seeking to be World Cup '98 venues and added that eight to 10 will be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint Denis will be the site of the opening game and eight others, including 
one semifinal and the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Platini said the draw for the qualifying rounds will occur in December of 1995 
at the Louvre in Paris. The draw for the finals will be held in Marseille in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If FIFA, world soccer's governing body, does increase the World Cup field to 
32, as expected, Japan and South Korea will be hoping to possibly split the 
2002 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries are bidding strongly for the event and the possibility of 
sharing it was suggested as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 That idea has been shot down by FIFA, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would qualify as hosts? Who would be responsible for security? The 
questions seem endless," said Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA President Joao Havelange has long wanted to stage the 2002 tournament in 
Asia, but said recently that Australia and Colombia also are interested in 
playing host to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has the edge at the moment, but South Korea's campaign is gaining 
attention. Colombia, which was supposed to stage the 1986 World Cup but had to 
bow out and turn the tournament over to Mexico, could not possibly handle a 
32-team event, and Australia's bid is nothing more than a publicity ploy. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 It took Argentine striker Claudio Caniggia less than a game to get embroiled 
in controversy again after a 13-month suspension for cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for his club, AS Roma of Italy, against River Plate of Argentina in 
Buenos Aires last week, Caniggia scored the Italian club's second goal in a 3-1 
victory. But the River Plate players protested furiously, albeit 
unsuccessfully, that Caniggia had used his hand, not his head, in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Caniggia apparently learned nothing during his enforced absence. He sat 
out the 1990 World Cup final in Italy after a blatant handball in Argentina's 
semifinal victory over Italy in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 He and teammate Diego Maradona, also well known for his handballs, will have 
to be watched closely by the referees in next month's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The European Cup next season will feature many of the sport's most famous 
clubs. Those that already have qualified by winning their respective national 
championships include Manchester United of England, Glasgow Rangers of 
Scotland, AEK Athens of Greece, Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands, Anderlecht 
of Belgium, AC Milan of Italy and Bayern Munich of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers won their sixth consecutive title, but the Scottish club still is 
looking for its first European trophy. Among the newcomers in the European Cup 
will be France's champion, Paris St. Germain, which won its first French title 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish championship came down to the last day of the season Sunday, with 
Barcelona winning its fourth consecutive title. Deportivo La Coruna, which had 
needed to win its final game to clinch its first title, was held to a scoreless 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president could have an 
impact on the nation's sporting image, too. Rugby has always been South 
Africa's most popular sport, or at least the one at which it has been most 
successful. Now, soccer could take over. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mandela's first acts on his inauguration day last week was to attend a 
soccer game with his Zambian counterpart, Frederick Chiluba. They were among 
50,000 in Johannesburg who watched South Africa upset Zambia, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa already has been chosen as host country for the African Nations 
Cup in 1997 and has been proposed as a possible World Cup host for 2006. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last of Europe's three cup tournaments ends tonight when AC Milan of Italy 
plays Barcelona of Spain in what could prove to be a classic European Cup Final 
in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 AC Milan, a former winner, lost last season's final to Olympique Marseille of 
France, and Barcelona won the trophy in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Internazionale of Milan, meanwhile, won the UEFA Cup by scoring two 1-0 
victories over Salzburg of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 The European Cup Winners' Cup was won by Arsenal of England, which defeated 
defending champion Parma of Italy, 1-0, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Arsenal became 
only the seventh English club to win the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands, Germany and Italy each announced World Cup rosters without 
much ado. But in Brazil, it was a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was being second-guessed even before the ink was 
dry on the paper. The main problem, it seemed to the Brazilian media, lay in 
midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerson, a member of Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning team and now a television 
analyst, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Parreira) has picked a midfield where the emphasis is too much on players 
who mark (defend) and not enough on players who create. It's a good squad and 
I'm optimistic, but it could have been a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Gerson too optimistic about the tournament as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of playing standards, I think this will be the worst World Cup in 
the last 20 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A harsh judgment, especially when voiced before the first ball has been 
kicked. Will Gerson say the same thing later on if Brazil actually wins the 
World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's 1990 World Cup-winning coach, Franz Beckenbauer, will serve as a 
German television commentator during this summer's tournament, but former 
England national team coach Graham Taylor has declined an invitation to attend 
the World Cup as a radio commentator for the BBC. . . . Dutch international 
Ruud Gullit has returned to his old club, AC Milan, on a one-year, $880,000 
contract. Gullit, Europe's player of the year in 1987, helped Sampdoria win the 
Italian Cup this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Fernandez, the former French international midfielder, is rumored to be 
leaving Cannes to take over as coach of new French champion Paris St. Germain. 
Fernandez, who played on the Parisian club's 1986 championship-winning team, 
would replace Portuguese Coach Artur Jorge. . . . Manchester United midfielder 
Bryan Robson, a former England captain, has retired after 13 years at the club, 
where he won three Football Assn. (F.A.) Cup medals, two league championships 
and a European Cup Winners' Cup medal. Robson's 534-game career included 359 
games for Manchester United. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderlecht and Belgium defender Phillipe Albert is expected to be fit for 
World Cup duty after a two-month absence following knee surgery.

HART WILTS IN PRESENCE OF ROYALTY; HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL: HIGHLANDERS ROLL 
THROUGH SECOND ROUND OF DIVISION II PLAYOFFS WITH 15-9, 15-11, 15-9 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Royal High's annual march through the Southern Section boys' volleyball 
playoffs seems a rite of spring, like baseball's opening day or the cherry 
blossoms blooming in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders have advanced to a divisional championship match each of the 
last five years, winning three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's three-game sweep of Hart in a Division II second-round match, 
then, was merely another step toward the Highlanders' usual goal of a section 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Same old, same old? Not quite, because the 15-9, 15-11, 15-9 victory was a bit 
unusual for Royal (15-3) in that its middle attack -- normally the team's 
strong point -- was misfiring a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, because Royal's outside hitters, Scott Hambly and Danny Rizzo, 
played an excellent match and powered the team from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our outside hitting really dominated the game tonight," Royal Coach Bob 
Ferguson said. "Usually our middle is our strength, so this is real exciting 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hambly, a 6-2 junior who bellows excitedly to no one in particular each time 
he makes a play, had plenty of chances to hone his in-your-face yell. He had 11 
kills, passed the ball well and had two aces. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our spirit," Ferguson said. "He has so much energy that sometimes I have 
to tie him down a little, but he's a lot of fun to coach. He's the best gamer 
I've had in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart closed to 13-11 in the second game. But the Indians (14-4) lost their 
serve on a net violation, then allowed a free ball to fall on the court to make 
it 14-11. Rizzo (nine kills, three aces) closed the game with an ace on a jump 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal took a 12-0 lead in game three and cruised the rest of the way. Matt 
Olsen added eight kills for Royal, and Garrison Chaffee and Eric Carlsen each 
had seven kills. Setter Josh White had 41 assists.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; PRELIMINARIES OUT OF WAY FOR EL CAMINO REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 El Camino Real High moved a step closer to claiming another City Section 
softball championship Tuesday with a 7-0 victory over Sylmar in a 4-A Division 
semifinal playoff game at South Gate Park. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (19-4), which was eliminated in the preliminary rounds the past 
two seasons, will face two-time defending 4-A champion San Pedro, a 2-0 winner 
over Chatsworth in the other semifinal, in the championship game Tuesday at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores, winners of eight City softball titles before being 
eliminated in 1992 and '93, are poised to return to the winners' circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Jennifer Gould, who pitched the Conquistadores to their 
last title in her freshman year, is at the top of her game. After watching 
Gould mow down his Spartans (11-9), Sylmar Coach Chuck Miller said: "Jennifer 
Gould deserves a City championship. She's the best I've seen in the City 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Sylmar, Gould (19-4) gave up four hits and two walks while striking 
out 13. She ran into trouble only once -- in the fourth inning when the 
Spartans loaded the bases on two singles and an error with none out. But, her 
defense came up with two forceouts at the plate before Gould escaped with a 
strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould had plenty of support. The Conquistadores pounded 10 hits, with Ramona 
Shelburne and Gretchen Vandenberg each collecting three hits while Gould had 
two. Shelburne and Gould hit back-to-back home runs in the fifth to give the 
Conquistadores a 4-0 lead and Vandenberg hit a two-run homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar right-hander Cherise Espinosa (10-8), one of six starting sophomores, 
allowed six hits in six innings and struck out seven. PAIGE A. LEECH

SENIORS HESSTON, STEPHENS HELP CLEVELAND RESURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleveland High swimmers Ricky Hesston and Sean Stephens are the leaders of a 
relay team that is an unlikely favorite for a City Section title. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors competed for the Cavaliers as freshmen in 1991 -- the last time 
Cleveland had a swim team. With a new on-campus pool, the swimming program was 
reinstated for this season, but two weeks before practice, the Northridge 
earthquake severely damaged the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches Jim Cromwell and Barbara Suto scrambled to find a practice facility, 
finally getting use of the West Valley YMCA pool in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all of the distractions, Hesston and Stephens, along with juniors Oren 
Yakovee and Richard Gilmore, posted the top qualifying time in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay for the City Section finals, which will take place today at 3 
p.m. at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a lack of participants, the program was disbanded after the 1991 
season. But with the imminent opening of the pool, Cromwell and Suto found 
student interest overwhelming, with 132 swimmers ready for practice on Jan. 31, 
the day the pool was set to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of structural damage, the pool was not opened. Expecting interest to 
wane, Cromwell was pleasantly surprised when nearly 100 students tried out for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland pool is wide enough for 11 lanes, plenty to accommodate 100 
swimmers. Because the YMCA pool has only five lanes, Cromwell and Suto 
reluctantly trimmed the squad to 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering all we went through, I'm pleasantly surprised how well we've 
done," Cromwell said. "We had no idea what kind of talent we had." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavalier boys' team also qualified for the finals of the 200 medley relay 
and the 400 freestyle relay and have laid a foundation for next year. The pool 
should be ready by February. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham is the defending boys' champion and is led by Chris Cristales, 
second in the 200 freestyle last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' competition, Birmingham sophomore Gretchen Ballard gives the 
Braves a solid chance to unseat defending City champion Palisades. Ballard set 
City records in the 50 and 100 freestyle; this year, she is competing in the 
200 and 500 freestyle.  
</P>
<P>
 Keri and Julie Quance lead Granada Hills, along with Erin Shaw. Last year, 
they teamed with Kristine Quance to set a City record in the 200 medley relay.

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: After winning two races in the 1993 Southern Section 
Division II championships, Jenkins concentrated on swimming year-round for the 
first time. In March, he received his first invitation to the U.S. national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: For the second year in a row, Jenkins won the 50- and 
100-yard freestyle races in the Division II finals Saturday night at Belmont 
Plaza in Long Beach. He also swam anchor legs on the victorious 200 and 400 
freestyle relays, leading the Falcons to a second-place team finish. Jenkins' 
split of 20.45 seconds in the 200 freestyle relay team helped the Falcons set a 
Division II record with a time of 1:26.75. "That record made the night 
worthwhile as a team. We didn't win the team title but we came away with 
something," Jenkins said. He was named the male swimmer of the meet for 
accumulating the most points.

finished with 221 points, 66 ahead of second-place Santa Barbara. Later in the 
evening, in the 500 freestyle, her automatic All-American time of 4:53.05 was 
more than four seconds faster than her closest pursuer. "It was a real exciting 
experience," Gilman said. "I felt great as soon as I hit the water."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FRONT OFFICE AWARE OF POOR TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angel front office may have been convinced they made the right move 
Tuesday in firing Manager Buck Rodgers, but they have braced themselves for 
bashing from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 They already have been compared to the Clippers, and firing their manager one 
day after the Clippers fired Coach Bob Weiss, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It does fuel it," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We considered that 
for a few minutes. But does that make it right because it fuels scrutiny in the 
media? 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize we're not taking the safe route, and I realize I'll take some 
scrutiny, which is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel President Richard Brown: "I know we are two organizations not known 
for winning, but I don't compare us to anybody. But if that's how we're 
perceived, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have shaken up their coaching staff after Rodgers' firing: 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Knoop, who will be the interim manager through Wednesday, will be moved 
from first base to the bench coach; Max Oliveras will be moved from the bullpen 
to become the first-base coach; and Joe Maddon, formerly the minor league 
director of player development, becomes the bullpen coach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angel pitchers are elated that Marcel Lachemann is returning, 
perhaps no one was more upset than Marlin closer Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not real happy about this," Harvey said. "I'm happy for Marcel, but it 
really hurts us. He's been everything to me. This is the first time I'll be 
without him, so it really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran starter John Farrell, whom Rodgers was pushing to be on his pitching 
staff weeks ago, will join the Angels today when they purchase his contract. 
The Angels will make room for him on the roster by placing reliever Scott Lewis 
on the 15-day disabled list with a strained neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell was 4-4 with a 3.25 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver with four 
complete games and a shutout. He will start Thursday in place of Mark Leiter, 
who has been moved to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are expected to call up Russ Springer, perhaps by the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox leadoff hitter Tim Raines, who was managed by Rodgers in Montreal, 
has had the displeasure of seeing Rodgers fired twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate, surprising," Raines said, "I don't understand it. I talked 
to him (Monday), and it seemed to me like everything was going pretty good. 
Next thing I know, they're having a press conference." BOB NIGHTENGALE

DIGEST: MACY LEAVES CLEVELAND POST TO JOIN MOORPARK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Cleveland High football Coach Everett Macy has resigned his position as 
a varsity coach at the school to join the Moorpark College program. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, 51, will continue as dean of students and athletic director at 
Cleveland, where he coached football for the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a neat experience," said Macy, who lives in Moorpark. 
"They've got a successful program and hopefully I can contribute in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy will coach outside linebackers and strong safeties at Moorpark for Coach 
Jim Bittner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost too good to be true," said Bittner of his interview with Macy. 
"Here's a guy with good experience who was on the same page as me." 
</P>
<P>
 After three seasons as the Cleveland head or co-coach, Macy stepped down after 
the 1993 season and planned to serve as an assistant under Joe Santallano.

 Crescenta Valley High center fielder Stephanie Kanzler, an All-Pacific League

Kanzler, who turned down offers from Dayton and Boston College, has a .441

<P>
 Andre Chevalier and Beth Calcante were named the Cal State Northridge male and 
female athletes of the year at the annual senior awards banquet Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, a 6-foot senior guard from Landover, Md., is Northridge's all-time 
leader with 1,311 points, 481 assists and 184 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante, a senior left fielder from Newbury Park, is the Matadors' career 
leader with 31 home runs, 30 doubles and 137 runs batted in. She was first-team 
All-American as a junior. Baseball

 Cal State Sacramento split a pair of makeup games Monday night with San Diego 
State, clinching the WAC West Division title for hard-charging Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubleheader was rescheduled after Sacramento outfielder Vince Beall died 
Friday night after a yearlong battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State won the opener, 10-3, but fell in the second game, 4-2. The 
Aztecs must hope for an at-large berth in the NCAA Division I tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge (25-30, 12-12 in conference play) finished third behind 
Fresno State (36-23, 15-9) and San Diego State (35-23, 15-9). Under the 
conference tiebreaker system, Fresno State earned the division championship 
because it won four of six games against Northridge. The Aztecs and Matadors 
split six games. Cross-Country 
</P>
<P>
 The men's and women's programs at Valley College, which produced a total of 
four state titles, have been dropped to free up funds to bring back softball, 
Athletic Director Chuck Ferrero said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no more funds so we're making a trade here," Ferrero said. "We've 
got X amount of dollars to work with and this was the decision, we in the 
athletic department, came to." 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team won state titles in 1968, '69 and '70 and the women's team won 
in 1985.

 Moo Vin First set the standard for the El Primero Del Ano Derby when he won 
the first 400-yard trial in 20.04 seconds. The Royal Prince, the next-fastest 
qualifier and winner of the second heat Friday night, ran a 20.18, nearly a 
length slower. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 fastest horses will compete in the $103,500 El Primero Del Ano Derby, a 
Grade I race for 3-year-old quarter horses, on May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Moo Vin First, a California-bred son of First Down Dash, is a neck short of 
perfect in three starts. And many believe his record should include one more 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, trainer Charles Bloomquist confidently watched Moo Vin First 
being loaded into the gate for the $200,000 Grade I Golden State Futurity. But 
then two horses broke through the gate and Jumping Tac Flash flipped in the 
gate beside Moo Vin First. 
</P>
<P>
 "To keep him from getting hurt, they led him through the front of the gate," 
Bloomquist said. "They did all they could to hold onto him, but he just broke 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 Moo Vin First and Jumping Tac Flash were scratched, and Time For Royal Cash 
won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't (Moo Vin First's) fault," Bloomquist said. "It was truly 
frustrating. He doesn't make many mistakes. He's good in the gate and he 
doesn't use up energy unnecessarily. He won't beat himself." 
</P>
<P>
 And with his 0.14-second edge in the qualifying times, Moo Vin First's 
challengers will have to improve dramatically to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey John Creager rode Moo Vin First, then qualified Bloomquist's Mimis Dash 
in the second heat. In the El Primero Del Ano Derby, he will ride Moo Vin 
First. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he runs his race, he should win," Creager said. "But they're all 
dangerous. Going down the list, they're all good horses. Even Rainbow Sun (the 
seventh-fastest qualifier) just won a stakes race." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 qualifiers for the El Primero Del Ano Derby and their times: Moo Vin 
First, 20.04 seconds; The Royal Prince, 20.18; Kid Gris, 20.24; Down South 
Dasher, 20.26; Mimis Dash, 20.31; Unreal Deal, 20.33; Rainbow Sun, 20.38;, A 
Cash Request, 20.44; Master Woodstock, 20.45, and Military Issue, who won a 
draw with Citation Five after both posted times of 20.50.

 Suzanne and Rick Flammer accepted the 1993 divisional award for their 
3-year-old filly, Orzonna, at the Arabian Racing Assn. of California's banquet, 
then watched her wrap up an easy stakes victory a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first four furlongs of the Equest International California Distaff, 
Orzonna stayed within a length of the leader, Bits And Pieces, a front-runner 
who had won her last race by 19 1/2 lengths. As the seven-horse field rounded 
the final turn, Bits And Pieces faded quickly, and Orzonna continued to surge. 
The Polish-bred Orzonna won easily, with Fryga second and Tu third. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Felix Payne, Orzonna has six victories and a second place in seven 
starts. Henry Garcia rode her in all but one race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've really asked her and we weren't really sure of 
the foreign mare," Payne said, referring to the French-bred Vanessa Du Loup, 
who had been undefeated. "I based my strategy against her, but then Bits And 
Pieces caused me a lot of grief early." 
</P>
<P>
 Bits And Pieces wound up last, and Vanessa Du Loup never came close to the 
winner, finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race turned out a lot easier to do than to prepare for," Payne said. 
</P>

 Even after Magna Terra Smoky disappointed bettors as a 3-5 favorite Friday 
night, no one was surprised Saturday that he was voted 1993 horse of the year 
by the Arabian Racing Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Barbara Jagoda, Magna Terra Smoky has been voted California horse 
of the year in each of the past four years. In 74 starts, he has 33 victories, 
23 seconds and $188,522 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Magna Terra Smoky, carrying high weight of 126 pounds, failed to make up 
ground in the stretch of the Equest International California Open on Friday and 
finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Styx. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the weight got to him," jockey Richard Pfau said. "I was waiting for 
(Styx) to tire at the sixteenth (pole) since he didn't have a start this year, 
but he never quit." 
</P>
<P>
 The David Williams-trained and Roger Lang-owned Styx, who scored his seventh 
victory, is being pointed toward the California Arabian Cup on Sept. 25.

THEATER REVIEW; THERE'S A PLACE IN O.C. FOR A GOLDEN 'WEST SIDE STORY'; THIS 
BEAUTIFULLY DIRECTED COLLEGE PRODUCTION HAS A BROADWAY-QUALITY LOOK AND A LEAD 
COUPLE OF DEEPLY AFFECTING MAGNETISM. THE CAST CAPTURES THE MUSICAL'S EMOTIONAL 
RANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The piles of trash on the set look too carefully arranged. The first few 
gunshot-like notes from the orchestra sound like they barely got out of the 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Charles Davis' set opens up, one layer of huge, grimy New York 
tenements after another. Musical director David Anthony's ensemble erupts into 
full power. And the Sharks and the Jets take over. Now we're talking "West Side 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 And though this is "West Side Story" care of Golden West College, there's 
almost nothing here to suggest that we might not be watching work by a very, 
very good civic light opera. As director Brandee Williams indicated last year 
with her giddy, delightfully retro "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
Dreamcoat" in this same Mainstage Theatre, she and the Golden Westers have a 
gift for musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this show is unexpectedly remarkable, a perfect balance of the 
anticipated youthful energy with a serious elevation of craft. "Joseph," after 
all, is a little warm-up exercise at best compared to Leonard Bernstein's 
majestic urban epic, "Romeo and Juliet" transplanted astonishingly (yes, it's 
still astonishing) from Verona to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony and Maria are sung and acted with galvanizing passion by Ivan Rutherford 
and Cindy Acevedo; the production is held together by their deeply affecting 
magnetism. A lesser couple well might have been overwhelmed by Davis' giant set 
of floor-to-ceiling panels, walls and platforms -- as close to a Broadway-scale 
set as this reviewer has seen in a college theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rutherford's extraordinary command -- both of Bernstein's demanding 
register range and of Tony's loyalties, divided between his Puerto Rican lover 
and his white gang pals -- fulfills every ounce of the character's tragic 
capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Acevedo's very different approach ideally complements his sense of scale: She 
elicits delicate intimacy with nearly every note and line, skillfully building 
her emotional pain until the lid explodes in the last, heart-wrenching scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad that pain is missing from Adrienne Johnson's blandly pop version of 
"Somewhere." But the rest of the cast conveys the musical's full emotional 
range, from Jamie Jacoby's great firecracker Anita burning up the house with 
"America," to Mathew Arietta's as Jet leader Riff staying real, real "Cool," to 
the Jets (especially Mark Reilly, Brandon Ibanez and Jeremy L. Pierson) 
delivering the caustic comedy of "Gee, Officer Krupke." 
</P>
<P>
 The big numbers are pretty terrific. But it's the small moments that make you 
realize how attentive director Williams has been to every detail. Before this, 
we never really heard Doc (a wonderfully bedraggled Art Frankel), the drugstore 
owner who employs Tony, saying wistfully to him, "I never had a Maria." It's a 
kind of dramatic haiku, playing off splendidly against the all-encompassing 
sights and sounds of a showstopper like "Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What doesn't stop the show is Tim Hill's choreography, a lame modification of 
Jerome Robbins' original work. But thanks to fight coach Eric Hudson, the 
jumping, punching and knifing are cruelly, beautifully effective. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; LEITHAM, BERG: A COMPLEMENTARY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing jazz without a drummer is much like tightrope-walking without a net. 
Without a firm footing, there's a chance the music can take a nasty fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo of bassist John Leitham and pianist Shelly Berg, appearing Sunday at 
Spaghettini, managed not only to keep on its feet, but also to hit the ground 
running. Though they accounted for just two-thirds of what normally constitutes 
a rhythm section, timekeeping was not a problem. In fact, the two had no 
difficulty tracking the beat while keeping their instruments singing together 
in sympathetic style. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience, of course, plays some part in this, and both Leitham and Berg are 
well-practiced in their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Leitham, who's gone on from a short stint in the Woody Herman band to become a 
longtime member of Mel Torme's touring combo, is one of Los Angeles' most 
in-demand bassists, having worked with trombonist Bill Watrous, the late 
saxophonist Bob Cooper and drummer Ed Shaughnessy. He has a pair of fine albums 
out under his own name, the most recent of which, "Southpaw," suggests both his 
love of baseball and the fact that he plays bass left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berg, a professor of music at USC, makes area appearances regularly at such 
clubs as the Jazz Bakery in Culver City and Chadney's in Burbank. He's also in 
heavy demand for his writing talents, having arranged the small-group sessions 
for trombonist Watrous' latest album and serving as musical director for the 
short-lived TV series "A League of Their Own." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they put on a fine show that was memorable not only for the quality 
of its musicianship but also for the way they complemented each other. The 
responsiveness that makes small-group jazz fascinating, here stripped to the 
bare essentials, was present in abundance. And, despite the lack of a drummer, 
the two took every opportunity to swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The character of the bass-piano sound makes for unusual audio twists, and the 
two took full advantage of this. Fats Waller's "Jitterbug Waltz" was a good 
example, with Leitham's bass taking the familiar descending line theme as Berg 
added the barest of accompaniment. On the bop-walk "Moose the Mooch," Leitham 
and Berg stated the bouncy melody in unison, before Berg took off into his solo 
propelled by Leitham's astute pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 As an improviser, Leitham has few peers. He works close to the melody, as he 
did on Jerome Kern's "The Song Is You," often sprinkling unbelievably brisk 
passages among his lyrical attack. His pitch, no matter how fast the tempo, is 
right on, and he decorates his play with a full complement of sliding tones, 
double-stops and up-register play. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg is an activist during improvisations, filling his statements with rolling 
passages, rifling ascending lines and various trills and flourishes that echoed 
Leitham's or his own play. As an accompanist, he prefers to let the lead do the 
majority of the talking, adding spare, understated touches while keeping an ear 
open for lines from the bass that bear repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they gave a varied program that had them each taking long solos 
followed by a short series of exchanges on every tune. 
</P>
<P>
 They were especially romantic during "In a Sentimental Mood" (Leitham, 
referring to the piece's sleepy tempo, called it "In a Semi-Mental Mood"), then 
followed with Leitham's own funk-driven "Poonin'." Leitham's solo during Sam 
Jones' "Bittersweet" was especially involved, concluding with a series of rich, 
deeply set tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man missed having a drummer. And judging from the amount of 
foot-tapping that was going on (this was probably the most attentive crowd 
we've seen in the Spaghettini lounge), the audience didn't miss hearing drums 
either.

73% OF COURT CLERKS JOIN SICKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and THOM MROZEK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was order in the courts -- even though there was no one to write down 
some judges' orders Tuesday as more than two-thirds of Los Angeles County's 
Superior Court clerks staged a sickout to protest stalled contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, 73% of the clerks and judicial assistants -- 277 out of 380 -- 
called in sick in a job action that sent court administrators scurrying to find 
fill-in help. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest hit courthouse was in Santa Monica, where all 21 of the assigned 
clerks stayed home. At the San Fernando courthouse, all but three of 16 clerks 
were missing; in Long Beach, all but three of 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures at other courthouses varied from no clerks missing at the 
Lancaster courthouse to 47% absenteeism at the Downtown Criminal Courts 
Building and 79% at the Compton courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm beginning to appreciate (my clerk's) job a lot more," said Van Nuys Judge 
Darlene Schempp, herself a former court clerk, as she struggled to take notes 
so that orders required for every court action could be completed later. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Criminal Courts Building, Judge Isabel R. Cohen was using the downtime 
between cases to transfer notes scribbled during a hearing for two men accused 
of a carjacking. The forms would normally be filled out by Cohen's clerk, Joe 
Pulido. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido had tried to assist Cohen by making her calendar accessible so she 
would not assign conflicting dates to cases, but he left some documents locked 
in filing cabinets and drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen couldn't find the rubber stamp for dating documents, so she was writing 
in the date in longhand and signing it. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the inconvenience in criminal cases, civil judges had it worse. Some 
of their courts were left clerkless so criminal courtrooms could receive 
priority from the small pool of fill-ins. In criminal court, some suspects can 
be released if their cases are not heard within a prescribed period. 
</P>
<P>
 The job action was expected to affect the filing of divorce cases, restraining 
order requests and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Judge Martha Goldin's civil courtroom in Downtown Los Angeles, a 
handwritten sign read: "No Clerk -- File All Papers in Dept. 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The sickout is planned to last through Thursday, according to David P. 
Bradford, president of the Los Angeles County Superior Court Clerks Assn. 
Arbitration in the dispute is scheduled to begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The job action came after two years of negotiations between the county and the 
clerks union broke down last month. The clerks, who earn a maximum annual 
salary of about $43,000, have not had a pay increase in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some judges reported being bogged down by paperwork normally handled 
by clerks, others were not inconvenienced. For the most part, trials and 
hearings continued as usual, with managers and other workers filling in for the 
missing clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Gary Klausner, assistant presiding judge for the Superior Court, said 
the sickout had little significant impact on the flow of cases through the 
court system, the largest in the nation. Clerks record judges' orders, keep 
track of their calendars, swear in witnesses and read aloud jury verdicts.

MOST OF CUT IN SHERIFF'S BUDGET IS RESTORED; FINANCES: SUPERVISORS PUT BACK $45 
MILLION OF A $60-MILLION TRIM. BUT THE MOVE WILL TAP AN ACCOUNT THAT HELPS 
MAINTAIN THE COUNTY'S CREDIT RATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to restore $45 
million to the Sheriff's Department, just one day after county staff had 
recommended a sizable cut and weeks before other department pleas for funding 
will be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsible way to go," Supervisor Ed Edelman said in urging his 
colleagues to support the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote came after Edelman informed the board that he had spoken 
privately with Sheriff Sherman Block, who said the $45 million would satisfy 
his budget demands. The agreement heads off the effects of state legislation 
that could force the county to give even more money to the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending legislation would require counties to maintain funding of law 
enforcement at current levels and funnel all Proposition 172 sales tax revenue 
to public safety agencies. Proposition 172, approved by voters last year, 
imposed a quarter-cent sales tax increase that was intended to bolster law 
enforcement budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has an "escape clause" that would exempt any county that enters into 
a budget agreement with the local sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed had recommended cutting the Sheriff's 
Department by $60 million, which Block said would have required the closure of 
two facilities. With the partial restoration of funds, he said that no jails or 
stations would have to be closed, but hundreds of job vacancies would remain 
unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board obviously agreed that the proposed curtailment would have had a 
severe impact on our ability to provide public safety," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said he did not hold out for full restoration of his budget 
because the county is facing a $184-million deficit, and he is willing to 
shoulder part of that burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supervisors were able to quash one potential threat on their 
treasury, they may have created another. 
</P>
<P>
 The $45 million will be taken from a special reserve account that the county 
keeps for paying interest on the millions of dollars in outstanding bonds. 
Depleting that account could threaten the credit rating on its bonds, 
ultimately costing millions in additional interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said in an interview that the account has been there to protect the 
county's credit rating. That rating is under review by the nation's leading 
rating agencies, and they have indicated that it could be revised downward. A 
lower credit rating typically means the borrower must offer higher interest 
rates to attract lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman said he checked with county Auditor-Controller Alan Sasaki and was 
told the transfer would have no effect on the county's rating. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the board tentatively approved the proposed $14.7-billion county 
budget for fiscal 1994-95, although each of the supervisors said they plan to 
seek significant changes. Hearings on the spending plan are slated to begin 
June 1 and board deliberations are set to start July 11.

THE SHOOTOUT ON EAST 54TH STREET; VIOLENCE: TWENTY YEARS AGO, THE LAPD AND THE 
SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY EXCHANGED FIRE AT A HOME IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a weed-choked lot in South-Central Los Angeles there is a single palm tree, 
the only surviving remnant of a fire that put an end to one of the most 
infamous shootouts in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, 20 years after the gun battle, only Florence Lishey paid tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Lishey had watched from her living room window across the street as, for two 
hours, police SWAT team members exchanged fire with six Symbionese Liberation 
Army members, the urban guerrillas who had kidnaped Patty Hearst. A fire, 
ignited by tear gas, touched off a large cache of ammunition inside the house. 
Four SLA members died in the house and two others were killed in a shootout 
with police as they tried to escap. 
</P>
<P>
 Lishey, who owned the house and still lives across the street, wandered by the 
site on the anniversary. She had received compensation from the city and her 
insurance company. But she decided not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her neighbors were from Louisiana, she said, some of them carrying 
with them superstitions and spirituality rooted in African religion. "A lot of 
people were very frightened by the place," said Lishey, now 81. "Some claimed 
they heard screams at night coming from the empty lot. I could have rebuilt the 
house, but nobody would have moved there." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the shooting thousands of people flooded into the 
neighborhood, watching the action. And for weeks after, East 54th Street was 
filled with rubber-neckers and tourists who drove by and took pictures of the 
charred lot. Soon people forgot about the infamous site, and the only one who 
showed any interest in the location was the mother of William Wolfe, an SLA 
member who died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, on the anniversary of the shootout, Lishey said, Wolfe's mother 
stopped by the lot. She placed a memorial wreath on the palm tree and stood in 
silence for hours. For about 10 years she showed up every May 17. Then she 
stopped coming, and Lishey never knew why. 
</P>
<P>
 The street has changed little in 20 years. It is still an impoverished area, 
filled with small ramshackle houses, weathered apartment buildings and cinder 
block walls covered with gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting, police had suspected that Patty Hearst was in the 
house. But it was later discovered she and two other SLA members had fled the 
city the previous day after a shootout at an Inglewood sporting goods store, 
touched off by a bungled shoplifting attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 While many who watched the confrontation have long since moved, a few who 
remain are still angry at the way the Los Angeles Police Department responded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, M. L. Leverette, who watched and took pictures of the shootout 
from a nearby street corner, criticized the police as he sifted through photos 
of the confrontation in his small Compton Avenue photo studio near the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was overkill, no doubt about it," Leverette said. "The LAPD was making a 
statement to revolutionaries to stay out of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shootout, the LAPD was criticized by some who claimed that the 
department's response was excessive. The day after the incident someone 
scrawled on a charred wall in front of the house: "It Took 500 Cops." And that 
is what many in the neighborhood believed . 
</P>
<P>
 But later reports on the incident indicated that only 19 SWAT team members 
actually took part in the gun battle. And it was determined that the six SLA 
members had an arsenal with more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition. Authorities 
recovered 17 guns and two pipe bombs in the ashes of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that police had the place surrounded and they kept telling the 
people to give themselves up," Lishey said. "The SLA answered with a pistol 
shot. That started the war. Bullets were flying fast and furious. I was with my 
granddaughter and we saw the whole thing from my front window. One bullet 
zipped right through the window and missed my granddaughter by just a few 
inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Leverette said he knew people "connected to SLA members," who assumed that 
once the shooting started, "the neighbors in South-Central would grab guns and 
help with the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "But hey, this isn't Berkeley," Leverette said. "This is a depressed area and 
people are just trying to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered that the SLA members were staying in the house when a woman 
approached an officer directing traffic, recalled Sgt. Albert Preciado, a 
member of the SWAT team that surrounded the house. The woman asked the officer 
if police "were looking for the white people with the bullets and guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's daughter, who was renting the house, had been offered $100 by the 
SLA if they could stay there with her. The mother spotted all the guns, became 
frightened and decided to contact police. 
</P>
<P>
 After the SWAT team surrounded the house, an officer grabbed a bullhorn and 
announced: "This is the LAPD. Come out with your hands up and leave your 
weapons in the house." He repeated the message 25 times with no response, 
Preciado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, police fired tear-gas into the house, and the SLA began shooting. The 
furious gunfight lasted two hours . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely the scariest thing I've ever been involved in," said 
Preciado, still with SWAT as an assistant platoon leader. "I've handled many 
armed suspects in barricaded houses with the SWAT team. But this was something 
else. My team was at the front, facing six heavily armed suspects who were 
trying to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of officers were at the scene, according to reports at the time -- 
the vast majority working to control the crowd of more than 10,000. The 
incident was broadcast live on television in Los Angeles. Four of the SLA 
members were found dead beneath the house. Donald (Cinque) DeFreeze, who 
founded the SLA, was one of those killed. Two others died attempting to escape, 
Preciado said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two had pistols in each hand and went down blazing," Preciado said. "It 
was like the movie 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.' "

FATHER ACCUSED IN FATAL CRASH FREED TO ATTEND SON'S FUNERAL; TRAGEDY: SHERIFF 
TAKES THE UNUSUAL STEP EVEN THOUGH THE MAN IS ACCUSED OF DRUNK DRIVING THAT LED 
TO HIS CHILD'S DEATH.

<P>
 Shackled and surrounded by sheriff's deputies, a North Hollywood man who 
authorities say ignored the pleas of his wife not to drive drunk faced the 
tragic consequences of his actions Tuesday at the funeral of his 5-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 mourners attended services for William Anthony Guzman, a 
kindergartner who was thrown from the car and killed while accompanying his 
father on a Saturday night beer run. In an unusual decision, Sheriff Sherman 
Block gave permission for the father, Pedro Guzman, to attend the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman, 35, who has three previous drunk driving convictions, is being held at 
County Jail in lieu of $1-million bail on charges of second-degree murder in 
the death of his son. Inmates accused of such serious crimes and with bail in 
excess of $50,000 are not granted such requests, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sheriff Block looked at the circumstances and decided to show a little 
compassion to the man," said Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Larry Lincoln. 
"It appears that it was not a crime committed with any premeditation. But it is 
not something we normally do." 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral was marked by grief, not blame. The boy's mother, Maria, said 
later that punishment of her husband will do nothing to bring back their son. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pedro Guzman entered Holy Family Episcopal Mission in North Hollywood, 
accompanied by an entourage of plainclothes deputies, his handcuffs were 
removed. Still shackled around the ankles, he was led to an empty pew in a back 
row of the church, isolated from the rest of his grieving family, including his 
wife, who authorities say begged him not to leave with their son the day he was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in street clothes, the distraught Guzman shook his head and 
occasionally put his hands together in prayer. His wife, who sat with family 
and friends, cried throughout the hourlong service. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a death of a child is difficult enough. But to have a death of a 
child and a tragedy of a father compounds our sorrow and grief," the Rev. Barry 
Verdi, pastor of the Holy Family mission, said during the service. ". . . If we 
live in a society that does not allow redemption and compassion, then we are a 
society that's going to collapse onto itself." 
</P>
<P>
 A small white casket, topped with pink and white carnations and a framed 
photograph, held the child's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that when Guzman drove with his son to buy more beer May 7, his 
blood-alcohol level was 0.13% -- well over the legal limit of 0.08%. 
Prosecutors allege that Guzman swerved into oncoming traffic and collided with 
a pickup truck on Riverton Avenue near Arminta Street in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the district attorney's office, Guzman should have known 
"somebody could die, but he drove anyway" -- knowledge based on his past 
convictions and court-ordered attendance at courses teaching the dangers of 
drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys are expected to argue that Guzman was not entirely to 
blame because both motorists were legally drunk. The driver of the pickup truck 
has pleaded no contest to a charge of driving under the influence and was 
sentenced to 193 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sheriff's Department allowed Guzman to attend the church service, 
it denied him permission to witness the graveside ceremony at Forest Lawn in 
the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping out under the green tent against the light drizzle, the boy's mother, 
Maria, gently tossed a single red rose into the grave. She let out a cry as 
workers put the soil back into the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Alma Rosa Guevara cried each time William's name was mentioned. 
She was a friend and playmate, said the girl's father, Juan Jose Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a son to me," said Guevara said of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara said his 5-year-old son, who would play football with William, "thinks 
his friend is sick and he'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters were joined by some of William's classmates at Strathern Street 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, Maria Guzman was shielded by family and friends in an 
attempt to avoid cameras and reporters. She hid her face using the framed 
picture of her son as she was led to a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, during a telephone interview, she said she did not want to 
speculate on what happened the day her son died. But she pleaded for mercy for 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our son is dead and we cannot do anything about it, " she said. "I want 
(Pedro) to get out soon so he can support his family." The couple also have an 
11-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdi said, "Pedro needs time to redeem and the family needs time to grieve. 
Society is too vindictive and too vengeful." 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty of second-degree murder, Pedro Guzman faces 15 years to life 
in prison.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
MOTHER, SON INDICTED IN WELFARE FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An indictment was unsealed Tuesday against two members of a band of so-called 
"gypsies" accused of running one of the largest welfare fraud schemes in Los 
Angeles County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Marelene Demetrio de Gomez, 33, and her 18-year-old son, Anyelo, appeared in 
Los Angeles Superior Court but did not enter pleas to the charges.Their 
attorneys were not in court and the arraignment was postponed until this 
morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that the mother and son, who were both dressed in jail 
clothes at their court appearance, are members of a ring that defrauded the 
welfare system for about 10 years. They each were indicted on various counts of 
conspiracy, grand theft, receiving welfare aid by misrepresentation and 
perjury.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman alleged that the defendants obtained birth 
certificates from Puerto Rico and used them to get California driver's licenses 
and other forms of identification. Through the false identification, they were 
able to defraud the system of at least $880,000 in welfare aid, Hodgman 
alleged.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOMITA; SHERIFF OPENS 
OMBUDSMAN OFFICE TO FIELD COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ombudsman's office has opened in Lomita, part of a long-anticipated effort 
to soothe community anger over the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
past use-of-force policies. Five retired judges were appointed to review 
complaints forwarded by the ombudsman's office and to provide an independent 
review in cases involving allegedly excessive use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph De Leon, 69, a retired police captain who worked as a special 
assistant to former California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, was hired in 
mid-March for the ombudsman's job. He began work Monday as the Sheriff 
Department's in-house investigator of citizen complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 De Leon, the unanimous choice of the Board of Supervisors for the $60,200- 
a-year job, vowed to provide swift and efficient response to community concerns 
and complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give people confidence that their complaints are going to be 
addressed, and there will be fairness and efficiency in dealing with their 
complaints to their satisfaction," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WOMAN 
FILES 'PEEPING TOM' SUIT AGAINST RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County woman who contends that somebody spied on her as she used 
the bathroom in a Jack in the Box in Norco, sued the restaurant Tuesday and the 
firm that licensed the franchisee. 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Cota is seeking damages for sexual assault, her attorney, David D. 
Moriel, said.He said his legal research indicates that at least 16 known 
"peephole" lawsuits have been filed in the United States. Two of them, he said, 
resulted in civil awards against a motel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things go unnoticed or they're never acted on because they don't find 
the peeping Tom," Moriel said. "This case is different."  
</P>
<P>
 Cota, who filed in Riverside Superior Court, is seeking at least $750,000 in 
general damages and unspecified punitive damages from San Diego-based Foodmaker 
Inc., which owns Jack in the Box.  
</P>
<P>
 Foodmaker spokeswoman Sheree Zizzi said, "We have not received a copy of the 
suit. But based on our understanding, we have no reason to believe the 
allegations are true."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 'THREE 
STRIKES' CASE FILED IN CARJACKING MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed a "three strikes" case Tuesday against a man held in the 
weekend carjacking murder of a father of three in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland Chambers, 31, was charged with the unlawful taking of a vehicle and 
receiving stolen property.But murder charges have not yet been filed against 
him in Sunday's shooting death of Terrance Booker, 26.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators are searching for a second man suspected of taking 
part in the theft of Booker's decorated, silver 1970 Chevrolet Impala 
convertible on El Segundo Boulevard. About 11 p.m. Sunday, an anonymous caller 
phoned detectives to say that the stolen car, covered with blankets, was parked 
behind an apartment building in Lynwood.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives arrested Chambers within an hour as he allegedly tried to drive the 
car from behind the building. Chambers was expected to be arraigned in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court this afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Because he has been convicted of at least two other felonies, Chambers faces 
25 years to life in prison if convicted of the two charges filed Tuesday, 
Childs said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOCTORS SAVE HANDS OF 
RETIREE LEFT TIED UP FOR 6 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 72-year-old retiree who faced possible amputation of both hands after 
robbers left him tied on the floor of his Altadena home for six days will keep 
both limbs and probably regain at least partial function in his right hand, 
doctors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Farrell was in stable condition in the intensive care unit of an 
undisclosed hospital Tuesday after surgery Saturday to restore the blood flow 
to his hands, said Dr. Stefanie A. Feldman, one of the doctors who operated on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "His right hand is partially functional, but he still has no sensation in his 
left hand," Feldman said. "Both hands will be saved, but their function, 
especially the function in the left hand, is in question." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is lucid and able to talk to visitors, though he still has periods 
where he is not completely alert, Feldman said. Farrell is also recovering from 
severe dehydration.  
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said that Farrell accidentally worked the bonds around his wrists 
tighter as he tried to free himself, and his struggles caused swelling that 
further restricted blood flow to his hands. Additional surgery will be needed, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell was attacked the evening of May 7 as he returned to his home on 
Sacramento Street after dinner at a restaurant, sheriff's deputies said. They 
said his assailants were three people who had broken into his home while he was 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that after beating Farrell and tying him up, the robbers 
ransacked the house, but it has not been determined whether anything was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he lived alone, Farrell was not found until a worried friend, Vincent 
(Gene) Cusic, 77, looked in on him almost a week later. No arrests have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this was bound to happen," Cusic said. "There are just some 
mean people in this world. They see an advantage, and they take it."MIKE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JURY BEGINS 
DELIBERATIONS IN KING LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury deliberations began Tuesday in the second phase of Rodney G. King's 
lawsuit for punitive damages against six current and former Los Angeles police 
officers, after attorneys on both sides concluded closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies told the jury that they may award punitive 
damages against the defendants if they used unreasonable force or acted in 
reckless disregard for King's constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of punitive damages are to punish and to deter others from 
committing similar acts in the future," Davies instructed. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers asked the jury to award between $3.8 million and $15 million in 
punitive damages from former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, former Officers Theodore J. 
Briseno, Laurence M. Powell and Timothy E. Wind and current Officers Rolando 
Solano and Louis Turriaga. Koon and Powell are serving 30-month prison 
sentences for violating King's civil rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Peterson, an attorney for Briseno, who has filed a countersuit, told 
the jury that King is now far richer than any of the defendants left in the 
lawsuit. He asked the jury to award Briseno half as much as the $3.8 million it 
awarded King last month in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that $3.8 million "is quite a feast. Now (King and his attorneys) are 
gnawing at the bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said King was responsible for his injuries because he provoked the 
officers by leading a high-speed chase and resisting arrest. He also said the 
city of Los Angeles shared blame for the beating, which was captured on 
videotape and broadcast worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milton Grimes, King's lead attorney, said the officers initiated the 
confrontation with King by yelling a racial epithet at him and then telling him 
to run for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to kill you nigger, run," Grimes said the officers told King that 
night. The defendants deny the allegations that they used racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes also said the scene that night resembled a bullfight. "They took Mr. 
King like he was a bull and then they played with him in the ring," he said.

LYNN REDGRAVE FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress Lynn Regrave filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Los Angeles 
on Tuesday, her lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
 In her filing, Redgrave, 51, contends that her financial problems began when 
MCA and Universal Television did not pay a 1987 court-ordered settlement to 
cover legal fees resulting from her 1981 wrongful dismissal lawsuit against the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to recover the funds, as well as her pursuit of malpractice claims 
against her former lawyers, created additional expenses, according to her 
petition.  
</P>
<P>
 "These circumstances have left the actress in need of the court's protection 
while she reorganizes her financial affairs," said attorney David Neale of the 
Century City-based law firm of Levene & Eisenberg, which also is handling the 
bankruptcy cases of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Kim Basinger.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD 
OFFICER CHARGED IN FREEWAY SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An off-duty Los Angeles police officer suspected of shooting at two cars on an 
Interstate 10 off-ramp in Colton was charged Tuesday with a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Robert Cardona, 35, is scheduled to be arraigned today in San 
Bernardino Municipal Court on a charge of firing shots at an occupied vehicle, 
said a spokeswoman in the San Bernardino County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardona, assigned to the Rampart Division, has been held on $50,000 bail since 
his arrest Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardona allegedly fired several shots from a 9-millimeter handgun at cars 
leaving the westbound freeway at Pepper Avenue, prompting back-to-back 911 
calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Lt. John Dunkin said the 12-year LAPD veteran was on 
vacation at the time of his arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was hit in either shooting incident. The second motorist went to a 
service station to call authorities and while on the phone described a man 
walking out of the shadows at that moment and toward the gas station.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
BANS CITY BUSINESS DEALS WITH HAITIAN LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council sent a message to Haiti's military rulers Tuesday 
by voting to stop doing business or investing in any company that operates in 
the Caribbean country.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the council adopted a similar resolution to put economic 
pressure on the white-dominated South African government to abolish apartheid, 
a system of racial separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Jackie Goldberg and Rita Walters, two of the Haiti resolution's 
sponsors, said they hope other local governments will follow suit, as occurred 
in the struggle to end white minority rule in South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 Walters said "only when these sanctions were put on South Africa . . . did the 
South African government take another look at their policies (and) release 
(black leader Nelson) Mandela from prison. And now Mr. Mandela is president of 
the country."  
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that the city will not resume investments in any company 
with holdings in Haiti until ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is 
restored to power.

2ND FIREFIGHTER SILENT AT HEARING; INQUIRY: LAWYER ADVISES SUSPECT TO REFUSE TO 
ANSWER GRAND JURY QUESTIONS ABOUT CALABASAS/MALIBU FIRE. CONTRACTOR WHO HELPED 
FIGHT FLAMES ALSO APPEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 The second of two firefighters named as suspected arsonists in last fall's 
Calabasas/Malibu fire refused to answer questions before a grand jury Tuesday, 
and a contractor who helped him and the other firefighter in the first few 
minutes of the blaze also appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Shelp, 29, refused to answer questions on the advice of his lawyer. 
When leaving the hearing room in the Downtown Criminal Courts Building during a 
break, Shelp had no comment on the investigation or on his appearance before 
the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Nicholas A. Durepo, 24, also was called before the grand jury and 
refused to answer questions -- a common practice among suspects facing 
prosecutors seeking to gather evidence for a criminal case. Anything a suspect 
says before a grand jury can be used against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block has said investigators suspect that Shelp and Durepo, 
who were volunteer firefighters at the time, started the Nov. 2 blaze so they 
could put it out, become heroes and help their chances of getting full-time 
firefighting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have maintained their innocence, contending that they happened upon 
the fire and made a vain attempt to put it out with the help of a plumber who 
also was driving by. The firefighters have neither been arrested nor charged, 
and both have maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators initially doubted the existence of the plumber, Block 
said. But the man -- actually a contractor named Robert Blakeley -- surfaced 
last week after friends saw his photograph in The Times. On Saturday, he 
revisited the hillside where the fire started, along with homicide 
investigators and a county prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakeley spent half an hour Tuesday testifying before the 23-member grand jury 
as to what happened in the first moment of the fire, when he tried to help 
Shelp and Durepo stop the spreading flames, which wound up jumping Old Topanga 
Canyon Road and burning across Malibu to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a regular grand jury-type deal, but I cannot discuss what took place 
behind closed doors," Blakeley said. "Obviously it took place. I was there, and 
I did testify." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp is now a firefighter with the Los Angeles Fire Department, although he 
has been placed on administrative duty until the investigation is completed. 
Durepo has been taken off active volunteer duty with the Manhattan Beach Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also testifying Tuesday was a volunteer firefighter and friend of Durepo named 
Scott Safechuck, who spoke with Durepo the night the fire started. Safechuck 
had no comment, but his father, Frank Safechuck, said the grand jury 
proceedings were active. "I know it's been very intense," he said. "At times, 
you can hear the conversation rising even outside those double doors."

PET PROJECTS ADDED TO CITY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It reminded some Los Angeles City Hall regulars of those heady budget sessions 
of the 1980s, when pet projects were often justified by a robust economy that 
poured cash into the city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday voted to add to Mayor Richard Riordan's budget 
everything from a new elevator for the Southwest Museum in Mt. Washington to a 
study of whether the Pussycat adult theater in Canoga Park can be converted 
into a venue for legitimate live theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most hotly contested issue of the day, the council rejected Riordan's 
proposal for a special $5-million appropriation for the Hope in Youth gang 
program. The council directed that the fledgling organization compete with 
other groups for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 A third day of budget deliberations is scheduled for today, with council 
members expected to offer dozens of amendments for projects in their districts 
and around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan will have five days after the council is done with the budget to veto 
any additions he does not like, and the city lawmakers will have five days 
after that to override any vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sources of funds that the mayor rooted out in the city's $4.3-billion 
budget had been targeted to beef up the police force and create a $37-million 
reserve fund, which the council continued to whittle away Tuesday. "The mayor 
gave everybody the impression through his budget we have a lot of money," said 
one council aide, "even though that's probably not true." 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly seven hours of debate and voting, the council agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire 10 more animal control officers to retrieve stray pets. The service has 
been reduced substantially because of a three-year hiring freeze. Cost: 
$346,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add another three-person team to repair vandalized street lights. About 
26,000 lights need repair, said Councilwoman Rita Walters, who proposed the 
plan. Cost: $311,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase street sweeping to once a week, instead of once a month, along 100 
"curb miles" of streets in the city. The extra streets to be cleaned would be 
posted with once-a-week no parking signs. Cost: $307,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain the staff and supplies of the William Grant Still Art Center in 
Southwest Los Angeles, which provides classes and other programs seven days a 
week. Cost: $124,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add two calligraphers who draw proclamations, construct plaques and inscribe 
keys to the city, which council members present to citizens and visiting 
dignitaries. Cost: $99,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the Fire Department unit that specializes in rescuing victims caught 
in flood channels during storms. Cost: $79,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grant $35,000 to the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park to 
replace lost state funding and to study possible consolidation with the 
African-American Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To study the remaking of the Pussycat Theater, as proposed by Councilman Laura 
Chick, would cost $30,000. Councilman Mike Hernandez's funding for an elevator 
to take visitors up Mt. Washington to the Southwest Museum would cost $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Not faring so well was Riordan's proposal for special funding for the Hope in 
Youth program. It was defeated, despite a compromise plan by Councilman Richard 
Alatorre that would have guaranteed the program $2.5 million and forced it to 
compete with other organizations to get more funding. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of eight of the 15 council members said the program should not be 
given special treatment and should be forced to compete for all of the $5 
million to be set aside for gang prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre and Councilman Joel Wachs said they will ask Riordan to veto the 
council's action. A veto would restore the $5 million to the church-sponsored 
counseling program, unless 10 council members vote to override.

BILL BOYARSKY: RX FOR REFORM TOO BITTER A PILL FOR SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sally Reed arrived at the Los Angeles County Hall of Administration with the 
naive assumption she could bring honest bookkeeping to county government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed, the county administrative officer, has seen her proposals shredded 
by the supervisors who hired her. In the seven months since she arrived, she's 
learning there's not much market at the hall for her simple prescription for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who is supervisor, no matter whether the board is liberal or 
conservative, county government is stubbornly wedded to its secretive, 
impossible-to-comprehend budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed first tried a budget with no one-time financing, no gimmicks, no 
depending on problematic state aid. The deficit in this truth-in-budgeting 
spending program totaled $900 million. Because the county is not allowed to 
have a deficit, Reed proposed balancing the budget with big cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors ordered Reed back to her computer. She compromised, coming 
back with a budget more to the supervisorial tastes. She abandoned a reserve 
fund, reduced estimates of some welfare costs, and added some hoped-for money 
from the federal and state governments and from employee pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 She also proposed a $60-million cut in the Sheriff's Department. The cut would 
have given the county's public safety departments, which include the Sheriff's 
Department, 45% of available county funds, up from last year's 41%. But Sheriff 
Sherman Block wanted more. He threatened to go to war against the supes. So 
Tuesday, the supervisors voted to give the sheriff just about what he wanted, 
dipping into another one of those many mysterious county funds that only the 
most knowledgeable insiders can find. This one is supposed to be used to make 
early payments on debts to improve the county's credit rating. Only Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the supervisors refused to swallow Reed's bitter medicine. In view 
of these continued rejections, it's interesting to examine why they hired her 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed won the job 3 to 2, backed by an odd coalition of liberal supervisors 
Gloria Molina and Yvonne Burke and conservative Antonovich. Deane Dana and Ed 
Edelman were opposed. The nature of her coalition is as much to blame for her 
troubles as is her approach to budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a woman CAO no doubt had some appeal to Burke and Molina. 
Antonovich seemed to approve of Reed's conservative fiscal philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed made a good first impression. She's a friendly, open person with a good 
sense of humor. She continued predecessor Harry Hufford's weekly Monday morning 
meetings with the Hall of Administration press corps, discussing hot issues in 
a forthright manner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear she was more conservative than the liberal board majority of 
Edelman, Burke and Molina. But with even liberal Democrats talking economy 
these days, it seemed like a philosophical accommodation might be possible. 
Everyone knew that the county would one day have to put its fiscal house in 
order. That was one point that Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown agreed on. And the state is the main source of 
county funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But in preparing her first budget, Reed made mistakes that left her coalition 
crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts she advocated were too massive for Molina and Burke to support. They 
included heavy reductions in the county health and welfare services so 
important to the East, Central and South Los Angeles areas they represent. Reed 
left her supporters behind as she raced toward her destination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, Reed should have gone slower. But that's a criticism of her 
technique, not her policy. What's most important is that Reed is on the right 
track, heading for the proper destination -- a county government that is open 
with the people in fiscal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of open government while I watched the Los Angeles City Council's 
budget debate. It's all being done in public, with every item argued openly, 
first in committee and then on the council floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and his assistants presented the budget to the council. 
Administration aides have been subjected to days of hostile questioning. The 
council's own fiscal experts, Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton and his staff, go 
up against the mayoral team. The public has testified at committee hearings and 
before the full council. A rough consensus is formed out of this clash, 
reflecting L.A.'s political will. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors would rather have only themselves and a few other powerful 
insiders understand the county's fiscal condition. In that way, they can raid 
obscure funds, put off decisions and avoid the day when they must confront the 
fact that county spending exceeds income. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why so many people -- Wilson, liberal Democratic legislative leaders, 
Howard Jarvis conservatives -- question the county's figures. Reed is having 
trouble because she has tried to change the stubborn and secretive process.

JUDGE, WIFE GET $1.5 MILLION IN FIRE INSURANCE LAWSUIT; COURTS: HANCOCK PARK 
COUPLE IS AWARDED THE SUM FOR DISTRESS CAUSED BY FIRM'S HANDLING OF THEIR 
CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages Tuesday to a federal judge 
and his wife for mental and emotional distress they suffered because of the way 
an insurance company handled their claim after their Hancock Park house was 
seriously damaged by fire in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled that United Services Automobile 
Assn. of San Antonio violated "the duty of good faith and fair dealing" in 
processing the claim of U.S. District Judge Laughlin E. Waters and his wife, 
Voula. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury ordered the company to pay the judge $1 million and his wife 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is a major victory for the judge and his wife," said attorney 
William Shernoff of Claremont, the lead lawyer for the couple. "They've made 
the point they wanted to make in this trial -- that USAA was guilty of bad 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Waters declined comment until the jurors conclude their deliberations. 
They are still debating whether the Waterses should also be awarded punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, the jury foreman told Superior Court Judge G. Keith 
Wisot that the jurors had been divided 8 to 4 on the issue of punitive damages 
since Friday. A 9-3 vote is needed for a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisot asked the jurors to continue deliberations starting at 9 a.m. today and 
thanked them for their persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waterses filed suit nearly three years ago, charging that the insurance 
company had "low-balled" them in negotiations over how much it would cost to 
repair their house. The two sides were apart by about $120,000 at the time the 
lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the couple sued, the insurers accepted a bid of $424,000 by the 
company that the Waterses wanted to use, and renovations began. The insurance 
company also paid the couple $11,000 a month in relocation expenses for the 15 
months they were out of the house. But the couple did not drop their suit, 
saying the company should be punished for mistreating them. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question on a verdict form, the jurors said Tuesday that USAA 
was 100% responsible for the damages suffered by Judge Waters but only 75% 
responsible for the damages suffered by Mrs. Waters. The jury said she was 25% 
responsible for the damages she suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 No explanation was available on the jurors' reason for this decision, because 
the verdict form asked only for a "yes" or "no" answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shernoff said he was unsure why the jurors had made that decision. Guy 
Kornblum and Paul Fine, attorneys for the insurance company, declined comment 
on the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisot rejected a motion by Kornblum for a mistrial on the grounds that jurors 
had been influenced by a Times article on the case that was published May 8, 
the day before deliberations began. Wisot polled the jury, and no juror 
reported reading the article or being influenced by it.

FED HIKE HELPS STOCKS, BONDS BUT NOT DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buyers swarmed in stock and bond markets Tuesday after the Federal Reserve 
Board took a tough stand against inflation by raising short-term interest rates 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar failed to get a lift from the Fed's move, suggesting that 
foreign investors remain wary of U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrials, which had been up 12 points 
just before the Fed's afternoon announcement, rocketed to close up 49.11 points 
at 3,720.61 in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields tumbled nearly across the board. The 30-year 
Treasury bond yield plunged from Monday's 7.44% to 7.26%. The yield on 
three-year T-notes sank to 6.26% from 6.40%. Just one week ago, the Treasury 
was forced to pay 6.54% on new three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said investors were reacting both to the size of the Fed's rate hike 
-- half a point in the discount rate, from 3% to 3.5%, and half a point in the 
federal funds rate, from 3.75% to 4.25% -- and to the central bank's suggestion 
that this will be the last increase in short-term rates for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the time being, the message of the stock and bond markets is that the Fed 
has hit the bull's-eye," said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at First Albany 
Corp. "The Fed administered medicine strong enough to kill off worries about 
inflation but not harsh enough to hamper growth in the economy and corporate 
earnings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said the economy is now close to the "neutral point" that central 
bankers had been seeking -- the point at which interest rates are neither 
spurring economic growth nor retarding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they were impressed with the magnitude of the rally in stocks 
and bonds, but many also cautioned that both markets remain vulnerable. 
Investors who failed to sell out as stock and bond prices dove in recent months 
may take the opportunity to trim their portfolios as prices rebound, some 
experts say. That could restrain any rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the strength in some interest-rate-sensitive stock groups Tuesday 
indicated that Wall Street believes rates have peaked for now, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 That message was also apparent in bonds' rally, experts said: Yields on 
long-term mortgage and muni bonds plummeted with T-bond yields, as investors 
rushed to lock in current high returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But in currency markets, the dollar lost ground despite the Fed's move. 
Ordinarily, higher short-term rates should bolster the dollar by attracting 
more foreign investment to short-term U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar eased to 1.673 German marks from 1.674 on Monday. It 
also slipped to 104.45 Japanese yen from 104.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign investors believe U.S. rates remain less attractive than those 
offered by Germany or Japan after adjusting for inflation, some currency 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, buyers focused on banking, utility and 
insurance stocks, all of which should perform better if market interest rates 
stop rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Winners topped losers by 13 to 8 on the NYSE on active volume of 312 million 
shares. But broad market indexes were weaker than the blue chip Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks fell 0.39 point to 711.52, 
though it had been down more than 6 points at midday. Losers edged winners 14 
to 12 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Dow, some industrial names rose on new hopes for stable economic 
growth. Alcoa gained 2 1/8 to 70 1/2, Bethlehem Steel added 1 1/4 to 18 1/8, 
IBM jumped 2 3/4 to 61 1/4 and GM was up 1 3/8 to 54 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks jumped, helped in part by bankers' decision Tuesday to hike the 
prime lending rate to 7.25% from 6.25%. That will help offset banks' higher 
cost of funds because of the Fed rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Among major banks, Citicorp soared 1 3/4 to 38 7/8, First Interstate surged 1 
5/8 to 82 3/8, BankAmerica gained 1 7/8 to 48 3/8, Wells Fargo jumped 2 1/8 to 
146 7/8 and NationsBank gained 1 1/8 to 54 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the utility group, Detroit Edison added 5/8 to 25, Pacific Gas & Electric 
gained 3/4 to 24 1/4, Bell Atlantic leaped 1 5/8 to 52 7/8 and U.S. West jumped 
1 1/4 to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, many tech stocks weakened again. Lotus Development plunged 
3 7/8 to 52 on rumors about swelling software inventories, and computer chip 
maker Xilinx sank 7 to 39 1/2 on fears about slowing growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, markets were mixed ahead of the Fed's meeting. London's FTSE-100 
index added 7.9 points to 3,123.5, while Frankfurt's DAX index eased 11.40 
points to 2,259.71. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index fell 54.91 points to 20,133.53. 
</P>
<P>
 But Toronto and Mexico City stocks rallied with U.S. shares after the Fed made 
its move. Toronto's TSE-300 index jumped 60.87 points to 4,269.15, while Mexico 
City's Bolsa index gained 48.75 points to 2,288.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index jumped 328.29 points to 9,372.99, 
buoyed by Wall Street's gains. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, oil, gold and coffee prices fell, and commodities in 
general rested after Monday's surge.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; FIRM CLAIMS CHEAPER, BETTER MRI SCAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Magnetic resonance imaging has become an important medical diagnostic tool, 
but unfortunately for patients, it involves an average of 40 minutes in a 
claustrophobia-inducing metal tube. And the best images are obtained in the 
more expensive equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Superconductor Technologies, based in Santa Barbara, believes it has a way to 
cut down on the time spent in an MRI machine, improve image quality and reduce 
costs. The company says its SuperSensor Coil, based on high-temperature 
superconductor technology, will either produce equal-quality images in a 
quarter of the time or turn out images in the same time that are 50% to 150% 
better. This, in turn, will enable less expensive MRI machines to produce 
images of the same quality as those from the more expensive machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSensor is a surface coil that acts as an antenna when placed next to 
the body area being imaged. It can take the place of the copper coils currently 
used in MRI machines without any modification. 
</P>

 Smart dipsticks: In the 1980s, chemist Robert Kauffman and physicist Douglas 
Wolf at the University of Dayton developed a way to gauge more accurately the 
remaining useful life of engine oils in military aircraft. The Air Force used 
their "smart dipstick" during Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the university has entered into two joint ventures to make a family of 
instruments for assessing engine -- and cooking -- oil. The "smart dipstick" 
uses a computerized electrochemical sensor that measures the oil's level of 
antioxidant, an additive that slows an oil's degradation. The antioxidant level 
tells when an oil has lost its lubricating or cooking properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluitec, a Dayton-based company, will market the technology primarily to the 
lubricating oil and fuel industries. Herguth Laboratories, an analytical 
laboratory in Vallejo, Calif., has purchased Fluitec's hand-held RULER 
(Remaining Useful Life Evaluation Routine) to help the nuclear power industry 
know when to change the oil in reactor coolant pumps. Alas for motorists, the 
devices will cost $1,500 to $3,500 each. Gem City Engineering, another Dayton 
company, will test a smart dipstick at Rally's, a fast-food chain.

 Transistor crush: As semiconductor makers cram more transistors onto smaller 
silicon chips, the problem of how to prevent the transistors from interfering 
with each other grows. The transistor, after all, is a switch that is either on 
or off. When on, it carries a current that may leak to other transistors, 
turning them on when they shouldn't be. When there were fewer transistors on a 
chip, transistors could be insulated from one another by tiny walls. But the 
more transistors, the less room for all that insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two technologies have emerged to deal with this problem. The most common is 
called "silicon on insulator." SOI puts the insulator under the transistor, 
because researchers believe the leaking current travels downward into the 
silicon before jumping to another transistor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi, a Japanese semiconductor maker, is using this technique in its 
most advanced memory under development, the 256-megabyte dynamic random access 
memory chip. Motorola and IBM are also developing chips using SOI. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative is being pursued at AT&T's Bell Labs. Rather than injecting 
insulation below the surface of the entire silicon wafer, as is done in SOI, 
two tiny areas of insulation are created under each transistor. Bell 
researchers say this achieves the same effect with less damage to the wafer.

 Tracking rapists: Technology developed for cellular telephone networks and 
satellite tracking of mobile missiles may help police better predict where a 
serial rapist will strike next. University of Virginia researchers have 
developed software that tries to predict not only where the rapist will show up 
next, but even where he lives. Experience shows that serial rapists tend to be 
either "locals" who strike mostly around their homes, or "marauders" who travel 
in search of victims. Using data from 700 rape cases of a serial nature, the 
researchers have tried to "reverse-engineer" the reasoning of the rapists in 
choosing locations. A few patterns have already emerged: Rapists tend to travel 
north and south of their homes, for example.

 Oops! Folks at Comsat Video Enterprises chuckled after they read last week 
about their video-on-demand system for hotel rooms. They rightly noted that 
having hotel workers slamming tapes into VCRs would be something like the 
Flintstones' keeping a creature under the sink to serve as a garbage disposal. 
In fact, Comsat's computer-controlled video recorders -- a minimum of 30, 
sometimes more than 100 of them -- are pre-loaded. When a movie is ordered, a 
computer switches that machine on and sends the movie to the guest's TV.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; ADIOS, AMIGA -- YOU HAD THE KNOW-HOW BUT NOT THE NICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It aimed to be the world's best game computer. By the time it was introduced 
in late 1985, it was instead the most technologically sophisticated personal 
computer of its time, but it lacked a clearly defined market niche and 
application software. 
</P>
<P>
 When it finally did find its niche, it revolutionized television and video 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Amiga and its troubled producer, Commodore International Ltd. of West 
Chester, Pa., are gone, victims of a personal computing world where the path to 
success isn't based merely on innovation: Tapping into a mass market is also 
vital. 
</P>
<P>
 The IBM PC and its legion of clones replaced typewriters, desktop calculators 
and drawers full of files in millions of offices. The Apple Macintosh gave 
professional-quality typesetting to the masses while replacing traditional 
typesetting equipment in small print shops, along with the pens and ink and 
rub-off symbols used by graphic artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Commodore, what the Amiga ended up replacing was a few very 
expensive computer and video production systems that a few people used to make 
animation and titles and fancy transitions from one video image to another. In 
the process, it created a new video cottage industry. But it found too few 
niches on the desktops of corporate America or in the family rooms of middle 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amiga, which had the most powerful graphics capabilities of any small 
computer when it was introduced, might have found a more permanent place if its 
designers had stuck with their early aspirations of making a super game 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe out of Commodore's announced liquidation, the Amiga, or at least 
parts of it, will end up in the next generation of someone else's super game 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 When the original Amiga was introduced in 1985, it used the same Motorola 
68000 microprocessor as the Apple Macintosh. But it also had three custom 
graphics processing chips that could manipulate much of the screen display 
without the help of the 68000 chip. In an era when you could go out for coffee 
waiting for the Mac to redraw its screen after making a change to a drawing, 
the Amiga was capable of real-time animation. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an era when the IBM PC could produce eight colors on its screen and the 
Mac none, the Amiga could easily show 32 colors -- and 4,096 colors were 
possible with special programming. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, however, there were problems. The Amiga's Santa Clara, 
Calif.-based designer was bought by Commodore while the innovative computer was 
still in development. When it finally arrived on dealers' shelves, it had a 
crude, unfinished operating system and a low-resolution "workbench" interface 
that belied the machine's sophisticated graphics features. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodore had once been a serious player in the small-business computing 
market in the late 1970s with its Pet. But by 1985, it was best known as the 
maker of the low-priced, low-powered, low-reliability Commodore 64 game 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 And it had undergone major management upheaval with the departure the previous 
year of Jack Tramiel, the man who had built Commodore into a home computing 
powerhouse. Tramiel's subsequent purchase of troubled Atari and development of 
computers that more clearly targeted the home market didn't help Commodore's 
future, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it simply wasn't very credible in 1985 that the company that defined the 
bottom end of home computing was suddenly also going to supply the most 
sophisticated multi-tasking, four-channel stereo, high-speed graphics computer 
of its day. As a result, most major computer dealers wanted nothing to do with 
the Amiga. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no mass market for high-performance computers in those days, so 
Commodore's failure to get the Amiga onto the shelves of corporate-oriented 
dealerships was a serious blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Software was slow to come for the Amiga, which was incompatible with any other 
computer of the day. (Eventually, however, it became the only computer capable 
of running both IBM and Macintosh software in addition to its own programs.) 
</P>
<P>
 And when software did appear, it was the kind that appealed mostly to computer 
hackers or animation artists, not secretaries or bookkeepers or middle managers 
or even neighborhood print shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the problems, the Amiga had one feature that no other personal 
computer could match: It could deliver a signal that matched the standard for 
televised images. That artifact, from its original conception as a game machine 
that would use a TV set for its monitor, made the Amiga the only choice for 
low-cost video processing. 
</P>
<P>
 People could feed in images from videotape and overlay titles or graphic 
images, re-recording the results back out to videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually a company called NewTek in Topeka, Kan., built an expansion board 
and software for the Amiga, called Video Toaster, launching this embryonic 
video industry into high gear. With a little training, a little money, a lot of 
imagination and a lot of patience, it was possible to create 
professional-quality video effects, ranging from fancy titles and scene 
transitions to complete animated features. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the Amiga was a must-have machine, from the local cable franchise to 
the networks to MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 A resurrection of the Amiga is doubtful. Its video features are already 
available on specialized add-in boards for the Macintosh and the PC, so the 
industry it created will live on without it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short history of personal computing, however, the Amiga's nine-year 
life span left a meteoritic trail that will persist long after its death.

 BOYS TOWN WEST: It was 77 years ago that Father Edward J. Flanagan founded 
Boys Town near Omaha, Neb. Since then it's expanded nationwide, with three 
programs in Southern California. . . . Tuesday, the first Boys Town in Orange 
County was dedicated. Its five long-term residential homes in Trabuco Canyon 
are expected to start housing up to 30 troubled juvenile referrals next month. 
They call it Boys Town, but the homes are open to both girls and boys.

 STILL HOPE? You thought you'd blown your chance to see Barbra Streisand at The 
Pond at Anaheim? A trickle of Streisand tickets is expected to flow back into 
the public pipeline as her six-show stand there nears. . . . At least one 
charity that received $350 tickets -- to resell privately at a premium -- was 
able to move only 100 of its 250-seat allotment, and has returned the rest to 
be sold publicly. Promoter Alex Hodges advises Streisand fans to contact the 
Pond box office (714) 704-2500 or Ticketmaster (714) 740-2000 to see whether 
any tickets have been freed up.

 COOKIE LOVERS: What's blue, has large eyes, and loves chocolate chip cookies? 
If you have a child 4 or younger, you likely know that it's the Cookie Monster. 
He's one of the original characters on public TV's Sesame Street, which is 
celebrating its 25th anniversary. . . . The traveling Sesame Street show will 
be at the Pond at Anaheim Thursday through Sunday. But Cookie Monster makes a 
special visit today to Children's Hospital in Orange, where a spokeswoman says 
youngsters can hardly wait. 
</P>
<P>
 HOMECOMING: A different kind of party is planned at the UC Irvine Birthing 
Center in Anaheim. Since it opened in late 1991, with homelike birthing rooms, 
1,500 babies have been born there. They're all invited to a birthday party and 
public open house there Saturday. . . . The center, run by the UCI Medical 
Center, is operated entirely by certified nurse-midwives. Its officials claim 
it appeals to "women who prefer the high-touch, family-centered environment."

DANA PARSONS: PASTOR'S BELIEF IN CONVICTED KILLER'S INNOCENCE IS A MATTER OF 
FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Baumann knows all about faith. He knows all about trust. As pastor of 
Blessed Sacrament Episcopal Church, he must practice both. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about his faith and trust in Bobby Janoe, now a convicted wife-killer 
sentenced to life without parole? Why has Baumann, a soft-spoken 45-year-old 
who has guided parishioners through some of life's most unfair moments in his 
20-year career, rallied to the cause of a man who, prosecutors say, bludgeoned 
his wife to death while she slept? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Baumann is convinced Janoe is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Tuesday morning and Baumann is sitting in his small rectory office, 
speaking frankly about the Bobby Janoe who had a criminal history as a two-time 
bank robber and a drinking problem. That was the Bobby Janoe who existed before 
1986, Baumann says, not the man he met that year and who, even as a long-haired 
biker, became a trusted parishioner to members of the Placentia church's mostly 
conservative congregation. Not the man who stayed sober after attending 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, got a job as a diesel mechanic, greeted 
churchgoers at the door and conducted anti-drug programs for youthful 
parishioners. The new Janoe, now 35, is also the man who has written Baumann a 
couple dozen letters since his arrest more than two years ago. Baumann keeps 
them in a tidy green folder in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 That Janoe is not a man who could have coldbloodedly murdered his wife in 
their bed and then dumped her body a few miles away, Baumann says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that neither Janoe nor Baumann can prove his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letters show a pattern of increasing depth," Baumann says. "They're 
saying, 'I shouldn't be here,' 'Where is God in this?' 'Why is this happening 
to me?' 'I'm looking for answers.' " Baumann says Janoe's tone isn't 
complaining, but searching. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the letters, Janoe writes: "You are not wrong, Father Baumann, and 
thanks for standing by your convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 "His questions are spiritual," Baumann says. "Those are the deepest kind of 
questions. Those are the most convincing to me. He's saying, 'I'm trying to 
understand why this is happening to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For various reasons, Baumann doesn't think Janoe got a fair trial. He then 
concedes he didn't attend the trial, because he expected to be a witness and 
therefore wasn't allowed to listen to other testimony. I tell him Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Lewis Rosenblum says the evidence, while circumstantial, was 
overwhelming. The jury deliberated just over three hours in returning a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask the priest if it's possible he's been conned by Janoe. "It's possible. I 
think it's unlikely but it's possible, I have to admit that. The evidence 
against that is that I've had experience in areas like this before and so far I 
haven't been conned, to my knowledge. And the pattern Bob established here over 
a long period of time is completely out of character with what he's accused 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann said it would be more plausible to believe Janoe killed his wife, Joy, 
in a momentary rage, but Rosenblum argued that the murder was premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although believing in Janoe's innocence, Baumann's tone isn't shrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important for me is the truth; not to get somebody off," Baumann says. 
"If he did it, then he's where he should be. If I were convinced he did it, I 
would still maintain contact with him, as long as he wanted it. And I would 
urge him to admit it and get right with God." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying circumstantial-evidence cases are often more reliable than 
direct-evidence cases -- because of the cumulative weight of evidence -- 
Rosenblum said he's certain of Janoe's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Baumann's advocacy, Rosenblum said, "He's entitled to his opinion, but 
I would venture to say that people present a different image when they're out 
in public and at their parish than their actions behind closed doors when they 
abuse their children and batter their spouses. There are a lot of people who 
beat up women and abuse children who are respected in the community. . . . 
They're very good at manipulating people and putting up a good front, and a lot 
of well-intentioned people fall for their act." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann insists his support of Janoe isn't an act of blind faith. He simply 
says he isn't convinced the truth came out during Janoe's trial. And although 
Baumann is steadfast in his support, the case is not an obsession with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the one great thing I'm doing," he says. "I told Bob I would pray 
for him every day and I do."

AFTERNOON SHOWERS BRING TRAFFIC SNARLS; WEATHER: THREE TRUCKS AND AT LEAST 12 
OTHER VEHICLES COLLIDE ON RAIN-SLICKED SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY. MORE RAIN IS 
EXPECTED.

 Winter made yet another springtime visit to the Southland on Tuesday, bringing 
scattered showers and cool temperatures to the San Fernando Valley. 
Meteorologists, blaming a deep trough of low pressure hovering over most of the 
Golden State, said similar weather is expected over the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem caused by the intermittent showers Tuesday was a collision 
on the westbound side of the Simi Valley Freeway that involved three 
semi-trucks, an empty school bus and at least 11 other vehicles, according to 
the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only minor injuries resulting from the accident that occurred near 
the San Diego Freeway interchange, but traffic was blocked for almost two hours 
while the many wrecks were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 It started about 1:05 p.m., according to CHP Officer Jeff Ferber, when a 
semi-truck driving too fast for the rain-slicked road braked, skidded and 
"drove over" a pickup truck ahead of it. Other cars swerved to avoid the crash, 
Ferber said, with some crashing into each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later another semi-truck approaching the scene could not stop in time 
and jackknifed over a Buick driven by a State Farm insurance adjuster, Ferber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Volkswagen "Bug" slid into the second big rig and then a third semi-truck 
rear-ended an empty school bus that had stopped for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a huge, huge mess," Ferber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three people who sustained injuries serious enough to be taken to Holy 
Cross Medical Center were all treated and released. Among them was a 2-year-old 
girl riding in the Volkswagen who suffered a hand laceration. She was thrown 
into the windshield when the car slid into the pileup, Ferber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division 
reported at least five rain-related accidents on surface streets that occurred 
during the afternoon shower. 
</P>
<P>
 As for today's weather, there is a 30% chance of showers in the Los Angeles 
Basin and that will diminish to 20% by Thursday, said Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chance of showers will continue to diminish throughout the week, 
Brack said, cloudy days are expected through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he said, up to 0.4 inches of rain fell in some parts of the 
Valley.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FIRM TURNING AT-RISK YOUTHS INTO MERCHANTS

 A Glendale espresso manufacturing company is turning junior high students and 
gang members into coffee merchants.  
</P>
<P>
 Piacere International, situated in the city's industrial section near Disney 
Imagineering, has partnered with a local nonprofit group, "We Care . . . For 
Youth," in an effort to keep adolescents out of gangs by giving them business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Forquer, president and founder of Piacere, is providing about 50 13- and 
14-year-olds from Toll Middle School the training in coffee bean sales that the 
teen-agers can use to run their own coffee distributorships. 
</P>
<P>
 Piacere, which Forquer -- a former East Los Angeles gang member -- founded in 
his 50s, manufactures espresso machines and roasts beans grown on the company's 
coffee plantations in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In the training sessions, at-risk students learn how to build clientele. They 
are required after operating their distributorship for several months to turn 
over their accounts to another student of their choosing, Forquer said. 
</P>
<P>
 This will cause a "domino effect" in the community, allowing more and more 
youths who are in gangs or considering joining one to own their own business -- 
taking them off the streets -- he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Maxwell, co-founder of the 2-year-old "We Care . . . For Youth," said 
giving at-risk students a business of their own increases their self-esteem and 
provides them with a sense of future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Piacere provides a lab for what we try to teach these kids -- to look to 
themselves for support and not to gangs," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Care . . . For Youth" -- based in Glendale -- has helped more than 900 
junior high students both in the Glendale Unified and Los Angeles Unified 
school districts who were in gangs or at risk of joining a gang, Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization teaches youth to recognize prejudice and to fight racism, as 
well as how to dress for business and how to rely on, and believe in, 
themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Banner, assistant principal at Toll Middle School, said teachers and 
parents have seen students take lessons -- including one that teaches youth how 
to talk through problems -- learned in the program back into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only use terms like incredible, marvelous and fantastic to describe 
this program," Banner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Sexton, 14, said skills she learned in a basic job training program 
provided by "We Care . . . For Youth" helped her get a job as a cashier at the 
Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program showed me not to depend on anyone, because basically you have to 
rely on yourself, you have to start managing your money and your time," Lisa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piacere plans a fund-raiser Sunday to benefit "We Care . . . For Youth." Funds 
collected from the $30 ticket price will be donated to the nonprofit group.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 are expected to attend the dessert-and-espresso party, to be 
held from 4 to 6 p.m. in the parking lot at Piacere International Headquarters, 
1101 Air Way in Glendale. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 Amid a laundry list of appropriations, the Los Angeles City Council voted 
Tuesday to set aside $30,000 in next year's budget to study the possibility of 
converting a Canoga Park movie theater that shows X-rated films into a 
performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of Councilwoman Laura Chick, the council agreed to spend $30,000 
to determine whether it is feasible to buy and repair the quake-damaged 
Pussycat Theatre on Sherman Way for use as a community theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The X-rated movie theater has been a sore point for Canoga Park business 
owners who complained to Chick that the theater has contributed to the 
deterioration of the business climate in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to convert the theater to a community arts center was proposed by the 
Winnetka Chamber of Commerce and the West Valley Symphony Orchestra after the 
Jan. 17 quake severely damaged and closed the Pussycat Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of clearing damaged portions of the building and 
reinforcing the theater range from $700,000 to $1 million, said Karen Constine, 
Chick's chief of staff. The building owner has discussed with orchestra 
representatives the idea of selling the building, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study approved by the council will evaluate the cost of converting the 
building into a 500-seat performing center and project the theater's annual 
maintenance and operating costs, Constine said. HUGO MARTIN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS WILL RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Unified School District Supt. Arthur Pierce announced his retirement 
Tuesday -- effective mid-July -- after seven years with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves the district at a time when the school board is still searching for 
a way to rebuild schools after the April failure of the $100-million bond 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always leaving issues behind," Pierce said. "The very nature of public 
administration is that there are always issues building and being left 
unsettled." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said he made his decision to retire last week, before he was named 
along with the school district and board of education in a lawsuit filed by 
former Burbank High Principal Keiko Hentell, who charged that her civil rights 
were violated when her contract was not continued and she was later removed 
from her job. Pierce said the lawsuit had nothing to do with his decision to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Rhode Island who moved to Burbank from a position as a 
superintendent in Maine, Pierce cited personal reasons for his retirement, 
saying his three children now live in New England. His oldest daughter's 
husband, who is in the Coast Guard, recently was transferred to Portland, Me. A 
son, who graduated from UC Irvine, is in graduate school in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce has been schools superintendent in four different communities during 
the past 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time comes when you need to get on with the rest of your life," Pierce 
said, pointing to the conversion of Burbank's junior high schools to middle 
schools as one of his most significant accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement will officially be effective Aug. 16, but with accumulated 
vacation time, Pierce's last day on the job will be in mid-July. He will be 
returning to Maine, where he owns two pieces of property -- one on an island, 
the other near a ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the natural disasters and other problems that have plagued 
California, Pierce said he will miss this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has lots going for it," Pierce said. "This is just a wonderfully 
rich environment in which to live." ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY MAY USE BIRTH CONTROL FOR PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal rights activists donated about $125 worth of birth control-spiked 
pigeon feed to the Glendale City Council on Tuesday and asked that the city 
consider buying additional feed from an out-of-state supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would need to go outside the state to acquire enough feed to control 
its pigeon population because Ornitrol, the birth control drug used on the 
feed, is no longer manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 Activist Bill Dyer and Wildlife Protection League representatives said they 
purchased 25 pounds of pigeon feed laced with Ornitrol for the city to use as a 
"starter kit" in conjunction with an ordinance banning public pigeon feeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The council backed away from a plan to trap and kill pigeons by putting them 
in cloth bags and then tying the bags to the tailpipe of a running car after 
more than 120 residents and activists called City Hall to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens accepted the Ornitrol-spiked seed but asked city staff to 
research whether the Environmental Protection Agency allows use of the bird 
birth-control drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of Ornitrol-covered pigeon feed is one of several alternatives that were 
recommended to the council to control the central business district's 
burgeoning pigeon population. Officials estimate that the downtown flock 
includes as many as 10,000 birds, which mess downtown awnings, ledges and 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed concern about the Ornitrol feed alternative after 
City Manager David Ramsay cautioned them about the scarce supply of the feed 
and the product's price.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than 10,000 pounds of whole corn covered with Ornitrol exist. The supply 
has dwindled since Avitrol Corp. stopped making the bird birth-control drug 
last year, said Betty Swindle, Avitrol communications manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Avitrol, based in Tulsa, Okla., bought rights to manufacture Ornitrol in the 
early 1970s. The company -- which discontinued manufacturing Ornitrol because 
of poor sales -- was the sole manufacturer of the drug in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those products that everyone talks about it and wants to be 
around it, but no one purchases it," Swindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ornitrol cost about $5 a pound when Lloyd Pest Control of San Diego bought its 
last batch before Avitrol stopped making the drug, said entomologist Herb 
Field. Lloyd Pest Control helped the city of San Diego reduce the pigeon 
population in Balboa Park from 5,000 to 1,000 birds using the spiked feed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the drug to be effective, about 75 pounds of Ornitrol must be fed to 100 
birds over a 10-day period every six months, Swindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city decides to use Ornitrol-spiked feed it must also implement other 
measures because of the drug's short supply, said Leslie Press, with the 
Washington, D.C.-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is studying use of an ordinance that would prohibit pigeon feeding in 
certain parts of the city and is drafting a request for proposals to trap and 
relocate downtown pigeons. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; LIGHTING ASSESSMENT LEFT UNCHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time has run out for the city of San Fernando to change the formula by which 
property owners pay for street lighting in the next fiscal year, despite a push 
to ease the burden on some homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been on the table for a year," said Councilwoman Joanne Baltierrez, who 
argued for the city to change the assessment district Monday night. "What faith 
will the people have with their city government?" 
</P>
<P>
 At its Monday meeting the council considered and rejected changes to the 
assessment district, which charges more to owners of corner lots than those who 
live mid-block, based on a formula that properties with a larger street 
frontage should pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 The average yearly assessment for a 50-foot-frontage residential property is 
now $26. 
</P>
<P>
 The current formula assumes that owners of corner lots get more advantage from 
street lighting than other properties. However, some residents have complained 
that the system is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Four alternatives to the current system, in place for 13 years, were presented 
to the council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to meet a county imposed August deadline to change the tax assessment 
district for the 1994-95 fiscal year, the council would have had to adopt a new 
plan Monday in time to set a public hearing in July to get input from 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A public hearing (in July) would be meaningless," said Councilman Raul 
Godinez II, explaining that any choice the city makes now would not be a fully 
informed decision and would be made without true public input. And, even if the 
City Council wanted to make a further change after a July hearing, it could 
never hold a necessary follow-up hearing in time to meet the county deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, at the urging of Councilman Doude Wysbeek, the council voted 3 to 2 
to put off any change to the district until next year and to start a series of 
public hearings July 11 on the issue. Baltierrez and Councilwoman Rosa Chacon, 
who wanted to change the district Monday night, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives to the current system include offering a discount to low-income 
property owners; setting up a flat rate for different types of property, such 
as residential, apartment buildings and commercial/industrial; offering a break 
on the cost to corner lots, and increasing the percentage of the assessment 
district that multifamily and apartment buildings pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The council votes on the assessment district each year, and since 1980 has not 
changed the district.  
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council missed the deadline to alter the district, it would have 
to pay $276,000 out of the city General Fund to run the street lighting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no quick and easy answers where money is concerned," Wysbeek said. ED 
BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GEOLOGIST TO DISCUSS EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private consulting and engineering geologist with 20 years experience 
studying the Santa Monica Mountains will meet with Sherman Oaks homeowners 
tonight to help them understand how and why the Northridge earthquake damaged 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners association President Richard Close said Frank Denison would speak 
to the question still on the lips of many in the area: "Why was Sherman Oaks so 
devastated in the earthquake and was so far from the epicenter?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Close, about 70% of the residences on hard-hit Willis Avenue 
between the Ventura Freeway and Ventura Boulevard were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Denison will offer his theories on why Sherman Oaks sustained the specific 
kind of damage it did during the Jan. 17 temblor, and discuss ways to improve 
local earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Noteworthy geological features of the area, ones that should be taken into 
account when discussing earthquake-safe building issues, Denison said, include: 
high ground-water levels north of Ventura Boulevard to the Los Angeles River; 
and old, less stringent landscaping codes that were in place during much of the 
construction on the south side of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the homes and structures to the south, he said, were built in the late 
1930s and early 1940s, before the improved grading code of the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting, city Planning Department officials will discuss the 
current revising of the Sherman Oaks General Plan, Close said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 8 p.m. at the Union Federal Savings building, 
13300 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MERCHANTS RECRUITED TO TACKLE CRIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merchants in western Van Nuys are being recruited to work with police to 
tackle problems ranging from graffiti to grand theft auto as part of a new 
Corporate / Business Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get 100 people at the first meeting, to get a graffiti cleanup 
unit going, to try to prevent robberies from happening," said Shelly Joanis, 
co-owner of Lutz Copies & Printing."We want people to become aware of these 
things and control it before it gets out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The watch will include merchants from Woodley Avenue to Balboa Boulevard and 
from Victory to Roscoe boulevards. A questionnaire is being distributed this 
week asking business owners when they would prefer to meet and if they would 
volunteer their facility for meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Officer Joe Losorelli said he will meet with the merchants 
to tell them of crime "hot spots" in the area, as well as offer crime-fighting 
tips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a problem with grand theft auto around the airport and business 
parking lots, a huge problem with graffiti and gang members," Losorelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will train owners how to prevent burglaries, educate employees to deal 
with crime, secure parking lots and put together emergency phone lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanis, who has been in business in the area for 12 years, said she was 
prompted to form the group after witnessing a local Neighborhood Watch group's 
impact on curbing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do something that unifies the residents and the businesses," 
Joanis said. "We want to be more proactive." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 3 AREA STUDENTS WIN VOLUNTEER GROUP'S 
AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mention the word "teen-ager" today and many think of gangs, drugs, guns and 
violence. At the North Hollywood-based East Valley Coordinating Council, 
however, the term evokes thoughts of leadership, hope and visions of America's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday, the council, a 62-year-old community-based volunteer group that 
serves North Hollywood, Studio City and Toluca Lake, honored three of its 
area's "best and brightest" with certificates and $75 checks at its 44th annual 
awards luncheon held at the First United Methodist Church in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognized for their academic achievements, community service and standing as 
youth role models were: Frank Ray Griggs, 17, an 11th grader from Zoo Magnet 
School; Katherine Fox, 18, a senior from Grant High School, and Maurice 
Shivers, 17, a senior from North Hollywood High School. The three also received 
award certificates from the offices of County Supervisor Ed Edelman and L.A. 
City Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 Shivers, a basketball player, aspiring actor, student council member and 
commissioner of athletics at North Hollywood High, was "surprised and happy" to 
learn he'd won an award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know until two weeks ago that I was nominated by my English 
teacher," he said. Shivers, who has a 3.6 grade point average, will attend UC 
Santa Barbara and major in mechanical engineering.  
</P>
<P>
 The Grant High senior plans to attend Pepperdine University and major in 
business administration. Nominated by both her pastor at First Presbyterian 
Church and her Sea Explorer Scout leader, Fox has served two terms as treasurer 
of her troop. She's certified in water safety and CPR, and also works as a 
baby-sitter. At church she's a youth choir member, deacon, Sunday school 
teacher, camp counselor, editor of the newsletter and was a 1992 delegate to 
the Presbyterian Youth Triennium held at Purdue, Ind.  
</P>
<P>
 Winner Griggs wasn't always a model citizen. Five years ago he was having 
trouble with his attitude, school, family and substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family, girlfriend and support system hung in there and I turned my life 
completely around," he says. Now clean and sober for two years and a magnet 
honor student who's enlisting in the Marines this June, Griggs says he's trying 
to help others avoid his mistakes by working as a teen counselor with the group 
"Because I Love You." 
</P>
<P>
 He also volunteers as a speaker on substance-abuse panels and works part-time 
at AMC Theaters in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its student awards, the council also honored Lin White, 
founding artistic and stage director of the Los Angeles Music Theatre Company, 
with its Citizen of the Year Award; Dorothy Barrett, founder and director of 
the Academy Children's Workshop, with its Humanitarian Award, and the Rev. John 
Moody, pastor of First Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood, with a special 
recognition award for outstanding community service on behalf of his church and 
the area's Interfaith Council. JIM CROGAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FAMILY CARE CENTER CANCELS OPEN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An open house for a family care center in Sun Valley, planned for Friday, has 
been canceled because the center failed to get an anticipated state grant 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers had been planning to hold the open house at the East Valley Family 
Care Center regardless of whether they got the grant, but the emotional impact 
of losing funding was stronger than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to wait until we have something to celebrate," said Ann 
Britt, chairwoman of the center's board. "The emotions are so low right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The $400,000 grant would have been used to renovate two bungalows at Glenwood, 
turning them into medical clinics for immunizations, screenings and referrals, 
and to also create a parenting center. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the money from the state Department of Education, the center will seek 
funding through private donations. "We're definitely moving ahead with this," 
Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had received a $50,000 planning grant from the state last year, and 
with volunteer help and the support of local agencies such as United Way, North 
Hollywood Rotary Club and Valley Community Clinic, had expanded the center. 
Counseling sessions were started and a dental chair was donated to the center 
from the Rotary, although a dental clinic has not been started yet. It began as 
a program for Glenwood Elementary parents two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The open house will be delayed until about October, when organizers expect to 
get the free dental clinic operating. ED BOND

SIMI STANDARDIZES SOIL STUDY GUIDELINES; SEISMIC SAFETY: THE CITY COUNCIL'S 
GOAL IS TO HELP RESIDENTS IN HILLY AREAS AND NEAR FAULT LINES BUILD MORE 
QUAKE-RESISTANT HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to help Simi Valley residents build earthquake-resistant homes, the 
City Council has adopted standardized guidelines for soil studies and quake 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the city has required such studies, called geotechnical reports, for 
all private developments in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in-depth ground studies, called geological reports, are required 
for developments in hilly areas and in areas along the Simi-Santa Rosa fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, however, consultants prepared these reports on their own, without 
any direction from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many consultants have asked the city if we have guidelines, but until now we 
have not, so they have provided services on their own personal discretion," 
Public Works Director Ron Coons told the council. "In some cases we believe 
better service could be given with these guidelines in place." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the guidelines, consultants should check for liquefaction, soil 
composition, slope stability and the potential for ground ruptures. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are not mandatory, but are meant to aid homeowners and 
consultants helping them to repair or rebuild after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines direct consultants taking stock of earthquake damage to 
describe and draw in detail cracks and other earthquake damage, outline the 
possible causes of the damage and suggest what could be done to keep it from 
happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine active earthquake faults run under Simi Valley, according to the city's 
General Plan. The Northridge quake was the most severe in the city's 24-year 
history, causing more than $350 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, the State Department of Mines and Geology is conducting 
a special study of soil stability in a severely damaged area on the 
southeastern side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The city requested the study after residents complained that large cracks 
under their homes were continuing to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists are monitoring the movement of the ground in the area, taking 
aerial photographs and testing the soil along the Arroyo Simi from Kuehner 
Drive to Stearns Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is scheduled to be completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monday night meeting, a representative from a local geology company 
asked the council to postpone adoption of the new guidelines until after the 
state completes its study. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know what this state study will turn up," Jeff Holt of Mountain 
Geology told the council. "It would be good to wait and see what they find." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Greg Stratton said he is eager to put the guidelines in place, 
adding that they could be modified when the state study is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guidelines are better than no guidelines at all," Stratton said. "Maybe 
it's not perfect but it is a step in the right direction."

LATE RAINS, COMING SUMMER HEAT MEAN IT'S TIME TO FIGHT FLEAS; ENVIRONMENT: 
EXPERTS SAY WE'LL SEE A LOT OF THE PESTS THIS YEAR. THEY OFFER SOME TIPS FOR 
COMBATTING THE INSECTS.

 Summer is coming, and with it beach parties and back-yard barbecues. But 
warmer temperatures and increased humidity also bring those tiny blood-sucking 
varmints that attack man and beast alike: fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year looks like a bad one. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the late rains, you can bet we'll see a lot of fleas," said Larry 
Day of the Grand Avenue Pet Hospital in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are mostly a nuisance, although if little kids get lots of bites, and 
they continually scratch them, they can cause a secondary infection," said 
Kelsey Onaga, a specialist with the Los Angeles County Environmental Health 
Department's Vectorborn Disease Surveillance and Entomology Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas are around all year, but they are most bothersome in summer because they 
reproduce best in warm, damp environments. In late spring, there is literally a 
population explosion of the pesky critters, which have hidden all winter long 
in front yards, beneath rose bushes and in the cracks of sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to go on the offensive: Veterinarians and pest-control experts say 
spraying now could prevent a serious flea infestation later. 
</P>
<P>
 First, check household pets carefully. Any fleas you see on a dog or cat have 
plenty of friends who are probably all over your house. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule of thumb, for every flea you find, there are 100 more in your 
environment," said Scott Chaness, president of Fleabusters, a pest-control 
company with offices throughout Southern California. "The flea continues to lay 
eggs all day long, and a lot of those eggs fall onto carpets." 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, Americans spend nearly $1 billion on flea control and prevention, 
according to flea-product maker Miles Inc. of Kansas City. Some of it goes for 
a variety of pills and potions, gizmos and gadgets that don't work, said 
Granada Hills veterinarian William M. Bender. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the so-called flea fighters Dr. Bender finds ineffective: flea collars 
(including ultrasonic collars), yeast/garlic tablets, organic flea repellents 
and organic bedding. Bender also does not recommend topical insecticides, which 
are absorbed into a pet's bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas are particularly difficult to get rid of because they breed so rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 A female flea lays up to 50 eggs every day. The tiny eggs, which resemble 
grains of salt, are resistant to pesticides. A small larvae hatches from an 
egg, and later spins a silky web around itself in the pupa stage of 
development. Finally, an adult flea emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 From start to finish, the reproduction process takes two weeks in optimum 
weather conditions. In cold temperatures, a flea egg remains dormant 
indefinitely until spurred by warm temperatures and humidity. The flea's 
average life span is about eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even if a dog or cat has been dipped in flea bath and the house has been 
fogged, eggs in the carpet continue to hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaness of Fleabusters said that besides grooming pets and brushing off the 
insects, it is also important for pet owners to spray their homes and yards. He 
said over-the-counter sprays and powders work fine, but because the killing 
agents do not last long they must be applied regularly to kill eggs that have 
not yet hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleabusters claims its treatment is effective for up to one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly strong for its minute size, an adult flea -- the size of the ball 
in a ballpoint pen -- can jump 13 inches. The wingless insects, which pass 
readily from animal to animal, puncture the skin with their sharp beak and suck 
out blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas are generally more annoying than harmful, except to pets and people who 
are allergic to them, Onaga said. But the critters can cause some serious 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleas can carry murine typhus, a debilitating disease that causes severe 
flu-like symptoms. The disease, which mostly affects people in their 50s and 
60s, is passed on to humans by fleas that have bitten field possums, said 
Onaga. He added that, fortunately, few cases of murine typhus have been 
reported in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, pets suffer from the annual onslaught of fleas the most, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dogs and cats suffer from allergic reactions to flea bites, often leading 
to severe skin irritations and sores. Fleas can also carry dog and cat 
tapeworms and can cause anemia especially in young or weak animals, according 
to veterinarian Bender.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECTED 'WHITE POWER' GROUP MEMBER ARRESTED 
</P>

<P>
 An 18-year-old youth suspected of belonging to a "white power" group involved 
in several racially motivated fights with students at Canyon High School was 
arrested Tuesday as he drove near the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Jace Edwards of Canyon Country was taken into custody by Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's deputies shortly after noon several blocks from the school, said 
Deputy John Hudson of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on suspicion of driving with a suspended license and 
possessing a deadly weapon. Two knifes and "a couple of other instruments that 
could be used as clubs" were found in his car, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards is in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Edwards may have been involved in two fights near the school 
grounds May 10 that involved between 20 to 30 students. The incidents 
apparently were sparked by the white power group when its members confronted a 
group of white, black and Latino students.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said witnesses told them Edwards is one of numerous people 
involved, although his possible role in the brawls is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean he was there, but he's been mentioned to us and could be 
possibly involved," Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The white power group -- possibly consisting of skinheads, Neo-Nazis or other 
white supremacy sympathizers -- is made up mostly of non-students, according to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards is not a student at Canyon High School. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious injuries resulted from the disputes, but sheriff's deputies showed 
up in force the following day to prevent a rumored large-scale fight from 
occurring. Hudson said deputies have been patrolling the campus in small 
numbers since then, although no rumors of pending fights have been heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson said deputies have no other suspects at present in connection with the 
campus fights, which remain under investigation.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CASTAIC DISTRICT EXPECTS TO CHARGE FOR SCHOOL 
BUS RIDES; EDUCATION: TRUSTEES ON THURSDAY WILL DISCUSS A FEE AIMED AT 
OFFSETTING AN ANNUAL TRANSPORTATION DEFICIT OF ABOUT $250,000. 
</P>

<P>
 Families of some 1,200 students now bused to school here will have to pay if 
they want to continue the service this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's not a question of 'if' so much as 'how much,' " said 
Michael R. Slater, business manager for the Castaic Union School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic trustees Thursday will discuss the fee, earlier suggested at $100 or 
$200 per year for each student, that district officials hope will offset an 
annual transportation deficit of about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 California reimburses schools for bus service based upon a 1978 formula, with 
minor adjustments made for inflation but not for explosive population growth 
such as that experienced in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Busing students to Castaic and Live Oak elementary schools and Castaic Middle 
School cost the district $277,278 more than it received from the state last 
year. That is the equivalent expense of eight teaching positions in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic trustees have already approved a $20 charge for summer school 
transportation. Its implementation will demonstrate how many parents will pay 
the charge and how best to collect such fees, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 750 students are enrolled in summer school, which runs July 5 to 29, but 
school officials are unsure how many of them will take the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 A busing fee for the regular school year appears to have conditional support 
from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 A written survey mailed to Castaic families in February generated 398 
responses. More than half said they would support a fee if it also paid for 
textbooks, instructional supplies, reading teachers or libraries. Fewer than 
half said they favor a fee that would help pay for counselors or for programs 
for students with limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials admit the proposed fee would not pay for additional 
services, but say they are encouraged by the survey results. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley now charge to bus 
students to and from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District and Newhall School District 
charge students $200 a year to ride the bus and the Sulphur Springs School 
District last fall approved a fee of $60 per semester or $100 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 California law exempts disabled students from school busing fees, and Castaic 
officials have mentioned making provisions for low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic trustees are also considering an earlier start for Castaic Middle 
School, beginning the school day at 7:30 rather than 8 a.m., and staggering the 
schedule so that additional buses would not be needed to serve the two 
elementary schools.

AGUA DULCE RESIDENT NAMED TO L.A. COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophia Waugh of Agua Dulce, a past member of the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District board of trustees, was sworn in Tuesday as the newest member of 
the Los Angeles County Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Waugh, selected by Supervisor Mike Antonovich to serve on the seven-member 
board, was named to a two-year term.She replaces Barbara Pieper, a member of 
the county Office of Education board since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board is involved in curriculum development and research and deals 
with issues such as student expulsion appeals and school district unification. 
The Office of Education oversees and approves the budgets and financial 
transactions of the 95 school districts in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Waugh, a longtime Agua Dulce resident, was at a board of education meeting 
Tuesday afternoon and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by Antonovich's office, Waugh said in her new role she 
would put a priority on career/vocational education, as she did when she was a 
member of the high school district board. 
</P>
<P>
 "These types of programs reach all students and result in better student 
attendance and attitudes and lowers the dropout and expulsion rate," Waugh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waugh was elected to the high school board in 1989, but did not seek 
re-election when her four-year term expired last year.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY REJECTS PLAN TO RESTRICT HOMES NEAR POWER 
LINES; LANCASTER: COUNCIL MEMBERS PRAISE THE CONCEPT BUT SAY ELECTROMAGNETIC 
FIELD HEALTH RISKS ARE UNPROVEN. 
</P>

<P>
 A Planning Commission proposal to restrict the construction of houses next to 
high-voltage power lines because of possible health hazards has been rejected 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, at a meeting Monday night, praised the commission for trying 
to protect residents, but said it is still uncertain whether power lines and 
electric substations pose health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support what the Planning Commission was faced with," Councilwoman Deborah 
Sheltonsaid. "They were trying to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "I feel we need more time to study this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner agreed, saying, "I just think it is a bit premature." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules concerning electromagnetic fields, or EMFs, had been included in the 
city's new subdivision law, which governs how land is divided and improved. The 
council removed the provision concerning EMFs, then unanimously approved the 
remainder of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, some studies have suggested that exposure to EMFs may 
increase the risk of developing cancer. But researchers have not established a 
causal link, and many of their findings are inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Planning Commission members voted last week to require that 
developers conduct a study on the possible effect of EMFs when they seek to 
build new houses next to power lines and electric substations. The developer's 
consultant was to propose setbacks and other steps to protect residents from 
the electromagnetic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also set a limit on the level of EMFs allowed next to a new house, 
unless the builder could prove they posed no health risk to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Building Industry Assn. and Southern California Edison 
objected to these rules, saying there is too much uncertainty about whether 
EMFs are harmful and what levels should be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission acted in haste," Denise Henderson, a Southern 
California Edison spokeswoman, told the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hawley, the city's community development director, said he was not aware 
of any other California city that has imposed EMF regulations. But he said 
Lancaster's planning commissioners opted for a cutting-edge position on this 
issue because they were concerned about the health of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the commission's thinking that we should approach this from the 
standpoint of prudent avoidance," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 While they rejected the EMF rules, City Council members instructed Hawley to 
monitor the issue.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER COURTHOUSE DESIGN WORK TO RESUME; 
SUPERVISORS: DECISION WILL ALLOW PLANNING FOR THE $80-MILLION PROJECT THAT HAD 
BEEN DELAYED BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four months after the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors indefinitely 
postponed all but two of its courthouse construction projects due to a lack of 
funding, design work on the proposed $80-million courthouse in Lancaster will 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors unanimously agreed Tuesday to resume design of the Lancaster 
courthouse and also approved several other interim projects in the wake of the 
halt on construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since January . . . we've kind of been floundering out there," said Lori 
Howard, justice deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich. "Today is the first 
definitive action to moving forward with the Antelope Valley project." 
</P>
<P>
 While the county go ahead with the design of the Lancaster courthouse, on 
which it has already spent nearly $6 million, it is not known when there will 
be funding to allow construction of the 21-courtroom building to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sort of taking this incrementally, one step at a time," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is legislation pending that would increase courthouse construction 
funding statewide, and Los Angeles County would get a portion of those funds, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To relieve crowding at the Lancaster courthouse until a new one is built, the 
supervisors also agreed to lease space for non-criminal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions benefiting the Lancaster courthouse were among several that 
supervisors made Tuesday to reduce crowding and make improvements to a number 
of courthouses, including those in Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, Culver City 
and the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim projects will cost more than $9 million over the next two years 
and in excess of $1 million each year in lease costs, according to Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed. The county does not have the money, she 
said, and passage of a series of three Assembly bills is crucial to the future 
of the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with declining courthouse construction funds, the board voted in January 
to indefinitely postpone eight projects and to complete just two court 
buildings, one in Chatsworth and the other near Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the supervisors directed Reed to find space to lease in Lancaster 
and Santa Monica and funds to pay for it. She was also told to find a way to 
relieve inadequate custody space at the West Los Angeles Courthouse. At that 
time, the board also agreed to make construction of the new Antelope Valley 
Courthouse a top priority, when and if funds become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was hoping to lease space and design temporary courtrooms at the 
now-empty Mira Loma Jail, which was closed by Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block last summer during budget cutbacks. Block, however, is talking 
with the state Department of Corrections about that agency's leasing of the 
entire jail to allow expansion of the state prison in Lancaster, which is 
adjacent to the vacant jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the county will begin looking immediately for other space to lease 
for Municipal Court traffic and small claims matters, as well as Superior Court 
civil, probate and family law hearings.

EFFORT FAILS TO BAN OUT-OF-COUNTY TRASH AT AREA DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's bid to keep El Cajon's garbage 
out of a Lancaster landfill failed Tuesday when no one seconded his motion to 
prohibit the dumping of out-of-county waste in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Antonovich received unanimous support on a follow-up proposal to conduct 
public hearings this year on how best to manage the remaining space in the 
county's trash dumps. The hearings also will address how the landfills would be 
affected by the importing of garbage from outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Vannatta, Antonovich's planning deputy, said the county's Regional 
Planning Commission will conduct one of the public meetings in the Antelope 
Valley to let residents express their concerns about the dumping of El Cajon's 
trash in the privately owned Lancaster Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem, of course, is that they're bringing it to the Antelope 
Valley and using up significant amounts of landfill space that ought to be 
reserved for local residents," Vannatta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced earlier this month when local residents learned that 
officials in El Cajon, in San Diego County, were planning to send 12 truckloads 
of trash a day to the Lancaster Landfill, where the tipping fee is less 
expensive than at a closer dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck trips, about 160 miles each way, are expected to start July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 3, Antonovich asked the Board of Supervisors to approve an emergency 
law that would temporarily ban any importation to the Antelope Valley of trash 
from outside the county. The board opted to study the issue for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors subsequently received a report from the county's attorneys, 
questioning whether the board could legally stop the movement of trash across 
county lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report, Harry W. Stone, the county's acting public works 
director, told the board that Los Angeles County itself exports trash to other 
counties and expects to send more out of the county in the future, possibly by 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said he is concerned that if the board restricts trash from coming into 
Los Angeles County, other counties might retaliate by adopting rules to keep 
out trash coming from the county.

DISTRICT TO RECEIVE PLAN FOR UNIFORMS AT NEW SANTA CLARITA SCHOOL; EDUCATION: 
LA MESA JUNIOR HIGH WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN STATE TO 
MAKE MANDATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Uniforms for students attending a new junior high school this fall are a step 
closer to reality after William S. Hart Union High School District trustees 
voted unanimously to allow school officials to submit a plan for final approval 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Neal, principal of La Mesa Junior High School in Canyon Country, said 
the uniforms would make the campus safer by eliminating gang-type clothing, 
reduce clothing costs and improve students' self-esteem by eliminating the peer 
pressure to wear certain brands or types of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe students are in school for one purpose and that's for learning," 
she said at a meeting last week. "We want them dressed in a way that will 
reinforce that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 La Mesa would become one of the first public schools in California to mandate 
uniforms if the board of trustees approves the proposal at its June 8 meeting. 
The proposal appears to have firm support from at least three of the four 
trustees, although board member William Dinsenbacher said he leans more toward 
further restricting current dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the mandatory uniform program could still face legal challenges 
from organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which contends 
students' freedom of choice is restricted by the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Having an alternate plan for the students will be necessary to make the 
program legal, said Michael von Buelow, director of personnel and pupil 
services. School officials have said they will allow students to transfer to 
other area junior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Senate has approved a bill allowing schools to require uniforms. The 
bill is now being considered by the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous students interviewed at Santa Clarita elementary and junior high 
schools have said they object to a policy requiring uniforms. But Neal said she 
received many positive comments from sixth-grade students who will attend La 
Mesa next year after she explained the reasons for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tucker, 12, a sixth-grader at Valley View Elementary School, attended 
last Wednesday's meeting and said he has no objection to the uniforms, but he 
said other students have teased, and even threatened him, over wearing the 
"right" clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, someone was bagging on my shorts because they think they're too 
short," John said, gesturing below his knees. "They're supposed to go way down 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said it would cost from $100 to $150 to buy several outfits for a 
student. Clothing choices would include black pants, shorts or skirts. White 
button-down shirts would be available, plus polo and T-shirts in black, white 
and teal blue. Sweat shirts, jackets and other clothing items are also being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost was debated by some board members who argued students might have to 
buy more than one set of uniforms during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that age, students quite often change their physical dimensions rapidly, 
so it could end up costing much more," Dinsenbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member John Hassel said the problem of children outgrowing clothes 
is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 "As their sizes change, uniforms or not, the parent would still have to put 
some clothing on the child," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal said businesses, churches and other organizations will be asked to donate 
money to provide uniforms for families unable to provide them. In addition, 
students might be able to sell the used uniforms to the school at the end of 
the year, and it would be provided at reduced cost to needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms are also being considered for students at Placerita Junior High in 
Newhall, although no formal action has been taken yet. Officials working on the 
uniform proposal for La Mesa hope that it will become a pilot program for other 
area schools.

VALLEY BRIEFING: HIGHWAY UPDATE; ACCELERATED EARTHQUAKE REPAIR ALLOWS 1-5 TO 
REOPEN EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The collapse of the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) at Gavin Canyon in the 
Northridge earthquake severed the main artery between Southern California and 
the rest of the state. A four-lane detour along The Old Road was constructed 
two weeks later to handle traffic, which nonetheless continued to bottleneck 
through the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers scrambled to restore the freeway by the June 8 deadline but found the 
work more arduous than on the shattered Santa Monica Freeway because of the 
80-foot high columns and occasionally adverse weather conditions. However, 
round-the-clock shifts still allowed Caltrans to open the freeway three weeks 
ahead of schedule, earning contractor E. L. Yeager Construction Co. of 
Riverside a $4.5-million bonus in addition to the $14.8-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The damaged interchange between the I-5 and Highway 14, a few miles to the 
south, is to be completely repaired by the end of year, with a first phase by 
the end of July. Repairing collapsed 1-5 bridges Both lanes of I-5 split in two 
places over The Old Road in Gavin Canyon, north of the interchange. The 
re-routing and repair timetable is shown below: Jan. 17: Bridges collapsed Jan. 
27: Bridges demolished Jan. 29: Detour opened Jan. 30: Repair work began Feb., 
March, April: Round-the-clock construction May 17: Southbound lanes open May 
18: Northbound lanes to open June 8: Original deadline Resources needed 
Reinforcing steel: 3.6 million lbs. Steel beams: 3 million tons Structural 
concrete: 16,000 cubic yds. Concrete pavement; 5,000 cubic yds. Columns: 12 
measuring 8 ft. in diameter and 75 to 80 ft. high. Workers: 200, three times 
the normal number Repair status of Highway 14 Highway 14 needed to be fixed in 
two places: 1. 450-foot section of Hwy. 14 connector to southbound I-5 fell 
onto I-5. (shown above) 2. 300-foot section of southbound Hwy. 14 connector to 
north I-5 fell adjacent to truck lane. (not shown) Rebuilding bridges at the 
interchange is being done in two phases: Stage 1: Kasler Corp. is rebuilding 
two of the four bridges. Work began March 19 to reconstruct the southbound Hwy. 
14 ramp to the southbound I-5. The northbound I-5 ramp to northbound Hwy. 14 
will also be rebuilt. Scheduled completion: By July 28. Stage 2: Contracts 
haven't been awarded yet to rebuild the two remaining interchange ramps. 
Southbound Hwy. 14 to northbound I-5 is expected to be awarded by the end of 
June, and southbound I-5 to northbound Hwy. 14 is expected to be awarded by the 
end of July. Estimated completion: By the end of the year. Source: Caltrans;

ONLY 16% OF U.S. WORKERS GETTING COMPANY TRAINING; EDUCATION: GLOBAL 
COMPETITION REQUIRES WIDER UPDATING OF SKILLS, LABOR SECRETARY ROBERT REICH 
TELLS GROUP MEETING IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an increasing dependence on technology in the workplace, only 16% of 
U.S. workers receive company-sponsored training to keep their skills up to 
date, according to a recent survey by the American Society for Training and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers who are willing to play the role of educator are heroes, U.S. Labor 
Secretary Robert Reich said in an address Tuesday to members of the national 
organization, which is holding its annual convention here this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Being competitive in today's dynamic global economy requires constantly 
updated technical and problem-solving skills, Reich said in his speech, 
delivered by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's message touched a sympathetic chord among the 615 exhibitors and 5,300 
others attending the annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are often reluctant to spend money on training, said Curtis Plott, 
president of the trade group, because they are concerned that they will train 
people who leave and take their new skills to another employer. That is why 
most of the continuing education money spent in the United States is on 
college-educated men over the age of 35 -- a group perceived as less mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 But with downsizing and the elimination of management layers, companies are 
going to depend more on lower-level workers, Plott said. And they must be 
taught to use technology and suggest change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need better skills at the bottom of the work force," he said. "They're 
always the ones who can suggest quality improvements and connecting the process 
to the customer, because they're the ones out there daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, as new technology raises potential problems for corporate 
America, it can also provide the solutions. Using high-tech training programs, 
companies can offer on-the-job education to employees at all levels without 
spending a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 One manufacturing company, for example, introduced 750 new products in one 
year, Plott said, and had trouble keeping its technicians updated. So, knowing 
that employees often learn by asking each other questions, the company gave all 
of its technicians cellular phones and each other's phone numbers. The system 
was a success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, a large mail-order house installed "electronic 
performance support" software -- a big name for giving customer service 
employees access to a particular consumer's buying habits. That way, employees 
could suggest other purchases to customers on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Such training for a service staff that works around the clock and has a high 
turnover rate would have been prohibitively expensive until recently, Plott 
said. But by giving employees computer training and access, such a program can 
be both practical and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gannett newspaper chain provided a similar tool for its advertising 
salespeople. Each was given a computer that carried the most current rates and 
options for buying space in more than one of the company's nearly 100 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kocher, an exhibitor at the trade show, said one of the fastest-growing 
uses for training databases is to educate employees about federal requirements 
for health and safety when working with hazardous materials. Kocher represents 
Advanced Educational Technologies, a La Mesa company that sells interactive 
video disc and videotape training programs. Keeping Current 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys conducted in 1983 and 1991 show that more employees are benefiting 
from formal training programs to keep skills current. In 1991, the most recent 
year for which figures are available, technical professionals reported 
receiving the most training, followed by management support specialists. 
Percentage receiving formal training: 03,32,06,06 Employee type 1983 1991

O.C. HOME BUILDER SELLS $100 MILLION IN BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an ambitious move that positions J.M. Peters Co. for a recovery, the 
Newport Beach home builder said Tuesday it has raised $100 million through a 
private bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters, like other Southern California home builders, has been hard hit 
by the real estate downturn. Since reporting a string of losses in the early 
1990s, it has struggled to obtain badly needed capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash infusion will allow the publicly traded company to pay off its $30 
million in debt, set aside $40 million to build new homes in Orange County and 
Nevada and $14 million to buy lots for future development. The company also 
said it has arranged a $25-million line of credit with Bank One of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a smart move," said Barbara Allen, a housing analyst with the 
brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. "This is an opportune time 
for J.M. Peters to raise this money and try to respond to the increasing demand 
for homes in Orange County. It looks like a real estate recovery is well 
underway there."  
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1975, J.M. Peters was at one time considered the premier builder of 
luxury move-up homes in Southern California. It fell upon hard times, however, 
after being sold in 1985 by founder James M. Peters to San Jacinto Savings & 
Loan Assn. in Houston. The thrift was seized by federal regulators in December, 
1990, and J.M. Peters was taken over along with other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company languished until 1992, when builders Hadi Makarechian and Dale 
Dowers paid $47 million to buy it from the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we bought this company, it was in cardiac arrest and we had the paddles 
out," said Dowers, the company's president. "Now it's not only breathing, it's 
in a marathon. Soon we will pass everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters, which has built single-family homes in Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Portola Hills and Coto de Caza, now has 21 active projects, including seven in 
Orange County and 10 in Nevada. It will start construction on 14 new projects 
next year, company officials said, and is in escrow on three South County 
projects, including one in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
 For its current fiscal year, the company expects to close escrow on more than 
1,000 homes, some priced as low as $200,000. By contrast, the company built 
only 28 homes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With its bond financing, J.M. Peters follows it neighbor, Baldwin Builders of 
Newport Beach, in turning to the capital markets for funds. Last year, Baldwin 
sold a $155-million bond offering.  
</P>
<P>
 J.M. Peters' bonds were sold through Morgan Stanley and Co., the New York 
investment bank, and mature in eight years. The bonds were bought mostly by 
institutional investors such as mutual funds, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing was announced after Tuesday's stock market closed. In trading on 
the American Stock Exchange, the company's stock fell 12.5 cents a share to 
close at $3.25.

BIRTCHER MEDICAL SYSTEMS HIRES NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE; PERSONNEL: KENNETH 
CLEVELAND WILL SEEK BUYERS FOR THE WHOLE COMPANY OR SOME OF ITS ASSETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birtcher Medical Systems Inc., a medical device manufacturer buffeted by two 
years of losses, has hired a corporate trouble-shooter as its new chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth C. Cleveland, president of Kenneth Cleveland Associates Inc., an 
Irvine-based management consulting firm, became Birtcher's CEO and president on 
Monday, the company said. He will remain as president of the consulting 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birtcher, he succeeds William E. Maya, who becomes vice chairman, a newly 
created position, and will be responsible for seeking candidates to buy either 
the whole company or some of its assets -- including its money-losing Solos 
endoscopic products division. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher, which makes advanced surgical products, decided to seek a buyer 
after posting a loss of $1.9 million, or 22 cents a share, for its latest 
fiscal year, which ended June 30. That followed a fiscal 1992 loss of $1.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher has not been able to recover. For the first nine months of the 
current fiscal year, the company posted a blistering $18.9-million loss, 
contrasted with a profit of $150,000 for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue also declined. For the first nine months, the company reported revenue 
of $26.9 million, down 18% from $32.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Devising a strategy for returning Birtcher to profitability will be 
complicated, Cleveland said. On the up side, he said, Birtcher is a 
"well-established company with a good core product line and a good customer 
base. The company has worked hard to achieve that." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, the company in the past has not responded 
adequately to a national trend of cost reductions in the health-care field. 
Across the United States, cost-conscious hospitals, squeezed by declining 
insurance reimbursement, are shying away from spending money on new surgical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been wrong about the company is that they have been too optimistic 
in their business forecasts and have structured the company to break even at a 
higher level than they have been able to achieve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care analysts agreed. Many of them have all but stopped following the 
company after expressing frustration that management seemed to be making poor 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those moves was the 1991 acquisition of Solos Endoscopy Inc., a 
Georgia-based maker of video surgical devices. The market for that product has 
since been in a slump, and the competition has grown. Solos has been the 
leading reason for Birtcher's financial losses, analysts said, forcing many of 
them to recommend that investors sell the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey L. Holmes, a health-care analyst with Hamilton Investments, a Chicago 
brokerage, said that when he issued his sell order a year ago, the stock was 
selling at about $3 a share. Several years ago, however, it sold for as much as 
$18. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I thought . . . 'How much lower could it go?' " Holmes said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has continued its slump, closing at $1.75 a share, down 12.5 cents, in 
Tuesday's Nasdaq trading. That price was still 25 cents a share higher than its 
52-week low of $1.50 a share, reached May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Cleveland acknowledged that he is inexperienced at running a medical 
company, he said he has a long record of successful turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Local companies he has helped turn profitable include Cardis Corp. of Buena 
Park, a distributor of automobile replacement parts and automotive tools. 
Another is Tylan Corp. of Torrance, a maker of semiconductor products such as 
circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
 At Birtcher, Cleveland said, he will stick to fundamentals: improving customer 
satisfaction, re-engineering marketing plans and trimming costs further -- 
though he maintained that no layoffs among the company's 140 employees are in 
the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is not worried about his lack of medical expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn the industry, you learn the buzzwords," Cleveland said. "We have 
people here who know the business. I am bringing to this company economic and 
marketing discipline." Birtcher Medical Systems 
</P>
<P>
 For its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, Birtcher Medical Systems 
reported a loss of $17.6 million on revenue of $6.8 million. The company 
attributed the loss to a onetime charge of $14.8 million. Figures in millions 
of dollars except data per share: 05,19,10,10,10,10 3rd qtr. 3rd qtr. 9 months

DIRECTORS AT US FACILITIES REJECT TAKEOVER BID; INSURANCE: UNANIMOUS DECISION 
RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS TURN DOWN FIDELITY NATIONAL'S $79-MILLION OFFER AT 
COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 US Facilities Corp.'s directors Tuesday roundly rejected a $79-million hostile 
takeover bid as a "bargain" sale and took steps to make it harder for the 
unwanted suitor to play havoc with the company's annual meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
 They voted unanimously to recommend that shareholders turn down demands by 
Fidelity National Financial Inc. to put the Costa Mesa insurance holding 
company up for sale immediately and to elect two Fidelity nominees as 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But they left the door open to a possible merger with Irvine-based Fidelity, 
the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, or other potential buyers on more 
"favorable terms" than Fidelity's offer of $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's resolutions will be presented to shareholders at US Facilities' 
annual meeting May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusiveness and unanimity of the board's decision sends a strong 
message to our stockholders of its support for management and its business 
strategies," George Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman and chief executive, said 
in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The message to Fidelity and its chairman, William P. Foley II, also is clear, 
Kadonada said. "We are not opposed to a sale of the company if an opportunity 
truly exists on favorable terms." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to shareholders, Kadonada said that the sale of the company "at 
this time would risk substantial damage to US Facilities' business and 
prospects." He urged shareholders to vote against Fidelity's two director 
nominees because the pair "will give Fidelity National a 'pipeline' to 
confidential corporate information, will be disruptive and, in our judgment, 
will create risk for your investment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting that lasted into the night Monday, US Facilities' directors also 
approved a bylaws change that lowers the quorum needed to conduct the annual 
meeting from half the shares outstanding to a third. 
</P>
<P>
 That change effectively blocks Fidelity's effort to gather enough shareholder 
votes to allow it to boycott the meeting and force a postponement for lack of a 
quorum. Fidelity had threatened to follow that strategy but abandoned it after 
top management said last week that it would ask directors to allow a 
shareholder vote on Fidelity's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because US Facilities isn't sure if Fidelity's offer is bona fide and isn't 
clear about the details, it has asked its Wall Street investment banker, Morgan 
Stanley & Co., to meet with Fidelity officials to see if Fidelity can come up 
with "a firm cash offer at an attractive price" that US Facilities could 
consider seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging that Morgan Stanley could talk to us," Foley said in an 
interview Tuesday, noting that Morgan Stanley has not called the offer 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said Tuesday that initial telephone calls between Morgan Stanley 
and Fidelity's investment banker, Merrill Lynch & Co., led to a stalemate so 
far. Foley asserts that Morgan Stanley wasn't given authority to enter into 
merger negotiations and that Kadonada should show good faith by delaying the 
annual meeting for a month so the two sides can negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadonada refuses to do that, saying shareholders now will decide whether the 
company should even be put on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 The pending offer, Kadonada said, doesn't take into account the "potential 
value of the company's business operations and prospects" and instead risks 
"substantial damage" to its business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadonada has insisted on following a slow and cautious course in evaluating 
Fidelity's offer, disputing Foley's allegation that he has been stalling in an 
effort to torpedo Fidelity's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial interest, Wall Street seems to be adopting a wait-and-see view. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity began accumulating its 9.6% stake in US Facilities on March 21, 
causing the price of the target's stock to rise quickly from $9 a share to 
$13.75 on the Nasdaq market. Since that early surge, though, the stock has 
traded a bit lower, closing Tuesday at $13.875 a share, up 12.5 cents from the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a big disappointment to shareholders if US Facilities defeats 
our resolutions," Foley said. "This stock will go nowhere except back down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's stock, meantime, hasn't suffered too much, falling gradually from 
$18.50 to $17.25 over the first month. It closed Tuesday at $17.625 a share, up 
25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: QLOGIC PINS SALES DROP ON WEAK DISK DRIVE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QLogic Corp., formerly a subsidiary of Emulex Corp., said Tuesday that it lost 
$4.6 million for its latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss, which included onetime costs for its spinoff from Emulex and other 
restructuring moves, contrasted with a $5.9-million profit for the previous 
year.Annual revenue dropped 14% to $44.9 million for the year, which ended 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, QLogic posted a profit of $87,000, down from earnings 
of $1 million for the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue was $11.4 
million, down from $13.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue decrease for the year was the result of a slump in the disk drive 
industry, the company's primary market, during the second and third fiscal 
quarters, the company said.

RELATIONSHIPS; LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S; NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISEASE 
COMING FROM RESEARCH AT UCI INDICATES THAT THE YEARS AFTER DIAGNOSIS CAN BE 
EASIER ON THE PATIENT AS WELL AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The little conference room at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's clinic is where they 
deliver the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got the diagnosis, it really ripped my heart out," re calls Charlene 
Folcarelli of Ana heim Hills. She had brought her 55-year-old husband John to 
the clinic to find out why he felt so "burned out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted anything else but Alzheimer's. I think John couldn't really absorb 
what the doctor was saying, but I could immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day we were in our office -- we worked together -- and he looked at 
me and said, 'The doctor said I have Alzheimer's. That's where you forget 
everything.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yes,' and he just started crying. From that moment on, I decided not 
to make it an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 What Charlene Folcarelli did, and how John Folcarelli reacted, amazed doctors 
and scientists at the UCI Alzheimer's Research Center. Resisting the despair 
and collapse that so often grips Alzheimer's patients and their families, 
Charlene Folcarelli decided to wrest as many good years as she could from her 
husband's affliction. She went looking for what he could do, not what he 
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 What she and doctors discovered over the next eight years was that Alzheimer's 
patients, progressively robbed of their memory of facts, very often retain 
their memory of how to do things. In the early and intermediate stages, often 
they still can garden, cook, shop, drive, play golf or play the piano and enjoy 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they can learn new activities. A man who cannot remember his 
children's names may be able to learn how to paint or how to play bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely astonishing," says Carl W. Cotman, a psychobiologist who 
directs UCI's brain aging and Alzheimer's research unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't understand what it is that allows them to do that. In the 
later stages of Alzheimer's, we can't promise anything. But we have had cases 
where clinic staff went to Autumn Years (a board and care home) and taught the 
people a beanbag-tossing game. These were severe cases, yet they could still 
learn this." 
</P>
<P>
 One clinic patient, "very demented," according to clinic director Joana 
Chrysler, continued to work as a pianist at a Newport Beach nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of the clinic patients banded together and formed what doctors called 
"the men's club," going on trips like any other group of old chums, Chrysler 
said. "You almost had to see it," Chrysler says. "It was an uplifting group, 
because they were very outward; they felt so good about it. It would have been 
hard for someone to notice that these were not just a group of men out for a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Charlene Folcarelli, "People have to get the word that there's a lot of 
longevity to this disease. It doesn't affect your health. You stay healthy a 
long time. If you throw in the towel too quickly, you may miss a lot of good 
years together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after his diagnosis, John Folcarelli is living in an Alzheimer's 
home in Costa Mesa. But for five of those years, he led a happy and satisfying 
life at home, his wife says. "I set out not to change our lifestyle," she says. 
She resolved to change their normal routine only after it was plain her husband 
could no longer cope with it, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife handling his telephone calls and correspondence, John Folcarelli 
continued to work at the credit agency the two owned in Orange. "We continued 
to take vacations, go to dinner, go out with friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "People think that all of a sudden these people can't remember. It's not like 
that. One day he wouldn't remember how to turn the computer on, but the next 
day he would. There were two doors to the office, and sometimes he'd get 
confused over which one he'd gone out. I knew things were changing, but he was 
never aware of the scope of it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months of worsening memory, she suggested that "we take a break from 
everything. That sounded acceptable to him." Such tact is vital, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I put the emphasis on. John never felt he was useless. The key 
thing was to involve John in everything. They keep their self-esteem and 
dignity when you concentrate on the things they can do and you don't criticize 
what they can't do. You say thank you; they do relate to that. They relate to 
the tone of your voice. Maybe they can't comprehend the words, but they 
comprehend the tone of the voice." 
</P>
<P>
 She hired a companion to stay with her husband while she was at work, telling 
her husband that the man was there to help with household chores. They went 
everywhere together, sticking to familiar places -- the golf course, 
supermarket, restaurants -- where they were known. "People have a good heart 
and respond well when they know the situation," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble, Cotman says, is that research into Alzheimer's most basic 
workings is only a few years old and ordinary people "don't know how to think 
about it yet. They don't know what to do about it. Families are distressed 
because it's irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he says, "it's not like (the patient is) losing everything, but people 
just write you off. Because you can't remember the person's name you just 
talked to, it starts to become an assumption that you can't do anything. All of 
a sudden you don't exist to anyone but your close circle. That has to be the 
most intimidating thing in the world and really humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, he says, anyone visiting the clinic's annual holiday party would 
have trouble picking out from the crowd the patients with mild or moderate 
Alzheimer's cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it's seriously difficult. You can tell if you go away and come back 
because some of the conversation will repeat. But in the normal course of a 
three- or four-minute conversation, you basically cannot tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he says, researchers have sent questionnaires to Alzheimer's families 
asking what the patient still can do. Usually they come back blank, he says, 
"yet we know many still have good motor skills. We're not convinced that the 
care-givers, the families, are really looking." 
</P>
<P>
 He said one patient, a former engineer, adored puzzles and could sit for hours 
enjoying them if someone could get the puzzle started. "It just made him feel 
good. That's good for him, probably good for the brain, too, and it's good for 
the care-giver, because he's not getting into other things." 
</P>
<P>
 People who used to work in a wood shop or a kitchen often still can do it, 
"even though they have trouble sequencing -- doing A, then B, then C. You just 
write out the sequence for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler says her clinic, though it's not designed to train care-givers, winds 
up doing that "because they have so few places to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them to keep the patient as independent as possible for as long as 
possible. Our goal is to keep them at home as long as possible, but it depends 
on the care-giver. Some people throw up their hands as soon as they get the 
diagnosis and want to put them in a home." 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful care-givers, she says, are the ones who experiment and 
adapt. "With Alzheimer's patients, there are few guidelines to what you can 
expect," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "One (wife) told me this is like being a widow backward, and she was perfectly 
right. Her husband was still alive, but she was doing the things that people do 
when husbands die -- going through their clothes, going through finances. Their 
lives are just taken and torn apart, and so to be successful at the job -- it 
can be a 20-year job -- you have to be very adaptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the disease finally advanced to the point that John 
Folcarelli could no longer drive. It was the turning point, his wife said. His 
resentment became hostility, and then every frustration became hostility aimed 
at her. "He finally got to the point that he didn't like me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a year, she placed him in a board-and-care home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I got five more quality years with my husband," Charlene Folcarelli 
says. "If I would have reacted to what they said eight years ago, I probably 
would have shut myself in the house, never gone out with John again and been a 
caretaker the rest of my life."

WHEN BABY MAKES TWO; FAMILIES: WHEN SHOSHANA ALEXANDER SOUGHT OUT BOOKS TO 
GUIDE HER THROUGH SINGLE PARENTHOOD, SHE FOUND ALMOST NONE. SO SHE WROTE HER 
OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoshana Alexander has temporarily sworn off adult entanglements -- so when 
she refers to her one true love these days, she means her son, Elias, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she was 42, pregnant and about to be married when her fiance left 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was terrified," said Alexander, a free-lance writer and editor. "Not so 
much about how my baby and I would physically survive, which was a big enough 
problem. But more important, I worried how I could function as both mother and 
father and still have a good relationship with my child." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had always assumed there were special reference books for single 
parents that show how to avoid the pitfalls unique to this group. But when she 
went to bookstores, there were almost none. 
</P>
<P>
 When she asked child-care experts for information on single parenting, she 
found that most believe that the basic rules of parenting apply in households 
with one parent or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that couldn't be true," she said in a recent interview. "From watching 
my friends, I knew there were issues of discipline and dependency that arise in 
a single-parent family that are totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 So Alexander decided to write a book. "In Praise of Single Parents" (Houghton 
Mifflin), published last month, is based on her story and those of hundreds of 
other single parents she interviewed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Alexander's book is our No. 1 reading choice this year because it shatters 
myths, shows what to expect, and for the first time makes single parents feel 
part of a group," said Andrea Engber, director of the National Organization of 
Single Mothers and editor of Working Mother magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, who lives in Oakland with her son, admits her own problems and 
disappointments, which she said mirror those of most single parents she 
interviewed for the book. For example, Alexander had always hoped and planned 
to share her life (and her child) with another adult. In other words, "to marry 
and live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Alexander said, she and her son have become a kind of couple on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the primary relationship in each other's lives. Elias is my assistant 
at the market, my companion on weekend outings. He gets my last kiss at night 
and my first one every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Her love is "unquestioned and all-encompassing," she said. At first she had a 
tendency to get so lost in it that she obliterated herself. She was willing to 
forgo her own needs to concentrate on his, but found that this was not good for 
either of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major differences between one- and two-parent families, she said, 
is: "In two-parent families, children are not considered lesser than, but they 
are certainly considered 'other than' adults. The kids hang with their peers, 
and adults hang with theirs. And it is adults who take responsibility for 
decisions, even when children participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For single parents, however, the child and parent tend to become psychic 
partners in a link of implied equality. We get used to relating to our children 
as friends and engaging them in our decisions. That means we put them in the 
untenable position of having to grant us permission to take authority. 'No, you 
cannot have a hamster, OK?' " 
</P>
<P>
 All this can lead to too much responsibility for the child, Alexander said, 
and it can be played out in many different ways. "If there is no one else 
around to make Mommy or Daddy happy, the child often perceives it is his job. 
He may feel he caused the sadness himself. Sweet as it is to be comforted by 
your adoring offspring, it will come back to haunt you when the child grows up 
angry that you allowed such a thing. You were supposed to take care of him. " 
</P>
<P>
 Her book catalogues the various difficulties to which only single parents can 
relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions would recognize this scene: The usually sweet, well-behaved offspring 
who turns into a barbaric, howling monster when Mom (or Dad) finally has a 
date. The date sits in the living room while the child clings to the parent, 
hysterically begging her not to go out. The date secretly believes that the 
parent abuses the child by leaving him alone too much and never calls again. 
The parent is too worn out to care. The child has won. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much equality between single parent and child, Alexander explained, can 
lead to a feeling of power that is inappropriate for someone who cannot yet 
read and write. What's more, she said, it can prevent children from 
understanding their importance as individuals in relation to a world full of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said almost every parent she interviewed could pinpoint a particular 
incident or situation that turned the tide, made them decide to surmount their 
own shock or depression and start a celebratory life alone with their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, guilt usually sets in. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilt at leaving your child in day care too long while you work, at losing 
your temper too much because you're so tired, at being the only parent in the 
home, at not getting chores done, not playing with the kids enough, not running 
the kind of household they see on TV. Guilt that leads you to give in to your 
child's demands when you know you shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander said that in spite of all this, research shows that 
single-parent families are inherently no worse for kids than families with two 
parents at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one recent study indicates that children of single parents tend to be 
more mature, independent, imaginative, self-disciplined and self-assured than 
their counterparts in two-parent families, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And guilt, Alexander writes, can be a valuable motivator for positive change. 
By understanding and evaluating it, a parent can sometimes set wrong patterns 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her own case, she recalled, she awoke one night to see if her son was 
breathing, as most doting new parents do. Then she caught herself thinking, "If 
he's not (alive), at least I'll get some sleep." At that moment, she knew she 
couldn't continue living the way she was: Alone and up half the night, at work 
all day, always worried about money, never an afternoon or weekend to herself 
or even an hour to take a relaxing bath. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to a communal house where couples, singles and a few single parents 
lived with their kids. She said she learned to ask housemates to care for her 
baby while she bathed and to accept their offers of help at other times. Able 
to breathe deeply once again, she realized that she wasn't stressed out 
anymore, that there were options and possibilities to take advantage of. She 
could enjoy her child and begin to nurture herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who will nurture the nurturer" she writes, "is one of the most basic and 
baffling quandaries of single parenthood. If we don't respond to our own needs 
in appropriate ways, we are likely to try to fulfill them through our children. 
If we don't dream our own dreams, our children may not be free to dream 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some overworked single parents, Alexander found, need to learn to do less -- 
perhaps allow themselves time to sleep all day, to get no chores done or to do 
something seemingly frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, that would be an attempt to find a mate. A romantic, adult 
relationship to fill the one remaining gap in life. For this, Alexander has no 
prescription. She has changed "from a single person who happens to be a parent 
into a parent who happens to be single." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it has for most in her position, she said, dating has become a joke. 
"Even if you meet someone interesting, you haven't the energy to devote to 
them. And the better you get as a single parent, the less desirable you become. 
If you are autonomous and efficient, the person coming into your life feels 
unnecessary to it. Most important, with each new romance, the heart of your 
child is at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, Alexander knows, is her son's need for a dad. When a 
photographer recently came to take their pictures for the book jacket, Elias 
adored the man. They played and sang throughout the photo session. As the 
photographer left, Elias whispered to his mother: 'Maybe he could be my 
father.' "  
</P>
<P>
 It is a dilemma of the heart for which Alexander said she has no answer.

THE STRAIGHT SHOOTER; RETIRING NRA CHIEF BOB CORBIN LED AS HE LIVES: NO 
COMPROMISES AND NEVER SURRENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few know the man or even the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he is vilified for the lobby he leads. He is at odds with President 
Clinton, Mother Teresa, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, other top 
cops and liberals who consider him a fusty gunslinger. 
</P>
<P>
 In his real, gentler life here, Bob Corbin is a 65-year-old father of three 
daughters; a crew-cut, 130-pound Hoosier who drinks Hamm's and likes country 
cafes that serve biscuits and gravy for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 He dotes on two grandchildren, wife Helen, heating baked beans in the can to 
save on dishes, gunky pipes and prowling for lost gold mines in Arizona's clean 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin does not like career criminals, a Congress in a mood to prohibit 
assault weapons, Washington Post editorials, the views of Sarah Brady -- and 
being photographed with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it would not be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the president of the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burglars read newspapers," he says. To date, no burglar has hit Corbin's home 
cache of hunting rifles, pistols and a fully automatic but fully legal MP5 
submachine gun. "My second concern is the minute people who don't like guns see 
someone holding one, they are opposed to you. I want people to listen to what I 
have to say and then make up their own mind. After that, I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Except to care about those who might presume that Corbin plus an assault rifle 
equals John Rambo. As NRA's top gun notes: "The perception today is that guns 
are evil and people who own guns are evil. I have been in law enforcement all 
my professional career and I don't think I'm evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control advocates, however, disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 They are awaiting Sunday and the NRA's annual meeting in Minneapolis when 
Corbin ends his leadership of a 123-year-old gun club considered by some to be 
a greater threat to public health than the Tobacco Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin has been a devoted president. Yet on his two-year watch, politicians 
have defied the all-mighty NRA and its megabuck phone banks, the Brady bill 
became law and firearm debates rage hotter than a $2 pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be, ask gun controllers, that the NRA is thinking compromise is the 
better part of discretion? Might a new president be closer to moderation and 
Jesse Jackson than extremism and Jesse James? 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't make one bit of difference who becomes president," Corbin snorts. 
"There is no way the present board is going to change direction and thinking of 
NRA. Which is no compromise, no surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder those around former Arizona Atty. Gen. Corbin, his state and its 
legacies do think of him as Buffalo Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a banty rooster who calls a spade a shovel; a frontier thinker who sees 
only blacks and whites, guilt or innocence, victims and perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a little big man of several fascinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corbin has been married to one woman for 34 years, is opposed to abortion, 
favors the death penalty, enrolled his grandson in the NRA at the age of 3 days 
and is a lifelong Republican. Deborah Corbin, his oldest daughter, is divorced, 
supports abortion rights, and is both anti-gun and a registered Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corbin has followed Yaqui guides into Mexico in pursuit of century-old 
whispers about bars of buried gold. His highest fever centers on the Lost 
Dutchman Mine of the Superstition Mountains east of here. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin has spent 40 years and made 300 treks in search of the mine without 
finding enough ore for a pair of cuff links. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corbin may not know where that tha'ar gold is hiding, but he certainly knows 
where its miner is buried. He once lead a municipal drive that restored a 
pioneers' cemetery near downtown Phoenix and the weedy, cracked, 1891 grave of 
Jacob Waltz, last known digger of the Lost Dutchman. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1965, Corbin, as Maricopa County attorney, handled the rape and kidnaping 
prosecution of Ernesto Miranda, whose appeal of an earlier criminal tangle 
produced the Supreme Court's sine qua non decision on suspects' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin won conviction. Miranda went to prison for four years. In 1976, in a 
fight in a Phoenix bar, Miranda was stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were witnesses," Corbin remembers. "But nobody said a word. They knew 
their Miranda rights and that murder remains unsolved." 
</P>
<P>
 * The only creak in Corbin's career was over his friendship with the 
financially powerful developer of the Phoenician resort. When Corbin 
contemplated a run for governor, his friend donated $39,000 to the campaign. 
That was in 1986, when there seemed nothing wrong in accepting money from 
Charles Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, with the savings and loan scandal unraveling, with political enemies 
after a hard-nosed attorney general's hide, Corbin made a typically pugnacious 
gesture. He refunded Keating's $39,000 -- but to the Resolution Trust Corp., 
which is prosecuting and overseeing the S & L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a trademark to Corbin's public service, it was always an office 
with props of a territorial lawyer: roll-top desk, spittoon, the bass tick of a 
Regulator clock and a framed invitation to a 19th-Century public hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin wishes he had lived there and then. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have picked my time, it would have been 1860 in the West," he 
explains. "Arizona. New Mexico. They were all settled by independent, tough, 
strong people who gave up family and friends to struggle out here." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Corbin prowls ghost towns and graveyards. To touch and sense the 
energies of that generation. That's why he has studied outlaw histories and 
recognizes a trace of gunfighter in his makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly why Jim Skelly, friend, political ally and state legislator 
describes Corbin as "the last relic of frontier justice . . . he believes 
wrongdoers should be punished. He doesn't buy that modern crap that all these 
things are society's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Old foes from a dozen years as Arizona's attorney general may doubt Corbin's 
methods and means. But never his uncorruptibility. New enemies from Corbin's 
two NRA terms will dispute his beliefs. But never his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one accuses Corbin of partisan prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Republican Atty. Gen. Corbin busted Republican Gov. Evan Mecham for 
misusing campaign contributions. Charges were dismissed. But only after Mecham 
was impeached.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Corbin indicted former GOP congressman Sam Steiger for extortion of a 
parole board member. Steiger was convicted but won on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fascist at heart," Steiger says. He attacks Corbin for everything from 
a "low IQ" to "bad breath." "But I have a deep and undying bias that won't go 
away by logic and common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Corbin is a law-and-order man in the mold of Roy Bean and somewhere 
to the right of Daryl Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be stability in the law so people know what to do," he believes. 
"Someone once said I would prosecute my own mother. Probably true." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not. Mother is 91. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fascination for firearms began when Robert Keith Corbin was 12 and a .22 
caliber Springfield was a rite of passage for kids in Worthington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin took his first rifle atop a railroad trestle over the junction of the 
Eel and White rivers and plinked at water snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, he ate bananas and milk to make 111 pounds in skivvies, minimum weight 
for joining the Navy. Corbin served two years, spent his GI Bill to study 
accounting, and worked as a court bailiff to pay for 3 1/2 years of night 
school and a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, he knew by heart a Saturday Evening Post story about the Superstition 
Mountains. It told of silver bars a person might trip over, of lost gold mines 
and an immigrant miner named Waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 To Corbin, the piece promised "freedom of the West . . . a place where if you 
gave your word, you didn't have to put it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 One Saturday in 1957, Corbin was admitted to the Indiana Bar. On the following 
Monday, with law books and luggage jammed into a Triumph TR-2, he headed for 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came through the Salt River Canyon at night," he says. "There was this huge 
moon, a million stars and cactus black against the sky. I remember mountains, 
silent, proud, honest. I knew the people would be the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the people first encountered by Corbin as a rookie prosecutor with the 
Maricopa County Attorney's Office were murderers and wife beaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Corbin's impartiality was close to a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard rumors that a judge was signing blank bail bond releases. The jurist 
happened to be the ex-county attorney who had hired Corbin. No matter. Corbin 
took the complaint to the presiding judge. His former boss resigned and left 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As county attorney and state attorney general, there was no misinterpreting 
Corbin's Way: die-hard and unflinching conservativism. 
</P>
<P>
 Lock 'em up and let 'em hear the tinkle of keys being thrown away. If there be 
more criminals, let there be more prisons. To be effective, the death penalty 
must be swift and sure with a limit on appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think I'm a dying breed," he says. "I think I'm a breed that has 
been put back in a corner for the last 30 years. And I think people are waking 
up. We're going back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recent tempering of Arizona by a younger, more liberal electorate, 
Corbin's views were a snug fit. By all analyses, they also built an effective 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under Corbin, the agency became the 10th largest in the nation. He doubled its 
staff of lawyers and investigators, quadrupled the annual budget and scored a 
95% conviction rate. 
</P>
<P>
 And when his terms were done in 1991, his attorneys presented their 
hip-shooting boss with a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Barr, an old adversary from the Arizona House of Representatives, 
doesn't agree with Corbin's shoving ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't concede alternative sides to an issue, he says, stand in the 
way of progress. The history of America is dialogue and compromise while 
deciding what one must give to get. On the other hand, Barr notes, the threat 
of organized crime against Arizona lurked huge when Corbin was in office and 
"he had to fight it hard and fight it large. Yes, organized crime retreated 
before the threat and effectiveness of Bob Corbin." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's cursing would have stirred a dead outlaw. On this, his latest 
prospecting trip, a horse had stomped hard and Corbin's toe was between a rock 
and a hard hoof. But in these harsh Superstition Mountains, which have buried 
six dozen men, coarse words and men are part of the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 It's lovely lore. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Apache Jack was killed by a curse picked up here. 
</P>
<P>
 When they found Adolph Ruth's skull, a hole in the side matched the punch of a 
.45 caliber slug. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner Jacob Weisner died of blood poisoning after ripping an Apache arrow out 
of his arm and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 All had looked for the Lost Dutchman Mine of Jacob Waltz. None would have 
denied this lode was worth dying for: Filthy rich gold ore worth $1.6 million a 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bob Corbin won't stop prowling the Superstitions, poking for the Lost 
Dutchman until he dies. Preferably of natural causes and very wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a more to it than gold lust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superstitions, cool and exquisite in spring, a hot death sentence in 
summer, are Corbin's Walden Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, it's the only place I can go where you (reporters) can't get 
to me," he says. "When I get on a horse, I forget about phones and cities and 
politics. My mind is here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here" is approaching Weaver's Needle, a tall, broad pillar setting directions 
from just about anywhere within the soul of the Superstitions. The rocky, 
broken trail is hours from Apache Junction, where Corbin picked up a new mare. 
But Corbin doesn't need the Needle to find his way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred trips have taught him each crease and creek of the endless 
Superstitions. He has read every word, heard every rumor of the Lost Dutchmen. 
He has held its ore, which is "half-gold, half-quartz, the richest I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to believe that the mine is still there. Although it might be covered 
over. He has studied 100 maps of its location and none agree. But one could be 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 So this day is like all other times he has backpacked the Superstitions. A 
good horse with a back made of bricks. A young sky lifting frowns from the 
canyons. Tobacco in his pipe. Vienna sausages out of the can and always the 
escape of silent loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours into the mountains, Corbin and mount have climbed Black Top with 
its far overview of LeBarge Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin ties the mare to a thorn bush, starts talking and history pours: "They 
found Ruth's body just down there in 1931. Well, his head was found under a 
Palo Verde tree and the body a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marie Jones used to work the Needle. Her grandfather was half-black, 
half-Apache who had told her about a jewel-encrusted, gold statue of Christ 
buried in the Needle by Apaches who had massacred a Mexican pack train.  
</P>
<P>
 "God, don't get me started. But that's why it is intriguing. Like I said, I 
have always wanted to live in the 1800s and this land is the way it was in the 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's peace out here. Except when Crazy Jake is dynamiting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a maiden bid for attorney general, Corbin considered making a 
television commercial that showed him on horseback, a six-gun on each hip. 
During a campaign speech, he suggested that the best way to stop airborne drug 
runners might be to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 With stiff postures his legacy, friends say, no wonder Corbin became president 
of the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were they surprised to learn that he was point man in a coup to reload 
this rich, all-powerful lobby from placid years when membership fell, lobbying 
went limp, association policies emphasized target shooting before self-defense 
and gun control editorials remained unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done is throw out (moderate Warren) Cassidy, the executive vice 
president . . . and brought in (Executive Vice President) Wayne La Pierre with 
the idea that we were going to fight," Corbin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin is comfortable on a sofa at home, an unpretentious adobe ranch with a 
gasp of a view of Phoenix sprawling flatly to the south. There's a portrait on 
a wall, a bad oil of Corbin with the statue of blind justice when both were 
much younger, less jaundiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's iced tea is melting. He is puffing his pipe into a smog alert. The 
topics are NRA and the media, Congress and its Brady Bunch, the state of the 
gun battle and the future of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 NRA membership, he says, is up to 3.4 million from 2.4 million during the 
Cassidy era. Although a recruiting blitz, a campaign to counterattack the 
media, and a program to rebuild national and local lobbies ate $40 million in 
NRA cash reserves, there's still $50 million in the ammo box. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we've instituted a lot of new programs," Corbin notes. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Crime Strike in support of local anti-crime bills and responsible, in 
part, for pushing three-strikes-you're-out legislation. Also seminars to 
instruct women in firearm self-defense and programs on gun safety for 
elementary school students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, challenge Corbin's effectiveness. They say the American 
majority favors some form of gun control; therefore, the NRA is flogging a dead 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin returns fire: "The media says we have lost our clout in Congress. But 
we were in 31 House races two years ago. You know how many we lost? One." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin doesn't understand the media. He thinks that gun control editorials are 
moved more by emotions, by grief at today's violence, than by the balanced 
reason and facts of the issue. Editors and general assignment reporters are 
generally younger, and often from the East, he says, where hands-on experience 
with firearms is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NRA's immediate priority, he says, is zeroing on the Brady Act -- so 
named for press secretary Jim Brady, shot in the brain during the attempted 
assassination of then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 NRA-backed suits in five states are seeking to overturn the law and further 
confirm individual Second Amendment rights to "the right of the people to keep 
and bear arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin sees the Second Amendment as sacrosanct as the First guaranteeing 
freedoms of speech, religion and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," he snorts. The lighter is clacking again, his pipe belching and 
glowing. "Somebody breathes that they are going to do something to the media 
and they are up in arms screaming about First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we scream about Second Amendment rights, we're evil, we're wrong, we 
should compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's all over now. Years of estimating public moods and second-guessing 
political systems. Months of trials, unseeing juries and work days ending at 
dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Until, at 65, Bob Corbin knows that there are no new debates, only stale 
arguments presented by fresh opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got a little old," he says. "Some days you feel like going out and 
fighting. Some days you want somebody else to do it. So I guess it's time I 
backed off and started enjoying myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Helen Corbin will enjoy themselves at Walker, site of a disappeared 
gold town, and the cabin they are rebuilding in the Bradshaw Mountains north of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen will continue to write home-grown and locally successful paperbacks. Bob 
will get really serious about extended explorations to gold fields lost and 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, among the trees and the 7,000-foot silence, with plops of frozen 
snow still clinging at this level, Corbin looked back. Maybe he is out of 
touch; a man whose day and ideas have passed. But they worked well in his time 
and one day, who knows, those old basics of a firm handshake and honest words 
might help this country again. 
</P>
<P>
 He regrets nothing. Except for what his career stole from three daughters: 
"When my kids were little, I thought politics were important and you had to be 
everywhere. If it took you until 3 in the morning to solve a problem, you 
stayed until 3 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But daughter Kathy Corbin-Russ, 33, a wife and mother, NRA-educated gun owner 
and a Phoenix golfing professional, speaks no resentment. She says Dad did what 
a professional dad has to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom tried to balance it all out and that seemed to work fine," she says. "I 
don't think I missed anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori LaJeunesse, 37, a Los Angeles nutritionist and personal trainer, says 
life with father was softer than one might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd done something wrong and had to wait until father to get home, he'd 
ask: 'What do you think you should do?' " she recalls. "Mother would ground you 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Corbin, 41, of Washington, D.C., a membership benefits representative 
with the American Federation of Teachers, sees her father as "a man with 
integrity . . . intense, very smart, reserved." 
</P>
<P>
 But they have been estranged for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a unionist . . . a feminist and a registered Democrat, a member of NOW 
(National Organization of Women) and pro-choice and absolutely anti-gun," she 
says. "So there's sort of no common ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Corbin continues painting and plastering the cabin on an 1897 gold 
claim. He has installed a burglar alarm, for this remote mountain home between 
Potato Patch and Big Bug Creek has been broken into seven times in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 That riles Corbin's sense of frontier justice. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he'd like to string up the burglars. Then display the bodies like 
coyotes as a warning to others. When the corpses crumble, he'd rebuild the 
skeletons with baling wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm joking," he says. "I guess."

RESEARCH ADVANCES ARE BEING MADE; HEALTH: EFFORTS TOWARD UNDERSTANDING 
ALZHEIMER'S 'ARE GOING LIKE GANGBUSTERS.' DRUGS THAT MAY SLOW THE DISEASE ARE 
BEING TESTED.

<P>
 The prognosis for Alzheimer's patients nowadays is still not good. Cognex, the 
one drug approved to treat the condition, only relieves symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Carl W. Cotman, a prominent psychobiologist who directs UC 
Irvine's research into Alzheimer's, efforts toward understanding the disease 
"are going like gangbusters. It's an amazing rate of progress." Drugs that may 
slow the disease are being tested. 
</P>

 Researchers have long known that the disease kills cells in the brain's 
cortex, memory cells that don't regenerate. The effect, which worsens over the 
years, is partially erased memories and an inability to store new ones. Cotman 
says the newest, most promising hypothesis is that Alzheimer's is actually 
normal body processes running amok. Brain cells receive orders to destroy 
themselves and comply, but the orders are bogus. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an established fact in all body cells, 
Cotman says. Under certain circumstances, a cell will trigger its own program 
for self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a society that would ask an undesirable person to go take a 
permanent walk into the wilderness. We think it initially was an adaptive 
mechanism that is used to take out bad-performing cells or sick cells, and it's 
just running away in Alzheimer's disease." 
</P>
<P>
 A protein called beta amyloid is exuded by neurons for some unknown purpose 
and accumulates in the fluids outside the cell. Everyone has a small amount of 
it, but with age, the concentration builds. In some people the proteins 
spontaneously condense into a sticky, fibrous substance that cannot be 
dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Like plaque on teeth, this substance binds to the outside of the cells and 
somehow stimulates or simulates the signal for cell suicide. "It triggers a 
process intended to be triggered by something else," Cotman says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, a few high-risk factors have been identified for Alzheimer's. A head 
injury or cardiovascular disease seems to signal a greater likelihood of 
developing Alzheimer's. Researchers are also on the track of genetic indicators 
and have a few promising clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, researchers are experimenting with ways of slowing the Alzheimer's 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're testing whether physical activity might produce something in the system 
that interferes with the Alzheimer's process," Cotman says. "It's a shot in the 
dark, but we're encouraged. We're getting some indications, but it's too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also turns out that education is an offset. Apparently if you stimulate 
the brain, it becomes more resistant. It's 'use it or lose it,' exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin C and E sometimes are prescribed to protect against, perhaps even 
slow, the progress of Alzheimer's, but their effectiveness has not been proved. 
"There is solid evidence that the vitamins protect against heart and blood 
vessel problems due to aging, and they're safe to take in moderate quantities, 
so why not?" Cotman says. "I take a gram of C and 800 units of E daily, but it 
varies person to person." 
</P>
<P>
 Most diseases are studied through animal tests, but for Alzheimer's "there's 
no animal model; that's the big problem," Cotman says. "We haven't figured out 
how to give rats Alzheimer's yet. So you're into cell culture and simpler 
models, and so whatever you've got, you've got to work on it until it's safe, 
then put it in man to find out. That's very time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 Something similar to Alzheimer's does occur in animals, Cotman says. Other 
primates show similar symptoms in old age. Old dogs sometimes suffer from 
memory problems, making it literally impossible to teach them new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real efforts in Alzheimer's research are only a few years old," Cotman 
says, "but we're getting more and more solid leads all the time." STEVE EMMONS

ON BEING A SINGLE PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoshana Alexander, author of "In Praise of Single Parents," offers these 
tips:  
</P>
<P>
 * Take on the job as if you were about to climb a mountain. Dedicate yourself 
to the task.In other words, choose to do it, instead of trying to find ways out 
of it -- such as looking for a partner to share the parenting. Being a single 
parent will strengthen you as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make the child a priority. Choose work that has flexible hours, if possible. 
Create a schedule that includes daily time with the child. Lead a 
child-oriented life, but not a child-centered life. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extend your family. It is crucial to include others in your and your child's 
lives. Reach out to friends, neighbors, relatives. Join support groups or live 
with others. Do whatever you can to build a group of people you consider to be 
family but who are not necessarily blood relations. Remember the South African 
adage: "It takes a whole village to raise a child." 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn that it's OK to ask for help. In fact, it's essential. Realize that 
the friend or extended family member you ask for assistance may consider it a 
gift and an honor to be asked, whereas you consider it a favor. BETTIJANE

'90S FAMILY; ON THEIR BEST RESTAURANT BEHAVIOR; EATING OUT WITH THE KIDS 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FOOD FIGHT. TEACH THEM WHAT'S APPROPRIATE -- AND PUTTING A 
FRENCH FRY IN SOMEONE'S HAIR ISN'T. 
</P>

<P>
 Adrian and Larry Miller of Beverly Hills take their three children -- Daniel, 
11, Felicia, 8, and Madeline, 3 -- out to dinner at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always taken them out to nice restaurants, mostly because we love 
food," Adrian Miller said. "When we go out, we have high expectations and (the 
children) know they can come out to eat with us if they behave." 
</P>
<P>
 They usually do behave, she said. But not all parents -- or nearby diners -- 
are so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are unpredictable, (but) by the time a child is 4 or 5 years old they 
should have a sense of what is appropriate behavior in a restaurant," said Judi 
Craig, a San Antonio psychologist, parenting columnist and author of the book 
"Parents on the Spot -- What to Do When Kids Put You There" (William Morrow and 
Co./Skylight Press, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Craig said good restaurant behavior can be taught. 
</P>
<P>
 First, parents need to coach children on the difference between a loud outdoor 
voice and a quiet indoor voice -- something especially hard for overly active 
children to master, Craig said. She suggests a simple incentive system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting still in a restaurant can be another tough one. Begin by setting a 
timer at home and again using the incentive system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going in, Susan Stevens of Saugus instructs her three sons -- Garrett, 
7, Kyle, 3, and Corry, 19 months -- to use their "best restaurant behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them if they misbehave, we will go to the car and wait until everybody 
else is done," she said. It is a rule she has had to enforce only a couple of 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents take pride in how well their children behave when eating out," 
said Steve Russell, general manager for Old Country Buffet in Kalamazoo, Mich., 
a family-restaurant chain based in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents are trying to correct the problem, and people usually know that. 
I find that table manners really begin at home. Most children know the common 
courtesies, like 'please' and 'thank you,' but children need good table manners 
whether they're in a McDonald's or a restaurant with table service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and other experts say common sense should prevail. Tired or very 
hungry children will not do well on a Friday night at the busiest place in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unreasonable to ask small children to wait for a table and then wait for 
dinner too," Miller said. "We either make reservations or go when it won't be 
so crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Daphne Vaccarello of Stanton always brings a small snack or asks for crackers 
when she and her husband, Tom, take Christopher, 4, and Daniel, 2, out to eat. 
"When a child sits at a table he expects to be fed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering appetizers or finger foods can tide kids over until the meal arrives, 
but don't expect to have serious adult conversation with preschoolers at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your main focus is taking care of the kids and keeping them entertained," 
Vaccarello said. Like many parents, she totes crayons, paper or other materials 
for quiet activities that will keep her children busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finds little things, such as ordering special drinks and appetizers for 
the children, can make eating out a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike DeLuca, editor in chief of Restaurant Hospitality magazine, said parents 
should encourage the waiter or waitress to include the children in the dining 
experience: "Children like to be spoken to. It makes them feel important." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids wield impressive clout in the restaurant industry. According to the 
latest U.S. Census Bureau projections, the population of children age 5 to 13 
is expected to increase by 4 million during the 1990s, and restaurateurs are 
following the demographics. Many bistros are turning in white tablecloths and 
bud vases for butcher paper and crayons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chains like Bennigan's and Friday's that catered to singles in the '70s and 
early '80s are good examples of places that changed their image to keep those 
same customers who are now moms and dads," DeLuca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides children's menus and crayons, other ideas that have become part of 
attracting family dollars include hands-on activity centers, magicians and 
giveaways, such as craft kits, finger puppets and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that a place offering a children's menu will probably be more 
tolerant of kids. If they offer balloons or have video games, it's an added 
bonus," Vaccarello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families find that taking the kids to dinner is cheaper than hiring a 
baby-sitter. In fact, some restaurants have even put child care on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Until January's Northridge earthquake, Tampico Tilly's in Santa Monica 
provided a supervised play area. At A Piece of Quiet in Denver, children are 
supervised in a playroom separated by a one-way soundproof glass wall. While 
mom and dad enjoy fine dining on white table linens, the kids are playing and 
enjoying their meals in a scaled-down setting within eye-shot. Bistro Banlieue 
in Chicago provides dinner guests with vouchers for a nearby child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Letting your children disturb other diners is the ultimate restaurant sin. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your child is going to be disruptive and it's not working out, just get up 
and leave," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unattended children are a potential problem and definitely an annoyance to 
other guests, said Russell, of Old Country Buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young children will have small outbursts," he said. "In a family restaurant 
it usually goes unnoticed. In fact, most people are giggling or smiling because 
we've all been through it. If the problem is handled quickly, it's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Khessali recalled a particularly harrowing experience in an upscale 
restaurant a couple of years ago involving her son, then 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got there, Alexander wouldn't sit in his chair. Then he started 
throwing silverware from the table. The waiter brought pickles to the table, 
which (Alexander) then flung across the room," said Khessali, of Coral Springs, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then Alexander got down and sat on an elderly gentleman's lap at another 
table. . . . The manager moved our food and everything to another table. 
Meanwhile, Alexander is lying in the main aisle as waitresses are stepping over 
him. The management told us to handle the problem or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, we got him to the table to eat. There was a woman with teased 
hair sitting behind us. Alexander put a french fry in her hair without her 
knowledge. At that point, the manager packed up our food and showed us the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really a good kid," Khessali said with a sigh. "It's just when you take 
him to a restaurant. . . ."

WHEN SMOKE CLEARS IN THE GUN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The firearm debate has built a cross-fire riddled with more ricochets than 
conclusive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claim: Control advocates point to a 1989 statement by Baltimore police chief 
Leonard Supenski, who said he was weary of "passing out flags to widows of 
officers killed by drug dealers with Uzis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Counter: Pro-gun forces say FBI statistics, compiled for the National Rifle 
Assn., prove that between 1980 and 1989, only one police officer -- and in 
Puerto Rico -- had been killed by such a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claim: Assault rifles are responsible for the majority of gun murders and 
should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Counter: FBI data show that rifles of all types account for less than 4.5% of 
murder weapons. Assault rifles represent only a minuscule number. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claim: Anti-gun forces point to a recent medical report that says keeping a 
handgun in the home triples the chance that someone will be killed there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Counter: Pro-gun representatives refer to another study that says firearms are 
used 2.1 million times per year to deter crime -- and without any shots fired.  
</P>
<P>
 In several days of interviews with The Times, NRA President Bob Corbin 
certainly put a spin on his arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 He said NRA money and influence were responsible for the 1992 defeat of Rep. 
Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), an 11-term incumbent. Alexander certainly supports gun 
control. What Corbin did not mention is that voters were equally dismayed by 
Alexander's record of writing 487 bad checks, the worst offender in the House 
bank scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin said ABC, CBS and NBC television networks -- also the Washington Post 
and New York Times -- refuse NRA advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted, spokesmen for the Post and the New York Times -- also the Los 
Angeles Times -- said they have never refused NRA advertising. Network 
television representatives confirmed that they do not accept NRA "issue 
advertising" -- but such policies also refuse commercials from groups in favor 
of gun control, abortion and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When the Second Amendment was written, the right to bear arms 
involved only muzzle-loading flintlocks. Would signers have allowed the right 
to bear semiautomatic rifles and handguns with 15-shot magazines? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Well, I could say the same thing about you and your business, freedom 
of press and freedom of speech. Did our forefathers foresee television and 
radio? No. Yet the First Amendment still applies and protects freedom of speech 
and freedom of the press from all the technology we have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is gun control synonymous with crime control? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Far from it. Did drug laws reduce the use of drugs and the amount of drugs 
coming into this country? A criminal is a criminal. A criminal doesn't obey any 
law. What makes you think he is going to obey a little gun law?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In 1991, 61% of 30,000 suicides were by firearms. Surely gun controls would 
reduce that number. 
</P>
<P>
 A: "If somebody is going to commit suicide and they can't find a gun, they'll 
find a knife, they'll find poison, they'll jump off a bridge. Or get Jack 
Kevorkian." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: However, gun controls would certainly reduce the number of children 
accidentally shot by playing with handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 A: "That is terrible, tragic. So do we do away with cars so cars wouldn't be 
hitting them when they run out in the street? If we do away with all poisons, 
kids wouldn't get under sinks and drink poison. If we didn't have swimming 
pools, they wouldn't be drowning in swimming pools. Kids are going to have 
accidents and are going to die. It's a part of life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Between the poles of Handgun Control Inc. and the NRA, does there exist an 
even, civilized reality? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "No. Because they lie. They said: 'All we want is the Brady Bill and a 
waiting period.' And then after it is passed, they say it is just the 
beginning, the camel's nose under the tent and 'we're coming after all your 
guns.' So why should we compromise? Let them compromise once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But they claim a legitimate concern with rising violence and high-powered 
weapons in the hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 A: "About 70 million law-abiding citizens own 200 million guns in this 
country. Less than 3/10ths of 1% of those 70 million misuse them. And if 99.77% 
don't misuse 'em, why do you want to punish them? Criminals are the problem, 
not the law-abiding gun owner."

 A few tips from parents for avoiding mealtime meltdowns: 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for restaurants that cater to families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go during off hours to avoid a wait, or make reservations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Take restless children for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring crayons and paper or a small quiet toy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring a small snack or ask for crackers before the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order appetizers or finger foods for toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring your own toddler-sized utensils and cups for little ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for foam cups with lids for drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always ask for extra napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Include your child in the dining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't allow children to run around or disturb other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discipline children away from the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reward good behavior. KATHLEEN O. RYAN

PEOPLE KILLING GUNS; EVIDENCE ROOM OVERFLOWING, ANAHEIM POLICE WILL ENSURE 300 
WEAPONS STAY OFF STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seizing an average of three firearms a day, Anaheim police have confiscated 
enough weapons from city streets to open up their own gun shop or equip a small 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could arm two battalions with the weapons I have here," said Anaheim Police 
Sgt. Bill Lane, who is responsible for securing the more than 3,000 guns in the 
department's property and evidence room. "I probably could arm an entire 
brigade." 
</P>
<P>
 In non-military terms, suffice it to say there are plenty of guns to go 
around. Too many, according to Anaheim officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Lane will destroy about 300 guns in the city's arsenal as part of an 
ongoing effort to permanently remove the weapons from the streets. The rest 
will continue to be held as evidence in pending criminal cases. "As soon as we 
can, we destroy them," Lane said, walking past a wall lined with guns. "But the 
supply doesn't seem to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Along one side of the property room is a cache of weapons that would make some 
pawnshop owners and gun aficionados drool. 
</P>
<P>
 There are military weapons, antique rifles, machine guns, assault rifles, 
rifles with bayonets and hunting scopes, and sawed-off shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 In another area, shelves are packed with various caliber handguns, including 
homemade "zip guns," revolvers, archery-type bow-guns and palm-sized 
derringers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nasty little weapon," said Lane, holding up a 12-gauge sawed-off 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most law enforcement officials decry the proliferation of firearms in 
their communities, some police departments throughout the state sell their 
confiscated firearms to the public as a way of raising sorely needed revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the cities of Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Orange stopped selling 
weapons back to the community, in part, because of public opposition to such 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Ernst & Associates, a Modesto-based auction company, decided 
about three months ago to stop holding weapon auctions for more than 700 law 
enforcement agencies that contracted with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said they probably could raise hundreds of thousands of 
dollars if they sold seized weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials have been adamantly opposed to that idea and are lobbying 
the state Legislature to approve a bill by Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San 
Diego), which requires that all guns seized by police be demolished. "We've 
been destroying weapons for years and years now. It's a moral issue," said 
Kristine Thalman, the city's intergovernmental relations officer. "We can't see 
the point of taking guns off the streets and then recirculating those guns back 
into the city." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the potential revenue benefits did not outweigh the potential 
dangers. "We feel it's just not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thalman added that about 70% of the firearms seized by Anaheim are not legally 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 firearms and several hundred knives will be "chop-sawed," basically 
cut in two pieces and then sold as scrap metal. Included in the demolition will 
be about 100 firearms, which were traded in by the public in February for 
Mighty Ducks hockey tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thalman said state law allows the city to destroy weapons once a year, 
although under certain circumstances such as space considerations it can be 
done more often. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make sure they (the guns) can't be repaired," said Lane, a 21-year veteran 
with the department who is also a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves. "We 
make sure they can't ever be used again."

 Kindergarten classes in Orange County are more crowded this year than ever, 
but average class sizes in other elementary and junior high grades have leveled 
off, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Orange County Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing a steady trend of growth over the past six years, kindergarten 
classes in all but a handful of local districts are larger than classes for 
older students this year, the new figures show. The county average for 
kindergarten is 29.5 students per class, up from 29 last year. The average 
class size in first through third grade is 28.9 students, and in fourth through 
eighth grade the average is 28.4, repeating last year's numbers exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year since 1989-90 that averages for all grades have not 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that it didn't go up more. It's gratifying that we're not over 40 
-- though there are classes out there that are that large," Department of 
Education Supt. John Dean said. "If we can keep the averages where they are, 
and not let them get any higher, we'll be making some real progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The data is based on averages from the first seven months of the 1993-94 
school year. The county does not track class sizes in ninth through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing class sizes reflect both Orange County's growing school-age 
population and budget cuts that have forced districts to increase their 
student-teacher ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only move (administrators) can make," Dean said. "You don't 
save much money by cutting out paper clips. The number of children in a class 
makes all the difference in the world. That's the only flexibility you have; 
they've cut everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified's kindergartens are the most crowded in the county, with an 
average of 32.4 students, and the district also has the largest classes in 
first through third grade, with an average of 31.6 students. In fourth through 
eighth grade, Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified has the most students per class, 
with an average of 31.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Unified has the smallest classes at all three grade levels, 
averaging 27 students per kindergarten, 26.4 in first through third grade and 
23.1 in fourth through eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 At all three grade levels, Westminster City School District saw the most 
growth in class size, Newport-Mesa Unified had the most significant drops in 
kindergarten and primary grades, and Savanna School District, which includes 
parts of Anaheim and Buena Park, saw the largest reduction in the upper 
elementary grades. 
</P>
<P>
 At the kindergarten level, 17 districts saw class sizes rise, with the biggest 
jump coming in Westminster, where the average grew from 27.5 students in 
1992-93 to 30.8 students this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Six districts have smaller kindergarten classes this year than they did in 
1992-93, with the most significant reduction in Newport-Mesa Unified, where the 
average fell from 31.1 students last year to 29.3 now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just made it a real priority," said Newport-Mesa Supt. Mac Bernd. The 
Newport-Mesa board allocated money to reduce class size last summer, and Bernd 
kept a close watch, monitoring class size with weekly reports in the opening 
months of school.  
</P>
<P>
 "The smaller the class, the more attention the teacher can give to individual 
students," Bernd said. "We can't get them as small as we'd like, but anything 
we can do in that direction we think helps teaching and learning."  
</P>
<P>
 Although county averages for first through eighth grade remained steady from 
last year to this year, several districts saw significant growth in those 
grades. The largest increases came in Westminster, where first through third 
grade class sizes rose from 28.8 to 29.4 and fourth through eighth jumped from 
25.2 students to 29.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster City School District spokeswoman Audrey Brown attributed the 
district's major increases to a $1.6-million cut in a $26-million budget, and 
noted that the growth in class size was outlined in the new teacher contract 
that took effect last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went for many years as one of the (few) districts in the county that had 
small class sizes -- last year it just dawned on us that we couldn't go on," 
Brown said. "If we had more money from the state, (class size definitely would 
be) something we would change, but it has a real financial impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts have introduced programs to compensate for the ever-increasing 
class sizes. In Capistrano Unified kindergartens, for example, each teacher 
spends 90 minutes a day team teaching in another classroom, so students get 
more individual attention for academic exercises. Visiting parents also help, 
particularly in younger grades where the lessons are simplest. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about kindergarten that makes it so easy is, we do get a lot of 
volunteers," said Kathy Kirtz, who has 31 children in her class at George White 
Elementary in Laguna Niguel. "I can't say that it's been real difficult for me 
at all. The teaming makes for an ideal situation and the parent volunteers are 
so wonderful and come in and help out." Crowded Classrooms 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten class sizes in Orange County averaged an all-time high this year: 
29.5. Several districts averaged more than 30 students per room. The average 
countywide leveled off in the first through eighth grades, though many 
districts had increases. Average class sizes, based on information for the

NIXON LIBRARY WILL INHERIT BULK OF ESTATE; LAW: FORMER PRESIDENT LEFT CASH 
GIFTS, PERSONAL ITEMS TO DAUGHTERS AND GRANDCHILDREN. LEGAL ACTION OVER 
WATERGATE TAPES, OTHER DOCUMENTS COULD BRING WINDFALL TO YORBA LINDA 
INSTITUTION.

<P>
 The Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace will inherit the bulk of the former 
President's estate, but a legal action over the infamous Watergate tapes and 
other documents could also mean a windfall worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in 1992 ordered the federal government to compensate Nixon for 
documents and tapes seized during the Watergate scandal, which could be worth a 
fortune as collectors' items. But the value of those papers and tapes has yet 
to be determined, and the beneficiary of that money was not specified in the 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's 37th President left cash gifts to his four grandchildren and 
bequeathed his diaries and other personal items to his daughters, Julie Nixon 
Eisenhower and Patricia Nixon Cox, according to a will filed May 11 in Bergen 
County, N.J., where Nixon lived the past decade to be closer to his 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon died April 22 at age 81. He signed his will on Feb. 24, eight months 
after the death of his wife, Pat. The will does not estimate the worth of the 
estate left by the former President and First Lady, but it is believed to be in 
the millions. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritance will help the $21-million Nixon library, a key tourist 
attraction in the area that has struggled financially since its opening in 
July, 1990. According to the will, the library received $2.65 million in cash 
gifts from the former President over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took care of his legacy," Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley said Tuesday. 
"Yorba Linda appreciates it. It could be a boon to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential windfall in the lawsuit involves a federal appellate court 
ruling in November, 1992, that the government may keep documents and tapes 
seized during the Watergate investigations, but must pay Nixon for the 
historically valuable documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge must determine the just compensation. Any money received from 
his lawsuit seeking the tapes would become a "charitable gift," according to 
the will, which does not specify to whom. 
</P>
<P>
 In the will, Nixon directs his executors to continue any pending lawsuit 
regarding ownership of his property "for as long as they, in their discretion, 
deem it appropriate to do so, knowing my wishes in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Nixon's daughters not survived him, Nixon instructed that the diaries and 
other items be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon defined the items as "any notes, tapes, transcribed notes, folders, 
binders, or books that are owned by me or to which I may be entitled under a 
judgment of law . . . that may contain my daily, weekly or monthly activities, 
thoughts or plans." 
</P>
<P>
 If Nixon's daughters decline to accept the items, they are to be turned over 
to the library, according to the will. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said his daughters have first claim to his personal property, but cannot 
take more than 3% of the total value, although the will bequeaths the balance 
of the estate to his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The will does not specify who will receive royalties from Nixon's best-selling 
books.  
</P>
<P>
 The former President gave $50,000 to each of his four grandchildren. Three of 
the grandchildren also get amounts ranging from $10,000 to $70,000 to 
"equalize" past gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Library director John H. Taylor and New York attorney William E. Griffin were 
named co-executors of the will. 
</P>
<P>
 The will declares that the balance of a $1.2-million pledge Nixon made to his 
library last year must be paid first before the rest of the estate is paid out. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's only presidential library to operate entirely without public 
funds, the institution lost $1.5 million during 1991 and part of 1992. Library 
officials blamed the loss on early expenditures on promotions and special 
events and vowed to cut expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The library includes the wood farmhouse Nixon's father built from a kit. 
Library officials believe attendance will soar since the President was buried 
alongside his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials and attorneys did not return phone calls.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; SHORTFALL IMPERILS ANTI-GANG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Gang Violence Suppression Program will end next year if outside 
funding cannot be found for it, officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was implemented in 1992 with a grant from the state Office of 
Criminal Justice Planning. Its purpose is to decrease gang violence by 
vigorously citing minors for violating La Habra's curfew and loitering in 
public, and by monitoring student truancy at high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, 91 youths have been cited for loitering on public 
streets between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., police said. They said the threat of a 
citation, the consequent court appearance and $50 fine has deterred many 
youngsters from hanging out late at night and early in the morning, when most 
gang activity is reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The program this year is being funded with $109,600 from the state and $46,519 
from the city. The state grant will dry up in fiscal year 1995-96, and the city 
says it cannot afford to support it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that although gang problems still exist in La Habra, there 
has been a noticeable reduction in gang-related murders due to the program, 
which involves schools, community organizations and volunteers as well as 
police. No gang-related homicides were reported in the past year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its curfew enforcement aspect, the program provides for a 
police officer to be stationed Mondays through Fridays at the city's two high 
schools -- La Habra and Sonora. Those officers work with school officials to 
crack down on truancy. They also serve on the School Attendance Review Board in 
an effort to keep kids in school and off the streets, Police Chief Steven 
Staveley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been so successful with this program," he said. "It is making the 
gang lifestyle unattractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Staveley pointed to the Police Department's role in closely monitoring the 
city's 40 most notorious gang members. He said 29 are in jail and the rest are 
checked on constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get them to deviate from the gang lifestyle but if they 
violate the law, they're going to jail," Staveley said. "Gangs have been here 
for 75 years so they are not going away overnight, but we're making progress."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CONDO FIRE LEAVES SIX HOMELESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire destroyed two units of a condominium complex Tuesday, leaving at least 
six people homeless and causing about $250,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman Karl Feierabend said the fire started 
about 1 p.m. in one of the ground floor units at South Coast Terrace, 1001 W. 
Stevens Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five firefighters from the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa fire departments 
contained the blaze in 15 minutes, Feierabend said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the units in the complex were destroyed and another was damaged. 
Investigators continued sifting through the rubble late Tuesday afternoon, 
seeking the fire's cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross provided at least five people with hotel rooms, 
clothing and food and, in one case, medicine. The Red Cross will also help the 
evacuees find places to rent, officials said.FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS CUT 46 POSITIONS FROM EMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting the dramatic downturn in the state economy, county officials 
approved a sweeping reduction of one of their largest bureaucracies, slicing 46 
positions Tuesday from the Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, achieved through the elimination of vacant positions, were approved 
by the Board of Supervisors.The action was expected to save the county 
government about $2.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are part of a five-year austerity plan for an agency that grew 
rapidly during the county construction boom of the 1980s but has since seen its 
workload shrink as development slowed and more South County municipal 
incorporations were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 EMA manages the planning of residential and business development in the 
county's unincorporated areas. The agency also oversees the county's building 
permit functions, building inspections, public works, housing and 
redevelopment, and harbors, beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the cuts Tuesday, staff reductions in the past two years total 250 
positions. When the agency's reorganization is complete by June, 1997, 
officials hope to have eliminated 337 positions for a savings of nearly $250 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like having a 190-pound man go on a diet and lose 30 pounds," said 
Ronald J. Novello, EMA's director of administration. "We still have 10 pounds 
to lose, but everybody knows that the last 10 pounds are the hardest to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Novello, who said the reductions have been particularly exacting on the 
agency, characterized the process at times as a trip through "the valley of 
despair." 
</P>
<P>
 But Novello said the agency is functioning well at its new staffing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad to see you are out of the valley of despair and into the sunshine," 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SHOP CENTER SITE FOR SCHOOL BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A City Council majority pledged support for the Santa Ana Unified School 
District's plan to build a middle school at a shopping center after residents 
asked for help and blasted Councilwoman Lisa Mills for lobbying state officials 
to pull funding from the pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no price too high for making sure that as my kids go through the 
system, they're provided with adequate school facilities," said Mayor Daniel H. 
Young, who promised to write state officials in support of the controversial 
site in the Bristol Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 residents -- most of them parents whose children could someday attend 
the school -- waited more than four hours to raise the issue at Monday night's 
council meeting, holding signs that read "Save Our Space-Saver School," "We 
Support the Site" and "Lisa Mills Doesn't Speak for Us." 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be built in the busy shopping center at Bristol and 17th 
streets as part of a novel state program designed to add new schools in crowded 
urban areas without condemning homes or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, several close to tears, begged the council members to present a 
positive and united face to Sacramento officials, who will decide next month 
whether to pay for the "space-saver" school or kill the project.  
</P>
<P>
 The school district could become the first in the state to build a space-saver 
school, but the project has come under increasing fire both here and in 
Sacramento in recent weeks, alarming parents and sharply dividing first the 
school board and now the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We desperately need schools in the city. It would make many of us happy to 
see the council show support for the school district," resident Kathi Jo 
Brunning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills recently wrote to state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) suggesting that 
the district overlooked cheaper sites that could provide a better youth 
environment. She sent similar form letters to 4,000 people in her district, 
urging them to write and fax Greene, chairman of the state board that hands out 
money for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council declined to take a formal vote on the project, several 
council members expressed support. 
</P>
<P>
 Young invited other council members to join him in writing state officials. 
Councilmen Ted R. Moreno and Robert L. Richardson pledged support Monday night, 
and Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. said Tuesday that he stands behind the 
school district's choice of the Bristol Marketplace site. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas E. Lutz said he could not support the site because 
information he had seen justifying the choice was "loosey-goosey at best." 
</P>
<P>
 If built, the school would be designated a "fundamental" school, where parents 
have a greater degree of control and responsibility for their children's 
education. Mills said she feels for the parents who want this project and she 
realizes the city needs another intermediate fundamental school. But she cannot 
support the site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy sparked by Mills' letter came as state officials already were 
expressing discomfort with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a preliminary appraisal, the state put aside nearly $23 million in 
December for the school. But state officials have said in recent weeks that the 
project may not fit the spirit of the space-saver legislation, in part because 
the HomeBase store and Montgomery Ward automotive center at the mall would have 
to be torn down and rebuilt elsewhere at state expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board will decide next month whether to proceed with the 
project. Greene said he will hold a public meeting on the matter at 7 p.m. May 
26 at a yet undecided Santa Ana location. LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; HOMELESS CHILDREN SPEND NOTABLE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Willy Martinez usually listens to the driving lyrics and beats of rap music, 
but at a musical show Tuesday he was introduced to the breezier sounds of the 
Beach Boys. And he loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 He also got his first taste of Italian opera, gospel music and folk songs. The 
5-year-old boy, who adores the rap group Kriss Kross, was overwhelmed by the 
new sounds but said he liked every bit of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," Willy said after being treated to a 45-minute musical show by a 
quartet from the Master Chorale of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy and 20 other children gathered at the YWCA in Orange for the show, 
organized by the Homeless Outreach Program for Education, also called Project 
HOPE, a federally funded program for homeless children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to present music that they may not have heard before," said Sandy 
McCune, the chorale's community coordinator. "We want the kids to know music is 
fun, and it's something that people can do together." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Robinson, who heads the three-member Project HOPE staff, said the children 
do not attend regular schools. Ranging in age from 5 to 13, they come from 
families around the county who live in shelters, motels and even cars and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 Project HOPE is run by the county Department of Education. The Orange YWCA 
provides bus transportation, breakfast and lunch for the children, and the 
First Presbyterian Church on Grand Avenue provides the classrooms, where the 
students get 2 1/2 hours of instruction each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't miss school very often," Robinson said. "The breakfast and lunch 
are a big help to the parents, and the children receive a lot of attention 
here. They respond very well."

<P>
 The show Tuesday was intended to introduce students to a variety of musical 
forms, Robinson said, and encourage them to take up music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said 9-year-old Debbi Lervold. "We got to sing, listen to the 
music and dance. And we also got to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Murrer, 6, loved a medley of Disney songs so much that he danced for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was touching," said Gary Busby, one of the singers. "This may be the 
brightest spot of their week." 
</P>
<P>
 Busby, who has been with the singing group five years, said they encourage the 
children to participate by singing along or dancing with the performers. The 
children tend to be timid at first, but it doesn't take long before they're 
participating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCune said her group performs at elementary and junior high schools around 
the county, usually before large audiences. Performing before a small group of 
homeless children was special, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little more intimate," she said. "We were able to give a little more 
individual attention." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; OFFICIALS CRACK DOWN AT RAILROAD CROSSINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to decrease accidents and deaths on railroad tracks, police and 
the California Public Utilities Commission spent Tuesday cracking down on 
motorists violating traffic laws at railroad crossings.  
</P>
<P>
 While one officer rode a train to watch for violators, others monitored the 
streets, issuing citations for careless driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The citations cost up to $271. PUC spokesman Jim McInerney said the choices 
are "a warning, an expensive citation or the worst punishment: the death 
penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 McInerney, whose agency regulates train operations in the state, said 99% of 
rail accidents are caused by drivers or pedestrians who ignore flashing warning 
lights and lowered gates. He said railroad accidents have risen fivefold in the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 In April an 18-year-old man standing precariously near tracks in Buena Park 
with four friends stumbled into the path of a freight train and was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a 21-year-old man trying to outrun an Amtrak train on his bicycle 
was struck and killed at Trestles, a beach near San Onofre. The same year, a 
49-year-old man was killed by a train as he walked along tracks in Anaheim, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent deaths include those of the two women who fell while trying to 
run across tracks in south Anaheim, the same site where two brothers died while 
driving around a gate trying to outrun a train. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 160 people died and 127 people were injured in 491 collisions with 
trains throughout the state, McInerney said. More than half the accidents 
stemmed from drivers failing to stop, driving around barriers or crashing 
through gates, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many motorists, pedestrians and cyclists tend to ignore crossing safety laws, 
McInerney said. "Flashing red lights mean you are required to stop. 
Unfortunately, people think they have to hurry up and get across before the 
gates come down." 
</P>
<P>
 To raise awareness of railroad crossing safety, La Habra schoolchildren, 
paramedics, police and volunteers will stage a mock accident today. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SMOKELESS TOBACCO DANGERS OUTLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 100 high school students who chew tobacco learned about the dangers of 
the habit at a conference on Tuesday when they saw graphic photographs of 
cancer and gum disease caused by smokeless tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches and advisers pulled many of the students out of class to attend the 
conference, called "Spittin' in the Wind: The Dangers of Smokeless Tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 Former California Angels first baseman Rod Carew and Angels pitcher Mike 
Butcher told students about how they became addicted to tobacco. Anti-tobacco 
workers then broke the youths into groups to talk about chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they listened to speakers, some students sneaked out of the conference 
rooms at Fullerton Racquetball World to use chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's as natural as putting on my socks in the morning," said Jason 
Dangler, 18, a senior at Magnolia High School in Anaheim. "It's going to be my 
personal choice when I want to quit."  
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual conference about chewing tobacco in Orange County was 
sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the Angels and the county Health Care 
Agency and Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20% of male high school students in the country either had tried 
smokeless tobacco or used it regularly, according to a 1990 survey run by the 
Centers for Disease Control. Only about 7% reported using it in surveys 
conducted in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the Southern Coast Regional Board indicated that about one 
in 14 youths in Orange County aged 12 to 14 said they had tried chewing 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' Butcher said tobacco use is often prevalent among athletes and 
residents of rural areas. He began chewing tobacco in 1983 when he was in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend said, 'Try it, it'll relax you for exams,' " Butcher said. "But I 
couldn't study because I was so dizzy from the tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Butcher kept chewing. He and his roommate built a pyramid of chewing 
tobacco cans in their room. During the baseball season, he would chew more than 
a can of tobacco a day and reduce it to two or three dips a week during the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to quit in 1993 after he found a small precancerous lump on his 
lip. "I just got sick of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Norco High School students wearing cowboy hats listened as Butcher 
told them about how using tobacco could result in cancer of the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot of new stuff here," said Ronnie Bowen, 16, a Norco High 
sophomore.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said he started chewing tobacco when he was 11. He picked up samples at 
a rodeo -- before handing out such samples was banned.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first it gave me a buzz," Bowen said. "Then it makes you lightheaded, kind 
of shaky. . . . It makes you relaxed. It never made me sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 18-year-old student from Anaheim's Canyon High School ducked outside 
for a quick dip. "Yeah, it's disgusting, I know," he said, stuffing the brown 
leaves in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to quit." ALICIA DI RADO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kris Rideout's fascination with Asia dates to her childhood, when her father 
would return home from business trips filled with stories about the region. 
</P>
<P>
 So it didn't surprise friends and family members when Rideout, who grew up in 
Irvine and graduated from University High School in 1991, majored in Asian 
Pacific Studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her continuing interest in the Far East landed Rideout a 1994 Fulbright 
scholarship. She will travel to Singapore this summer to study Asian woman 
entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rideout, 21, said the scholarship will allow her to research the impact that 
female entrepreneurs have on the Pacific Rim economy and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role that women are playing in Asia and around the world is very 
important," she said. "It's the kind of thing that is hard to learn from books 
without going there and meeting the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Rideout will leave Orange County for Singapore in July. She will begin an MBA 
program at a university there and interview dozens of businesswomen in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of her year abroad, Rideout will write a report that looks at what 
Asian businesswomen are doing and compares their status to women in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Rideout was born in New York but has lived in Irvine since she was 12. Her 
father worked at IBM and traveled frequently to Asia. "His stories fascinated 
me," she said. "I was very interested in the Pacific Rim, even as a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Rideout said she hopes to learn Japanese when she returns to the United 
States. She also plans to earn a business administration degree from a U.S. 
university. Eventually, she'd like to work in international business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fulbright Scholarship program was named after the late U.S. Sen. William 
Fulbright of Arkansas. It is administered by the federal government. Considered 
one of academia's most prestigious fellowships, the program is designed to 
foster understanding between the United States and foreign countries. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST; CANDIDATES REACT TO KOLL DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisorial candidate Haydee Tillotson reacted mildly Tuesday to news that 
her campaign co-chairman has advised the Koll Real Estate Group to split its 
support between her and an opponent. But a third candidate in the 2nd District 
supervisorial race cried foul over the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson downplayed the significance of a confidential April 13 memo from 
attorney John P. Erskine to two top Koll officials, which, according to news 
reports, advised them to divide $40,000 in corporate fund raising between 
Tillotson and Jim Silva, a Huntington Beach city councilman who is one of her 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson, a Huntington Beach property manager, said she had not seen the 
memo, had spoken only briefly with Erskine about it and had not pressed him on 
it because he cited attorney-client privilege with the Koll company. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney with Nossaman, Guthner, Knox & Elliott, Erskine works as a 
land-use lawyer for Koll, trying to help the company obtain county approval for 
its controversial proposal to build 4,286 homes near the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Erskine could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But Tillotson described him 
as a longtime friend and said she had no plans to replace him as unpaid 
co-chairman of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson's campaign manager, Chris St. Hillaire, speculated that Erskine may 
actually have been working on Tillotson's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all we know, Koll could have been raising that entire amount for Jim 
Silva until John asked that they split the money between us," St. Hillaire 
said. "We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll officials declined to release the memo, but said it contained advice on 
contributions to all three candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did not advise splitting $40,000 between these two candidates," said Lucy 
Dunn, a Koll senior vice president. "It was a political review and it talked 
about support for three candidates," whom Dunn identified as Tillotson, Silva 
and Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are considered the top contenders to replace retiring Orange County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder in the primary scheduled for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said, however, that Moulton-Patterson, who is a member of the California 
Coastal Commission, is prohibited by a 1983 state law from accepting more than 
$250 total from employees of any company affected by the commission's 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we can't raise money for Linda and candidates Tillotson and Silva 
were both asking for our support," Dunn said. "There is nothing sinister about 
this. It's much ado about nothing, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moulton-Patterson responded angrily to news of the memo Tuesday and said 
she believed it was aimed at derailing her candidacy. She has been a frequent 
critic of Koll for its political strategy to develop the Bolsa Chica area. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson contends that the city of Huntington Beach, not the county, 
should have remained the lead agency in decisions regarding the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disgusted by this but not surprised, because I expected all along that 
(Koll) would do anything they could to stop me from becoming the next 
supervisor and get a candidate in there who will fully support their project," 
Moulton-Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said that he has so far received about $4,000 from individuals 
associated with Koll but "I haven't seen any $20,000." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out there trying to raise money right now and frankly, I don't think 
any of the five candidates in this race would turn the money down," Silva 
said.REBECCA TROUNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; COUNTY TO TAKE OVER FIREFIGHTING DUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Fire Department will shut down in October as the result of a City 
Council vote just after midnight Tuesday to contract with the county for fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was proposed as a cost-saving measure. The council voted 4 to 1, 
with Councilman Don R. Griffin dissenting, to use county firefighters for both 
fire protection and paramedic services, beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 About 170 people attended the meeting, which lasted long into the night at the 
Senior Center. Of the 37 people who addressed the council, a majority opposed 
the merger and urged the council to retain the city Fire Department, which has 
been in operation since November, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents charged the move will decrease service, cost the city more money in 
the long run and result in the loss of local control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is it's not a good deal for Buena Park, for its citizens and 
businesses -- now or in the future," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters believe the city will save money while maintaining the current 
level of fire service. Charles Hintz, a fire captain and paramedic with 19 
years of service, said the council made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They voted on the facts. We're not going to lose service, we're going to 
maintain service," Hintz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the city Fire Department for 1993-94 is estimated at $5.3 million, 
Finance Director Greg Beaubien said. Based on preliminary figures, the 
department's budget for 1994-95 would have been $5.5 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will save $800,000 over the next four fiscal years by contracting 
with the county, City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said. After absorbing onetime 
costs, such as paying off accumulated firefighter sick leave and vacation time, 
the city also will recoup about $414,131, mostly from the sale of its equipment 
to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitions were submitted from those on both sides of the issue. More than 
1,000 signatures were collected by those opposing consolidation and more than 
2,200 people signed a petition gathered by city firefighters to support the 
county contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters have not had a pay raise in four years. In recent years, labor 
negotiations between the city and firefighters have been difficult, resulting 
in low morale.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for the guys to really take pride in their job and for 
the city to get more bang for its buck," Hintz said. "A lot of the same guys 
are going to stay here. We're just going to be wearing different patches." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 55 sworn firefighters will all be offered jobs with county 
providing they pass physical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed Monday to a $3.55-million contract with the county for fire 
protection from Oct. 1 to June 30, 1995, Beaubien said. Under the agreement, 
the city can terminate the contract with 12 months' notice at the beginning of 
any fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract requires that the county add a fourth firefighter to one truck 
company whose firefighters will be trained to rescue people caught in confined 
spaces or fast-moving water. However, one of the city's four engine companies 
will be eliminated under the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourkesaid the Board of Supervisors must give final approval of the 
contract, a move expected in the next few weeks. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PENSION SPIKING DEBATE HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public criticism of pension spiking by Huntington Beach city employees 
intensified this week during the public comments portion of a City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking allows a person to collect a higher pension by including such things 
as unused vacation days in computing a final year's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of a new organization, the Citizens Bureau of Investigation, 
repeatedly assailed the practice Monday night, saying employees who do it are 
"robbing" the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, a frequent critic of pension spiking, praised the 
group and invited its founder, Bill Mello, to attend meetings of a council 
subcommittee that is investigating ways to halt spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Earle Robitaille, a retired police chief, blasted the CBI 
speakers. "I think I've never heard so much b.s. coming out of one group in my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people in the audience booed at Robitaille as he made the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got the money, Earle!" yelled one man in the council audience. The taunt 
apparently referred to Robitaille's having benefited from a spiked pension when 
he retired from the Police Department. State auditors in 1992 said 16 
Huntington Beach retired officials, including Robitaille, received artificially 
inflated pensions caused by spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille has previously defended his pension. He has noted that previous 
City Councils voted for spiking provisions as part of city contracts with 
employee organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 One such city-employee contract that allows pension spiking came before the 
City Council in 1991, when Robitaille was a councilman. During Monday night's 
public comments, one speaker suggested that council members at the time did not 
realize what they were voting for when they unanimously approved contracts 
allowing pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robitaille, in rebuttal, said he knew exactly what he had voted for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, for one, was not deluded, hornswoggled or misinformed," Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell told the audience that the council majority is 
working to eliminate spiking, but that the problem is complex. "It is this 
council's desire to get this straightened out in the best fashion possible," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello and others in CBI have charged that 153 current city employees 
potentially can obtain spiked pensions when they retire. Mello has said such 
continued spiking could cost the city up to $10 million. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COLLEGE TO HONOR OUTSTANDING CITIZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who has been an advocate for minority-owned small businesses and who 
helped raise millions of dollars for Orange Coast College will be honored by 
the college this month as an outstanding citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC President David A. Grant and his Cabinet selected Patricia A. Krone to 
receive the award, which will be presented May 26 at graduation ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really played a major role over the past decades in this community and 
for Orange Coast College," said Jim Carnett, one of the 10 Cabinet members. The 
Cabinet is made up of Grant, academic deans and campus administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone, a Newport Beach resident, graduated from OCC in 1968 when she was a 
working mother. This month's graduation will be her first; she was too busy to 
attend the ceremony 26 years ago, she told Carnett. More than 2,000 students 
will be honored at this month's ceremony, Carnett said; 1,415 students will get 
associates of arts degrees, and 604 will get certificates of study. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone has been a board member of OCC's fund-raising foundation for eight years 
and worked as president of the organization for the past two years. Last year, 
the foundation set a school record by raising nearly $2.6 million in cash and 
gifts, Carnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone was the first woman to serve as chair, in 1989, of the Orange County 
Chamber of Commerce & Industry. She founded the Orange County Minority Business 
Council in 1988 and was recognized in 1989 as the national small-business 
minority advocate of the year by the federal Small Business Administration. She 
has received many other county awards for her work in behalf of race relations 
and community activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Krone was not available for comment Monday, but in a statement to the college 
she said she was overwhelmed and humbled by her selection as the Outstanding 
Citizen of the Year. WILLSON CUMMER

 Water officials in the South Coast Water District are breathing easier about 
their ability to handle an emergency after the completion of a 27-inch water 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Installed at a cost of $10.5 million, the six-mile-long pipe will give the 
district better access to water sold by the area's main importer, the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new water line will provide a back up to our existing water system," said 
Mike Dunbar, South Coast district manager, "enabling our district to better 
respond in the event of an emergency like an earthquake, fire or prolonged 
drought." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews worked on the water line for 18 months, laying pipe from 
Stonehill Drive in Dana Point to Avenida Pico in San Clemente. The project was 
finished last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the water-importation pipeline, we would not have been able to 
connect with Metropolitan Water District's major transmission line," Dunbar 
said. "This would have eventually resulted in a 9.7-million-gallon-per-day 
water shortfall for the district." 
</P>
<P>
 The project was built in partnership with the Tri-Cities Water District, which 
serves San Clemente and parts of Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 It was financed with $8 million in bonds and $2 million in connection fees 
from newly developed properties. A property owner with a $400,000 home paid 
$144 in the first year of the bond issue with the bill decreasing each 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we tried to raise the money by raising water rates, it would have resulted 
in a 40% to 50% increase in the cost of water," Dunbar said. "By approving the 
general obligation bond issue, our community provided the lowest financing and 
allowed themselves a tax write-off." FRANK MESSINA

REVIEW OF SANITATION OFFICIALS' ACTS URGED; REACTION: CALL IS PROMPTED AFTER 
LOCKS ARE CHANGED ON DOORS OF MANAGER AIDING DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH PROBE. 
</P>

 An Orange County Sanitation District director Tuesday called for a review 
after administrators ordered locks changed on the doors of a laboratory complex 
managed by an official who is aiding a district attorney's investigation of the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a member of the sanitation district's 
board of directors, said he was shocked by the agency's action and 
characterized it as "not in keeping with the normal business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whistle-blowers are protected under California law and should not be subject 
to harassment," said Stanton, calling for a review of agency personnel policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation district spokeswoman Corine Clawson has said the locks were changed 
on about 10 doors of the Fountain Valley laboratory complex as a security 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 That was done, she said, a day after an attorney for laboratory manager Dr. 
Louis Sangermano informed the district that he was helping prosecutors in a 
probe of certain sanitation agency activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sangermano, who is on medical leave from his duties and has been refused 
reinstatement pending an examination by sanitation agency doctors, said the 
district's administrators have been "operating way below board" in an attempt 
to force him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets worse and worse all the time," Sangermano said. "They are doing 
everything they can to prevent me from coming back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators were not available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the lock changes, the laboratory manager -- whose office 
provides analyses of local coastal waters and monitors industrial discharge 
among other duties -- said his private telephone message system has been 
recoded, shutting him out of any communication with his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so crazy there," Sangermano said. "I feel they are breaking the law, 
left, right and sideways." 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Lisa M. Howard of Santa Monica, said in a letter to the district 
Tuesday that "Changing door locks, forcing unwarranted medical leave, etc. . . 
. are pathetically desperate, despicable and terribly careless" actions. 
"Demand is now made that Dr. Sangermano is allowed to return to work 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sangermano nor his attorney have talked about their discussions with 
the district attorney, but officials have confirmed that investigators have 
received numerous documents about alleged improprieties involving agency 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also have said they are reviewing reports that sanitation 
officials may have improperly accepted gifts from contractors doing business 
with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, sanitation officials Tuesday canceled plans to issue a 
public response to a state report that cited the districts for serious safety 
code violations relating to a fire earlier this year which killed two workers 
at the Huntington Beach treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Clawson said the matter was referred to district lawyers Tuesday after 
sanitation officials received notice from the fire victims' families, 
indicating their intention to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the 
sanitation agency, the city of Huntington Beach and the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the families claimed that the fire resulted from the "negligent 
installation and maintenance and observation" of equipment that allowed 
flammable oxygen gas mixture to seep into an open trench where the victims were 
working. Both of the workers died from burns and were employees of Pascal and 
Ludwig Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering firm was also cited for safety code violations by the 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the victims' 
attorneys said they had no intention of naming the firm in its planned lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA's Bureau of Investigation is continuing a criminal investigation of 
the incident. GOVERNMENT OFFI

LAPSE COULD COST DISTRICT $5.8 MILLION; GOVERNMENT: FUNDS FOR NEW SANTA ANA 
SCHOOL WEREN'T SPENT BY STATE'S DEADLINE. BUT DISTRICT HOPES TO WIN AN 
EXTENSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District stands to lose $5.8 million of state 
funding for a desperately needed elementary school after missing a state 
deadline to spend the money, state officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board set aside the money last year to renovate the 
district's headquarters at 1405 French St. into an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the district failed to spend the money within 180 days as required by 
a state policy intended to ensure that scarce funds are used expeditiously, a 
state spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of funding, however, is not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Districts do get a chance to make their case to the State Allocation Board," 
said Jeanine Holmes, supervisor for the Office of Local Assistance, which works 
with the district on the board's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is now in jeopardy, but district officials are expected to defend 
their handling of it during next Wednesday's meeting of the Allocation Board, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials downplayed the risk of losing the funds, saying that once 
they explained the reasons for the delay, the board would probably grant an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe there will be any problem," said Mike Vail, senior director 
of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for the delay stemmed from an April meeting at which the Board 
of Education was forced to reject construction bids for the project. The two 
lowest bidders failed to submit a legally required affidavit stating they did 
not collude to fix prices. A third bid came in at $254,000 more than was 
budgeted for the renovation. The board rejected all three. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will review new bids on Tuesday, and is expected to approve 
one at that time. Vail said that action should show that the district is making 
a good-faith effort to push the project forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they (Allocation Board members) hold their meeting, we may have 
awarded the contract. They'll see we're fulfilling the spirit of the policy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District enrollment estimates show an overwhelming need for the new school. 
The number of elementary students is expected to jump by 4,000 by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the completion of Martin Luther King Jr. and Pio Pico Elementary 
schools, which are now under construction, as well as the proposed French 
Street campus, the district will need three additional schools to accommodate 
the influx, Vail said.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO CITY BLOCK MAY BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sale of an entire city block in the heart of downtown San Juan Capistrano 
for $1.1 million to a development partnership will be considered next Tuesday 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, across the street from Mission San Juan Capistrano, includes 
three decades-old buildings that make up El Peon Plaza.The buyer is San Juan 
Partners, which consists of Richard J. O'Neill, a local rancher and one of the 
county's wealthiest men, and Steve Nordeck, who owns the Swallows Inn.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill and Nordeck plan to renovate the buildings and bring in upscale retail 
shops to lure tourists who visit the mission, which is the county's 
third-most-visited attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the developers to spend about $687,000 to bring the 
buildings up to earthquake standards and to rehabilitate the entire complex 
within 12 months of the close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is selling the property for almost $200,000 less than what it paid 
for it in 1987. But officials say once renovated, the plaza should generate 
more property and sales tax revenue for city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Partners have told the city that they plan to attract a variety of 
upscale boutiques and bistros to the complex, which is part of the 
redevelopment agency's Historic Town Center project. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday decided it wanted more time to approve the draft 
agreement.

SOFTER VERSION OF BERGESON'S 1-STRIKE BILL WINS KEY VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key Senate committee on Tuesday softened but ultimately approved an Orange 
County lawmaker's one-strike bill that would set sentences for some first-time 
rapists and child molesters at 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the measure by Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) on an 8-0 vote, but not before narrowing the scope of the 
legislation so it now reaches only the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson began to carry the bill at the behest of Gov. Pete Wilson, who has 
made the rape measure one of the centerpieces of his election-year fight on 
crime. As originally drafted, the bill required a blanket sentence of life 
without the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 That tough stance drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups, 
including some district attorneys and women's organizations, who said the 
measure was so harsh it might actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to 
kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson redrafted the bill to delete all references to sentences of life 
without parole, substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for the most serious 
offenses and doubling current penalties -- now ranging from three to eight 
years -- for all others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judiciary Committee went even further Tuesday to tone down the measure, 
most directly by eliminating the doubled penalties for less-serious sex 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 As now drafted, a rapist or child molester could get the maximum sentence of 
25 years to life only if one of the following circumstances applied: The victim 
was kidnaped; she suffered great bodily injury; the rape was committed during a 
burglary; a deadly weapon was used; multiple victims were attacked; or the 
rapist had a previous felony conviction for a sex offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she was pleased that the measure had survived the committee and 
expressed hope that it will be signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee's changes didn't take away the force of the one-strike 
provisions," Bergeson said. "It's a bill I think we all can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Her measure still faces several tough votes in the months to come -- and will 
be competing with a bill authored by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), who 
chairs the Assembly Public Safety Committee. Epple's measure would apply a life 
sentence only when rape was committed during a kidnaping or residential 
burglary at the same time that a weapon was used or a victim suffered great 
bodily harm.

FAMILY; 'SIGN ME A STORY': A SMOOTH PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you say "rain" in American Sign Language? How do you say "I love you"? 
How can three adult theater pros make a show for kids so entertaining that an 
hour flies by before you know it? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers can be found in "Sign Me a Story," a thoroughly engaging mix of 
improvisation and story theater -- including a wacky version of "The True Story 
of the Three Little Pigs," Jon Scieszka's book from the wolf's point of view -- 
at Deaf West Children's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by veteran stage and television actress Linda Bove, a "Sesame Street" 
regular for 20 years, "Sign Me a Story" also gives children some sign language 
basics and satisfies understandable curiosity about life as a person unable to 
hear: How do you know when the phone and doorbell are ringing, what do you do 
for an alarm clock? 
</P>
<P>
 Sign language, a remarkably eloquent method of communication using the body 
and face, is a natural for the theater, but to be accessible to a hearing 
audience, timing is vital or a silence can be felt as unintentional hesitation. 
There are no hesitations here. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Freda Norman and performed with skill and ebullience by Bove, Ed 
Waterstreet (Bove's husband and the theater's artistic director) and Koli 
Cutler, a versatile speaking actor, the show's consistent rhythm and humor 
create an inclusive experience. Indeed, comfortable audience participation is 
key here. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent performance, hilarity reigned when the audience was asked to help 
guide both action and dialogue as Bove and Waterstreet acted out a first date. 
The couple ended up, rather eccentrically clad, going bowling, with a 
motorcycle as their mode of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Props and costume pieces (by Susan Doepner) come out of trunks on the small 
stage and the colorful, miniature hills and flowers by set designer Yael 
Pardess are a storybook touch, as are designer Ken Booth's soft, multicolor 
lights.

TV RATINGS; STEPHEN KING MINISERIES STANDS ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the ratings, the viewers who tried "The Stand" liked "The Stand." 
ABC's four-part adaptation of the Stephen King novel attracted almost exactly 
the same-sized audience each night--about 19 million homes, enough to take the 
top three spots on the A.C. Nielsen Co. list released Tuesday.(Part 1 was 
included in the previous week's ratings.) 
</P>
<P>
 That was the best performance by an ABC miniseries since "North & South, Book 
II" in May, 1986, the network said, and helped ABC register its second 
consecutive win in the weekly network competition. But "The Stand" ranked only 
43rd among all TV miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC scored another knockout on Sunday with "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," which 
placed sixth among the week's 80 prime-time network programs and beat NBC's 
"Tears & Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story" (No. 18) and CBS' "My 
Breast" (No. 31). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, America's infatuation with figure skating may be over, at least for 
the time being. Fox's "Fox on Ice Part II," featuring Olympic skaters, 
attracted only 9% of the audience Sunday and ranked 77th overall. Southland

BALTIMORE BOOSTER BULLISH ABOUT RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: PETER ANGELOS SAYS RAM 
OWNER GEORGIA FRONTIERE EXPRESSED A 'SOFT SPOT' FOR THE CITY IN MEETING LAST 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter G. Angelos, who met last week with Ram officials about possibly moving 
the team to Baltimore, said owner Georgia Frontiere "expressed a soft spot" for 
the city and that he is optimistic about the chances of procuring an NFL 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, managing partner of the Baltimore Orioles, flew to Los Angeles last 
Thursday. He met with John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, and had dinner 
at Frontiere's Bel-Air home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very gracious lady, and I thought the evening produced a very clear 
conclusion that all parties were very compatible," Angelos said Tuesday in his 
first public comment on the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting went very well," Angelos said. "Obviously, we intend to follow 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos said Frontiere, widow of former Baltimore Colts and Rams owner Carroll 
Rosenbloom, "feels in a sense that she is a Baltimorean, and she said Baltimore 
should have a team and is a great sports town." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was mostly social and did not include an exchange of offers, 
Angelos said. Frontiere has said she is considering selling a minority share in 
the team, possibly in conjunction with a move to a city offering a better 
arrangement than the current home at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has said he will lead an investment group to make an offer if the team 
moves to the state-funded stadium proposed for downtown Baltimore. Larry 
Lucchino, former Oriole president, and novelist Tom Clancy are also part of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos declined to discuss the content of his conversation with Ram 
officials, but acknowledged that potential objections by Washington Redskins 
owner Jack Kent Cooke came up. Cooke plans to build a stadium in Laurel, about 
15 miles from Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are concerned about litigation, but they feel as we do, that no 
one wants to litigate but one has to sometimes and the chances for success are 
excellent," Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams probably will meet with other interested suitors, he said. Groups in 
St. Louis, Hartford, Conn., San Antonio, Tex., and Memphis, Tenn., have 
expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to talk with the rest of the groups and wants to satisfy 
herself, which is the best arrangement for her and her company," he said. "I'm 
confident that Baltimore is the best applicant for an NFL franchise both from a 
financial and a fan standpoint."

PLAYER'S ELIGIBILITY COULD COST SCHOOL; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: CAL STATE SAN 
BERNARDINO SENDS RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION TO NCAA AFTER ATHLETE'S STATUS IS 
QUESTIONED.

 The Cal State San Bernardino women's basketball team, which finished second in 
the nation, might have used an ineligible player during the season, a Times 
investigation has shown. The use of an ineligible player could cause the school 
to be penalized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice Logan, 26, a sophomore center, played professionally in Spain in 1991, 
which would make her ineligible to compete in any NCAA sport. In addition, 
questions have been raised about her eligibility based on her possibly 
attending Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1986. If she did attend, she would have 
been required to sit out a year at San Bernardino or receive a degree from a 
junior college before being eligible at San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials at Central Arizona College, a junior college in Coolidge, 
Ariz., said Logan did not receive her two-year degree. This past season was 
Logan's first year attending San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at San Bernardino, responding to inquiries by The Times, called a 
news conference Tuesday to announce that the school has investigated the matter 
and sent a report to the NCAA. The school would not disclose the findings of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an announcement said not to be directly related, Athletic Director David 
Suenram said he was resigning effective March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan's professional experience in Spain was confirmed by Jose Antonio Parra, 
president of ADFB, a women's professional basketball team in Zaragoza, Spain. 
He said Logan received round-trip air fare and living expenses to try out with 
the team in September of 1991. Parra said that Logan played in "two or three 
practice games." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA amateurism rules prohibit athletes from competing for any form of 
compensation after enrolling in college. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NCAA were to find Logan ineligible, it could result in San Bernardino 
having to forfeit games. The team advanced to the NCAA Division II title game 
before losing to North Dakota State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is conceivable if a school is competing with an ineligible player, in a 
worst-case scenario, it would be forced to forfeit games," said Rick Perko, who 
interprets rules for the NCAA. "There are also other possible sanctions 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The other possible violation, dealing with the NCAA's 4-2-4 rule, is less 
clear. The rule says that a student who transfers from a four-year college to a 
two-year school must sit out a year or have a degree from the two-year school 
before being eligible to play at another four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show Logan enrolled at a four-year school -- Cal State Dominguez Hills 
-- in 1986. She then attended and played for Central Arizona College in 1988 
and left before earning a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino officials said Logan told them she never attended a class at 
Dominguez Hills. If Logan attended any class or any team function at Dominguez 
Hills, she would not have been eligible to play for San Bernardino last season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, records show Logan's eligibility form, dated Oct. 23, 1986, was 
filled out after classes began in September. Kay Don, the athletic director at 
Dominguez Hills since 1993, said athletes routinely fill out their own forms. 
The form also said that Logan received $322 in scholarship aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan would not comment about her situation, referring all questions to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of Logan's transcript obtained by The Times also confirms that Logan 
was enrolled at Dominguez Hills in September 1986. A transcript does not 
indicate attendance, only enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino officials said they received an anonymous call in mid-February 
telling them of possible violations. The athletic department said they 
investigated and found no violations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Suenram, that investigation did not include talking to Don or 
anyone from the Spanish basketball league about Logan playing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino initiated the second investigation after Don called the school 
on May 12 to let the school know that The Times was making inquiries into the 
matter. The subsequent investigation led to the school filing a report to the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Suenram said the investigation was not the impetus for announcing his 
resignation, but it did have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been considering this for some time," Suenram said. "My planning for 
retirement goes back before any of this. Nobody pressured me, but this led me 
to believe this is a good time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Suenram became San Bernardino's athletic director in 1989 and took the school 
from Division III to Division II, which he said was a high point for his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask me about the low point because I won't talk about that," Suenram 
said.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEY SHOULD HAVE FOUND BETTER WAY TO PASS THE BUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob (Buck) Rodgers managed the California Angels with two screws inside his 
left knee and more screws inside his right elbow. He was fired Tuesday by an 
organization with more than a few screws loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another crazy day here at Seraphic Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a guardian angel kept Rodgers from literally giving his life for the 
Angels. He rode Row 1, Seat 1 on the Charter From Hell, a bus that capsized on 
May 21, 1992, on the turnpike between New York and Baltimore. He came home on a 
slab. I met his plane at LAX only to find Rodgers motionless, speechless, 
sedated to the max. They loaded him into a van like cargo. He limped back to 
work three months later, using crutches, held together by wire, nuts and bolts, 
lucky not to be wearing a halo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rodgers gave at the office. Gave until it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Only to be told to clear out his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 How come? 
</P>
<P>
 None of your damn business, that's how come.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask. Apparently, you, Mr. Big A baseball fan, do not deserve to know. 
Apparently, you, Ms. Anaheim Stadium season-ticket holder, are not entitled to 
an explanation. Trust us. We have our reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 There. Satisfied? 
</P>
<P>
 We needed a change of direction.  
</P>
<P>
 There. Understand? Oh, and if this 0-for-Ever, Orange County sandlot team had 
still been in first place, as it was a few days ago, would the manager still 
have been given directions to the Interstate 5 ramp and told to take a hike? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes! Definitely. Mmmm, well, probably.  
</P>
<P>
 And you thought George Steinbrenner was nutty. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did Rodgers go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, veep and GM: "I'm sorry, but I don't want to read my name in the 
paper criticizing Buck Rodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Brown, prez and CEO: "If this is perceived by some as merely change 
for change's sake, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving us free to speculate. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Buck ticked somebody off. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Buck alienated the players. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Buck mismanaged. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Buck said the Angels should move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Buck was a bad dude. 
</P>
<P>
 No, as to that, Bavasi said, still speaking no evil, "We are talking here 
about a real good guy. Buck did not survive this long as a baseball manager 
without some skills. Quality human beings aren't that easy to come by, and he's 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 So, what then? Because he wasn't going to win the pennant? Because he wasn't 
equipped to beat out Joe Carter, Paul Molitor, John Olerud and Roberto Alomar 
by using Chad Curtis, Gary DiSarcina, Eduardo Perez and Damion Easley? Because 
he wasn't prepared to go to war in the World Series with Game 3 pitting Phil 
Leftwich against Tom Glavine and with Game 4 pitting John Farrell against John 
Smoltz? Because he wasn't working miracles or wasn't using Mark Langston and 
Chuck Finley on two days' rest or what?  
</P>
<P>
 Gentlemen? 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi: "My action has spoken loud enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "Because it's May and because this team has a chance to win the pennant 
and because we don't want to wait to make our move." 
</P>
<P>
 The move being Marcel Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of luck, Latch. 
</P>
<P>
 As an expert pitching coach, the first thing Lachemann will recognize is that 
the Angels lack expert pitching. This staff is still Langston, Finley & Pray 
for Quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, welcome to another round of can-the-manager. There are office pools -- 
fairly sick ones -- and fantasy leagues wherein one of the prizes goes to 
whoever can pick the first manager to be fired. Usually you can count on 
Cleveland or the Cubs. Or now that Disgorge 'Em George is back running the 
Yankees, you might expect him to dump his manager during a 10-game winning 
streak. Believe me, Buck Rodgers hardly seemed the most likely to bite the 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked and talked a good game. He survived the bus crash and came back 
strong. He kept the club in the 1993 race until midsummer, without Bryan 
Harvey, without Jim Abbott, without Kelly Gruber, with a lineup carried by a 
rookie right fielder. All around baseball, ex-Angels excelled, from Dave 
Winfield to Devon White to Dante Bichette to Mark McLemore, while the manager 
of the Angels played the hands he was dealt. 
</P>
<P>
 It wore on him. Buck can be blunt. He doesn't pull his punches. That was Buck 
on the mound Monday night, chewing out Leftwich, begging him to throw the damn 
ball across the damn plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad when he walked back, the manager never glanced at the dugout wall. The 
writing was there. It wasn't his pitcher who was on the way out, it was him. 
Somewhere upstairs, Bavasi was dialing directory assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miami listing, please. For a Mr. Lachemann? No, not that Mr. Lachemann. The 
other Mr. Lachemann." 
</P>
<P>
 How long had Bavasi been thinking about this? 
</P>
<P>
 "For a considered amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time? 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your concept of a long time?" Bavasi asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Since spring training? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not that long." 
</P>
<P>
 Since when, then? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not prepared to say." 
</P>
<P>
 All he would confirm is that the Angels had a new manager. Somebody else gets 
front row on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Angels win the pennant now? In this century? I am not prepared to 
say. It could mean reading something negative in the paper.

ANGELS WILL MANAGE WITHOUT RODGERS; BASEBALL: BAVASI FIRES HIM, HIRES MARLIN 
PITCHING COACH MARCEL LACHEMANN TO GUIDE STRUGGLING CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, who seem to manage to do something each season that leaves the 
baseball world dumbfounded, came up with a beaut Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They fired Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 And hired Marcel Lachemann, the pitching coach of the Florida Marlins, to be 
their manager beginning Thursday against the Kansas City Royals. Meanwhile, 
first-base coach Bobby Knoop will fill in, then will become the bench coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Really. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, the original Angel who was instrumental in turning around the image 
of the organization, who refused to bash his bosses for trading away Jim Abbott 
and allowing Bryan Harvey to leave in the expansion draft, who nearly was 
killed for the Angels during their 1992 bus crash, was whisked away for one 
major reason. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Really. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, according to a highly placed source in the organization, was fired as 
much as anything because he was outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 He was much too candid in his opinions that appeared in print, irritating his 
players, and too opinionated in the private meetings, enraging his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel officials, according to sources, were infuriated when Rodgers was quoted 
after Sunday's 9-5 defeat by the Seattle Mariners as saying, "You have to 
realize John Dopson has been released. Mark Leiter has been released. Joe 
Magrane has been released. And we're trying to find spots for them on our club 
. . . . You've got to look at what we've got to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one club official: "Come on, you just can't say those things. It wasn't 
like that was the first time. It just kept happening." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was the underlying belief in the organization that the club had one 
too many general managers. While Bavasi was hired Jan. 12, 1994, as general 
manager to replace Whitey Herzog, several front-office officials said Rodgers 
also behaved as if he was general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 President Richard Brown and Bavasi informed Rodgers several times of personnel 
decisions that they wanted made, but too often Rodgers steadfastly refused. 
This was his team, and he was running it like he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship had all but dissolved Monday during a private personnel 
meeting with Rodgers, the coaching staff and the front office. Rodgers accused 
the front office of being more concerned about budget restraints than winning, 
saying they were trying to save $200,000 by bringing up Russ Springer instead 
of veteran John Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
 There also had been the disagreement on the handling of triple-A first baseman 
J.T. Snow. Although the Angel front office was ready to bring up Snow if 
Eduardo Perez was placed on the disabled list, Rodgers wanted utility player 
Mark Dalesandro. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was no coincidence that on the day Rodgers was fired, the Angel lineup 
was overhauled. Rookie Jim Edmonds was playing left field instead of Dwight 
Smith or Bo Jackson; third baseman Damion Easley was dropped from leadoff to 
seventh in the lineup; and Chad Curtis was moved up from sixth to second. And 
while Farrell indeed will be brought up to replace Mark Leiter in the rotation, 
they also decided Springer will be up later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi refused to confirm the reasoning for the firing, and wouldn't even 
offer specifics, but he did say the Angels' 16-23 record had no bearing on his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have done it if we were in first place," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the change because as an organization we feel we need to take a 
different direction. I don't want to get into why we made the move, because 
saying anything would be negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be critical of the guy. I've probably done enough damage 
already. 
</P>
<P>
 "My actions speak loud enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 55, who had the team only two games out of first place in the 
American League West, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, informed by Bavasi of the decision in a private meeting at about noon 
Tuesday, spent the rest of the day with a close friend who recently had a heart 
attack. He will have his own news conference at 2 p.m. today, and perhaps then 
he will divulge his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea something like this would happen," said Judi Rodgers, his 
wife. "I don't even know what happened. He just called me and said, 'Well, I 
got the ax.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, who said he had been contemplating the decision for about a week, 
phoned Marlin General Manager Dave Dombrowski in about the seventh inning of 
their game against the New York Mets, and asked permission to hire Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make a decision and offer the job to Marcel," Bavasi told 
Dombrowski. "The job's his if he wants it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dombrowski, who fired Rodgers on June 3, 1991, from the Montreal Expos, 
informed Lachemann after the game. Marlin Manager Rene Lachemann, his brother, 
hitting coach Doug Rader and Marcel stayed up until 4:30 in the morning 
discussing whether he should take the job. Rader was fired by the Angels when 
Rodgers took over on Aug. 26, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I even had my mind made up when I woke up," Marcel Lachemann 
said, "because I'm not sure I even fell asleep. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "My emotions have kind of run the gamut. There is sadness about leaving the 
Marlins and my brother, and all the good things happening there, to the elation 
of coming back to California and joining Billy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann and the Angels have not reached agreement on a contract, but Bavasi 
said it will last at least through the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time (managing) was a big goal, then it went to a period where it was 
not," Lachemann said. "This is probably the only place I'd think of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My next goal is to manage against my brother, and the only way for that to 
happen is in late October. That's our next dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who spent the previous nine years as the Angel pitching coach 
before heading to the Marlins, joins his brother as the first brother tandem to 
manage simultaneously in the big leagues since 1879, when George Wright managed 
Providence and brother Harry managed Boston. Overall, they are the fourth set 
of brothers to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dammit, I can't believe it," said Whitey Herzog, former Angel general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the hell can you fire a manager who didn't have his No. 1 pitcher (Mark 
Langston), didn't have his No. 3 pitcher (Joe Magrane), and his No. 2 and No. 4 
pitchers (Chuck Finley and Phil Leftwich) are pitching horse. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That ain't too damn fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, Marcel will do a good job, and he's a very good baseball man, but I 
managed against Buck, and that's a pretty damn good manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, firing Buck Rodgers is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still will be responsible for the remainder of Rodgers' contract, 
which will expire after the 1995 season. He will be paid $600,000 this year and 
next.

WORLD CUP '94: 30 DAYS AND COUNTING; LASTING GOODBY; PELE'S FETE MAGICAL; HIS 
EXIT IN '77 GAME RECALLED AS TOUCHING MOMENT IN SOCCER HISTORY 
</P>

<P>
 The gates of Giants Stadium opened Oct. 1, 1977, flooding the Meadowlands with 
75,646 well-wishers and worshipers. Later, the gates of heaven would break, 
soaking the field with raindrops. 
</P>
<P>
 "God was crying," Julio Mazzei, a witness, contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Outpourings marking the occasion of Pele's last soccer game were emotional and 
spontaneous, dispensed from above and below. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner Roth, then-captain of the New York Cosmos, lifted a triumphant Pele 
after the 36-year-old star had scored the last goal of his career in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like we were losing someone," Roth says today. "I felt it. Players 
retire all the time. Players come and go. But Pele was a special player. It was 
almost a little bit like a funeral. We were celebrating something ultimately we 
would miss." 
</P>
<P>
 After 22 years of Brazilian brilliance, Pele would no longer share his gift 
after that final command performance. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Celeste, who had wished Pele would become a physician and wore out 
several rosaries praying for her son's safe deliverance from soccer, sat 
nervously in the stands to witness him play in person -- for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 To her, Pele was always her vulnerable baby, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, not 
the prodigy who would earn his legendary nickname in the streets of Bauru. 
</P>
<P>
 That Oct. 1 was heavy with clouds and symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele believed he owed the game's first half to New York, the soccer surrogate 
that had lured him out of retirement for what he considered the final sojourn 
of his missionary work. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele donned the Cosmos' shirt partly for Americans who had embraced an import, 
if not his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, he played the first 45 minutes for his father, Goao, better 
known as Dondinho, who toiled for years in the Brazilian soccer leagues, taking 
his family from town to town, never remotely approaching his son's success. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring his 1,281st and last goal on a free kick, Pele offered Dondinho 
the shirt off his back. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Pele emerged in the jersey of Santos, the Brazilian club 
for which he had played since 1956. At game's end, the shirt was presented to 
Valdemar de Brito, Pele's youth coach from Bauru. It was Valdemar who 
hand-delivered the wonder boy to Santos, after a six-hour bus trip. Santos then 
passed Pele on to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele, stripped to the waist after his final stand, his skin glistening in the 
rain, was paraded around the field on the shoulders of teammates as choruses of 
"Auld Lang Syne" were sung. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely umbrella-less crowd, rich and rogues alike, stood unaffected by 
the downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzei, a Cosmos assistant coach and Pele's longtime friend, was among those 
singing. Mazzei had followed Pele to the States from Brazil and now works in 
Pele's New York offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends for 32 years, Mazzei is known to Pele as "the Professor." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how it feels to graduate a son from college?" Mazzei asked, trying 
to find a comparable feeling to that day. "And then he goes on to the world? 
You know what I mean? I felt that way. It was like seeing the coronation of a 
brilliant, fantastic, genius career. It was very emotional. He cried a lot. It 
was really, for me, in my soccer career as a coach, assistant coach, manager, 
administrator, the biggest thing that happened to me in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As naturally as emotions flowed at Giants Stadium, the blueprint for Pele's 
last waltz had been mapped out years before by Clive Toye, then the Cosmos' 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Toye and Phil Woosnam, head of the North American Soccer League, had been in 
hot pursuit of Pele since 1971, first approaching the world's greatest player 
in Kingston, Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele had already retired from the Brazilian national team, which he had helped 
to three World Cup championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele tentatively had planned to retire from Santos in 1974, but the Cosmos 
wanted to sign the star in the hope he might breathe life into the young and 
struggling NASL. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzei, who served as interpreter at the Kingston meeting, remembers sitting 
by a hotel swimming pool as he relayed to Pele the Americans' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell them they are so crazy," Pele told Mazzei. "I'm never going to play in 
America. Tell them to say hello for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pele could not justify to his Brazilian fans how he could retire from the 
national team, then turn around and defect to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Toye pressed on and Pele slowly came around. Toye eventually sold the star 
on the vital role he might play as a soccer missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele agonized over the decision, soliciting the opinions of hometown taxi 
drivers and waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not worried about the president of Brazil," Mazzei says. "He was 
worried about the Brazilian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Toye made another run at Pele in the spring of 1974, traveling to Santos, to 
attend a club game. 
</P>
<P>
 After the match, Modesto Roma, Santos team president, told Toye he thought 
Pele was about to cave in. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was in it for Roma? 
</P>
<P>
 Pele wanted to make only a two-year commitment to New York, but Toye insisted 
on a three-year deal so Pele could play his last season in Giants Stadium, 
scheduled to open in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Toye dangled an irresistible carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it was a dusty, hot day in Santos," said Toye, now president of 
the World Cup's New York Host Committee. "I was leaning against a car. And 
that's where it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Toye promised that if Pele would play in America for three years, his last 
game would be played against Santos. After playing one half for the Cosmos, 
Pele would switch uniforms at intermission and play the last 45 minutes of his 
career for Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give him back to you," Toye explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma's eyes lit up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a contract on it," Toye said. "Just a handshake. But 3 1/2 years 
later, that's exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1975, Pele signed a three-year, $4.5-million contract with 
the Cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 During his last game in Brazil, though, Pele bade an emotional farewell to 
Santos, which he had helped to two world club championships. 
</P>
<P>
 His final club game was played Oct. 1, 1974, exactly three years before his 
Meadowlands farewell. It was, in some ways, more dramatic than his North 
American farewell because Pele had refused to reveal the time or date of his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept everyone guessing," Mazzei remembered. "Then, 20 minutes before that 
game is finished, Pele stopped action in the middle of the field. Then he 
grabbed the ball, knelt on the kickoff spot and opened his arms like a cross. 
Then, he faced the VIP area, then then the south stands, then the east stands, 
then the north stands, and then the game is stopped. That's the way he finished 
in Santos." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a Brazilian soccer paper ran a full-page picture of a deflated 
soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was sad," Mazzei said. "It don't want to jump no more." 
</P>
<P>
 On to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Werner Roth, a Cosmos' defenseman from 1972 through '79, was on the receiving 
end of the first and last goals Pele scored for the Cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pele scored in his debut against the Dallas Tornado in 1975, he jumped 
into Roth's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth had the whole soccer world in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us were in awe, being on the same field," recalled Roth from his 
home on Long Island. "I caught myself just watching him on a number of 
occasions. We overplayed to him the first couple of games. We gave him the ball 
all the time. He'd come off the field and say, 'Fellas, there are 11 guys on 
the field, let's use them all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As much as by his talent, Roth was impressed by Pele's humility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd seen college players who joined the Cosmos who had bigger ego problems," 
Roth said. "He doesn't come across as a legend." 
</P>
<P>
 By Pele's last game, professional soccer in America had seemingly come of age 
after years of struggle. Pele might have thought his missionary work was done. 
So popular were the Cosmos, in fact, that they often outdrew the New York 
Yankees and Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer was never more popular, more viable, in America then it was when Pele 
played his last game. You might have expected the sport to blossom in Pele's 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't. It had always been more popular in New York than elsewhere in 
the country, and greedy, short-sighted ownership and expansion eventually took 
down the NASL, which folded in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many of the new owners that were attracted by the glamour of Giants 
Stadium and Pele," Toye reflected. "They did not understand the hard labor that 
went into making it a success. It's not just one day you sign Pele and the next 
day there's success. We worked many years developing the market and then signed 
Pele at the appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said the shame is that soccer failed to take advantage of one of its 
crowning moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele's last game was televised to 40 countries and attracted 760 journalists 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the greatest opportunities to establish pro soccer as a major 
sport in this country," Roth said. "You look back at the number of mistakes 
that were made. It could have been different, if we hadn't been so cocky at 
that point. We assumed, after 1977, that the game was here, that we didn't have 
to try as hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Pele's little shoes were impossible to fill." 
</P>
<P>
 All that's left now are memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth remembers running with teammates alongside Pele after the game, and not 
wanting to leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us were crying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toye, the man who had brought Pele to the States, watched the culmination of 
his dream from a private box on the mezzanine level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone's quite transcended any sport worldwide the way Pele has 
transcended soccer," he said. "It was a great first day when he first stepped 
on the field with the Cosmos shirt on and a great last day when it all came to 
an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, in the locker room, Mazzei sat next to Pele and wondered if the day 
could have been more perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Pele nearly scored for Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The shot) hit the back of one of his Santos teammates," Mazzei remembered 
clearly, as though Pele had put foot to ball only yesterday. "It was over the 
goal line and ricocheted out. In the locker room, I say to him, 'Pele, why that 
goal not go in? It would be great that you scored a goal for the Cosmos and one 
for Santos in the second half. It would be perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pele looked Mazzei in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professor," Pele said, "it would be asking too much of God."

UNSER SR. RETIRES FROM RACING; INDY 500: THE EVENT'S LAST FOUR-TIME WINNER, 54, 
STEPS ASIDE AFTER HIS SON WINS THE POLE FOR THIS YEAR'S FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Unser, the last of the Indianapolis 500's four-time winners, retired 
Tuesday only two days after his son, Al Jr., had won the pole for this year's 
500. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Unser was here in hopes of qualifying for his 28th 500 when he 
abruptly decided he had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said many times that when the day came that I wasn't producing in the right 
way, and I wasn't happy, that I'd get out," said Unser, who will turn 55 on 
race day, May 29. "I think the time has come." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, who won the 500 in 1970, '71, '78 and '87, had been practicing in a 
Lola-Ford Cosworth entered by Arizona Motor-Sport Racing. His fastest lap had 
been a disappointing 219.250 m.p.h. and he waved off his only qualifying 
attempt last Saturday after getting up to only 214.225. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day when I was out there on pit lane, watching my boy qualify and 
sit on the pole, I finally realized that it just wasn't there for me and I 
wasn't producing like I should. It takes 100%, and I didn't have that much 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 His retirement follows by almost a year that of four-time winner A.J. Foyt, 
who quit on the morning of qualifications. Indy's only other four-time winner, 
Rick Mears, retired in December of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Moreno will replace Unser in the Arizona Motor-Sports car. In 1985, it 
was a pass of Moreno by Unser for fourth place in the year's final race in 
Miami that enabled him to beat his son by a point for the PPG Cup Indy car 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 That was his third Indy car championship. He also had won in 1970, when he 
finished first in 10 races, and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of my dad's decision," said Al Jr. "I know it was very hard 
for him. I feel it takes a bigger man to know when to quit, than it takes to 
stay out there when his heart isn't 110% in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about it and the Indianapolis 500 means a lot to my father. That's 
why it was so tough. We both know that he is still a winner, and that he still 
could be a winner at this racetrack." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's most memorable race was the 1987 Indy 500. He came here without a 
ride, then, when Danny Ongais was injured, took the seat in one of Roger 
Penske's cars. He started 20th and barely missed a spinning Josele Garza on the 
first lap. Moving up steadily, he got the lead for the first time on lap 183 
when Roberto Guerrero stalled in the pits. Once in front, he held off Guerrero 
for his fourth 500 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In 27 Indy 500s, Unser had three seconds and four thirds, giving him 11 
top-three finishes and the highest finishing percentage of any long-term 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 His last third place was in 1992, when he gave Buick its only 500 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, Unser's longtime rival, previously announced that this will be 
his final season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al and I did a lot of things together over the years, so I'm glad we're 
closing things out together," Andretti said. "I wish he had a full-time ride so 
he could close it out that way, but I'm really happy for him that now he can go 
out and smell the roses, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, Al Unser is one of the top five racers who has ever lived. Nobody 
had race savvy like Al Unser in his prime."

PATRIOTS GIVE USC'S MCGINEST 4-YEAR DEAL WORTH $6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's Willie McGinest, the fourth player taken in the NFL draft, signed a 
four-year, $6-million contract with the New England Patriots on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract includes a $3.3-million signing bonus and salaries of $500,000, 
$625,000, $750,000 and $875,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kraft, who became the Patriots' owner Jan. 21, said he had no intention of 
waiting for other teams to establish a salary scale by signing their picks 
first. Dan Wilkinson, the top choice in the draft, is the only other 
first-rounder who has signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just decided we're going to run our own business and not be dependent on 
other people and the standards that they set," Kraft said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McGinest: "I just wanted what was fair. I wasn't going to try to drag 
this thing out. I have money now so the only thing left is playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing came just five days after Andre Tippett, seventh in NFL history 
with 100 sacks, ended his 12-year career, opening up an outside linebacker spot 
for McGinest, who played that position at USC before switching to defensive end 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got really excited" about that opportunity when he heard Tippett retired, 
said McGinest, who had 28 sacks in college, "but I was a little disappointed 
because I did want to play with him for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Combining his $500,000 salary with this year's $825,000 prorated portion of 
the bonus, McGinest will make about 41% of the $3.2 million salary pool the 
league allotted for the Patriots to spend on their 10 draft picks.

RAIDERS SIGN MOSEBAR, RELEASE STEVE SMITH; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM RETAINS VETERAN 
CENTER, LOSES ONE FULLBACK AND OBTAINS ANOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The door at Raider headquarters was swinging both ways Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Back was center Don Mosebar. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone was fullback Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Back was fullback Derrick Gainer . . . . for the fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
 The club signed Mosebar to a multiyear contract, terms not disclosed, released 
Smith and obtained Gainer from the Dallas Cowboys in a trade for past 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The retention of Mosebar, an unrestricted free agent, was crucial. Only the 
third regular starting center in the team's history, following stalwarts Jim 
Otto and Dave Dalby, the 32-year-old Mosebar, an 11-year veteran, has been the 
anchor of the Raider line since becoming a starter in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 He had talked with the Cincinnati Bengals but apparently didn't find the big 
offer there he had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mosey's a guy who's been around here a long time," Coach Art Shell said. 
"It's important to have him here. He showed he wanted to be here and we're glad 
to have him around." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's release raised a few eyebrows. If there is one word that describes the 
seven-year veteran, it is dependable . Throughout all the uncertainty that 
hovered over the Raider backfield in recent years, between the quarterback and 
tailback positions, Smith was always there, blocking, rushing and even catching 
a few passes when needed. He had played in 96 consecutive games for the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But his fate is becoming a familiar story in this age of the salary cap. 
Smith, who will turn 30 this summer, was heading into the second year of a 
three-year, $3.6-million contract that would have paid him $1.05 million this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting him and picking up Gainer, who was recently signed by the Cowboys 
to a one-year deal, the Raiders save about $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going in a different direction," said Shell of Smith. "We released him 
at this time in order to give him the opportunity to catch on somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Raiders would not be specific about the nature of the past 
considerations in the Gainer deal, sources in Dallas said it was thought to be 
basically a favor done by the Cowboys. The Raiders wanted Gainer, the Cowboys 
didn't. So, Dallas signed him and sent him to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's nothing new for Gainer, who has needed a travel agent as much as a 
negotiating agent since joining the Raiders as an eighth-round draft choice 
from Florida A & M in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of his time on developmental squads and on the sidelines with 
the Raiders during his previous four tours of duty. He had two carries with the 
Raiders, both in 1992, and 30 with the Cleveland Browns in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainer spent the last two years as a Cowboy reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with his weight up to 242 pounds and the fullback spot suddenly vacant, 
Gainer has a shot at a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always had the ability to run, but he's bigger now," Shell said. "But he 
did not lose any speed. He's a good blocker and a good receiver. He's a jack of 
all trades." 
</P>
<P>
 Gainer's biggest competition figures to come from Napoleon McCallum, who will 
be tried primarily at fullback now after alternating between there and tailback 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainer still must show he can hold the job. But the precedent is there. A year 
ago, the Raiders found themselves handing the starting tailback job to another 
eighth-round draft choice. Greg Robinson responded by leading the club in 
rushing, gaining 591 yards, before going down in the Raiders' 12th game with a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it's Gainer who has the chance. But he didn't know it until Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Gainer didn't realize Smith was gone until a reporter told him at the team's 
El Segundo training headquarters where Gainer is already on the job. "Really?" 
Gainer said. "If they're looking for me to be the guy, I'll be the guy. It's 
good to come back home. I just hope I can stay."

KNICKS SEARCH FOR INTENSITY IN PIVOTAL GAME AGAINST BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Pat Riley says the Knicks turned the ball over 21 times in Game 3 
because they were "careless." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Anthony says: "The problem is we haven't played with any effort, energy 
or intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks says he's surprised the series isn't already over. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this make the Bulls, tied at 2-2 in this NBA Eastern Conference 
semifinal series going into tonight's Game 5 at Madison Square Garden? 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago has outscored New York in 13 of the 16 quarters, has led going into 
every fourth quarter -- by an average of 11 points -- and has had third-quarter 
leads of 15, eight, 22 and 19 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are still favored but must go one more game without the suspended 
Derek Harper. Starting in his place Sunday, Anthony missed 11 of 13 shots and 
turned the ball over four times. Anthony, Starks and Hubert Davis combined for 
13 turnovers and 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, this series has followed last year's pattern: The Knicks, who had the 
better regular-season record and had won the season series, opened with two 
victories at home. The Bulls won two at home. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Chicago won Game 5 in New York after four layup attempts by 
Charles Smith were blocked on the last Knick possession.

CAL STATE SAN BERNARDINO PLAYER MIGHT HAVE BEEN INELIGIBLE; BASKETBALL: PLAYER 
ON WOMEN'S TEAM, WHICH FINISHED SECOND IN NATION, PREVIOUSLY PLAYED 
PROFESSIONALLY IN SPAIN. COLLEGE SENDS RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION TO NCAA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL and ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State San Bernardino women's basketball team, which finished second in 
the nation, might have used an ineligible player during the season, a Times 
investigation has shown. The use of an ineligible player could cause the school 
to be penalized by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice Logan, 26, a sophomore center, played professionally in Spain in 1991, 
which would make her ineligible to compete in any NCAA sport. In addition, 
questions have been raised about her eligibility based on her possibly 
attending Cal State Dominguez Hills in 1986. If she did attend, she would have 
been required to sit out a year at San Bernardino or receive a degree from a 
junior college before being eligible at San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials at Central Arizona College, a junior college in Coolidge, 
Ariz., said Logan did not receive her two-year degree. This past season was 
Logan's first year attending San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at San Bernardino, responding to inquiries by The Times, called a 
news conference Tuesday to announce that the school has investigated the matter 
and sent a report to the NCAA. The school would not disclose the findings of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an announcement said not to be directly related, Athletic Director David 
Suenram said he was resigning effective March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan's professional experience in Spain was confirmed by Jose Antonio Parra, 
president of ADFB, a women's professional basketball team in Zaragoza, Spain. 
He said Logan received round-trip air fare and living expenses to try out with 
the team in September of 1991. Parra said that Logan played in "two or three 
practice games." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA amateurism rules prohibit athletes from competing for any form of 
compensation after enrolling in college. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NCAA were to find Logan ineligible, it could result in San Bernardino 
having to forfeit games. The team advanced to the NCAA Division II title game 
before losing to North Dakota State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is conceivable if a school is competing with an ineligible player, in a 
worst-case scenario, it would be forced to forfeit games," said Rick Perko, who 
interprets rules for the NCAA. "There are also other possible sanctions 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The other possible violation, dealing with the NCAA's 4-2-4 rule, is less 
clear. The rule says that a student who transfers from a four-year college to a 
two-year school must sit out a year or have a degree from the two-year school 
before being eligible to play at another four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show Logan enrolled at a four-year school -- Cal State Dominguez Hills 
-- in 1986. She then attended and played for Central Arizona College in 1988 
and left before earning a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino officials said Logan told them she never attended a class at 
Dominguez Hills. If Logan attended any class or any team function at Dominguez 
Hills, she would not have been eligible to play for San Bernardino last season. 
</P>
<P>
 However, records show Logan's eligibility form, dated Oct. 23, 1986, was 
filled out after classes began in September. Kay Don, the athletic director at 
Dominguez Hills since 1993, said athletes routinely fill out their own forms. 
The form also said that Logan received $322 in scholarship aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan would not comment about her situation, referring all questions to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of Logan's transcript obtained by The Times also confirms that Logan 
was enrolled at Dominguez Hills in September 1986. A transcript does not 
indicate attendance, only enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino officials said they received an anonymous call in mid-February 
telling them of possible violations. The athletic department said they 
investigated and found no violations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Suenram, that investigation did not include talking to Don or 
anyone from the Spanish basketball league about Logan playing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino initiated the second investigation after Don called the school 
on May 12 to let the school know that The Times was making inquiries into the 
matter. The subsequent investigation led to the school filing a report to the 
NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Suenram said the investigation was not the impetus for announcing his 
resignation, but it did have an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been considering this for some time," Suenram said. "My planning for 
retirement goes back before any of this. Nobody pressured me, but this led me 
to believe this is a good time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Suenram became San Bernardino's athletic director in 1989 and took the school 
from Division III to Division II, which he said was a high point for his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask me about the low point because I won't talk about that," Suenram 
said.

BID TO SAVE TWO MEN'S PROGRAMS AT UCLA TURNED DOWN BY COURT 
</P>

<P>
 Superior Judge Alan Haber in Santa Monica denied an application for a 
preliminary injunction against UCLA that would have forced the school to 
reinstate its men's swimming and men's gymnastics programs. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA said last August that it would drop men's swimming and men's and women's 
gymnastics after the 1993-94 academic year, but reinstated women's gymnastics 
two weeks later when threatened with a gender-equity lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the men's swimming and men's gymnastics teams were awarded a 
temporary restraining order on April 18 preventing the school from cutting the 
programs, but Tuesday's decision allows UCLA to proceed with their elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan W. Halperin, the attorney representing the male swimmers and gymnasts, 
said he has not determined whether he will appeal the decision.

TIMING PROBLEM FORCES SOUTHERN SECTION TO SCHEDULE RUNOFFS; TRACK: FIFTEEN 
ATHLETES WILL RE-RUN THEIR EVENT THURSDAY IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR SATURDAY'S 
FINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southern Section officials determined Tuesday that 15 athletes whose times 
were affected by the mechanical failure of the automatic timing system at the 
Division I track and field preliminaries Saturday must participate in runoffs 
for qualifying berths for this Saturday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoffs will be at 3 p.m. Thursday at Cerritos Gahr High. Competitors have to 
participate in order to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of notifying schools and coaches of the runoffs today," 
said Dean Crowley, acting Southern Section commissioner. "I don't see a lot of 
coaches holding back their kids (from competing in the runoffs). It's just 
unfortunate that this occurred, but we're doing the right thing for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials began reviewing times Monday night after The Times discovered the 
Accutrack automatic timing system at Saturday's preliminaries malfunctioned 
before the start of the girls' 100-meter hurdles. The meet's remaining events 
were timed by starting the Accutrack manually but allowing the machine to 
record automatic times. 
</P>
<P>
 National Federation of State High School Assn. rules state that when an 
automatic timing system fails, races are to be hand-timed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight runners were eliminated improperly Saturday because the procedure was 
not followed. If it had been, ties would have resulted, and runoffs would have 
been held that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoffs are necessary because in hand-timed races, any time above a 10th of a 
second (10.11 or 10.19) is rounded up to its nearest 10th (10.2). Because races 
were being timed by the malfunctioning Accutrack, runners advanced to the 
finals or were eliminated based on times recorded to the 100th of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey Hubert, Dana Hills coach, said, "You've got to be kind of lucky 
sometimes" and plans to have hurdler Roberta Burns ready for Thursday's runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to go on with it and adhere to whatever the people (Southern 
Section) want to do," Hubert said. "What else can I do? I mildly feel sorry for 
the girl in ninth (Capistrano Valley's Laurel Simpson, who had seemingly 
clinched the last berth in the finals), but I would be remiss not to want our 
girl to make the final." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is the two-time defending South Coast League 100 hurdles champion. Her 
"unofficial" time of 15.31 Saturday edged Burns (15.32). But under the rules, 
they should have tied at 15.4, with a runoff that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's coach at Capistrano Valley, Tom White, knew there was a problem 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just figured the Accutrack was calibrated wrong," he said, adding that the 
runoffs are "ludicrous, but probably the best solution to an unfortunate 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said no disciplinary action is planned against those involved with the 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob McGuire (Division I meet manager) was not at fault," Crowley said. "He 
knew the machine had broken down but was led to believe it was working when he 
read the double-digit results. 
</P>
<P>
 "McGuire should have been told the machine wasn't working and a decision made 
right then." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's runoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' 100-meter hurdles (one advances): Simpson (Capistrano Valley) and Burns 
(Dana Hills), tied at 15.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 400 (one advances): Desmond Ketton (Fontana) and Jeremy Womack (Ocean 
View), 50.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' 100 (two advance): Jaime Taylor (Etiwanda), Virginia Williams (Compton 
Dominguez) and Miesha McKelvy (Cerritos Gahr), 12.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 100 (two advance): Troy Searcy (Quartz Hill), Jamal Carr (Pasadena 
Muir), Anthony Rudolph (West Covina) and Tyson Murphy (Santa Monica), 10.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 110 high hurdles (one advances): Ignacio Barrios (El Monte Mountain 
View) and Levar Castillo (Lynwood), 14.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys' 200 (two advance): Michael Granville (Bell Gardens), Murphy (Santa 
Monica) and Akinyela Taylor (Dominguez), 21.6.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; FIRING MERELY A CONTINUATION OF 34 YEARS OF CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This goes back to the beginning, to the first "Welcome Angels" banquet during 
their first spring training in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to Gene Autry, the proud owner, rising unsteadily to deliver the 
first keynote address and launching into a rambling speech about how the Angels 
had wanted to hire Casey Stengel but felt very fortunate to have landed Phil 
Wrigley. 
</P>
<P>
 If Autry didn't know Bill Rigney from the then owner of the Chicago Cubs, not 
much has changed in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion rather than continuity has been the hallmark of an organization 
still looking for its first American League pennant while continuing to look 
like the Clippers of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Angels fired Buck Rodgers and hired Marcel Lachemann as their 
14th manager. If Autry didn't know Rigney from Wrigley, is anyone sure he knows 
Marcel Lachemann from his brother, Rene? 
</P>
<P>
 Gene and Jackie Autry didn't return phone calls Tuesday. What's new? The buck 
never seems to stop with the owner, and that's strange. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinematic Autry used to ride to the rescue, but with wife, Jackie, as a 
budget-minded accomplice over the last 13 of the 34 years, he has consistently 
abdicated that responsibility in the B-movie script enacted by the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The shocking and surprising firing of Rodgers -- "the baseball world will have 
trouble understanding it," Rigney said from his Northern California home -- was 
merely the latest shift in leadership and/or philosophy by this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rigney, who survived nine years as the first manager and is now senior 
adviser to the Oakland Athletics: 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was there you couldn't see the leadership or direction. There's 
always been confusion. They've always seemed to be groping for direction, the 
missing piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, a few years ago she (Jackie Autry) told me that she was going to get 
rid of all those $3-million players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's fine, but you better have an idea how you're going to attack the 
next four or five years if you dump the Polonias and Harveys and Joyners. But 
I'm just not sure they've ever had an idea, and I was there at the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, Autry's ninth general manager, shouldered responsibility for the 
decision to fire the popular and respected Rodgers but wouldn't say why he did 
it, insisting he didn't want to deal in negatives, that there was enough of 
that in the decision itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, club president Richard Brown said, was presented to the Autrys 
on Monday night "but their style of management is to rely on their president 
and general manager." 
</P>
<P>
 "They listened," Brown said, "asked some pointed questions, then deferred to 
our judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Some will portray it as a power struggle, with Rodgers wanting to make moves 
the front office rejected, but it was basically a matter of honesty not always 
being the best policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers consistently told it like it is, and Brown and Bavasi got tired of 
hearing it and reading it, as did some of his pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, recent comments about dealing with a staff heavy in released 
pitchers is known to have irritated a front office that must think the fans are 
unaware of what they are paying to see. 
</P>
<P>
 With Lachemann, of course, many of the pitchers know what they are getting and 
are happy about it. He served as the Angels' highly respected pitching coach 
for nine years before spending the last two as pitching coach of the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what he sees from the Angels' staff will remind him of the expansion 
club he is leaving. How Rodgers was expected to win consistently with it is a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi insisted that the won-loss record was not a primary factor in his 
decision, although he still believes the Angels are capable of winning 
baseball's worst division. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he consider how the firing would fuel the perception of a rudderless and 
directionless organization? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he said, "but I can't let that guide our strategy. I can't worry about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is not to take the safe route, but to put the best management team 
together that we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Historians might say that will only happen when Autry and his wife, 
management's bottom line, ride off into the sunset. The firing of Rodgers, who 
seemed to be the perfect fit for a developing team, suggests it's time.

ONE SPORT JUST ISN'T ENOUGH FOR WEINSTEIN; ATHLETICS: CORONA DEL MAR STANDOUT 
LIKES THE TEAM ELEMENT OF SOCCER AND THE INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS OF TENNIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Had he listened to his father, Corona del Mar's Jed Weinstein probably would 
have given up one of his two hobbies, tennis or soccer, long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always telling me that I've got a lot of potential," Weinstein said. 
"That if I put my mind on one sport, I could really be good at one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinstein never could quite decide which sport suited him best, so he 
played tennis and soccer throughout high school, and excelled at both. He 
lettered three times in each sport and made All-Sea View League twice in soccer 
and twice in tennis. Last year, Weinstein was a Times first-team all-county 
selection in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Division I college soccer and tennis coaches started offering 
scholarships, Weinstein's phone wasn't exactly ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 But that made it easy for Weinstein. Simply find a school that will let him 
vacillate for four more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Weinstein found such a school -- Emory University in Atlanta. While 
majoring in business, he will play soccer and tennis for teams that are 
perennially ranked in the top 20 among Division III schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have probably gone to Cal and walked on and played tennis," Weinstein 
said, "but that takes a lot of time and commitment. I'm pretty serious about my 
sports, but I'm not thinking about going pro or anything. They're very serious 
up there and I just don't want to put in that much time." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein also could have walked on or received partial scholarships to 
Oregon, UC Santa Barbara, Washington and UC Davis. Instead, he chose Emory and 
Atlanta, the land of Kudzu, peaches and oppressive humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I visited there for four days and I loved it," he said. "It's the different 
atmosphere that interests me. I'll probably wind up living in Southern 
California later, so I wanted to experience something else for a while. The 
campus is beautiful and the people were really friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Newport Beach and Orange County, we tend to judge people on what kind of 
car they drive and how much money they make. People there didn't seem to care 
about any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But before Weinstein can start experiencing some of that Southern hospitality, 
he would like to finish his high school tennis career in style. Corona del Mar 
(17-2), the Sea View League champion, opens the Southern Section Division I 
playoffs today against Lakewood. The match was rained out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Weinstein and his doubles partner, Tyler Stonebreaker, will begin 
their quest for the section doubles championship by playing in the 
preliminaries at Edison High. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein does not have fond memories of either tournament. In a Corona del 
Mar semifinal match against Palos Verdes Peninsula, Weinstein double-faulted 
three consecutive times on set point. Weinstein and his doubles partner, Beat 
Baudenbacher, went on to lose the set and the Sea Kings went on to lose the 
match, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals of the individual tournament, Weinstein and Baudenbacher 
were beaten badly by Santa Barbara's Nathan Jackmon and Jason Merrin, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The two losses left a bad taste in Weinstein's mouth and had him wondering if 
he should continue to play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were bad memories," Weinstein said. "I was thinking about concentrating 
on one sport and excelling in one. I thought maybe it was time for me to pick 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim Mang, Corona del Mar's tennis coach, thought differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a long talk and I told him that he could be the guy this year," Mang 
said. "I told him if you set the pace, we could have a really good year." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said he's glad Mang was there for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Mang went to tournaments with me all summer and kept me positive," he 
said. "I really appreciate what he did for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein has shown Mang his appreciation by having the best year of his 
career. He is undefeated in 33 singles sets and has lost only twice in 15 
doubles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's come into his own," Mang said. "He's got quick feet and quick hands, 
maybe the quickest in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Mang, like Weinstein's father, believes Weinstein could have excelled at one 
sport had he concentrated on it. "I think Jed could have gone much farther in 
tennis than soccer," Mang said. "I think Jed knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinstein also knows he would have missed out on too much had he opted for 
one over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have chosen tennis, I would have missed the team stuff and bonding 
in soccer," he said. "If I had played only soccer, I would have missed doing 
things for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 So now at Emory, Weinstein won't miss out on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jed can be a hero there," Mang said.

LAW AND ORDER ON THE DELTA; SPECIAL DFG UNIT HELPS PATROL SLOUGHS LOOKING FOR 
POACHERS AND OTHER VIOLATORS, BUT SOMETIMES COMPASSION NECESSARY 
</P>

<P>
 As the dog is the natural enemy of the cat, the snake of man, so were we of 
the fish patrol the natural enemies of the fishermen.  
</P>
<P>
 -- JACK LONDON, "Tales of the Fish Patrol" 
</P>
<P>
 From the looks on the faces of the four men, confronted on a recent night by 
Department of Fish and Game wardens and caught red-handed with dozens of 
undersized striped bass, it seems little has changed since Jack London's days 
as a commissioned warden around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen still break the law, knowingly or otherwise, and those who get 
caught are usually quick to show their scorn for the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many regulations on everything," one of the men said as he was 
being cited by Lt. Joe Gonzalez. "You should have the rules written on the 
(fishing) licenses. I can go out into the ocean and catch anything I want. 
There are no regulations out there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who has seen and heard it all, continued writing while warden Robert 
Prosser gathered the fish, some only four inches long, as evidence. Only one of 
the men, all of Philippine ancestry, spoke English, and he was the one cited. 
He will have his day in court, and probably be fined a few hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the truck, continuing down the dark and desolate road, Gonzalez said: 
"The man's an engineer for the state. He builds bridges and he doesn't know 
that a striper should be 18 inches (the legal limit)?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,100 miles of waterways winding through this region are jet-black at 
night, and the streets along the levees provide miles of access. It is easy to 
see why this maze of sloughs known as the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an 
agricultural mecca by day, is a poacher's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 With knowledge of the tides and seasonal runs of salmon and striped bass, 
fishermen can carry a small boat down to the water's edge, spread a net or set 
a line across the slough and in a few hours haul in a load of fish, then slip 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Such operations have been going on in the Delta since London's days, when 
"knives flashed at the beginning of trouble and men permitted themselves to be 
made prisoners only after a revolver was thrust in their faces." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with all Delta fisheries in serious decline for several reasons, a 
serious effort is being made to deter poachers from showing such blatant 
disregard for the law. The DFG is trying to use its regular wardens in 
conjunction with the relatively new Delta-Bay Enhanced Enforcement Project, or 
D-Beep, which was organized in 1992 and recently expanded to 10 wardens and a 
lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 10 wardens doesn't sound like much, but then D-Beep is not an 
ordinary DFG unit: It has money with which to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 D-Beep is funded by the Department of Water Resources as part of a mitigation 
effort to offset fishery losses caused by water diversions that destroy eggs, 
larvae and young fish in the system. Steelhead runs, once prolific, are all but 
a thing of the past. Salmon runs are endangered or threatened. Spawning adult 
striped bass in the Delta, which in the 1960s numbered 3 million, have declined 
to a few hundred thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of London's sailing the bay chasing down Chinese junks and angry 
fishermen are a thing of the past in one respect: 
</P>
<P>
 D-Beep wardens have at their disposal shiny new boats capable of 50 m.p.h., 
with state-of-the-art electronics and engines that run silently at the touch of 
a button. They have telescopes with cameras to spot and document poachers from 
almost a mile away, and laser-enhanced night-vision equipment that enables them 
to see in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Prosser, somewhat colorfully: "Our deputy lieutenant, he's just happier 
than a pig in boop that somebody's got the money to buy these things to make 
our job easier." 
</P>
<P>
 It will never be an easy job. The Delta is too big, and it's like no other 
angling destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen from all walks of life come here every day. In the spring and summer 
when the daytime heat is unbearable, they come at night when the mosquitoes are 
equally unbearable, parking on the levees and clearing a path to the water's 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, there is no such thing as catch and release, nor is there any sport. 
There is only the matter of catching some fish to feed the family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On that same recent cold and windy night, Prosser and Gonzalez stopped to 
check out an old station wagon parked on the levee 15 feet above the slough. 
Inside were a husband and wife with two young children. One end of a string of 
heavy monofilament was tied to the car's antenna, which was bent almost to the 
breaking point toward the water. The other end was about 35 feet out in the 
slough, attached to a rock. Three lighter lines with baited hooks were 
suspended from the heavier line and the hooks were in the water.  
</P>
<P>
 The line would be checked from time to time, any fish removed and the hooks 
baited and put back in place. It's a method common among Southeast Asian 
fishermen and is legal, Prosser said, provided three or fewer hooks are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosser and Gonzalez climbed back into the truck and continued down the road. 
They stopped again and noted more anglers using the same method. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther down the road, the four previously mentioned fishermen were huddled at 
the foot of an embankment, using rods and reels, when Gonzalez and Prosser came 
up from behind. At first, the English-speaking man denied catching the fish 
stuffed in a small white bag nearby, some of them still flapping. He eventually 
acknowledged blame for the whole group. "It's my fault for bringing them," he 
said, pointing to the others, who seemed confused by the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving on, the wardens noticed a man setting up a plastic tarpaulin under 
some trees for shelter. He had his young son with him. They were camping for 
the night, hoping to catch their dinner. "Hard times," the man said, as Prosser 
and Gonzalez started to move on. They did not check for licenses. "Even we have 
a heart," Prosser said. 
</P>
<P>
 When told by this reporter that he had never experienced anything to match 
this scene, Gonzalez said matter-of-factly: "This is just different out here. 
This is the Delta." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since its creation in 1992, the D-Beep unit has made more than 4,000 arrests, 
with a conviction rate of nearly 100%. Most of the violations were for fishing 
without a license or for possessing too many fish or fish under the legal size. 
</P>
<P>
 But D-Beep, while steadily increasing the compliance rate among everyday 
fishermen, seems also to have begun uncovering dozens of large-scale poaching 
operations in which fish by the hundreds were being netted or caught on 
set-lines and sold on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people here are new immigrants and they're not sophisticated, and other 
groups have a whole plan worked out where they may actually be fencing this 
stuff, and they're just as complicated as any drug lord," D-Beep warden Mark 
Lucero said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most innovative poachers to date, Lucero said, were dubbed the "50th 
Avenue Sturgeon Gang" because all its members lived on 50th Avenue in 
Sacramento. After six months' surveillance with night scopes, D-Beep finally 
nabbed two of them in November 1993 on the lower Sacramento River off Sherman 
Island, near its confluence with the San Joaquin River.  
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, the suspects were spotted working with longlines on the water. 
They then moved upriver without using their lights for about two miles, and 
began loading the night's catch into a van. 
</P>
<P>
 The team moved in and arrested So Van Nguyen and Tung Van Nguyen. Others 
believed to be involved could not be connected to the crime. Included in the 
catch was a 180-pound sturgeon as a well as smaller sturgeon and hundreds of 
striped bass. The van was modified with an electric winch and boxes with false 
bottoms to store the fish and gear. The longlines measured a total of 2,250 
feet. The Nguyens pleaded guilty on March 1 and were fined $2,735 each. So Van 
Nguyen was sentenced to 30 days in jail, Tung Van Nguyen to 10 days in jail. 
Both had their fishing privileges revoked for three years, and their boat and 
equipment were confiscated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key thing is, our funding source basically allows us to do our job 24 
hours a day," Gonzalez said. "If we come upon a net case or set-line or 
longline, we have the capability to just go ahead and be on stakeout as long as 
it takes, where we might not have been able to before. With some of the 
restrictions and budgetary problems the state's going through right now . . . 
that is affecting the regular wardens' jobs. They don't have that luxury to 
stay out there past eight hours." 
</P>
<P>
 An even more recent case involving two gill-netters resulted in large fines 
and jail sentences. And one repeat offender, who had spent six months in jail, 
was believed to have fled the country after being caught a third time. Several 
boats have been seized and thousands of dollars worth of gear have been 
confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 D-Beep members and the DFG admit they will never be able to put a stop to the 
poaching of fish in the Delta -- Lucero says they probably catch only 3% of the 
violators -- nor are they naive enough to believe that the fisheries will ever 
be the same as in Jack London's day. 
</P>
<P>
 But London would be proud nonetheless, having written of his dealings with 
poachers: 
</P>
<P>
 "We menaced their lives . . . We confiscated illegal traps and nets, the 
materials of which had cost them considerable sums and the makings of which 
required weeks of labor. And when we captured them, they were brought into the 
courts of law, where heavy cash fines were collected from them. As a result, 
they hated us vindictively."

15 EX-TITAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS SUING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen former Cal State Fullerton football players filed suit Tuesday in 
Orange County Superior Court, alleging that they did not receive financial aid 
to which they were entitled after the program was suspended following the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's attorney, Ron Talmo, said the suit seeks $3,500 for nine former 
players and $8,000 for six others along with general damages.The extent of 
damages is based on remaining NCAA eligibility, Talmo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the athletic department requested the athletes to work 
10 hours per week for money the suit says they were owed. Talmo also said the 
athletes were coerced to sign agreements of acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inconceivable to me that Cal State Fullerton didn't know they were going 
to cancel the season before signing players to their 1992 contracts," Talmo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talmo said he expects the case to go to court within nine to 11 months and 
that he will request a jury trial. "Based on the way things have gone so far, I 
feel certain it won't be settled out of court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the plaintiffs, Matt Pearson, said he and another former football 
player, Joe Elizondo, met with university President Milton A. Gordon this week 
in an attempt to settle out of court. LON EUBANKS

JETS MAKE PITCH TO SIGN RAMS' TERRELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Jets made a contract offer Tuesday to free-agent safety Pat 
Terrell of the Rams and hope to sign him today. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell will be in New York today to undergo a physical and meet with 
coaches.The Rams showed interest in re-signing Terrell, an unrestricted free 
agent, early in the signing period but have since backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seriously negotiating with the Jets right now," said Leigh Steinberg, 
Terrell's agent. "We're looking at a two-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell's departure would leave the Rams without a returning strong safety 
from last season's 5-11 team. Michael Stewart, who started 14 games at strong 
safety, has signed with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams expect Deral Boykin and rookies Toby Wright and Keith Lyle to compete 
for the starting position. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrell, drafted in the second round by the Rams in 1990, finished with 29 
tackles (24 solo) and two interceptions in 13 games last season as Stewart's 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets would use Terrell to back up starting strong safety Brian Washington 
and free safety Ronnie Lott, with a thought of replacing Lott once he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams plan to work out Ed King, a free-agent offensive lineman from 
Cleveland, this week. The team also named Pete Russell as area scout, replacing 
Jeff Beathard, who took a similar position with the San Diego Chargers. MIKE 
REILLEY

TITANS ARE WINNERS IN THE BIG WEST; BASEBALL: CONFERENCE COMMITTEE GIVES 
FULLERTON A SHARE OF TITLE, AND ANNOUNCES POSTSEASON TOURNAMENT THAT SCHOOL 
WILL PLAY HOST TO IN '96. 
</P>

<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton baseball team received two boosts from the Big West 
Conference executive committee, which is meeting this week in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Titans were awarded a share of the conference championship when 
Fullerton's make-up game with Pacific was canceled by the committee.  
</P>
<P>
 And second, the committee announced the conference will switch to a postseason 
tournament to decide the automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs starting in 1995. 
Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State will be co-hosts of the first two 
tournaments, which will be played at Blair Field in 1995 and at Fullerton in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is now a Big West tri-champion with Nevada and Long Beach State. 
Nevada and Long Beach State finish the regular season 16-5; the Titans are 
15-5. Based on head-to-head competition, Nevada gets the automatic NCAA 
tournament bid for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton and Long Beach State are hoping for at-large bids when the playoff 
field is announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton won at Pacific twice this season, but the third game was rained out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the game was reset last week, it appeared that it might have a bearing 
on the automatic playoff berth," said Rob Halvaks, assistant conference 
commissioner. "But when Nevada swept last weekend that issue was no longer a 
factor. At that point, the conference had to look at it from a cost-containment 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Rain this week in Stockton made field conditions questionable as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido was pleased by the news.  
</P>
<P>
 "In view of all the things the committee had to consider, I think it was the 
right thing to do," Garrido said about Fullerton was awarded a share of the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido also was pleased with the conference's decision to go to a postseason 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Long Beach State Coach) Dave Snow and I have moved to the beat of the drum 
on a postseason tournament," Garrido said. "We need things like that to promote 
our product and I think a postseason tournament will generate a lot of 
interest."

PELE'S PRESENCE LIKELY; WORLD CUP ROLE NEAR CERTAIN AS RIFT COOLS WITH FIFA 
CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A World Cup celebration without Pele? 
</P>
<P>
 Say it ain't so, Joao. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility once seemed real because of a personal grudge between Pele and 
Joao Havelange, president of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently the rift has cooled enough so that soccer's greatest name will 
be allowed to lend his legend to the World Cup effort in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange would not allow Pele to participate in last December's World Cup 
draw at Las Vegas because Pele is embroiled in a lawsuit with Havelange's 
son-in-law, who is president of the Brazilian soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute involves Pele's attempt to get television rights to the World Cup 
in Brazil, the country he helped lead to three World Cup titles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Julio Mazzei, Pele's manager, Havelange and the soccer star made 
up at the CONCACAF convention at Trinidad and Tobago in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele was there as a guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he walked to the stage, Dr. Havelange stood up," Mazzei said, explaining 
the situation as told to him by Pele. "He was there. He opened his hands and 
arms and walked toward Pele. I said to Pele, 'What happened?' He said. 
'Professor, I could not avoid him. In front of everybody, we embraced. And we 
threw roses at each other. Havelange said for the good of soccer, we should be 
the same friends we were before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzei said the dispute between Pele and Havelange's son-in-law has not been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truce comes as a relief to World Cup USA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be a World Cup without Pele on the scene," Jim Trecker, senior 
vice president and press officer for the World Cup USA, said from New York.

RODGERS ENDS ANOTHER CHAPTER IN ANGEL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers, a member of the original 1961 Los Angeles Angels and a longtime 
friend of team owner Gene Autry, seemed a natural when the club hired him as 
manager Aug. 26, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a native son, living in Orange County since the Angels moved to Anaheim 
in 1966, coming home again. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, the union seemed as if it might stand the test of time, 
bringing stability to a franchise that sorely needed it. History, friendship 
and commitment appeared to be on Rodgers' side. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his name is just another on a growing list of former Angel managers, his 
tenure about average among the 16 other men who held the job. 
</P>
<P>
 He inherited a young team with glaring weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he could make much of an impact, he was seriously injured in the 
crash of the Angels' team bus on the New Jersey Turnpike on May 21, 1992. The 
most seriously injured of the passengers, Rodgers suffered a broken kneecap and 
his elbow had to be reconstructed with metal plates, wires and screws. He 
missed all but 73 games that season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was his only full season as Angel manager and the team went 71-91, 
finishing fifth in the AL West. There were promising signs that things would be 
better this year, however. Young players like Tim Salmon, AL rookie of the year 
last year, Chad Curtis, Gary DiSarcina and Damion Easley established themselves 
as solid big league players. 
</P>
<P>
 They, in turn, expressed thanks to Rodgers for giving them the opportunity to 
play every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who put his professional reputation on the line by putting me in 
the lineup every day," DiSarcina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Easley: "I thank him immensely. He put me in the lineup and let me learn 
on my own. He treated me outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Third base coach Ken Macha watched and learned from Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he tried to stay on the positive side most of the time," Macha said. 
"Also, he'd bring in a young player and explain the things they were doing 
incorrectly, but he did it in a private manner." 
</P>
<P>
 When Rodgers came to the Angels as a young player, he was known as Bob, a 
catcher who had attended Ohio Wesleyan and Ohio Northern. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Rigney, the first Angel manager, quickly hung the nickname Buck on 
Rodgers. It stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers played nine seasons for the Angels, but he never topped 1962 when he 
batted .258 with six home runs and 61 runs batted in in 155 games. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed in the minors before becoming a big league manager for the first 
time, with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1980. Later, he managed the Montreal Expos 
and was named National League manager of the year in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 When things turned sour in 1991, the Expos fired him, and the Angels quickly 
came calling. A Growing List

LACHEMANN WILL HANDLE THE ENTIRE TEAM THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So just who is Marcel Lachemann? 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, he was the Florida Marlins' pitching coach, known around the 
major leagues as a diligent, knowledgeable, compassionate handler of pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was the Angels' pitching coach for 10 seasons from 1983-92, overseeing 
the standout 1986 staff that helped the club come within one out of reaching 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said Tuesday he wasn't looking to become a manager, but he jumped at 
the opportunity to return to the Angels. This will be his first full-time 
managing job. 
</P>
<P>
 "A situation like this was one in a million," said Lachemann, 52, who was the 
Angels' interim manager for four games in 1992. "If I was going to manage, this 
was it." 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves behind his brother, Rene, manager of the Marlins; they become the 
first brothers to manage at the same time in the major leagues since the 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lachemann arrives at Anaheim Stadium on Thursday for his first day on the 
job, he will be faced with the task of jump-starting the faltering Angel staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take time," he said. "There are no quick fixes in this 
business. Sometimes you try things and they don't work, so you do something 
else. It takes patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Kirk McCaskill of the Chicago White Sox, an Angel from 1982-91, 
believes his old club found the right man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's going to be a very good manager," said McCaskill, a 17-game 
winner for the 1986 team. "He's one of the most consistent, organized people I 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys who have played for him all respect him. He is always up front. He's 
been honest with every pitcher he's ever had and I think everybody respects him 
for that. He's into every pitch. He's very compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) managing is very difficult no matter where you are, no matter who you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley knows Lachemann only as a pitching coach but said 
it isn't difficult to imagine how he might fare in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably will be a good manager," Finley said. "From my personal 
standpoint, he has a lot of self-determination in seeing that a job is done 
right. He demands 100%. If you can't give him 100% physically or whatever, then 
you give him all you can. I don't think he's going to let players dog it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also gives people the flexibility to do their thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the organization for a long time. I knew he was down in Florida 
with his brother. I thought he was going to be content to do that for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Said designated hitter Chili Davis: "I didn't get to know 'Lach' that well. He 
wasn't involved with the position players. He was always with his guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Come Thursday that will change.

TIMING PROBLEMS FORCE SEARCY INTO 100 RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Searcy of Quartz Hill High is one of 15 athletes required to take part in 
runoffs Thursday at Gahr High in Cerritos to determine the final qualifying 
berths in six events for the Southern Section track and field championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoffs became necessary when section officials discovered Monday that the 
Accutrack timing device malfunctioned early in last Saturday's Division I 
preliminaries, resulting in incorrect times and erroneous seedings for the 
championships at Long Beach Veterans Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing system's percussion device failed before the start of the girls' 
100-meter high hurdles -- the fifth event of the meet -- and remained 
inoperable for the duration of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering the malfunction, Accutrack operator Joe Raya started the 
machine by hand at the start of each race but allowed it to record automatic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya said he informed the starter of the malfunction, but apparently other 
meet officials were unaware of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the times, which should have been rounded up to the nearest 
tenth of a second, were recorded as fully automatic times in hundredths. 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy thought he had advanced to the Division I final with a time of 10.62 
seconds in the 100 meters, when, in fact, he was one of four sprinters who 
should have been credited with a 10.7 clocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy, Jamal Carr of Muir, Anthony Rudolph of West Covina and Tyson Murphy of 
Santa Monica will compete in the runoff. The top two finishers will advance to 
the Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Other runoffs will be staged in the boys' 200, 400 and 110-meter high hurdles 
and in the girls' 100 and 100 high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the timing malfunction, the wind-aided marks of Redlands' Pat 
Johnson in the 100 (10.19) and 200 (20.61), and Hart's Jason Medearis in the 
110 high hurdles (13.64) have been converted to hand times of 10.2, 20.7 and 
13.7.

JUST CALL HIM ANGEL OF THE MORNING; CITY SECTION GOLF: DEFENDING CHAMPION TEES 
OFF IN FIRST GROUP AT KNOLLWOOD, WHERE HE HOLDS THE COURSE RECORD OF 63. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No sense messing around. Send out the big kid first to set the tone for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Darren Angel might not only blaze a trail, he might burn the place 
to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 When the City Section high school golf championships begin today at Knollwood 
Country Club, Angel, the individual favorite, will tee off in the first group. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, who plays for defending team champion Granada Hills, also is the 
defending individual champion. Knollwood is the Highlanders' home course and 
Angel practically owns the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Angel broke the Knollwood course record with a nine-under-par 63. 
Two weeks earlier, he tied the record with a 64. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in several years, due in no small part to Angel's presence 
in the field, the tournament is generating fan interest. Knollwood officials 
anticipate a notable gallery, which prompted some fancy footwork on their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of liability concerns, it was uncertain whether spectators would be 
allowed to walk the course. Los Angeles County, which owns the course, decided 
to permit fans to follow the action. Spectators will be charged $1 and must 
sign a liability release beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a long tournament for everyone in the individual race if Angel's 
short game is in order. Known for his length off the tee, Angel has experienced 
difficulties of another sort lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wedge has been all right," Angel said. "The driver's the problem. I can't 
keep it in the fairway. Even Knollwood's fairways." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't shed too many tears. Angel hasn't been over par at Knollwood in a match 
or practice round this season, a span covering an estimated 30-40 rounds. In 
Bakersfield on Tuesday, he won a U.S. Open preliminary qualifying tournament 
with a one-under 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Golditch and Art Weiner of Taft and Josh Jacobs of Grant rank among the 
favorites in the individual race. Golditch, who will play next season at 
California, won two national tournaments over the winter and boldly predicted 
he would upset Angel in the finals. Golditch and Jacobs will play in the first 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Play, which concludes at Knollwood on Thursday, begins at noon each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills edged Taft in the final match of the season to win the City 5-A 
League title. Taft and Grant are Granada Hills' primary threats in the team 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two teams advance to the 18-hole CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. 
championship on June 6 at Redlands Country Club. The CIF-SCGA tournament 
includes teams from the City, Southern, San Diego and Central sections.

O.C. DANCE; BALLET PACIFICA WILL MAKE A LEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ballet Pacifica will take two big steps next season, dancing at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa for the first time and moving its 
annual holiday performances of the "Nutcracker" from the 400-seat Laguna 
Playhouse to the 750-seat Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The program at the center, Feb. 26 at 7:30 p.m., will be a collaboration with 
the Pacific Chorale. Ballet Pacifica will dance premieres set to Gian Carlo 
Menotti's "The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore" and Libby Larsen's "The 
Settling Years" (choreographers to be announced) and will reprise Brahms' 
"Liebeslieder Waltzes" as choreographed by James Jones. Chorale music director 
John Alexander will conduct 30 of his singers, the Winds of the Pacific 
Symphony and pianists Lori Loftus and Jan Sanborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be feasible for us to do the center program alone," Ballet 
Pacifica artistic director Molly Lynch said this week. "But this is feasible 
because we'll be splitting (promotional and rental) costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking off and on for years about collaborating with other 
groups," she noted. "This will really open the doors to us doing new work and 
expanding the repertory and fulfilling one of my goals, which is to do more 
concerts with live music." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Nutcracker" will be danced at the Irvine Barclay Dec. 16 through 24 at 
2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Lynch said the shift from Laguna Beach was "to accommodate 
the audiences we've developed in the 'Nutcracker' with fewer performances." 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe's season will open Oct. 14 and 15 at the Irvine Barclay with the 
premiere of a yet-untitled work by choreographer Tina Gerstler, visual artist 
Megan Williams and composer Brad Dutz. Fokine's "Les Sylphides" (Chopin) and 
Lynch's "Different Trains" (Steve Reich) will complete the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The season will conclude at the Irvine Barclay May 19 and 20 with Lynch's new 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Mendelssohn), her familiar "Les Femmes" (Poulenc) 
and Israel Gabriel's "Eternal Spring" (Kitaro). Both programs will begin at 8 
p.m. Fridays and at 2:30 and 8 p.m. on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs in the Children's Series will be offered Sept. 24 and 25, Feb. 4 and 
5, March 18 and 19 and April 29 and 30 at the Festival of Arts Forum Theatre in 
Laguna Beach (curtain times: 11:30 a.m and 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. daily). 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch estimated her 1994-95 budget to be about $450,000, about $130,000 more 
than this season's. The increase doesn't spring from the move to larger venues 
as much as from "our losses in (last fall's Laguna Beach) fire. Everything has 
to be built new." The company lost its warehouse and everything in it, all its 
sets and costumes. The total loss was more than $1 million, only about $380,000 
of which was covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 By choreographing "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Lynch inevitably will be 
stirring up comparisons with the great Frederick Ashton, whose version was 
danced earlier this month at OCPAC by the Royal Ballet of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be compared to the Royal Ballet," she said. "That's not the 
idea. I have a long list of Shakespeare plays I would like us to do. My 
interest is to try to do some smaller story ballets that can reach new 
audiences," especially "high school students who are reading plays like 'A 
Midsummer Night's Dream.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Originally called the Laguna Beach Civic Ballet, Ballet Pacifica was created 
in 1962 by Lila Zali, who had danced with the forerunner of what is now the 
American Ballet Theatre and with other important companies. Lynch took over in 
1988 upon Zali's retirement and began expanding the repertory by commissioning 
new work from younger American choreographers, especially through a series of 
annual summer workshops. Some of the works created in the 1994 workshop may be 
added to the 1994-95 concert schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Season tickets for the concert series will be $50, $40 for students and 
seniors. Tickets to individual programs at the Irvine Barclay will be $18, $15 
for students and seniors; tickets to the program at OCPAC will be $15 to $40. 
Tickets for the "Nutcracker" will be $16 for adults and $13 for children. 
Tickets to programs in the Children's Series will be $10 for adults and $7 for 
children and seniors. Individual tickets go on sale Sept. 1. BALLET PACIFICA

PAT MCLAUGHLIN: CAUSE FOR . . . PAUSE; POP MUSIC: THE SINGER/SONGWRITER, WHO

 ". . . . . . . . . . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the sound of Pat McLaughlin pausing before he answers a question about 
one of the songs on his "Unglued" album. There were a few such pauses during a 
phone interview with the singer/songwriter last week, along with some evasions, 
some good laughs and, eventually, a bit of insight into how his songs are 
written -- which, all things considered, I probably would rather have done 
without. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, there's a song on the album called "Friendly Bird" that I love. Some 
of it is pure wordplay ("I didn't know people could still move this slow/Where 
did all of them Mohicans go?") but it also strikes me as a song with a haunting 
sense of longing, as if for a 1962 summer feeling that won't be here again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't that a pretty bird," goes the chorus, "Sure ain't no friendly bird." Is 
it about longing for a mood made bittersweet by time? About a relationship that 
won't relate? About pre-jaded plans for the future? I hope I'll continue to 
hear it those ways, though McLaughlin said its origins were somewhat less 
rarefied: 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one song that has some fairly literal beginnings. I was opening for 
John Prine and really wanting a new song to do. I was trying to write in the 
car, and there was this radio station that carries network TV all day long. I 
was listening to 'The People's Court.' This lady was in court because she'd 
gone in a pet store and saw this bird cage that said 'Friendly Bird' on it, and 
she stuck her finger in there and it bit her. So she took 'em to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I got started, and the rest of the song is just sort of a manual 
for life for Everyman," he concluded, with a deflating laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 For months I've been doing my best to make myself sick of McLaughlin's 
"Unglued," listening to it almost daily, and sometimes twice a day, 
force-feeding it to friends, calling folks long-distance to tout its virtues. I 
like a lot of music that's come out in the past year, but I like this better. 
</P>
<P>
 Like John Hiatt's instant classic "Bring the Family," "Unglued" is an example 
of the creative flowering that can occur under limited circumstances. 
McLaughlin, 43, and producer Ben Keith (best known for his long association on 
pedal steel guitar with Neil Young) recorded the album in two days on portable 
equipment in McLaughlin's Nashville-vicinity log home, and later captured three 
tracks live at New Orleans' gritty Howlin' Wolf club, where McLaughlin is a 
regular. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicianship is eerily empathetic; the singing a beguiling blend of 
Memphis soul, folk and stone country; the songs unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is juke joint floor-burners, musical buckwheat pancakes and country 
plaints, and not in the least the sort of record that insists on its own 
importance. Even the most melancholy tunes are dusted with a spirit of whimsy, 
yet there's no doubting that this is the sort of record that could keep you 
company through the hardest night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Elvis Costello with his lyrical thickets, McLaughlin doesn't need many 
words at all to be utterly befuddling. Try the opening verse of his "Nothin' 
But Trouble": 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling girl, even with your hands can make Such a night ring true, baby, Only 
flower underneath my rug can find Such a piece of cake.  
</P>
<P>
 I feel a bit better now, having been assured that McLaughlin himself isn't 
always sure where his songs come from or what they portend, and that he feels 
that's the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me there's always that little frustration there, and that makes 
for good songs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't think he particularly makes for good songs, though ("I'm not 
particularly high on my own songwriting right now"). Asked why he writes, he 
answered: "I think maybe it's that I'm curious to know if I can really write a 
decent song, so I keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has written country hits for Trisha Yearwood, Tanya Tucker, 
Delbert McClinton and Steve Wariner (the No. 1 "Lynda") and co-written with the 
likes of Prine and had his own stuff praised by some peers and critics as being 
in a class with Van Morrison, he remains circumspect about his abilities. "As 
far as those comparisons go, I try to take it as just flattery. If I let it go 
to my head, I might become an unmanageable dinner companion." 
</P>
<P>
 Say something kind about his yearning ballad "Try the Love" and he immediately 
deflects, "Oh, that's just a song about more white people, losing their address 
books and falling in love" before he finally owns up: "It's a real personal 
song, my sigh." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they rarely are literal, he says all his songs are personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I write any fiction. I don't have any way of writing about 
things I don't know about. I don't see how people write songs that don't have a 
direct link to their lives. But then again, maybe that accounts for those songs 
you hear and don't remember or like." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his childhood in Waterloo, Iowa, he said he "was the youngest of six, and I 
still am. I heard a wide variety of music, a lot of Kingston Trio type folk 
music. I remember liking Julie London. My next older brother was a serious 
music fan, and he was a big Lou Rawls fan so I was a big Lou Rawls fan too, in 
high school. To this day I think that guy is my biggest singing influence." 
</P>
<P>
 In high school McLaughlin was in a Motown-influenced band that often played 
college frat parties. "It was a hell of an opportunity for a high school kid to 
really get out there and screw off at an early age." He took the experience to 
heart and spent a good deal of his adult life as an accomplished drifter, 
living all over the country and working odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977 he moved to Nashville and started to make a small name for himself 
with his songs. He made two independently released albums in the early '80s, 
and in '88 Los Lobos saxman Steve Berlin was instrumental in getting him signed 
to Capitol Records. McLaughlin's first album for the label, the Mitchell 
Froom-produced "Pat McLaughlin," was released with such attendant hype -- 
including a press junket to New Orleans and a McLaughlin jigsaw puzzle -- that 
some critics immediately were turned off. In a typical example of record 
industry schizophrenia, a second album was shelved and remains unreleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to be surprised by anything a major label does," McLaughlin said. 
"People make decisions based on numbers and stuff, so I didn't take it very 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unglued" came out this past winter on the small Dos Records label, 
distributed by the only slightly less minuscule Antones Records. McLaughlin is 
touring as an opening act for the Subdudes, playing solo instead of with his 
usual excellent band, and he said he's enjoying the challenge. "If it goes 
well, it's a little more intense. But if it doesn't go well, if it really is a 
miserable night, I have no one else to blame, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 For some writers, being on the road is an impediment to writing. McLaughlin 
finds the reverse to be true. Touring, he spends more time with his guitar, and 
many of his songs have been sparked by noodling on the strings. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mite distressing, though, that some of his songwriting literally is 
done on the road. "I write a lot in the car. I play the mandolin and steer with 
my knee, if that makes you feel any more at ease on our nation's roads." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Unglued," he went to producer Keith with a set of songs that had already 
gone over well in clubs. "Ben's been around a lot of great music, being with 
Neil Young and others, so running songs by him was interesting, to say the 
least. I really wanted to figure out what my best songs were before I played 
them for him, songs I wouldn't be embarrassed by." 
</P>
<P>
 What does he hope listeners get out of his music? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I just hope they go back to the church and quit their foolish ways. 
After all, enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. I hope they get out of it what I have when I really sit down 
and listen to something. That's the most flattering thing that can happen. I 
know when I'm actually listening to some music, and wanting to, and going out 
of my way to listen to it, those are some of the better times in my life. So 
I'm just wanting to be a part of that."

CBS KEEPS ITS EYE ON FAMILY APPEAL; TELEVISION: NETWORK DEPENDS ON MATURE 
PERFORMERS DESPITE PROMISE OF URBAN EMPHASIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ratings leader CBS, while vowing to add to its comedy and urban appeal, 
nonetheless stuck by its formula of mainstream, "broad, family-appeal 
entertainment" in the fall prime-time schedule announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, seeking its fourth consecutive winning season, canceled one of its 
mainstay comedies, Burt Reynolds' "Evening Shade." But its continued dependence 
on mature, veteran performers was indicated by its seven new series -- four 
dramas and three comedies -- that feature such stars as Hal Linden, Suzanne 
Pleshette, Dudley Moore, Judith Ivey, Della Reese, E. G. Marshall and Eileen 
Heckart. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the network's other established returning stars include Angela 
Lansbury in "Murder, She Wrote," Dick Van Dyke in "Diagnosis Murder," Chuck 
Norris in "Walker, Texas Ranger," Jane Seymour in "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," 
Candice Bergen in "Murphy Brown" and the veteran news correspondents of the 
ageless "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that CBS is strong in grass-roots territory, network 
entertainment president Peter Tortorici said at a news conference in New York 
that "we're trying to balance our schedule" and "reach out" with urban 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tortorici's outgoing predecessor as CBS Entertainment president, Jeff 
Sagansky, predicted a fourth consecutive championship, the network's difficulty 
in changing its image was made clear in the schedule. The network's three new 
comedies give it only eight for the fall, compared to 16 for oncoming ABC and 
12 for NBC. Comedies are generally considered the main weapon of long-term 
ratings dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has no comedies on four of its seven nights of prime-time programming this 
fall. Neither of its two comedy producer whizzes, Diane English and Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason, has a new show on the fall lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 English has "Murphy Brown" and "Love & War" returning back-to-back on Mondays. 
Bloodworth-Thomason's company has "Hearts Afire" but lost "Evening Shade." A 
new English sitcom, "Double Rush," is targeted for midseason. A new 
Bloodworth-Thomason sitcom, with Delta Burke as a woman who takes over her late 
husband's congressional seat, is in development, a CBS spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, CBS, going against the grain of youth-crazy advertisers and 
programmers and comedy-heavy schedules, has proven its case since its 
remarkable turnaround three seasons ago, with a strong blend of movies, drama 
series, creative specials and newsmagazines led by "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours." 
And that looks to be the prime formula once again this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 With ABC threatening to unseat the defending champs next season -- aided by 
the Super Bowl, World Series and Oscar broadcasts -- CBS unveiled its lineup 
with Tortorici saying it reflects "the kind of first-class, broad, 
family-appeal entertainment that is the signature" of his broadcast 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Tops on Tortorici's list of series is "Chicago Hope," a new hospital drama 
starring Marshall, Mandy Patinkin, Adam Arkin, Roxanne Hart, Peter MacNicol, 
Roma Maffia and Hector Elizondo. The producer is David Kelley ("Picket 
Fences"). "I think it will be the next great television drama," Tortorici said. 
"It will be the best new show of the season on any network." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, "Chicago Hope" will be going head-to-head Thursdays with 
another new hospital drama set in the Windy City, NBC's "E.R.," whose 
co-producers include writer Michael Crichton ("Jurassic Park," "Rising Sun") 
and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new CBS dramas are: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Touched by an Angel," with Roma Downey and Reese in the story of an 
independent-minded angel who is sent to Earth and has "the questionable habit 
of defying orders and talking back to her boss," namely God. The way CBS puts 
it, she has been "sent to Los Angeles, a city considered by some to be hell on 
Earth," with the mission of helping children fulfill their promise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Due South," a Chicago-set tale starring Paul Gross as "an upright Canadian 
Mountie with an unconventional approach to police work" and David Marciana as a 
tough cop "with a flexible sense of morality." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Under Suspicion," a "police mystery" set in a northwestern city and 
focusing on "the only woman detective in the squad room (Karen Sillas), who has 
to be 'one of the boys.' " The cast also includes Seymour Cassell and Peter 
Onorati. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning at midseason, said CBS, will be two more of the network's 
traditional series that performed well in the ratings this year as late-comers: 
the revival of "Burke's Law," with Gene Barry, and "Christy," starring Kellie 
Martin and Tyne Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another CBS drama, "In the Heat of the Night," will return as a group of 
two-hour specials or, possibly, one-hour episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' new comedies are: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Boys Are Back," with Linden and Pleshette "as a couple who are about to 
enjoy the freedom of their 'golden years' -- and then their grown kids begin to 
move back home." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Daddy's Girls," with Moore as a man whose marriage and business partnership 
crumble and who is "trying to rebuild his own life while dealing with the 
ever-changing relationships of his three daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Five Mrs. Buchanans," with Ivey and Heckart in a tale of "four 
sharp-witted but wildly disparate sisters-in-law who have become combative but 
inseparable best friends through . . . their marriage bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Evening Shade," other CBS series not returning from this season 
include: "704 Hauser," "Angels Falls," "Bob," "Family Album," "Harts of the 
West," "How'd They Do That?," "It Had to Be You," "Second Chances," "South of 
Sunset," "Tom," "The Road Home," "Good Advice" and "Traps." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's CBS' night-by-night lineup for fall: 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: "The Boys Are Back," "Dave's World," "Murphy Brown," "Love & War," 
"Northern Exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: "Rescue 911," "CBS Tuesday Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: "The Nanny," "Daddy's Girls," "Touched by an Angel," "48 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: "Due South," "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung," "Chicago Hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: "Diagnosis Murder," "Under Suspicion," "Picket Fences." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday: "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," "The Five Mrs. Buchanans," "Hearts 
Afire," "Walker, Texas Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday: "60 Minutes," "Murder, She Wrote," "CBS Sunday Movie."

TONYS CHEER TAPER, WHAT'S IT MEAN?; AWARDS: THE THEATER EARNS PRAISE AS 'AN 
ESSENTIAL PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AMERICAN WORK' FOR CO-PRODUCING THREE 
OF THE FOUR BEST PLAY NOMINEES.

 Gordon Davidson was crowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the most active and productive theater in the area of new and 
challenging work in the United States," claimed the artistic director of the 
Mark Taper Forum. "Somebody else can add 'the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent evidence in support of his boast: The Taper co-produced three 
of the four nominees for one of Broadway's top awards, the Tony Award for best 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tony records dating back to 1956, which is when producers were first listed 
with the nominations, never before has a single theater company been affiliated 
with three of the four nominees in a production category, according to a Tony 
spokesman. The only Tony precedent that might be considered as impressive was 
in 1977, when the New York Shakespeare Festival was affiliated with two of the 
best play nominees and two of the best revival nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper's responsibility for this year's nominees differed from play to 
play, and the productions seen in New York were not the same that appeared in 
Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Kentucky Cycle." The Taper helped develop the play in its New Work 
Festival. But Davidson didn't decide to present a full production in Los 
Angeles until after he saw the world premiere at the Intiman Theatre in 
Seattle. The Intiman production was largely imported to Los Angeles, where the 
play attracted enough attention to win the Pulitzer Prize for Van Nuys-based 
playwright Robert Schenkkan. The Taper and the Intiman were among the 
co-producers on Broadway, for which Schenkkan somewhat rewrote the second half 
of the "Cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Angels in America: Perestroika." Although the now defunct Eureka Theatre in 
San Francisco commissioned Tony Kushner's two-part "Angels in America" and 
officially presented its world premiere, the Eureka premiere of the second 
half, "Perestroika," was an incomplete staged reading. The Taper presented the 
first fully staged production of "Perestroika" in 1992, then was one of several 
co-producers of the Broadway production. "Perestroika" was somewhat rewritten 
between the Los Angeles and Broadway stagings. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992." The Taper commissioned Anna Deavere Smith to 
create this work, based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and presented the world 
premiere last year. It was substantially re-edited before going to Broadway, 
where the Taper is among the co-producers. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory producing artistic director David Emmes said the 
nominations were a "tremendous credit" not only to the Taper but also to "West 
Coast theater" and "the tremendous amount of new play activity that's taking 
place out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper is "among the primary institutions" where playwrights want to take 
new work and has been since "Zoot Suit" in 1977, said critic Robert Brustein, 
who is also the artistic director of the American Repertory Theatre in 
Cambridge, Mass. He said the Taper shares that honor with such theaters as the 
New York Shakespeare Festival, the Goodman in Chicago and Actors Theatre of 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwrights "go where their work will be produced well. But David Mamet isn't 
going to send his work to the Taper," Brustein added. Mamet severed ties with 
the Taper after a casting dispute in the Taper's planned production of his 
"Oleanna." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper is "certainly an essential part of the development of new American 
work," said Peter Zeisler, the longtime executive director of Theatre 
Communications Group, the organization that serves as an advocate and service 
group for nonprofit theaters. "I don't know that many theaters could have given 
Anna Deavere Smith the resources the Taper did." 
</P>
<P>
 But he criticized the Tonys for "restrictive procedures" that limit 
nominations only to shows on Broadway. In response to such criticism years ago, 
an annual regional theater Tony Award was created. The Taper was the second 
theater to win the award, in 1977. Other Southern California theaters that have 
won the award are the Old Globe, South Coast and La Jolla Playhouse. This 
year's winner is the McCarter Theatre of Princeton, N.J. -- where "Twilight: 
Los Angeles, 1992" was briefly presented in between Los Angeles and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Brustein also discounted the importance of the Tonys: "You don't have to be 
validated by New York. New York is collapsing." The primary question should be 
whether any theater's shows are of importance to its own city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the Taper's most consistently acerbic critic, director Charles 
Marowitz, hasn't changed his tune in the light of Monday's announcement. While 
conceding full credit to the Taper for "Twilight," he said the "real risks" on 
the other plays were taken elsewhere, in keeping with what he called the 
Taper's "timidity."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; TALE OF TWO CITIES, TWO HOSTS: SAME OLD STORY 
</P>

 Traveling can be overrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late Show With David Letterman" resumed taping in New York on Monday after a 
highly publicized week's worth of allegedly tinselly telecasts from CBS in Los 
Angeles. Letterman's first guest Monday: Fox's "Melrose Place" star Heather 
Locklear. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally beamed to the United States from Burbank, "The Tonight Show With Jay 
Leno" is temporarily coming from NBC in Manhattan, spending this week 
supposedly soaking up that famous New York "edge." Leno's first sit-down guest 
Monday was Mike Myers of "Saturday Night Live," who immediately began spinning 
anecdotes about being with Sylvester Stallone in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nielsens made them do it. Letterman and Leno became bicoastal this month 
because of the May ratings sweeps, hoping to inflate their respective audiences 
merely through changes of locale. The trappings of travel worked for 
Letterman's "Late Show," which last week extended its lead over Leno's "Tonight 
Show," swelling its Nielsens in the crucial Los Angeles market and earning its 
fourth highest national ratings since its inception. And Leno's audience Monday 
was 13% larger than usual in the 31 cities for which overnight ratings were 
available -- including a 69% jump in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ratings, such relocations are usually noisier than substantive, 
rarely yielding the level of change promised by their buildup. In Letterman's 
case, his Los Angeles quickie became a media-bloated whale nourished by 
thunderous promotion that sucked in just about everyone. Credit that for his 
higher audience numbers, not the content of his Los Angeles segments, which, by 
his standards (his show is just about always funny), were more or less routine 
-- the exception being a couple of unbilled cameos by Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 No Rodney G. King sitting in with Paul Shaffer on drums. No 10 Best list read 
by the jailed Menendez brothers. All in all, it was just another week of 
Letterman. Worth watching, but not distinctive. Nearly everything he did in Los 
Angeles he could have done in New York; even his signature on-location whimsy 
was not especially distinguishing. 
</P>
<P>
 His guest list is generally not dependent on which coast celebrities live. So 
what's the big deal? You turn on Letterman and there he is in Los Angeles with 
Billy Crystal, for example, as if Crystal would never think of jetting to New 
York to promote his latest movie. As if Los Angeles celebrities don't fly to 
New York and their New York counterparts to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, everything blurs. One of Letterman's guests in New York Monday was 
book-promoting, movie-promoting, tour-promoting country singer Travis Tritt, 
who Tuesday morning was interviewed in Los Angeles via satellite by Sam Rubin 
on KTLA-TV Channel 5's morning news. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to appear with Leno this week, meanwhile, was radio talk-show 
host/New York gubernatorial candidate Howard Stern (wasn't he just in L.A.?), 
who would go to Rwanda if he had something of his own to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Leno wove a little New York ("You come here, you walk around, you 
get that New York attitude . . .") into his otherwise typical, generally funny 
monologue. Suddenly, there was Jack Paar, co-host of "The Tonight Show" from 
1957-62, when it originated in New York. There was something symbolic here: 
Letterman got Carson, Leno got Paar, who cracked some terrible crotch jokes 
before mercifully departing while the studio audience turned on the applause as 
if it actually knew who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Later there was a non-speaking cameo by syndicated talk-show host Phil 
Donahue, who hadn't been seen on television since, well, earlier that day. But 
the New York attitude really hit the fan when Myers was followed by the now 
sedate and stiff-upper-lippy Spike Lee, on the talk-show circuit promoting his 
new movie, "Crooklyn," and later by the even more laid-back singer James 
Taylor. The show also ran some pre-taped New York location pieces, with Leno 
and that human brick, bandleader Branford Marsalis, taking a scenic tour of the 
city ("Then it was off to the Empire State Building . . .").  
</P>
<P>
 What's it like being in New York? "Really exciting," Leno told Regis Philbin 
on "Live" Tuesday, as if he were just in from Peoria.  
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, his show did have that Peoria edge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of traveling, meanwhile, this is also the week that "Action News" 
meets Aunt Matilda. 
</P>
<P>
 That is to say, Monday marked billion-, zillion-, schmillion-dollar Ann 
Martin's debut as Michael Tuck's co-anchor on KCBS-TV Channel 2 news at 5 p.m. 
and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real pleasure to have you on our side for a change," said Tuck, 
starting a gusher of on-set welcomes given Martin, who for years was a top 
anchor at KABC-TV Channel 7, where Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill also once 
toiled. "It is going to be fun times again," Hill told Martin on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fun times? Happily, that is what Martin has never represented as an anchor. 
Unlike many of her hammier, pontificating counterparts, who seem convinced that 
they were divinely appointed to their jobs, she has always been thoroughly 
pleasant, professional and low key, almost to the point of being prim. She's 
several points lower on the Richter scale, for example, than the anchor she 
replaces, Bree Walker, and much less intense than her new co-anchor, Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the addition of Martin, the pairing of Bob Jiminez with Tritia Toyota at 
6 p.m. and a swanky new set be enough to lift terminally trailing Channel 2 in 
local news ratings? No one knows, but possibly. But will the basic character of 
"Action News" be altered by these cosmetic touches? Probably as much as Los 
Angeles altered Letterman and New York altered Leno.

WARRIN' PIECE; DONALD BYRD'S 'BRISTLE' FUELS RAGING POWER PLAYS BETWEEN DANCERS 
-- AND HAS PARALLELS TO HIS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Off to a hostile start, unsmiling men and women in Donald Byrd's newest dance 
stand erect in separate camps like opposing troops ready for battle. It's a war 
the choreographer knows firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a relationship now that for 10 years was like one big battle," before 
things changed, said Byrd, whose New York troupe will perform "Bristle," an 
evening-length work, at Irvine Barclay Theatre on Thursday. The presentation 
concludes the theater's 1993-94 Feet First Contemporary Dance Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiered in Baltimore in the fall and danced earlier this week in Santa 
Barbara, "Bristle" seethes with energy that fuels violent power plays -- both 
sides fight to dominate -- and explores other issues, including intimacy, or 
the fear of it, seduction and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Deploying a mix of sharp-edged, postmodern dance, ballet and pedestrian 
movement, the acclaimed dance-maker's alienated charges fling themselves 
together like co-dependents, repel one another like commitment-phobic loners, 
and make love that looks at times like rape, at others like unfeeling aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, dancers strip down to their underwear. That, Byrd said recently, 
represents the point in a love relationship, amid all the conflict and 
violence, "when there's nothing left to do but expose the true self; the 
clothing is like a shield." 
</P>
<P>
 "You also have the (characters) at their most seductive," he said. "And, from 
a strictly theatrical point of view, it heightens the tension of the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd, 44, is considered one of his generation's top choreographers. He founded 
his eight-member company, Donald Byrd/The Group, in 1976 and has since crafted 
works for major troupes in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his critically praised creations are "The Minstrel Show: Acts for Coons, 
Jigaboos and Jungle Bunnies" (1991), which addresses racism and stereotypes, 
and "Drastic Cuts" (1992), a suite of virtuosic, abstract dances. 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview before the Santa Barbara performance, he said that 
"Bristle" was inspired in part by Jean Baudrillard's writings. One of the 
French intellectual's theories suggested to Byrd that bigger-than-life, lace- 
and red-velvet-trimmed notions of love must die in order for relationships to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Brainwashed by the movies and romance novels, Byrd said, "most of us think 
that our partner has to give us a lot of attention for us to believe they love 
us, that they have to demonstrate their desire and love" in an epic way, a la 
"Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Such overblown fantasies "really get in the way of our actually being with the 
person; we're not really dealing with the person in the room or the bed with 
us." A successful relationship requires the ability to "just be with another 
human being" and accept his or her flaws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd's longtime musical collaborator, Mio Morales, wrote "Bristle's" 
propulsive, synthesized score. Its midsection, however, contains some of 
Ravel's "La Valse," a waltz that builds to an over-the-top frenzy, musically 
reinforcing the "ludicrousness" of dressed-up romanticism over genuine love, 
Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used the Ravel," he said, "because it's European music, and for most people 
that means romanticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony is the theme of the work's final third act. Tenderness prevails as the 
men sweetly kiss and caress their mates; pas de deux partnering becomes 
give-and-take, men and women supporting each other's weight. This resolution 
mirrors the progression of his own, formerly war-torn relationship, today a 
dozen years old, Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I noticed that the fighting had stopped. There was much more 
harmony, and I realized I was more accepting of (my mate), and they were more 
accepting of me, including my limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while dancers embrace at the end, a subtle sense of discord remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you enter into an arena of intimacy," Byrd said, "there's always going 
to be a certain amount of conflict. The proportions of it change, but it's 
always there. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there is no expression of joy in "Bristle," performed by dancers in 
austere, black or gray garb. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, the joy would come after the third act," Byrd said. "If you can get to a 
place where you can accept the person, be with them, whoever they are, there's 
a tremendous amount of joy, but getting there is dark. Also, basically, I don't 
think I'm an optimistic person. I have moments of great optimism, but . . . ."

SERLING'S 'DEAD' COMES TO LIFE ON CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All things considered, "Twilight Zone" creator Rod Serling would probably 
appreciate the irony that the last script he completed before his death in 
June, 1975, was a tale about prolonging life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades later, that teleplay itself has been revived as the main 
event of a two-segment television film, "Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost 
Classics," airing Thursday night on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Where the Dead Are," the 90-minute story stars Jack Palance as a 
mysterious doctor in 1868 New England whose patients have some unusual 
qualities. It shares the two-hour time slot with the 30-minute "The Theatre," 
starring Amy Irving as a woman who sees her future played out on a movie 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter was written by "Twilight Zone" veteran Richard Matheson, from a 
treatment by Serling. Both were directed by Robert Markowitz, with James Earl 
Jones assuming Serling's narration duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects had come to light about two years ago, when Serling's widow, 
Carol, was sorting through material to send to the newly established Rod 
Serling Archives at Ithaca College in New York, where the prolific television 
pioneer frequently taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up popped this screenplay," she recalls. "It had been buried and forgotten."  
</P>
<P>
 She gave that work and a number of treatments in various stages of completion 
to her attorney, Rene Golden, who asked two other clients, producing team 
Michael O'Hara and Lawrence Horowitz, if they would be interested in having a 
go at the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rene said it almost as an afterthought," remembers O'Hara, whose credits with 
Horowitz include the miniseries "Switched at Birth" and the NBC "Moment of 
Truth" telefilms. "I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about 
reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called my partner 
and said, 'I love it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But with 90-minute television movies passe, the producers needed something to 
fill two hours. They chose the treatment for "The Theatre" because, O'Hara 
says, "it was completed and terrific."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For O'Hara, himself a childhood fan of Serling's allegorical science-fiction 
series, "Where the Dead Are" was a welcome change of pace from his usual 
TV-movie fare. "It's no fault of the writers writing the material, because 
fact-based stories are the market," he says, "but those are narrow. This is 
pure imagination, a period piece, literate -- some might say wordy. If Rod 
Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't have a chance at getting made." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than some deletions, no changes were made in the script, in which 
surgeon Ben Ramsey, played by Patrick Bergin, discovers evidence of a long-ago 
injury on a young patient that no one could have survived. Intrigued, he 
launches a search for answers, landing on an island inhabited by Palance's 
retired regeneration research specialist.  
</P>
<P>
 The key story points also remain unchanged in "The Theatre," in which film 
buffs Irving and her boyfriend, played by Gary Cole, get swept up by events 
beyond their control after one too many visits to their local movie house. The 
characters, though, were updated to reflect the 1990s: Irving's Melissa Sanders 
was initially a secretary in love with a co-worker, but is now a sculptor with 
a doctor-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara says he believes the two segments remain true to the original "Twilight 
Zone" series. For her part, Carol Serling, who served as a producer, says she 
is "thrilled" with the project and the cast, particularly Palance, who won an 
Emmy for her husband's television classic "Requiem for a Heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other treatments could be developed and produced," she says. "And 
there's one other screenplay people are looking at. A lot of people out there 
want to do a remake, but I'm not rushing to that. If something was done right 
the first time, why do it again?" 
</P>
<P>
 * "Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics" airs at 8 p.m. Thursday on CBS 
(Channels 2 and 8).

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; WHICH DISK WILL SLIP?; 
FIRMS FACE OFF OVER COMPUTER DATA STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Irvine Spectrum Business Park, Pinnacle Micro Inc.'s two-story building 
looks up to Western Digital Corp.'s 14-story headquarters much the way David 
must have looked up at mighty Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a stone's throw apart in Irvine, these computer data storage companies 
have lived in peaceful coexistence for years, because a technological wall 
separated their industries. But with the advent of multimedia technology -- 
enabling computers to combine sound, text, graphics and video -- the neighbors 
may soon become adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle, a maker of optical storage devices, senses an opportunity and is 
readying its slingshot. Western Digital, a leading maker of magnetic disk 
drives with $1.2 billion in annual sales, insists it isn't worried it will 
suffer Goliath's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Each company's products perform the same basic function: storing computer 
data. Whichever can do that better at the best price will have a future; the 
other may be left spinning in the dustbin of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that optical disks will be around 30 years from now and 
magnetic won't exist," said Scott Blum, who co-founded Pinnacle Micro Inc. with 
his father, Bill, in 1987 and now serves as executive vice president. "This is 
what we've worked on for seven years." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Western Digital beg to differ. At stake is a share of the 
multibillion-dollar personal computer data storage industry, where demand is 
expected to explode in the future as companies vie to electronically supply 
entertainment and information to businesses and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every computer user cares who survives this battle, but it matters to tens 
of thousands of workers -- from engineers to assemblers -- who make their 
living in the PC storage industry, which so far has remained largely 
American-owned despite efforts by foreigners to grab a foothold. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, magnetic has been king. The $700-million optical disk drive 
industry is puny next to the $8.3 billion spent on magnetic hard drives each 
year, based on estimates by market researchers Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain 
View, Calif., and Freeman Associates Inc. in Santa Barbara. The magnetic disk 
drive industry mushrooms to $23.6 billion when sales of stand-alone drives are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be difficult to mount a serious challenge to the magnetic disk drive 
manufacturers, which grew on the enormous success of the personal computer. The 
disk drive serves as the permanent memory system for the PC. But Pinnacle's 
executives believe business and home users will eventually favor their type of 
storage system, which is expected to undergo a major enhancement next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle is set to release its enhancement project, code-named Diablo, next 
spring. For the first time, he said, an optical disk drive will cost less than 
similar high-capacity magnetic disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnetic hard drive makers scoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The epitaph of the disk drive industry was written in the mid-1980s when 
optical first appeared," said Peter Knight, vice president of business 
development at Conner Peripherals Inc. in San Jose, a top disk drive maker. 
"Many theorists stood up and talked about how the fundamental limit of the disk 
drive was coming. I thought optical would be a serious challenger. As time goes 
on, it's clear that isn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have tunnel vision," said Gary Marks, vice president of marketing at 
Western Digital. "There will be peaceful coexistence between hard disks and 
optical for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marks' view is shared by industry experts such as Bob Katzive, a vice 
president at Disk/Trend, and Phil Devin, storage analyst for Dataquest Inc., a 
market researcher in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see optical drives as a replacement for the magnetic hard disk," 
Katzive said. "They're good for storing things as archives. But if you need to 
(change) it fast, the hard disk drive is better." 
</P>
<P>
 Optical drives use a laser to read bumps and grooves on a metal platter, much 
like a compact disc player. In magnetic disks, a mechanical head reads the 
magnetic pattern on the metal disk. In both, the disks spin past a head, which 
reads the data or changes it based on commands from the computer's main 
processor. 
</P>
<P>
 This ability to alter, or "write" on, the disk quickly is key to a disk drive 
system, but for optical drives, it is still too slow and expensive -- which 
puts their manufacturers at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Blum, 59, stresses that "rewriteable" optical technology -- which 
allows data to be repeatedly recorded and erased -- has been on the market for 
only four years, compared to more than a decade for magnetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can put more information per square inch than them, and we just started," 
Scott Blum said. "They're pushing the limits. We're just beginning to make 
advances." 
</P>
<P>
 It is next to impossible to forecast the best technology for the future based 
on those that prevail today, said Bob Abraham, vice president of Freeman 
Associates.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one really knows where the physical limits are," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technological advance is a game of numbers. If Pinnacle improves its optical 
technology faster than competing magnetic disk drive companies, it will gain 
ground in sales. Speed, capacity and price matter most. Analysts, however, say 
that optical technology is behind on every front. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle had about $39 million in sales last year. With barely 100 employees, 
it competes against Japanese rivals such as Sony, Panasonic and Olympus. Its 
principal customers are businesses that have huge archives, especially defense 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for Pinnacle is to overcome the challenges optical drive makers 
face, which include developing better lasers that can read data squeezed into 
ever tighter spaces on a disk. It must build its drives in smaller packages to 
match the size standard of magnetic disk drives. It must also improve its write 
speeds, or the time it takes to record data, several times over to catch up 
with magnetic drives.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of this advancement depends on how quickly new laser heads are developed, 
and Pinnacle is dependent on the Japanese companies that manufacture them. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the obstacles, some optical players have simply decided not to 
directly challenge their magnetic hard disk rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital, for instance, has doubled the capacity of its hard disk 
drives every 16 months. Marc Nussbaum, vice president of engineering for 
Western Digital, says there is no foreseeable "brick wall" to such advances. In 
fact, a new technology expected to be on the market in 1995 -- magnetic 
resistive heads -- will virtually quadruple capacity on magnetic disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 And last year Western Digital established a new standard for magnetic hard 
disk drives -- dubbed the enhanced intelligent drive interface -- to 
accommodate ever higher storage levels.  
</P>
<P>
 While typical drives today store a maximum of 528 megabytes -- about 264,000 
typewritten pages -- future drives could hold 10 times as much, thanks in part 
to the new technology standard, Nussbaum said.  
</P>
<P>
 The unanswered question is when will magnetic drive makers max out their 
ability to stretch capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later there will be a limit for magnetic," said Peter Rentzepis, a 
chemistry professor at UC Irvine who is working on an $18-million project to 
develop an optical drive of the future. "The only way to overcome it is with 
optical. How soon? I cannot say." HOW OPTICAL DRIVE WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 These drives incorporate a laser and are used for storing large volumes of 
data. The laser's narrow beam can write more data in less space than the 
magnetic drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing data 1. Laser heats a spot; alloy layer crystallizes into loose 
particles. 2. Write head passes over the revolving disk, creating a magnetic 
field that aligns the crystal particles according to positive or negative 
polarities, representing the binary language of computers, which is based on a 
system of zeros and ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading data 1. A second, weaker laser reflects off of aluminum surface. As 
beam passes through alloy, crystallized particles polarize the light. 2. Sensor 
receives polarized light and reads its binary code. HOW MAGNETIC DRIVE WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic drives are standard in desktops, but are also used in supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing data 1. Read/write head passes over revolving disk. 2. While passing 
under read/write head, particles are organized into magnetic bands according to 
their positive and negative polarities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading data 1. Iron particles create a magnetic field, generating a current 
through the coil. 2. Computer "reads" direction of current and interprets its 
binary code.

IMPACT OF THE FED RATE INCREASE / THE VIEW FROM MAIN STREET; RECENT HIKES DO 
LITTLE TO SLOW CONSUMER SPENDING; FINANCIAL: ALTHOUGH MORTGAGES ARE HIGHER, 
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EFFECT ON THE COST OF MOST OTHER BIG-TICKET ITEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Rising interest rates have caused tumult in housing markets, particularly 
sparking fears that California's belated economic recovery could be choked off. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the exception of rising mortgage rates, most Americans so far have 
been relatively unscathed by the Federal Reserve Board's rate hikes, which 
began in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have yet to face sharp increases in loan rates for autos, furniture 
and other big-ticket items. The economy is still growing. And consumer 
confidence has continued to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Even savers, the most obvious beneficiaries of interest rate increases, 
haven't responded with a large-scale shift of investments into bank 
certificates of deposit, money market mutual funds and U.S. Treasury 
securities. Many savers say they want higher yields on those investments before 
they shift more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rate increases may not be big enough to do anything but hurt the 
housing market," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists argue that by slowing the rate of the economy's expansion now, the 
Fed is demonstrating its resolve to prevent future rises in inflation -- which 
would trigger even sharper and more dramatic rate increases. It's a matter of 
"taking the medicine now as a preventive measure," said David Lereach, chief 
economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If the medicine works, economists say, everyone wins because the economy 
continues a sustained, moderated growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the housing industry may ultimately gain, Lereach said: "Rates that 
gently rise now will moderate the economy's growth and ultimately we'll enjoy a 
longer run at expansion. The whole point is to get a soft landing of the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a soft landing is achieved remains to be seen, because the cumulative 
impact of the rate hikes -- particularly Tuesday's latest round -- has yet to 
be fully felt. Rates could rise so much further as to pinch many consumers and 
slow their demand for houses, cars and other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, consumers have shown little interest -- or concern -- over 
the rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, economists say, is that the rates in question have not really 
increased greatly. Since early February, the Fed has increased the target rate 
banks charge each other for overnight loans from 3% to 4.25%. But rates on auto 
loans, credit cards and other non-mortgage borrowing have not risen as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that the increases so far have been widely expected, and 
consumers may be braced for still additional rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, bankers and investment experts say, consumers and investors alike 
have become more sophisticated about the economy and are less likely to panic 
at individual movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most surprising has been the ho-hum response from savers -- an 
attitude that strongly suggests a new breed of individual investors has become 
far more comfortable with the often volatile fluctuations of the market and far 
more accepting of investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, James Von Lossow, a 66-year-old retired Seattle resident 
who relies on his investments for much of his living expenses. He certainly 
can't afford to be a gambler. But, he added, he also can't live on what bank 
certificates of deposit or other government-guaranteed investments currently 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 So he's accepted some risk when investing his retirement portfolio to gain 
higher returns. "You need to be more flexible these days," he said. "You either 
have to give up the security of guaranteed investments or learn to live on less 
income." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Money magazine survey last year, 60% of respondents said they were taking 
greater risks with their funds today than in 1991 -- many with no small amount 
of fear. "Two years ago I had two-thirds of my money in bank CDs," one 
respondent said. "Now I have zero in banks and 100% invested in the market -- 
with my fingers crossed.'

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IMPACT OF THE FED RATE INCREASE / THE VIEW FROM WALL 
STREET; WALL STREET TAKES HEART; DOW SOARS 49 ON MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board gave investors what they wanted on Tuesday: A hefty 
interest-rate hike, and -- more important -- the promise that that's all for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's half-point boost in its two key short-term rates sparked an 
immediate rally when the news hit Wall Street at 2:30 p.m. EDT, and the buying 
continued til the close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 49.11 points to 3,720.61, its highest 
finish in seven weeks. In the bond market, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond 
yield tumbled to a two-week low of 7.26% from 7.44% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors don't normally root for higher short-term interest rates, of course, 
but the economy's healthy pace this year has fanned an unexpected -- and some 
say ridiculous -- inflation paranoia on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 With each bullish economic report in recent months, long-term interest rates 
surged and stock prices crumbled, on fears that faster growth would inevitably 
mean higher inflation. Though the Fed began to tighten credit in February in an 
attempt to slow the economy, the markets didn't believe the central bank was 
moving fast enough to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, each of the Fed's three quarter-point increases in short-term rates, 
prior to Tuesday's half-point rise, simply added to financial markets' woes by 
focusing investors on the likelihood of another increase down the pike. The Fed 
was accused of dallying. 
</P>
<P>
 By last week, the markets had all but backed the central bank into a corner: 
If Chairman Alan Greenspan and the other Fed governors cared at all about 
investors' view of the economy and inflation, the Fed would have to engineer a 
half a point rate rise at its policy-setting meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, Greenspan came through. Usually, Wall Street sells rather than buys 
when its expectations are met. But this time, many pros say, investors' relief 
that the Fed is moving aggressively to moderate economic growth overwhelmed the 
sell-on-the-news crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the question was whether the Fed was behind the curve, this has to tilt 
peoples' opinion toward the notion that the Fed has at least caught up with the 
curve," said Steven Nothern, who manages bond mutual funds for Massachusetts 
Financial Services in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the inflation worrywarts could feel better Tuesday. But more significant 
was the bone the Fed threw to investors whose greatest fear was that another 
round of rate hikes would soon follow this one. The Fed essentially said it is 
done for now, having wrung out the "monetary accommodation" that had helped 
goose the economy over the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're communicating that policy is apt to be on hold for a reasonable 
period of time," said William Sullivan, money market economist at brokerage 
Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Dean Witter, that suggestion of stable short-term interest rates in the 
near term was enough to warrant a bullish turn toward bonds, on the expectation 
that long-term rates now have room to fall back after rocketing in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Witter recommended Tuesday that clients increase their bond holdings to 
35% of their portfolios from 25%, while cutting short-term "cash" investments 
from 25% to 15%. Stocks' recommended weighting was left at 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Retzer, manager of the Heartland U.S. Government bond fund in 
Milwaukee, also believes that the bond market is ready to rally. He snapped up 
longer-term bonds on Monday, and also removed a hedge from his portfolio, 
effectively lengthening the average maturity of the fund's bonds. Given 
Tuesday's plunge in long-term yields, Retzer's strategy of locking in high 
yields worked beautifully: His fund's share price jumped 11 cents on Tuesday, 
to $9.62. 
</P>
<P>
 Retzer figures that the bond market's Angst over inflation has been grossly 
overdone. He believes the Fed is successfully slowing the economy to a 
manageable growth rate (look at the weakening housing sector, he says) and that 
that will allow long-term interest rates to come down. "We think long rates 
will be significantly lower by the end of the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retzer also believes that the bond market has something going for it that's 
almost as important as the fundamentals: Too many bears. "If this rally shows 
any staying power, there's a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to come 
into" bonds, he said. "Short" sellers who thought yields would continue to rise 
will have to cover their positions; and bond fund managers who have accumulated 
piles of cash will feel pressured to put that money to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Wall Streeters still argue that any rally in the bond market ought to 
be viewed as an opportunity to exit, not to buy. What happens, ask these 
doubters, if economic statistics continue to look strong well into June? How 
long before investors again see the specter of higher inflation, and begin 
clamoring for the Fed to tighten credit again? 
</P>
<P>
 Shelby Davis, who manages the New York Venture stock fund, contends that the 
stock market has a far better chance of mounting a sustainable rally here than 
the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it this way, Davis says: If the economy is stronger than the Fed yet 
knows, interest rates will jump again (bad for bonds), but corporate profits 
will be stronger as well (good for stocks); and if the Fed has achieved its 
goal of moderating growth without bringing on a recession, interest rates may 
stabilize, but continuing growth in corporate profits should prove the bigger 
lure for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The capital gains play in bonds isn't there," Davis argues, while it still is 
for stocks, he says. Ready to Pop? 
</P>
<P>
 Investment newsletter writers' sentiment toward stocks has grown increasingly 
negative in recent weeks, and the percentage of newsletters bullish on the 
market now is at a 3 1/2-year low -- which could, perversely, signal a 
short-term rally.

JAMES FLANIGAN: UTILITY STOCKS HAVE MORE POWER THAN YOU THINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd think the lights were going out all over the world the way investors 
have been dumping electric utility stocks. Since September, utility shares on 
average have lost 30% of their value; stocks of California utilities have been 
in a swan dive for the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates and a profound, historic change in the electric power 
business are behind the headlong plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 But panic is always unwise. Cooler analysis of trends in the utility business 
shows real value and an exciting future there. 
</P>
<P>
 First, understand the factors that have caused the decline. Rising interest 
rates are partly to blame because they reduce the investment attraction of 
utility dividends. However, on Tuesday, as the Federal Reserve Board again 
hiked short-term rates, the Dow Jones utility average rose 2.38 points, 
reflecting investor belief that rising rates may now pause, allowing utility 
shares to shine. 
</P>
<P>
 But far more important is the competitive change in the business. Utility 
stocks began falling in September when the credit rating agency Standard & 
Poor's issued re-evaluations of electric companies based on their "competitive 
business position," a ranking based on how vulnerable a company would be to 
competition from other suppliers selling cheaper power to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And California utilities sank last month after the Public Utilities Commission 
proposed total deregulation by 2002, which would allow all customers to shop 
around for power. One Wall Street analyst called it a "populist, 
damn-the-torpedoes restructuring of a major part of the economy with no 
evidence that the existing system can be improved in efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 But that reaction is off the mark. The California regulators simply recognized 
that competition has already come to the business. Big industrial users 
exercise options in buying power today. Ohio and other states have bills before 
their legislatures proposing deregulation of electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To understand what's happening, ask yourself this question: If McDonald's can 
order all its hamburger rolls from a single baker in Kansas City, why can't it 
buy electricity for all its stores from a single supplier, rather than paying 
electric companies in each state and locality? 
</P>
<P>
 In England, McDonald's now buys electricity for roughly 200 stores from a 
single supplier rather than a dozen. The savings begin with a reduction in 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 National Westminster Bank is headquartered in London but buys its electricity 
from a utility in the eastern part of Britain. "It saves $15 million a year 
doing so," reports Edward Tirello, a utility analyst for NatWest Securities, a 
U.S. subsidiary of the British bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain has separated electric power generation from transmission and 
distribution to homes and businesses and found that this produced economies. By 
1998, Britain plans to have a switch in every home, allowing residential 
customers to go from coal-generated to gas-generated electricity at will, 
depending on which is cheaper at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 And that British model is very much on the minds of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission in Washington. That agency, with responsibility for 
utilities, knows that U.S. "national chains, supermarkets, shopping malls, 
local school boards want to buy electricity competitively, the way they buy 
telephone services," says Richard O'Neill, director of economic policy for the 
FERC. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance telephone competition was opened up 10 years ago with the 
breakup of American Telephone & Telegraph, and local competition is spreading 
today. Many experts envision a similar breakup pattern for electric power, with 
nine regional power generation providers and numerous transmission and local 
distribution companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Future transmission and distribution companies may remain as local monopolies, 
such as the Baby Bells, with regional generating companies freed up to compete 
-- to take risks like any other business. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's in the United States might buy power from regional suppliers who 
would arrange distribution to stores in each locality for a package-deal price. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors ultimately may get hybrid holdings, one part regulated company 
paying a relatively safe dividend, the other a competitive company taking the 
risk of huge power plants, fuel prices and the battle to win customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nervousness, but also opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Duff & Phelps, the Chicago-based credit rating agency that specializes in 
utilities, notes that California companies -- Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric -- have been forced to buy 
high-priced power from independent suppliers, a boondoggle dating to the 
energy-crisis 1970s. But under deregulation, the utilities should be able to 
dispense with such purchases or reduce what they pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, if you need steady dividend income now, utilities might not be the 
best place for your money. But for ambitious employees and investors, the 
once-sleeply utility business will prove very interesting in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful utility of the future would keep costs low and be aggressive. 
Other than that, no particular advantage stands out among companies qualifying 
for Standard & Poor's list of those with an "above average business position." 
Subsidiaries of Columbus, Ohio's American Electric Power are on the list, and 
so is Pacificorp, the Portland, Ore.-based company that wants to sell power in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Tirello wrote to clients that "while competition will create a 
multitude of losers," some companies will prosper -- among them, Duke Power of 
Charlotte, N.C., and Florida Power & Light, which has cut its dividend because 
it wants cash to finance growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirello also favors PG&E because he thinks fears that shareholders will be 
stuck with a big bill for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone precedent is reassuring for utility investors: Stockholders of 
AT&T who received shares of seven Baby Bells, plus a share of the new AT&T in 
the 1984 breakup, have seen their investment almost quadruple in the 
intervening decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Change, as they say, is constant -- but that's not a bad thing.

BEVERLY HILLS MAN INDICTED ON HOUSING FRAUD; REAL ESTATE: GARY LEFKOWITZ OF 
CULVER CITY-BASED CITI EQUITY ALLEGEDLY DEFRAUDED $50 MILLION FROM PROJECTS FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOMES NATIONWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal grand jury Tuesday charged a Beverly Hills real estate syndicator 
involved in low-income housing projects across the country with defrauding 
investors, developers and the Internal Revenue Service out of $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota, alleges that Gary 
Lefkowitz, president of Culver City-based Citi Equity Group, lied to state 
housing authorities to gain low-income housing tax credits, left builders and 
property owners with millions of dollars in unpaid bills and took investors' 
money for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $2 million earmarked for low- and moderate-income housing, for 
example, was diverted to payments on Lefkowitz's homes in Beverly Hills and 
Beaver Creek, Colo., according to the indictment. Lefkowitz is accused of using 
another $2 million in investor funds for clothes, jewelry and art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lefkowitz is preparing to vigorously defend all charges," according to a 
statement issued Tuesday by Citi Equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz, who founded Citi Equity in 1984, is expected to turn himself in to 
federal authorities in Minnesota on Thursday, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Andrew Luger in Minneapolis, where the 18-month federal investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was committing fraud in order to mastermind what became a very complex 
scheme to enrich himself," Luger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the alleged scheme shocked proponents of affordable housing, some 
of whom fear a backlash against the low-income housing tax credit program. The 
credits are issued to qualifying developers of affordable housing, who then 
sell them to investors to raise money for projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any firm in the country has been charged with this before," 
said Ronne Thielen, executive director of the California Tax Credit Allocation 
Committee, which has approved the use of tax credits for 40,000 units of 
affordable housing. "It has been one person who has been alleged to be 
dishonest. But the program will get blamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz's firm has been involved in the development and acquisition of 
affordable housing projects since the late 1980s, raising at least $100 million 
through the sale of limited real estate partnerships, according to the 54-count 
federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the firm's roughly 7,000 investors did not know that about $20 million in 
tax credits they received as part of their investments were obtained illegally 
by Lefkowitz, prosecutors charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In applications with housing authorities in at least five states, Lefkowitz 
falsely claimed a nonprofit group as a general partner to win credits set aside 
for such organizations, the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz is also charged with embezzling some of the $30 million that Citi 
Equity raised from investors for construction loans. He is accused of 
misleading some developers and builders into believing he had commitments for 
long-term, permanent financing to pay off interim construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some of the low-income properties were not completed, and 
developers and builders have lost or are owed at least $20 million, according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Citi Equity has been involved in up to 10 housing projects, 
according to Thielen. One construction lender threatened to foreclose on a 
project in Fresno, but a settlement was reached between the lender and Citi 
Equity, she said.

 Nordstrom to Try Interactive Home Shopping: The Seattle-based department store 
chain said it plans to plug into two separate interactive home shopping tests 
being launched by regional phone companies U.S. West and Bell Atlantic Corp. 
Nordstrom said it signed a licensing pact to participate in an interactive 
shopping trial that U.S. West will launch in the Midwest. "We are going to work 
directly with those two providers," John Nordstrom, the retailer's co-chairman, 
said. "And if the interactive TV part of it is successful, we'll move right 
along with the technology providers, and we will be a provider of the 
merchandise."

 Lynn Redgrave Files for Bankruptcy Protection: The actress, whose credits 
include the television show "House Calls" and the 1960s film "Georgy Girl," 
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.Redgrave's financial problems stem from costly legal battles that started 
with her dispute with MCA's television unit over her 1981 dismissal, as well as 
disputes with her former lawyers in the now-defunct Finley, Kumble law firm. 
Redgrave's bankruptcy lawyer, David Neale with Levene & Eisenberg, estimated 
that Redgrave will list about $250,000 in liabilities on her petition, the bulk 
of which she disputes. Her assets largely consist of her Los Angeles-area home.

 Coroner Finds High Drug, Alcohol Level in Lazard's Body: The chairman and 
chief executive of W.R. Lazard & Co., Wall Street's biggest black-owned money 
management firm, appears to have been drunk and high on cocaine when he died, a 
coroner said.Wardell Lazard's blood alcohol level measured more than 0.25%, and 
toxicology tests indicated a white substance found near his body was 83% or 
more cocaine. The findings support investigators' speculations that Lazard, 44, 
whose naked body was found last Wednesday on a bed in a Pittsburgh hotel, died 
of an accidental overdose. An empty vodka bottle was on a table at the foot of 
the bed, the coroner's office said.

 State Farm Raises Estimate of Quake Losses: State Farm Mutual Automobile Co., 
the nation's largest property and casualty insurer, raised to $1.27 billion its 
estimated losses from the Northridge earthquake. The expected pretax losses are 
27% higher than the estimate of $1 billion made March 25.On Feb. 8, the 
company's initial loss estimate was put at $600 million. "The new estimate is 
based on our most current data," said Roger Lehman, State Farm's vice 
president. "Further revisions are possible, but we should be getting close to 
the final figure." The company, headquartered in Bloomington, Ill., based the 
most recent estimate on more than 105,000 claims for earthquake damage totaling 
almost $890 million. At the time of the $1 billion estimate in March, the 
company had received 100,000 claims and expected a total of 103,000.

4 HEALTH CARE GROUPS FORM STATEWIDE NETWORK; MEDICINE: THE JOINT VENTURE IS THE 
RESULT OF REFORM PROSPECTS AND PRESSURE TO CUT COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four regional health care organizations said Tuesday that they have formed a 
statewide network they hope will appeal to large companies by giving their 
employees access to medical facilities throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the four organizations said their effort is a response to the 
prospect of national health reform and the pressure of employers that are 
demanding cuts in medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture, dubbed the California Health Network, is composed of 
Adventist Health System/West and Loma Linda University Medical Center in 
Southern California, Sharp HealthCare of San Diego, Sutter Health of Sacramento 
and California Healthcare System of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations collectively represent 1.2 million patients, 14,500 doctors 
and $4 billion in assets, officials said. The group plans to expand to other 
parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The companies noted that they are not merging their organizations. But 
patients who belonged to one of the four health care groups would be able to 
use medical facilities of the other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of California's largest private employers want to limit the number of 
health plans with which they must contract," said Peter K. Ellsworth, Sharp 
HealthCare's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Likewise, large health plans have begun to merge and are looking for 
strategic relationships with provider networks and fully integrated health care 
systems to contract with on a statewide basis." 
</P>
<P>
 To attract employers with offices throughout the state, the network will have 
to forge links with hospital, medical groups and perhaps health plans in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties and the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellsworth said the group is in discussions with other hospitals in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, but he declined to say which ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the formation of the venture will help the four organizations 
compete better with Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest HMO, with more than 
4 million members in California alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the venture is a response to growing pressures from private and 
public employers to reduce health care costs. In particular, they cited the 
success of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which purchases 
health coverage on behalf of nearly 1 million public workers, at reducing its 
members' insurance premium rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cost seems to be driving almost everything in health care, and we must 
respond to that," said Quentin L. Cook, chief executive of California 
Healthcare System, a Bay Area network of two hospitals, 3,600 doctors, nursing 
homes and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, the Bay Area Business Group on Health, a recently 
formed health-purchasing consortium of major employers, including Bank of 
America, Wells Fargo Bank and Chevron Corp., is likely to have a big impact on 
driving down medical costs, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture will also seek to improve the quality of health care because 
the network will allow the hospitals to combine resources and expertise, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group would be able to standardize patient claim forms and create computer 
systems to provide better information about patient care and clinical 
practices, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Adventist Health operates Glendale Adventist Medical 
Center, White Memorial Medical Center and Simi Valley Hospital & Health Care 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the joint venture, it has teamed up with Loma Linda University 
Medical Center to form an organization known as Pacific Integrated Healthcare.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN PACIFIC LUMBER SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maxxam Inc., the Houston-based investment firm headed by Charles E. Hurwitz, 
agreed in principle Tuesday to pay $52 million to settle lawsuits brought by 
former shareholders in Pacific Lumber Co., which Hurwitz took over in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suits, filed beginning in 1988, the former shareholders alleged that 
Hurwitz, the former board of Scotia, Calif.-based Pacific Lumber and others 
used fraud and deception in the acquisition. The board members were accused of 
breaching their fiduciary duties by accepting a price of $40 a share in one of 
the first hostile takeovers financed by junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz raised $450 million of the $863-million purchase price with the help 
of Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Other defendants in the agreement -- which apparently settles all lawsuits 
connected with the takeover -- include the former directors of Pacific Lumber 
and Salomon Bros. Inc. -- the lumber company's financial adviser at the time -- 
and Jefferies & Co., the Los Angeles brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants in the case, which would have gone to trial Tuesday, denied 
wrongdoing but said the settlement will save the costs of a trial as well as 
"the diversions, distractions and uncertainties of litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement apparently applies to other Maxxam securities litigation that 
was pending before Judge Milton Pollack in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. It 
is subject to notification of class-action plaintiffs and a fairness hearing 
before Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and angry shareholders have contended that the former board 
members should have known that Pacific Lumber lands held at least 40% more 
timber than the company estimated -- including the last big private stand of 
old-growth redwoods in California. It was this extra value that allowed Hurwitz 
to finance the takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurwitz has since angered environmentalists by dramatically stepping up timber 
cutting, in part to pay for the takeover.

NASDAQ PLANS OVERHAUL OF ITS TRADING SYSTEM; MARKETS: PROPOSAL TO NARROW GAP 
BETWEEN ASKING PRICE AND BID ON SMALL STOCK ORDERS COULD BRING ABOUT LOWER 
PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Nasdaq stock market is proposing a significant overhaul of its trading 
system for small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal could result in customers seeing an improvement in the price paid 
for their shares traded on the redesigned system for small stock orders, 
tentatively called N-Prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say the possibility of price improvement would mark a significant 
advancement in the Nasdaq electronic market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By narrowing the gap between a seller's asking price and a buyer's bid in 
certain stocks, small investors could save money and inject competition into 
the electronic dealer market, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a significant change, and it is a change that market makers have 
always resisted," said Eric Clemons, professor of finance at Wharton School at 
the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalists to auction markets such as the New York Stock Exchange claim 
investors there get a better shake because the share price can improve in 
auction trading, but not in dealer systems such as Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of N-Prove contend investors could find that their stocks end up 
selling for less than they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like dropping your order in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and 
knowing it will end up somewhere, someday," said Linda Lerner, general counsel 
for All-Tech Investment Group in Suffern, N.Y., which is fighting the Nasdaq 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate about Nasdaq's inner workings are among the many topics at the 
spring convention of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the group that 
oversees the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, which begins here today, follows a strong year for Nasdaq: 
Trading volume rose 37% to 66.5 billion shares, while market capitalization 
rose to $791 billion, up 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD has proposed a complete overhaul of its controversial Small Order 
Execution System, a computerized system for brokers to automatically execute 
small orders of 1,000 shares or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOES system has created controversy because professional traders can take 
advantage of momentary price discrepancies among the stocks to make quick 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, a customer who seeks to sell 1,000 shares of a major 
Nasdaq stock at a specific price -- say Apple Computer at $29.50 a share -- can 
have that order piped into the N-Prove system. 
</P>
<P>
 The following steps will take place: 
</P>
<P>
 * The trade is immediately executed if a buy order for Apple exists at that 
price in the N-Prove system, or if a market maker chooses to buy the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * If $29.50 is higher than the current market price, two things will happen: 
The order will be routed to traders who specialize in Apple stock, the market 
makers, who can have the opportunity to execute the trade. Or a new incoming 
order to buy Apple stock, regardless of the price, will be matched at the 
$29.50 price. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner of All-Tech Investment said customers could see the price of their 
order decline if Nasdaq dealers refused to take the order.

HOUSING STARTS SLIP IN APRIL, BUT CONTINUED STRENGTH SEEN; ECONOMY: RESIDENTIAL 
CONSTRUCTION IS DOWN 2.5% NATIONALLY AMID RISING INTEREST RATES. THE WEST SEES 
A 6.8% DROP.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rising mortgage rates began to curb residential construction in April, but 
building activity is still expected to remain strong because of the improving 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing starts slipped 2.5% to a 1.46-million seasonally adjusted annual rate, 
the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. That was down from a revised 
1.49-million rate in March, when construction rebounded 12.3% from a winter 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Thompson, president of the National Assn. of Home Builders, attributed 
increased starts in the Northeast and Midwest to a continuing rebound from 
severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just starting homes that were sold earlier in the year when sales 
were not impacted by rising rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that rising rates were probably responsible for larger declines 
in the South and West, which were less affected by winter storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Starts fell 6.8% in the West to a 342,000 rate, and 4.9% in the South to a 
608,000 rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thompson and other analysts said overall starts remain strong. For the 
first four months of 1994, they were 19.4% above those of the same period in 
1993. Starts totaled 1.29 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. noted that the 
April construction level was higher than any month in 1993 except December, 
when starts reached a 1.61-million rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some modest interest rate effect, but it will be largely offset 
by stronger economic activity," Berson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 8.39% in April, up from 7.75% in March 
and a 25-year low of 6.74% last October, according to the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. They had risen to 8.77% by last Thursday, the highest in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert R. Davis, an economist with the Savings and Community Bankers of 
America, said the "change in the interest rate environment is not quite as 
precipitous as some would have you believe." 
</P>
<P>
 "There still is strong demand, strong job growth, strong spending potential," 
he said. "That will fuel a strong housing market into the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, applications for building permits, often a barometer of future 
activity, rose 4.4% to a 1.37-million rate in April, up from 1.31 million a 
month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, analysts agreed that rising rates will have a slowing effect. 
The Home Builders said a jump in rates from 7% to 9% would add $209 to the 
monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher rates make housing less affordable and hurt people at the margin, 
particularly first-time buyers," Thompson said. As a result, the association 
has revised its 1994 forecast of housing starts to 1.38 million, down from its 
initial 1.43-million prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of single-family homes dropped 4.4% in April to a 1.21-million 
rate. Housing Starts

cable TV operation in the city, likely making Rochester, N.Y., the first U.S. 
city where people will be able to make phone calls over their cable TV systems. 
The agreement is the first of its kind between a cable operator and a major 
telephone company in the United States.Phone service through cable systems is 
becoming common in Britain, where telecommunications laws are less restrictive. 
The staff of the New York Public Service Commission approved the pact, but 
commissioners must still act. If they approve the deal, Time Warner Cable's 
phone service could be running next year in Rochester, spokesman Michael 
Luftman said.

 IBM Introduces New PC Models: In an effort to recapture revenue lost due to 
its nagging supply problems, International Business Machines Corp.'s PC Co. has 
launched several new personal computer models.The world's largest computer 
maker, which has been bedeviled by parts shortages, also said meeting demand is 
its top priority. IBM introduced three new models of its hot-selling ThinkPad 
notebook computer, including a lower-priced notebook to fill a gap in its 
product line. The company rolled out a new line of ValuePoint PCs, the 
Performance Series, which uses the fastest Intel 486 chips. They are 
higher-priced and targeted to large corporate customers.

 Hewlett-Packard Co. Earnings Up 18%: The Palo Alto-based company attributed 
the higher second-quarter profit to strong demand for its computers and 
printers, and cost containment.The company earned $408 million, or $1.56 per 
share, for the three months ended April 30, compared to $347 million, or $1.38 
per share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 23% to $6.3 billion 
from $5.1 billion. Despite the strong report, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 
$1.625 to close at $76.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. For the first half 
of fiscal 1994, H-P earned $776 million, or $2.98 per share, up 28% from $608 
million, or $2.41 per share, in the same six-month period a year earlier.

Q & A; FIRST PENSION ALLEGATIONS SPARK CONCERN ABOUT 'DIRECT PARTICIPATION' 
PROGRAMS; INVESTMENTS: THEY AREN'T ILLEGAL, BUT USE CAUTION. SCRUTINIZE THE 
PROSPECTUS AND ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION.

 The allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that First 
Pension Corp. in Irvine may have stolen or misappropriated as much as $124 
million from its investors have heightened financial experts' concerns about 
such "direct participation" programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did First Pension Corp. allegedly do wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Before it declared bankruptcy last month, First Pension functioned as a 
pension fund administrator, setting up IRAs, Keoghs and other types of 
retirement accounts. The SEC has alleged that First Pension persuaded many of 
the clients to invest in trust deeds offered through other companies that were 
operated by the same people who ran First Pension -- an apparent conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also claimed that as much as $99 million of investors' money was never 
invested in real estate at all and that millions more may simply have been 
stolen by management at First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is a "direct participation" program? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In a typical direct-participation program, a brokerage firm sells 
investment products that are controlled by the same people who run the 
brokerage. In this case, the SEC claims, the same people who owned First 
Pension were selling interests in pools of trust deeds through a brokerage firm 
they also controlled, VestCorp Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's wrong with such an arrangement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Legally speaking, nothing. Yet First Pension misled its investors by 
failing to disclose its connection to VestCorp. In addition, and far more 
seriously, the SEC alleges that First Pension's owners used VestCorp and other 
companies they owned to set up an elaborate pyramid scheme to bilk thousands of 
consumers out of their money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If direct-participation arrangements aren't illegal, how come so many 
financial experts are wary of them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Advisers often make larger commissions or bonuses for selling investments 
their own company or an affiliate offers than they would by selling products 
offered by other financial institutions. This can encourage unscrupulous 
advisers to put unwitting clients into bad investments, or ones that don't 
match their financial objectives, just so the adviser or broker can collect a 
fatter paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some experts warn that direct-participation programs make it 
easier to defraud unwitting investors. "You don't always get the normal system 
of checks and balances when only a few people are running the whole show," said 
Elaine Cacheris, regional director for the SEC in Los Angeles. "In this case, 
the fox was in charge of the henhouse, and the investors were the chickens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have there been problems with direct-participation programs before? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Prudential Securities' highly publicized problems with some of its oil 
and gas partnerships is a prime example of the troubles these programs can 
cause, Cacheris said. 
</P>
<P>
 And last December, a federal court-appointed officer agreed with the SEC that 
the defunct Brokers Investment Corp. in Woodland Hills had misused much of the 
estimated $109 million it raised for limited partnerships offered by a 
telecommunications firm with which it had close ties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can I reduce the chances of getting ripped off if I invest in a 
direct-participation program? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, realize that most of these programs are legitimate and that any 
investment you make will carry risks. Have your financial planner or adviser 
justify all these risks and explain how it would meet your overall investment 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrutinize the offering's prospectus, including the section on conflicts of 
interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Always get a second opinion from a planner or adviser at another firm before 
you invest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can I find out more about my broker or the people who run the company 
that he suggests I invest with? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you're dealing with investment brokers, you should call the state 
Department of Corporations to see if they and the firm they work for are 
licensed and whether they have been the subject of disciplinary action in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 If the investment you are considering involves real estate, you can get 
similar information by calling the state Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also get the names of individuals who own the company, as well as any 
company listed under the "conflicts of interest" section of the prospectus, by 
contacting the California secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also discover the disciplinary history of any brokerage firm or sales 
representative by calling the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' toll-free 
hot line at (800) 289-9999. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the chances that First Pension investors will get all their money 
back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Chances of a full recovery are virtually nil. Up to $124 million of the 
$350 million in assets of First Pension clients may have been lost. It will 
probably take several months and possibly even years to determine where the 
money went and then try to get what's left of it back.

RAND SAYS C-17 COULD TEAR UP RUNWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study by Rand Corp. has raised serious questions about the ability of the 
C-17 cargo jet to make repeated landings at many unimproved runways overseas, 
saying the plane could create large craters in the airports' concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 But Air Force officials dismissed the report in congressional testimony 
Tuesday as a superficial analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure, and the resulting attack on the Rand study, came during a 
lengthy House Armed Services Committee hearing on the fate of the C-17, 
produced in Long Beach by McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 John Deutch, undersecretary of defense, made a lengthy and spirited case for 
continuing the program, arguing that the committee erred in cutting its funding 
for fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland), the committee chairman, indicated he had 
not changed his position that the Pentagon should cut the program further, 
though some members expressed support for trying to restore funding in a later 
House vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rand report, which has not yet been publicly released, says that much of 
the cargo carried to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf War was bulk cargo 
that could have been carried by commercial jetliners. The study by the Santa 
Monica think tank also asserts that the C-17 would wreck many of the airports 
where the Pentagon expects to use the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-17's weight is distributed over 12 main landing gear wheels. By 
contrast, the C-5, which is the military's other large cargo jet (now out of 
production), is easier on runways because it has 24 main wheels but a gross 
weight that is only 50% higher than that of the C-17, Rand said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gen. Ronald Fogelman, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command, 
suggested that the C-17 is not any harder on the runways than the C-5. He 
testified that the C-5 and the C-17 are in the same classification for their 
runway thickness requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 "The author of that (Rand) report ignored the operating reality of our airlift 
system," Fogelman said.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; HAND-HELD 
RADAR SHOWS CONTENTS OF WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for home improvement: a hand-held electronic device you simply wave 
against a wall to locate studs, plumbing and electrical wiring. Such a tool 
could be on the market next year, thanks to radar technology developed by Tom 
McEwan, an electronics engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Livermore, Calif., lab has licensed the technology to Zircon Inc., a 
Campbell, Calif.-based producer of electronic hand tools. Zircon is working on 
a prototype of the device, which would sell for less than $100 in 
do-it-yourself retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the device is its ability to send out extremely fast 
electrical pulses -- more than 1 million per second -- that can travel about 20 
feet through a wall. The pulses bounce off of any object behind the wall, such 
as a wooden stud or metal pipe, and "echo" back to the tool, displaying them on 
a small screen attached to the tool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a variation on standard radar, in which microwaves are used to detect 
aircraft and other objects over vast distances. 
</P>
<P>
 McEwan, who formerly worked with radar at Northrop Corp.'s defense electronics 
group, said the idea for the hand-held device stems from Lawrence Livermore's 
weapons research. The lab had developed ways of measuring similar high-speed 
electrical pulses that would come from detonating nuclear weapons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The device could have many other applications besides finding studs, McEwan 
said. Two examples: Someone installing solar heating devices on top of a house, 
or laying carpet in the living room, could use the tool to easily find the 
joists underlying either the roof or the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The battery-powered tool's electrical pulses are invisible and safe, having a 
radiation-emission level 1 million times lower than a cellular telephone's, 
McEwan said. Zircon isn't the only one trying to exploit McEwan's idea. 
Amerigon Inc. of Burbank licensed the technology from Lawrence Livermore with 
an eye toward placing radar-emitting devices on the exterior of cars, so 
drivers could be warned of any other vehicles -- or people -- behind them.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; Q & A: MITCHELL KAPOR; 
LOTUS FOUNDER WORKING TO GUARD PRIVACY IN THE ELECTRONIC AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplishments: Founded Lotus Development Corp. Co-founded the to promote 
free and open communications in the digital world. 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Bachelor's from Yale College, with interdisciplinary major in 
cybernetics. Master's in psychology from Beacon College. 
</P>
<P>
 Interests: Eastern religion, reading, mountain biking on Martha's Vineyard 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Kapor and his wife, Ellen Poss, a psychiatrist, have a young daughter 
and son. They live in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects: Kapor is developing a program for a Boston public TV station that he 
refers to as the "Wall Street Week of Cyberspace." He is also writing a book on 
democracy in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Mitchell Kapor founded a computer software company in 1982, he chose the 
name Lotus, a word representing the state of perfect enlightenment in the Hindu 
philosophy. Five years later, he left Lotus Development Corp. at least $100 
million richer. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the developer of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program mainly tries 
to enlighten government and citizenry about the enormous potential of the 
nation's electronic byways. 
</P>
<P>
 His nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, founded in 1990 with Grateful 
Dead lyricist and author John Perry Barlow, seeks to safeguard the right of 
free speech and other civil liberties of on-line Americans. Kapor is also a 
member of the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council, helping the 
Clinton Administration design its information superhighway policy. 
</P>
<P>
 We caught up with Kapor recently in San Jose at the 1994 Computer Bowl 
All-Star Game, a "technical IQ" fund-raiser for Boston's Computer Museum, Kapor 
led an East Coast squad that out-nerded the West Coast team, featuring the 
likes of Microsoft's Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your worst fear about the information superhighway? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the only things you could get were reruns of everything ever produced in 
Hollywood and the home shopping channels selling the full range of fake gems -- 
that would be a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your greatest hope? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That we wind up with a network that reaches out to include virtually 
everyone in the society and that is highly participatory, in which people are 
not simply passive recipients of prepackaged information, but are engaged in a 
wide variety of activities, from education to entertainment to recreation to 
commerce. A system which can help revitalize the democratic process by 
encouraging more citizen participation, a network which stimulates information 
entrepreneurship and innovation, something which really restores the balance of 
power in a way that puts more power in the hands of individuals and less power 
in large, centralized institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are said to be an admirer of the principles of Thomas Jefferson. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I find his political philosophy to be a major inspiration. He was not only 
the champion of liberty as the principal author of the Bill of Rights, he was a 
tremendous believer in decentralization of government, of putting control at 
the local level and letting individuals and communities shape their own 
destiny. I think there's an opportunity with networks like the Internet, as 
they evolve and grow up, to put into practice a lot of the Jeffersonian 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Yet the Administration is perhaps not cooperating as fully as some might 
have hoped? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that the Administration really has a large vision for the National 
Information Infrastructure which is, on the whole, compatible with the kinds of 
things we've been talking about here. There are huge difficulties in crafting 
legislation which can get us out of the current morass and into this new 
regime. Where there are disagreements with the Administration, it's on issues 
of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is privacy the Electronic Frontier Foundation's biggest concern? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is certainly on EFF's short list of issues, because there are major 
controversies, in that the federal government wants to impose certain systems 
that would benefit national security purposes and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The so-called Clipper Chip would allow the FBI and other agencies to tap 
into new digital communication networks. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It would have an unjustified effect on personal privacy and communications 
forever. I was thinking about this after President Nixon's death. People who 
came of age during and lived through Watergate have an appreciation why there 
are separations of powers between different branches of government and why the 
framers of the Constitution limited the power of government: Because they knew 
people are fallible and periodically will get governments that dramatically and 
systematically commit major abuses of power. At the same time, I absolutely 
believe there are legitimate national security and law enforcement issues. I 
don't want to see the hands of government unnecessarily tied, but I feel the 
rights of the individual to privacy are sufficiently important that we need a 
more public discussion on initiatives like Clipper Chip. We just can't swallow 
it when they say this is the right solution and we have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The commercialization of the Internet seems inevitable. Is somebody going 
to want to manage this creature? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm sure there are going to be various kinds of demands for more controls. 
Heavy-handed attempts to take it over or to impose some sort of new code are 
going to fail, because people won't go for it. My hope is that people can for 
the most part work things out on a voluntary, cooperative basis through 
agreements that don't require a dysfunctional bureaucracy. That has certainly 
been the tradition and the spirit of the Internet. Whether it survives is 
really the challenge.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; MICROSOFT UNVEILS 
SOFTWARE FOR INTERACTIVE VIDEO USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. unveiled a computer program code-named Tiger on Tuesday, 
calling it the first major element in its strategic thrust into the emerging 
world of interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger, which relies on low-cost personal computer hardware to deliver audio 
and video information, will compete with more expensive offerings by companies 
such as IBM and Oracle, whose software depends on larger and costlier 
computers. Microsoft's goal is to become a dominant supplier of software for 
video servers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said Microsoft's offering, which may not be available in its 
fully configured form for years, could prove to be a paper tiger, another 
example of Microsoft's well-known strategy of announcing products long before 
they are available. Critics said the announcement could be designed to dissuade 
customers from buying a competing product that is already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the stakes are high. The market for such video servers is expected 
to grow from just $50 million this year to anywhere from $1 billion to $5 
billion by 1998, depending on how fast cable and telephone companies roll out 
their promised interactive systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hotel conference room, Microsoft demonstrated how a single $2,000 Compaq 
computer outfitted with Tiger could simultaneously send different movies to 16 
television monitors, each of which could be fast-forwarded or reversed. Craig 
Mundie, vice president of advanced consumer technology at Microsoft, said the 
same computer could "easily support 100 video streams," a claim that brought 
looks of disbelief from some engineers in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 A key obstacle in the spread of interactive television has been the high cost 
of video servers. Most of those used in ongoing trials cost nearly $3,000 per 
subscriber. Microsoft's claims suggest costs dramatically lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger will be tested in Seattle beginning next year, with full-scale 
deployment in 1996. A fault-tolerant, "self-healing" function in the system 
will give it the reliability necessary for large-scale systems, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft said Tiger will be available from Intel and Compaq later this year. 
But the company concedes that early systems will be used for lower-end 
applications such as hotel video services. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics suggested Microsoft may have been premature in its announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever something new comes out, they say they will come out with their own 
product soon," said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Partners' industry 
newsletters. "A little cage rattling can chill the market for competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 But competitors aren't shaking in their boots. "They have a long way to go 
from their roots (in personal computers) to providing everything that is 
necessary" for large-scale interactive television, said Jerry Held, senior vice 
president for Interactive Multimedia Products at Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Oracle, whose system is being used by British Telecom and will be tested by 
Bell Atlantic and U.S. West, announced Tuesday that its software is available 
on Hewlett-Packard video servers, as well as its own parallel computer systems.

 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams proposed sweeping changes Tuesday 
in his department's handling of sexual harassment and discrimination 
complaints, while sources said his subordinates are working behind the scenes 
to transfer a number of sergeants, detectives and other officers out of the 
West Los Angeles police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sergeants have been transferred out of West Los Angeles recently, said 
Capt. Robert Kurth, the commanding officer of that station. The transfers, 
which sources said may eventually involve detectives and officers of other 
ranks, are not intended to punish the officers but are an attempt to improve 
the working environment of a police station with a long -- though disputed -- 
reputation for hostility toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has generally declined to comment on developments at the West Los 
Angeles station and did not mention the transfers in his report Tuesday to the 
Police Commission. Instead, the report highlighted a number of proposed LAPD 
reforms, most notably creation of a specialized unit to investigate all 
harassment and discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of such a unit has been eagerly sought by some women's advocates, but 
reaction to Williams' proposal was mixed, largely because many proponents of 
the concept hoped that the group would report directly to the Police 
Commission, rather than through the LAPD chain of command, as Williams 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission President Gary Greenebaum, who referred the chief's proposal to a 
committee, said he was gratified by the chief's recommendations, which he 
described as "generally on the right track," but added that he was inclined to 
favor having the unit report to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my sense that people who have complaints do not feel comfortable working 
through the department because there's a sense of reprisal," Greenebaum said. 
"When I hear over and over again the same fears and the same concerns it makes 
me feel that (complaints) ought to come through us." 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, if approved by the commission during the coming weeks, would be 
"responsible for receiving and investigating all complaints dealing with 
discrimination based on ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation," Williams said 
in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit would be part of a newly configured Equal Employment Opportunity 
Division, which also would be charged with providing employee counseling and 
with coordinating harassment, bias and discrimination training. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present system, some harassment and discrimination complaints are 
handled by Internal Affairs, while others are investigated by the Employee 
Opportunity and Development Division, the Women's Coordinator or the 
complainant's commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This diluted process has caused confusion for the employees of this 
organization and implies to employees and people who examine the department 
from the outside that there is not a concerted effort to quickly and concisely 
prepare resolutions to these complaints," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the creation of the new complaint unit, Williams outlined 
several other proposals for combatting harassment and discrimination. The chief 
wants every LAPD officer to receive special harassment training, and he pledged 
to forward to the commission a timeline to assure that the training is 
delivered promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not enough to simply reorganize and respond to complaints of our 
employees," Williams said. "We must also ensure that all the current and future 
members of the department receive training to ensure that they fully understand 
the policies and procedures relating to discriminatory behavior in the areas of 
ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that training, every officer will receive a packet of material on 
sexual harassment and discrimination, Williams said. Some critics warned that 
repackaging the department's current harassment and discrimination material is 
not enough. They said the LAPD should instead revisit those materials and draft 
better ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bow to the City Council's Personnel Committee, the chief said he also has 
ordered that every departing LAPD employee be questioned about harassment, 
gender bias and other forms of discrimination. Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, 
who chairs the Personnel Committee, had asked that discrimination and 
harassment questions be posed as part of the exit interview process. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's recommendations come in the midst of a shuffle at the West Los 
Angeles station, as a few longstanding officers there are being asked to take 
positions elsewhere in the department. Kurth, the commanding officer, stressed 
that the officers who are moving are not accused of any wrongdoing and said 
that such transfers are encouraged to "recharge the batteries" of employees who 
have been in their assignments longer than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles station has been the subject of a long-running internal 
LAPD audit into the working conditions there, particularly with respect to 
sexual harassment, though allegations of racism also are being addressed. 
Although some elements of that audit still are under way, it has sparked a 
number of changes. At least two officers are under investigation, and 
disciplinary action could be brought against them or others. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers and the proposed LAPD reorganization come after news reports and 
City Council hearings this spring that detailed the problem of sexual 
harassment in the LAPD ranks. The department's responses represent its most 
sweeping efforts to root out that problem, but they fall short of changes that 
some women's advocates had proposed and they were greeted with guarded 
enthusiasm Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," said Katherine Spillar, national 
coordinator for the Feminist Majority and co-chairwoman of the Women's Advisory 
Council to the Los Angeles Police Commission. "It's not enough. It's something 
that we would never have seen under the previous chief or the previous police 
administration, but it's still not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Sobel, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who will announce today 
the filing of a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit against the LAPD, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say that all of us . . . are pleased that there are some 
affirmative steps toward dealing with this problem," she said. "But there's 
enormous concern that this piecemeal approach does not cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention Tuesday was focused on the chief's proposal for the new 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the division would be located outside police headquarters, a move 
Williams said "should reduce the stress that some of our employees currently 
express about entering Parker Center to express a concern about their peers, 
supervisors or managers." 
</P>
<P>
 That and other changes were sought by women's advocates during a series of 
Personnel Committee hearings in March and April. But some women's advocates 
worried that the new unit's effectiveness would be undermined if it is staffed 
by police officers and required to report through the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need an independent, civilian-staffed unit that reports directly to the 
Police Commission," Spillar said. "That's the only way to insure that this unit 
can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, however, department insiders had questioned whether the chief 
would be willing to turn over such a sensitive function to a civilian unit, 
particularly because personnel issues are involved. The LAPD traditionally does 
not release personnel information except in rare circumstances, such as when it 
surfaces in matters that go before police disciplinary boards.

<P>
 There was no revolution, no totalitarian takeover, no war bringing the 
collapse of worldwide democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But by an invention here and a new computer application there, American 
culture is nearing the point forewarned by those who feared technology could 
breed a new kind of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are potentially under surveillance -- watched, videotaped and 
digitally monitored -- for most of their waking hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't necessarily the government doing the watching. Often it is employers, 
doctors, insurers and merchants -- seeking security or gathering information in 
an invisible universe of mostly unregulated databases, the memory bank of the 
electronic culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct marketers have "master files" that include half the U.S. population 
categorized by intimate details. Anyone can subscribe to databases such as 
Sleuth, Asset Locator and People Finder. They sound like video games, but they 
have a very serious purpose: Through them, you can learn of people's real 
estate holdings, the value of their homes, their children's ages, even their 
neighbors' phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology offers people and institutions efficiency and security. 
</P>
<P>
 But some worry that it could prove to be too much of a good thing. The 
widening electronic culture is bringing new pressure to bear on individualism 
and privacy. And as the nation accelerates onto the information superhighway, 
what is the effect of all the rattling machinery on people's behavior, 
creativity and peace? 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine an absolutely ordinary day. You commute to work on the freeway, stash 
the car in a parking garage and spend the morning at the office on the phone 
and computer. At lunch you get cash from an automated teller machine. After 
work you use a credit card at a department store, then stop at the supermarket. 
At home you call an 800 number and perhaps even order something from a 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 At each step, you may be under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of freeways have cameras to catch speeders, and soon many of 
the nation's tollbooths will electronically read which cars are driving by. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parking garages also have video cameras for security. So do ATMs, 
supermarkets and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 At work, employers can monitor every phone call and computer keystroke you 
make -- the software to do this is available at any store -- and it is 
completely legal. (Technology also allows employers to get detailed information 
from your insurers and your doctors.) 
</P>
<P>
 Store and credit card receipts give companies detailed information on your 
buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount club at the supermarket does more than save you money. Through 
your computerized membership card, your grocer can build a dossier on you, 
itemizing what you buy and how often. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, digital technology records every phone call you make, increasingly a 
source for investigators and lawyers fishing for data about the targets of 
their clients' lawsuits. Shopping by phone gives merchants and manufacturers 
still more information. 
</P>
<P>
 And the trend will only intensify. Soon, for example, cable carriers will know 
not only what programs you watch but also what you read on interactive 
television sets. Once the TV cable becomes the conduit for most of our 
entertainment, shopping and financial transactions, it will also be an 
accessible storehouse of information about our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 How much surveillance goes on and how it is used is difficult to know 
precisely. But given the modest limitations imposed by law, scholars say the 
potential for abuse is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 And what some experts find most discomforting is that so much highly personal 
data is being accumulated by private companies that have almost no restrictions 
on what they can do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only rules which limit the use of the most personal information by direct 
marketers are the rules which the marketers voluntarily choose to follow," Mary 
J. Culnan, an associate professor at the Georgetown University School of 
Business in Washington, testified earlier this year to a government task force. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Colorado sociologist Gary T. Marx worries about a less apparent 
problem: 
</P>
<P>
 "On a broad social scale, what does the presence of cameras and all these 
other things do to people's behavior?" 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they are doing is helping to stop crime. A man was convicted of 
murder recently in Rochester, N.Y., because the computer at the convenience 
store where he claimed to be shopping during the crime obliterated his alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology also means that much of life is becoming less secure. A leading 
private investigator tells the story of a prominent high-technology company 
that discovered that, during a company party, someone from outside had dialed 
into the firm's computers by modem, locked the company out of its own machines 
and downloaded the plans for the company's next generation of software. 
</P>
<P>
 The e-mail manager at Epson computers in California was fired in 1990 because 
she wanted to let employees know the company was reading their private messages 
-- and she lost in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to think about . . . how many people you gave your credit card 
number to by reading over your cellular phone," said John B. Gage, director of 
the science office at Sun Microsystems Inc. in Mountain View. Cellular phones 
are so vulnerable that Gage estimated that perhaps 60% of the cellular calls in 
Silicon Valley are being taped. 
</P>
<P>
 Information technology is turning the business of private investigation topsy 
turvy. The job that was once the preserve of gumshoes like Philip Marlowe, 
whose assets were their charm, fists and gun, now falls in the province of 
mouses and modems. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Information America, a commonly available commercial database, anyone 
can plug into People Finder and find the phone number, address, dwelling type, 
estimated age and average income of 70 million Americans and 10 million 
businesses, not to mention the average price of a house in every neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Skip Tracer can find people who are on the move by combing 
change-of-address records from the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 A database called Assets has property records for people nearly everywhere in 
the country. The Lawsuit databank offers court records. Other databases hold 
records on bankruptcies, liens, births and deaths, high school and college 
listings, wedding announcements and more. Any information is available within 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the congressional General Accounting Office reported there were 910 
federal databanks containing health, financial, Social Security and other 
personal information around the country; many of them were shared with 
corporations and commercial databanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroll Associates, the nation's largest private investigation firm, has access 
to 700 on-line databases. That makes Kroll the largest subscriber outside the 
U.S. government, according to managing partner Alan Brill. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency used its computer skills to track down Ferdinand E. Marcos' 
worldwide financial holdings, plus those of Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier of 
Haiti and Saddam Hussein's Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 A dizzying array of information is available to the direct marketing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Direct Marketing List Source, a massive catalogue that marketers use to 
buy mailing lists, offers 12,000 categories of lists for sale -- everything 
from "born-again doctors who donate" to "Bill Moyers' Journal transcript 
buyers" to the 750,000 people who called TV's "The Jessica Hahn Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, direct marketing firms can compile these various 
sources into super lists, or "master files." 
</P>
<P>
 The P cle Financial Markets list -- sold by the "target marketing" subsidiary 
of TRW, the giant credit bureau -- contains 87 million households segmented by 
the head of household's age, weight, height, ethnicity, net worth and financial 
behavior, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The Behavior Bank divides 28 million U.S. households by 100 lifestyle 
categories such as the types of investments people have, their hobbies and the 
kinds of vacations they take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most consumers think of catalogues," said Lorna Christi, a spokeswoman for 
the Direct Marketing Assn. "But there are very few major corporations today 
that don't do direct marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Direct marketing accounts for $350 billion in sales annually, and 54% of adult 
Americans, or 111 million consumers, shop this way, Christi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association, which has 3,600 member firms, has an ethical code and a 
"guide to effective self-regulatory action." But the guidelines are necessarily 
vague: 
</P>
<P>
 "Direct marketers should be sensitive to the issue of consumer privacy and 
should limit the combination, collection, rental, sale, exchange and use of 
consumer data to only those data which are appropriate for direct-marketing 
purposes," the group's 13-page pamphlet on "Ethical Business Practices" reads. 
</P>
<P>
 The association can recommend referring members found to be in violation of 
the code to its ethics group, or it can suspend their membership. In the last 
year, Christi said, the group has referred two members and suspended one. 
</P>
<P>
 Some privacy advocates wonder whether self-regulation is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Smith, an assistant professor at Georgetown University's Graduate School 
of Business, has written what some experts call the most thorough analysis of 
corporate America's approach to privacy. "Managing Privacy: Information 
Technology and Corporate America" is a soon-to-be-published study of how banks, 
insurance companies and credit card firms process medical, financial and 
consumer data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost without exception, when it comes to privacy, companies are reactive," 
Smith said. "They drift along and make policy only when some crisis occurs. It 
could be a consumer backlash or a legal challenge, but at that point they react 
with task forces and committees and they create policies." 
</P>
<P>
 What most concerns the handful of privacy experts around the country is that 
legislative policy-making is just as haphazard and reactive. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies can sell data about what products people buy, where they vacation 
and where they invest. But disclosing what videos people rent was made illegal 
after the rentals of Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork were made public 
during his unsuccessful 1987 confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In roughly 20 states, drivers' license records are public information. This is 
how direct marketers can know how tall people are, how much they weigh, whether 
they wear glasses and, in many states, what their Social Security numbers are. 
</P>
<P>
 Political activists use these lists as well. In his book "Closed: 99 Ways to 
Stop Abortion," anti-abortion advocate Joseph Scheidler urged fellow activists 
to write down the license-plate numbers of cars parked at abortion clinics, get 
the names and addresses of the owners from the state motor vehicles department 
and then picket their homes and deluge them with mail. 
</P>
<P>
 California stopped selling its motor vehicle records after a stalker used them 
to find and murder actress Rebecca Schaeffer in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many legitimate uses for this information. If driving records were 
private, for instance, school bus firms might not be able to check the driving 
records of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 But policy toward what should be available and what should not is all but 
nonexistent, privacy advocates say. In Europe, by contrast, there are laws that 
precisely detail how the technology can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some extent, we are first in technology and last in privacy," said Marc 
Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. data protection board with advisory powers was proposed in Congress in 
1991, but has not materialized. And other legislation to deal with monitoring 
at the workplace has been stalled in Congress for years. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), for example, would require 
employers to disclose in advance that workers might be monitored, that the 
monitoring would be for business purposes only and that certain places, such as 
restrooms, would be off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the home is another area of concern. When the age of interactive 
television arrives in perhaps five years, what policy should there be governing 
how data on viewing or shopping habits can be used? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question to which scholars, public policy-makers and businesses have 
given little thought. 
</P>
<P>
 As Marx at the University of Colorado laments: "There hasn't been a lot of 
careful research into the social implications of all this." Always Under Watch: 
A Day in the Life... 
</P>
<P>
 Whether by video camera or computer, surveillance techniques may threaten your 
privacy. Here are some of the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 1) THE COMMUTE: Cameras on freeways catch a driver speeding to work. 
</P>
<P>
 2) AT WORK: Parking garage video camera can note a worker's arrival time, 
companions in auto. 
</P>
<P>
 3) WORKSTATION: Employers can monitor computer messages and other electronic 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 4) AT LUNCH: A diner's credit card scan shows restaurant and bill. 
</P>
<P>
 5) AFTER-WORK ERRAND: ATM camera and computer records transaction. Credit card 
used at store shows where consumer shopped, what you bought. 
</P>
<P>
 6) DRIVE HOME: Toll booth scanner records when auto passed. 
</P>
<P>
 7) IN THE HOUSE: Shopping by phone gives companies information on tastes and 
lifestyle.

U.S. VOWS MAJOR CUT IN HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros unveiled a new 
federal effort to combat homelessness Tuesday and pledged that the Clinton 
Administration will reduce the number of homeless Americans by one-third before 
the end of its first term. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report by Cisneros' department that was a year in the making, the 
Administration contended that on any night, 600,000 of the nation's people are 
among the ranks of the homeless and that 7 million people were without a 
permanent residence at some point between 1985 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration vowed in its report to take a new approach to the problem 
by giving local governments more responsibility for creating comprehensive 
programs designed to establish emergency housing and to treat substance abuse, 
mental illness and other problems believed to be at the root of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's release Tuesday coincided with the Administration's attempts to 
push legislation for a variety of programs through Congress and was designed to 
help defend its proposal to double federal funding for homelessness programs to 
$1.7 billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates applauded the report as the first federal acknowledgment of 
the extent and complexity of homelessness in the United States. But they 
cautioned that even the resources being contemplated by the Clinton 
Administration would be dwarfed by the need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doomed to disappoint because for the first time the federal government 
understands the problem and because of political reasons it cannot respond at 
the level necessary," said Fred Karnas, executive director of the National 
Coalition for the Homeless, which represents homeless advocates in 40 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, Ky., Mayor Jerry Abramson, president of the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors, said that the report marks the first time the White House has responded 
to the mounting demand for services for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year we appealed to the federal government to intervene, to help cities 
and service providers keep pace with the alarming growth of the problem," 
Abramson said. "The response during those years came largely from Capitol Hill, 
not the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the federal government has granted money on a competitive basis 
to nonprofit organizations with the expectation that they would provide 
emergency shelter and services to the homeless. But the Administration argues 
that the problem is too intractable to be alleviated in such piecemeal fashion 
and must be addressed through coordinated, comprehensive public policy headed 
by local government with guidance from federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 While responses will certainly vary from city to city, depending on the extent 
of the problem, each would be expected to use the federal funds to provide: 
</P>
<P>
 * Emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transitional and rehabilitative services, including substance abuse 
treatment, short-term mental health services and independent living skills 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permanent affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This comprehensive approach to homelessness should be instituted and 
coordinated by localities," the report says. "Unlike not-for-profit providers, 
the locality can view the entire system in the jurisdiction to ensure that 
transitions from each stage can be smooth. Unlike the federal government, the 
locality is intimately familiar with the needs of its neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been working with the District of Columbia -- the first 
municipality awarded a special $20-million grant to create a model approach to 
homelessness -- since soon after President Clinton took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, the second winner of a pilot grant, is drafting its final 
proposal on how it will use the $20 million it is scheduled to receive. Other 
cities qualifying for pilot programs have yet to be announced.

GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY OPENS 3 WEEKS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beneath gray skies that could not dampen the relief of commuters and truckers 
across California, the Golden State Freeway partially reopened Tuesday over 
Gavin Canyon in northern Los Angeles County, exactly four months after two 
80-foot-high bridges collapsed in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A raincoat-wrapped Gov. Pete Wilson and local dignitaries heralded the early 
reconstruction of the freeway, the commercial lifeline between Southern 
California and the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to celebrate the latest victory in California's victory march in 
the wake of the Northridge earthquake," Wilson said of the freeway's reopening 
three weeks ahead of schedule. "This effort is going to put California, 
specifically the Los Angeles area, back on the fast lane to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials and the California Trucking Assn. have estimated that the 
closure of the Golden State Freeway cost the region about $550,000 in lost 
commerce per day. So perhaps it was fitting that the first vehicles to navigate 
the new bridges -- behind California Highway Patrol squad cars with flashing 
lights -- were tractor-trailers with Viking Freight System, one of California's 
largest intrastate carrier of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys just want to get from Point A to Point B and see their families, 
so this is a big thing," Senior Vice President Terry Shambaugh said from 
company headquarters in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opened four restored southbound lanes at 2:30 p.m., flashing a 
thumbs-up sign at dozens of honking and whooping motorists who had resigned 
themselves to long backups on the Old Road detour around the downed freeway in 
Newhall. The four northbound lanes are scheduled to be opened sometime before 
noon today after the contractor moves the detour, which has carried the bulk of 
freeway traffic since Caltrans opened it Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 30 minutes of the removal of the road barriers, the Golden State 
returned to its old ways. Traffic slowed to 25 m.p.h. The freeway carried an 
average of 135,000 vehicles a day before the quake. The detour averaged 88,000 
vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials had expected to begin putting the freeway back in business 
today. But consultations with the governor's office and the contractor late 
Monday night pushed the date up to Tuesday afternoon, sending officials 
scrambling to cobble together an opening ceremony complete with balloons and 
caterer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized the contractor would be ready earlier than we thought," said 
Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels, "so we got on the phone and said, 
'We can't wait any longer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction of the twin Gavin Canyon spans caps 3 1/2 months of 
round-the-clock work by Riverside-based E. L. Yeager Construction Co., which 
will harvest a bonus of about $4.5 million for finishing the project ahead of 
the planned June 8 date. The original contract was worth $14.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the financial incentives -- including an extra $14.5 million awarded 
to the company that rebuilt the shattered Santa Monica Freeway -- have come 
under recent criticism, Wilson said the expense was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's money well-spent," he said. "It's the kind of thing the private sector 
does routinely." 
</P>
<P>
 Repair of the Santa Monica Freeway -- the world's busiest -- was completed by 
April, but Caltrans District Director Jerry Baxter, who oversees Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties, said restoration of Interstate 5 was also a high priority 
because of its economic significance and the lack of surface street 
alternatives through the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind this was probably the most important bridge," Baxter said. "With 
the Santa Monica, we had alternate routes. (With the Golden State Freeway) we 
had no alternate routes. This is the major commerce connection with Central and 
Northern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the I-5 was more arduous and complex than reconstructing the Santa 
Monica Freeway, Caltrans officials said. The overpasses rise four times higher 
over the ground than the 20-foot bridges on the Santa Monica. Greater 
inaccessibility to supply trucks and adverse weather conditions in the windy 
pass also made the job more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials credited a cooperative contractor, streamlined bidding and 
permitting processes and an effective partnership between federal, state and 
local agencies with speeding work along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a miracle," said Jacques Yeager, chairman of the contracting firm 
that devoted 200 employees -- three times the normal number -- to the repair 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening Tuesday, there was none of the political sniping that was an 
undercurrent to last month's reopening of the Santa Monica, when some federal 
officials privately complained that Wilson hogged the credit for a project paid 
for with federal money. In fact, Wilson and Rodney Slater of the Federal 
Highway Administration remarked pointedly on the good working relationship 
among all parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
 However, state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who was invited but did 
not attend Tuesday's ceremony, accused Wilson of trying to reap the most 
political capital from the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ongoing process for the governor to maximize the political benefit of 
a freeway opening, even if there were a lot of other people involved in the 
rebuilding," Katz said in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gavin Canyon bridges should be completely open to traffic by the 
end of today, construction is ongoing on the interchange between the Golden 
State and the Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said work had fallen behind after the contractor ran into a 
concrete footing left behind after construction in 1967. But Caltrans' Baxter 
said the first phase would still be completed by the end of July, with the 
entire interchange back in operation by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the freeway forced many north county motorists to try mass 
transit for the first time. Ridership on the Metrolink commuter trains from 
Santa Clarita skyrocketed from about 1,000 to nearly 22,000 immediately after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of passengers has dropped since, with the monthly average about 
5,500 journeys a day on the Santa Clarita line. Metrolink spokesman Peter 
Hidalgo said the reopening of the freeway may clip ridership further but 
expressed hope that quake-inspired riders would remain loyal. "We've found from 
our informal on-board surveys that they're hooked," Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorena Owens is one of the newly converted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not driving if I don't have to," Owens said as she got off the train in 
Santa Clarita on Tuesday afternoon. Owens, who has been living in Acton since 
the quake ruined her Santa Clarita home, hops on the train every day in Santa 
Clarita and transfers in Sylmar to a van bound for Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd miss my car during the day, but I don't miss it at all," Owens 
said. "I come home and I'm relaxed and ready to keep going."

HALDEMAN'S DIARIES SHOW NIXON'S DARK, HUMAN SIDES; HISTORY: SECRET MEMOIR TELLS 
OF PRESIDENT'S ALTERNATE GLEE AND GUILT AT PROVOKING ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly released diaries kept by Richard Nixon's chief of staff portray the late 
President as alternately gleeful and guilt-ridden about provoking 
confrontations with Vietnam antiwar demonstrators and more scornful of blacks 
and Jews than had been reported previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The diaries secretly kept by the late H.R. Haldeman, one of Nixon's most 
trusted White House lieutenants, provide new insights into Nixon's complex 
personality. They reveal the darker side of the only U.S. President to resign 
and also illustrate his humanity, as when Haldeman reported that he wept openly 
on hearing of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's death and when the deaths 
of four students by guardsmen at Kent State University upset him. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years and three months before his Watergate-related resignation in 
April, 1973, Haldeman kept by hand, and later dictated on tapes, a daily record 
that remained a secret to all but his family. Completing a foreword for his 
diaries shortly before his death in Santa Barbara last November, Haldeman left 
it up to his wife, Jo, to decide if they should be published. 
</P>
<P>
 She subsequently worked out arrangements with G. P. Putnam's Sons Inc., which 
is publishing the Haldeman diaries this week. The document is unique because 
Haldeman's reporting is contemporaneous, said Nixon biographer Stephen E. 
Ambrose. "No other presidential chief of staff has gone to such lengths to make 
a record in anything approaching such detail," Ambrose said. 
</P>
<P>
 The diaries show Nixon torn by conflicting emotions toward young demonstrators 
protesting the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1970, shortly after Nixon widened the war by ordering the bombing of 
Viet Cong bases in neighboring Cambodia, the four students at Kent State in 
Ohio were shot and killed by National Guardsmen during a campus demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very disturbed," Haldeman recorded. "Afraid his decision set it off. . . 
. Issued condolence statement, then kept after me all the rest of the day for 
more facts. Hoping rioters had provoked the shooting but no real evidence they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1970, Nixon took joy in taunting demonstrators whom he encountered 
on a visit to San Jose, Calif. In his diary, Haldeman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted some confrontation and there were no hecklers in the hall, so we 
stalled departure a little so they could zero in outside and they sure did. 
Before getting in car, P(resident) stood up and gave the V signs, which made 
them mad. They threw rocks, flags, candles etc. as we drove out, after a 
terrifying flying wedge of cops opened up the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's low view of blacks appears both in his discussion of substantive 
issues and political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April 28, 1969, discussion of welfare reform with Haldeman and John D. 
Ehrlichman, his domestic affairs adviser, Nixon "emphasized that you have to 
face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks," Haldeman wrote. 
"The key is to devise a system that recognizes this while not appearing to." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon "pointed out that there has never in history been an adequate black 
nation and they are the only race of which this is true. Says Africa is 
hopeless, the worst there is Liberia, which we built," Haldeman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although racial or ethnic slurs occasionally are found on some of Nixon's 
White House tape recordings made public previously and while some historians 
have noted his biases, the Haldeman diaries present by far the most graphic 
examples of these attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, John H. Taylor, director of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in 
Yorba Linda, Calif., defended Nixon's statements as a reflection of his 
frustrations and said that they should be viewed "strictly in a political 
context." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 26, 1970, Nixon expressed great displeasure with American Jews for 
planning to boycott a dinner for French President Georges Pompidou in New York. 
Nixon "really raged again today against United States Jews because of their 
behavior toward Pompidou," Haldeman reported. "Has decided to postpone Jewish 
arms supply for their 'unconscionable conduct.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Haldeman also told of a Feb. 1, 1972, meeting between Nixon and evangelist 
Billy Graham in which "there was considerable discussion of the terrible 
problem arising from the total Jewish domination of the media and agreement 
that this was something that would have to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in his diaries, Haldeman noted that "Graham has the strong 
feeling that the Bible says that there are satanic Jews and that's where our 
problem arises." 
</P>
<P>
 On other topics, Haldeman comments on the well-known feud between Nixon 
National Security Adviser Henry A. Kissinger and Secretary of State William P. 
Rogers. "Actually, most of the fault in all of this is chargeable to Henry 
because of his almost psychopathic concern with everything that Rogers does," 
Haldeman wrote. "He acts like a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Biographer Ambrose, who has read the Haldeman diaries, spoke in a television 
interview Monday of "the extraordinarily bad relationship" between Kissinger 
and Rogers that Haldeman records. "We hadn't any idea of the extent of it. 
Every day Kissinger comes to Haldeman and says you've got to fire Rogers or I'm 
quitting, I'm going to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Haldeman diary entries as well as audio recordings of Nixon were 
the subject of two programs on ABC's "Nightline" television program on Monday 
and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A diary entry by Haldeman on June 18, 1972, the day after the Watergate 
break-in, bolsters evidence that Nixon had no advance knowledge of the burglary 
of Democratic National Committee headquarters. "So far the P is not aware of 
all this," Haldeman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later Haldeman wrote that White House thinking was "that we've got to 
hope the FBI doesn't go beyond what's necessary in developing evidence and that 
we can keep a lid on that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1973, Haldeman and Erhlichman resigned in an attempt to 
shield the President from the growing Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 29, 1973, as Nixon tried to convince the two to step down, Haldeman 
said that Nixon "went through his whole pitch about how he's really the guilty 
one. He said he's thought it all through and that he was the one that started 
(White House aide Charles) Colson on his projects, he was the one who told 
(White House counsel John) Dean to cover up, he was the one who made (John N.) 
Mitchell attorney general, and later his campaign manager and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 Haldeman's diaries also paint Nixon as two-faced with political opponents like 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 On July 21, 1969, shortly after a car Kennedy was driving plunged off a bridge 
on Martha's Vineyard and a woman passenger drowned, Haldeman wrote that Nixon 
"wants to set up and activate dirty tricks" against the senator. 
</P>
<P>
 But several days later, on Aug. 4, 1969, Nixon invited Kennedy into his office 
and "told him he understood how tough it was etc.," Haldeman reported. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a year later, Nixon "came up with a plan" for the White House to hire 
a private detective to follow Kennedy in Paris and take photographs of him with 
various women, in hopes it would damage him politically, Haldeman said.

HAITI'S ARMY: DOZING SOLDIERS, DECREPIT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian military has revealed its preparation for any possible U.S. armed 
intervention -- a World War II-vintage antiaircraft machine gun and a 
broken-down armored personnel carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The .30-caliber, single-barreled weapon came out of a cardboard box, with 
several parts left over. It sits in a bush across the street from the army 
general command in central Port-au-Prince and is pointed skyward to the west. A 
reporter who saw the machine gun in the shrubbery noted that two Haitian 
soldiers -- evidently the crew -- were sprawled on a park bench about five 
yards away, mouths agape and both sound asleep in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in the parking lot behind the headquarters, sat the armored personnel 
carrier, one of 10 reportedly possessed by the army. Although it hasn't moved 
in at least 2 1/2 years, it too is part of the defense system. Soldiers had 
pulled a canvas cover from a light machine gun on the vehicle's left fender. It 
was unattended but was pointed at the presidential palace on the other side of 
this capital's widest street, the Champs de Mars (Field of War). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's about it," a European military expert here said. The Haitian 
military leaders "think they have to make some public display, and a couple of 
aging and probably inoperative guns is about what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The weaponry symbolizes the general state of the army, a collection of 7,000 
uniformed soldiers and police whose only battle experience has been the killing 
and intimidation of the local populace. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are expert at shooting up civilian neighborhoods in the dark and 
at kidnaping and killing unarmed people," one diplomat said. "But they haven't 
a clue about real fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 The military's most successful recent endeavor was the September, 1991, bloody 
overthrow of Haiti's first freely elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He 
angered the army and its civilian allies by threatening to limit corruption and 
restrict the power of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 That coup sent Haiti into collapse with severe international economic 
sanctions, the isolation of the country, the destruction of its political 
institutions and the beggaring of what was already the poorest nation in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 A major aim of the United States and the United Nations here has been a total 
restructuring of the army, cutting its size, removing key officers and creating 
a separate and civilian-controlled police force. 
</P>
<P>
 As things now stand, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras -- who recently promoted himself to 
the rank of army commander in chief -- Chief of Staff Gen. Philippe Biamby and 
police commander Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois have until Saturday to resign 
and leave the country or face possible military intervention by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers as well as their civilian stooges have said they won't go. Cedras 
has promised resistance and ordered his men to prepare themselves for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 But what exactly does this mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers here are armed, more or less, with Israeli-designed Galil assault 
rifles, assorted pistols and a hodgepodge of other guns, some dating from the 
single-shot days of World War I. The air force has no planes, the navy no 
ships. The armored force consists of about 10 armored personnel carriers, only 
two or three of which have ever been seen in operation. Most sit in bases, 
unable to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras has a foreign military adviser, a former Royal Canadian Air Force jet 
pilot named Lynn Garrison, who once also operated an art gallery in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 But his influence seems to have diminished in recent days, perhaps because of 
his off-the-record criticism of Cedras to foreign reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Haitian army is a vague descendant of a military force created by 
U.S. Marines during a 14-year U.S. occupation. Instead of the force that was 
intended to patrol the border, run customs posts and build roads, the army 
quickly deteriorated into a ragtag collection of competing officers more 
interested in seizing political power and stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost obliterated during the time of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, the 
brutal dictator who dismantled much of the army, closed its officers academy 
and created a private security force, popularly known as the Tontons Macoutes. 
After his death in 1971, the army was reconstituted, again more as a 
political-criminal enterprise than a professional force. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any members of the army -- officers or enlisted men -- would fight if 
the United States landed a force here is widely doubted. "One theory, the one I 
subscribe to," said the foreign military expert, "is that they will throw off 
their uniforms at the first sign of a military move against them and run for 
the hills." 
</P>
<P>
 There is another theory, one put forth by a civilian supporter of the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The military, this source said, "will simply sit in their barracks with their 
arms folded and let the Americans take them. Then, when Aristide comes back and 
everything breaks loose in the streets, the Americans will have two choices -- 
either start shooting civilians or ask the army to restore order."

FED PUSHES UP 2 KEY INTEREST RATES, SIGNALS END TO INCREASES; ECONOMY: 
HALF-POINT HIKE IS DOUBLE THE SIZE OF BOOSTS AGENCY MADE EARLIER THIS YEAR IN 
EFFORT TO STAVE OFF INFLATION. WHITE HOUSE IS RELIEVED AND WALL STREET REACTS 
WITH BUYING SPREE.

<P>
 The Federal Reserve, in its most aggressive inflation-fighting action of the 
year, raised short-term interest rates Tuesday by half a percentage point, then 
signaled its intent to hold off on additional hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual public statement suggesting the future direction of interest 
rates, the Fed indicated that Tuesday's large rate hike -- double the size of 
its moves earlier in the year -- might be the last it imposes for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials moved to raise two benchmark interest rates underlying the rates 
charged by banks and other lenders for short-term loans. The federal funds rate 
was boosted to 4.25% from 3.75%, and the Fed's discount rate was increased to 
3.5% from 3% -- the first discount rate increase in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These actions . . . substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation 
which prevailed throughout 1993," the Fed said in a statement issued at the end 
of a closed-door meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, a policy-setting 
panel composed of Fed governing board members and regional bank presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual statement, which indicates that the Fed does not see an immediate 
need for further rate hikes, was greeted with relief at the White House and 
celebrated with a buying frenzy on Wall Street. Administration officials were 
anxious that the Fed's efforts to squelch future inflation might spoil the 
economic recovery, and bond and stock traders feared that a continuing series 
of rate hikes would cause the markets to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an A-plus statement," one senior Administration official said. "It 
takes a weight off of our shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration has steadfastly refused to criticize the Federal 
Reserve since the central bank began boosting rates in February, senior aides 
said President Clinton had become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about 
rising interest rates. Tuesday's statement should ease those concerns, 
Administration officials suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Fed's announcement, Clinton sought to dismiss worries that the 
Fed's actions might dampen the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every confidence that we're still going to have another good year this 
year and that we will be able to offset any modest increase in interest rates 
with increased growth," Clinton told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's increase in the discount rate, the rate the Federal Reserve charges 
banks for short-term borrowings, was the first since Feb. 24, 1989. The federal 
funds rate, an overnight lending rate that banks charge each other, stood at 3% 
before the Fed raised it for the first time in five years on Feb. 4. The 
initial quarter-point increase was followed by identical moves in March and 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 One White House source said the Fed's recent rate hikes have created sharp 
divisions within the Administration. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, in 
particular, has been highly critical of the central bank's anti-inflation 
crusade because of its potential dampening effect on the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The midafternoon announcement sparked a dramatic rally in the closing hours of 
the nation's financial markets. In the bond market, where many investors had 
expected the Fed to continue ratcheting short-term rates up for the next few 
months, long-term interest rates began to fall. The decline suggests that the 
market had exaggerated its fears about inflation and the prospect that 
short-term rates were headed ever higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got a statement that tells the markets that the Fed is done, at 
least for the summer," said Alan Levenson, an economist at UBS Securities in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hopeful thing about what happened Tuesday is the lowering of long-term 
rates as a result of the Fed's statement," said Thomas Thompson, president of 
the National Assn. of Home Builders. The trade group has been an outspoken 
critic of the Fed's interest rate increases because of their impact on mortgage 
rates and home sales. 
</P>
<P>
 While long-term interest rates eased, short-term rates rose in tandem with the 
Fed hike. Major commercial banks, led by Citicorp, moved immediately to take 
advantage of the Fed's action by increasing their prime lending rates half a 
percentage point to 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest rate increase, the fourth by the Fed since February, came in the 
face of growing opposition within Congress and criticism by outside analysts 
who questioned the need for a tough anti-inflation campaign at a time when 
there is little evidence of rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, for instance, California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer 
and Dianne Feinstein, sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
complaining about the impact of interest rate increases on the California 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), the Fed's fiercest critic in Congress, chided the Fed and the 
nation's banks for their actions Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed couldn't resist an irrational impulse to raise interest rates and the 
banks couldn't wait to use the excuse to instantly raise their prime rates, 
though their spread is the fattest ever," said Gonzalez, referring to the 
difference between the rates that banks charge borrowers and pay to depositors. 
Gonzalez is sponsoring legislation to reduce the Fed's independence by 
increasing oversight by the President and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics who argue that the Fed is putting its foot on the brakes before the 
economic recovery gathers real momentum can point to plenty of recent evidence 
that inflation is not a threat. Economic growth seems to be moderating after an 
initial spurt last winter, and the latest government reports show few signs of 
surging prices. Last week, the government reported that consumer prices rose 
just 0.1% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenspan and other officials of the central bank argue that they have 
been raising rates not because inflation is visible today, but to keep 
inflation at bay in the months and years ahead.

<P>
 * Major U.S. banks hiked prime lending rates by 0.5 percentage point to 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Borrowing costs are expected to rise on short-term consumer and business 
loans; rates on mortgages and other long-term loans could fall if inflation 
fears ebb.

CHRISTOPHER IN JERICHO, SAYS HE'S THRILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greeted by a sea of freshly sewn Palestinian flags and saluted by an honor 
guard of Palestine Liberation Organization soldiers, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher visited the first West Bank town from which Israel has withdrawn on 
Tuesday and hailed its peaceful transfer of power as a model for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am . . . thrilled to be here," the usually taciturn Christopher said 
effusively as he met with Palestinian leaders at the police headquarters that 
Israel handed over to the PLO on Friday. "We have been talking about seeing 
things happen on the ground for such a long time, to see it translated into 
reality . . . is a tremendous thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal rides on how this is worked out," he said, sitting beneath a 
newly installed oil portrait of a beaming Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman. "I 
am very impressed to see the degree to which this has been managed with skill 
and efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, the most prominent leader among the Palestinians of Jerusalem 
and the West Bank, lost no time in asserting that Christopher's visit was a 
boost for PLO hopes of establishing an independent state. "I would like to 
welcome the secretary of state to Jericho -- the first step in building our 
state of the future," he said as Christopher listened impassively. 
</P>
<P>
 Husseini said the Palestinians were determined to "implement a real peace . . 
. where all the people of the area can live together in peace and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the conference room where they met, the new Palestinian 
state-in-testing was already visible. American security agents mingled with 
grizzled PLO soldiers just arrived from Iraq, Russian-made AK-47 rifles at 
their sides. A troop of Palestinian boy scouts in khaki uniforms and red 
kerchiefs paraded to a ragged beat of drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't help but think what they could have been doing under other 
circumstances," Christopher said later, referring to the rock-throwing youths 
of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This visit is an important political signal to the world," said Capt. Anwar 
Tanireh, 35, a physician in the PLO medical corps, who arrived from Baghdad on 
Friday as part of the new security force. "This helps put the Palestinian 
governing authority solidly in place." 
</P>
<P>
 On his left shoulder were new insignia: a black patch reading "National 
Security Force" over a bright enameled coat of arms proclaiming simply: 
"Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
 The roughly 500 soldiers came to Jericho under the Israeli-Palestinian pact 
signed May 4, under which Israel agreed to give the Gaza Strip and 24 square 
miles around Jericho to a Palestinian Authority, as an experiment before 
handing over more of the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, one senior U.S. official said, was "the first time in their entire 
history that Palestinians have governed themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks from Christopher's meeting, Palestinians from all over the West 
Bank flooded through the ancient oasis town -- the world's oldest continuously 
inhabited human settlement -- to take a look at what may be the government of 
their future. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought PLO flags hawked by street vendors, gawked at two huge portraits 
of Arafat spray-painted on the front of the City Hall and photographed each 
other in front of a freshly painted mural that shows Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Hussein looking heroic between a pair of Scud missiles. "Everybody here loves 
Saddam Hussein," a taxi driver explained. "He shot missiles at Tel Aviv." 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the town hall, Mayor Jameel Khalaf had more immediate concerns: His 
city is running out of money, and he doesn't know who in the new Palestinian 
Authority to turn to. "We are all chiefs and no Indians," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who is in charge was also a major reason for Christopher's 
visit, the first by any high-ranking foreign official to the self-ruled 
Palestinian area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration wants to strengthen the authority of Palestinian 
moderates such as Husseini -- and weaken the allure of Hamas, the radical 
Islamic group that claimed responsibility Tuesday for the slaying of two Jewish 
settlers in Hebron, only 30 miles from Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration wants to help Husseini and his colleagues deliver basic 
services and begin rebuilding a ravaged local economy for the 20,000 residents 
of Jericho, and has promised $500 million in aid over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working to rehabilitate schools, clinics, we are helping to set up the 
Palestinian Authority, we are helping to equip the police," Christopher said. 
"One of the reasons I came today is to make clear to our Palestinian friends . 
. . that they are not alone in this new endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not enough for the Palestinians. "It is time for donor countries 
to deliver," said Saeb Erekat, one of the leaders who met with Christopher. 
"Any delay will cost us dearly." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even Erekat's demands gave the Americans some hope. One senior official 
noted that Erekat, once known for fiery denunciations of Israel and the United 
States, spent part of the closed meeting discussing the need for improved water 
pipes in the area, to reduce the loss of precious irrigation water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians have realized, the official said, that "it is essential that 
they be seen as being up to the task of self-government."

WAYWARD WHALE GETTING ESCORT BACK TO THE SEA; ANIMALS: SCIENTISTS DRIVE THE 
SIX-TON BABY AWAY FROM A BOAT CHANNEL IN PETALUMA BUT SAY ITS TROUBLES ARE FAR 
FROM OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wayward gray whale swam up a narrow boat channel and nearly reached downtown 
Petaluma on Tuesday, thrilling onlookers but alarming experts who quickly 
ushered it back toward San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Banging on metal pipes dangling in the water, a team of state and federal 
officials persuaded the baby whale to swim out of the channel after it briefly 
became trapped amid pilings a quarter-mile south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mission accomplished," Capt. Mike Wade of the state Department of Fish and 
Game said with a grin shortly after the whale re-entered the deeper waters of 
the Petaluma River. "That channel is very shallow, and we were worried the guy 
would run aground." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the successful operation, experts predicted that the whale's troubles 
are far from over. As dusk fell, three boatloads of volunteers and government 
scientists were trailing about 100 yards behind the disoriented whale, herding 
it slowly toward the river's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are using hammers to bang on capped metal pipes that make a sound that 
repels the whale," said Peigin Barrett, executive director of the Marine Mammal 
Center in Sausalito. "Hopefully, it will keep moving, but we've got a lot of 
water to cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's episode was the latest chapter in the whale's curious saga, which 
began Saturday when it was seen cruising the calm, brackish Petaluma River. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the whale, which appears healthy, probably took a wrong turn 
during its migration north to Alaska, winding up in inland waters 30 miles from 
the Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This darn animal must be pretty confused," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife 
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. "Sometimes gray whales 
like to explore little inlets. Maybe this one did that and just couldn't find 
its way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the explanation, the whale has become an instant cause celebre , 
drawing hundreds of fans from all over Northern California. Residents have 
given it two names -- Phyllis and Petaluma Pete -- because its sex is unknown, 
and posted a sign on U.S. 101 that reads: "Drivers Caution: One Mile to Whale 
Crossing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, camera-toting spectators lined the river's banks and breakwaters 
hoping to catch sight of the six-ton whale surfacing to spout. The crowd 
included retirees, construction workers on their lunch breaks, amateur 
scientists with binoculars and students ditching school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big thrill," said Julie Tarantino, who brought her four children to 
see the famous leviathan. "How often do you get to see a whale swim right next 
to you, blowing water into the air? It's pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Martin, a retired maintenance worker, agreed, but said he hoped the 
adventurous mammal would soon "get smart and get back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 "What if some kook chases her with a boat, and runs her up on a bank?" Martin 
said. "You just never know these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its appearance Saturday, the whale has shown particular preference for 
the tiny Petaluma Marina. On Sunday, the whale lollygagged amid the docks for 
about seven hours, delighting a crowd of about 300, Harbor Master Wayne Kipp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was close enough to touch," said Kipp, whose office has become ground 
zero for the whale-loving public. "Maybe she's just a social creature. Who 
knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whale, a bottom-feeder that lacks the dorsal fin found on most 
whales, is listed as an endangered species but has made a strong comeback in 
recent years. Its most distinctive characteristic is the heart-shaped stream of 
water it forms when it spouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The whales are at the very end of the spring migration from their breeding 
ground in Baja California to Alaska. One danger of herding the Petaluma whale, 
scientists said, is that it may become stressed, using up fat reserves it needs 
for the journey north. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's living off its blubber now, so we don't want to do anything to make him 
use up all his energy," Cordaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The whale's troubles are reminiscent of those of Humphrey, the humpback whale 
who meandered far off course in 1985, becoming trapped in a Sacramento River 
slough 25 miles south of the capital. In a massive, dramatic rescue, volunteers 
were able to coax him to safety through a small opening in a bridge that 
blocked his path.

CONSERVATIVES FLING WELL-HONED BARBS AT HUMOR CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With impish glee and acid wit, former Vice President Dan Quayle and 
conservative humorist P.J. O'Rourke lobbed verbal spitballs at the Clinton 
Administration on Tuesday in a daylong humor conference at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke skewered the President's health care reform proposal as the bloated 
product of a pre-exam "dorm room bull session." 
</P>
<P>
 "They think that if they just stay up late enough, there'll be human rights in 
China," O'Rourke said of Clinton and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I should take health advice from a President with a waistline 
like a Beautyrest mattress, the jogging gait of a beached sea lion and the 
sleeping habits of a teen-age slumber party," O'Rourke told more than 300 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Do Conservatives Have a Sense of Humor?" the conference answered its 
own question with lectures by O'Rourke, Quayle and former Reagan staff member 
Lyn Nofziger, and musical political spoofs by the Capitol Steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nofziger recalled quips by conservatives such as Herbert Hoover, who said of 
reporters: "Every President should be allowed to shoot two a year, without 
explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 And he told the crowd that Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater once sought entry to a 
golf course that excluded Jews, asking: "What about if I play nine holes? I'm 
only half-Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan, who once defined status quo as "this mess we're in," was the wittiest 
conservative President, even in the face of peril, Nofziger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in a 1981 assassination attempt, Reagan bombarded the hospital staff with 
one-liners, and Nofziger recalled repeating them to an anxious press corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by emergency room doctors, Reagan had cracked: "I hope you're all 
Republicans," Nofziger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the remarks that would let the country know that President Reagan 
is OK and that everything would be fine," Nofziger said. "Because up till that 
point, everyone thought Al Haig was in charge," he said, referring to the 
then-secretary of state's take-power speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitol Steps, a satiric singing group, took a more melodic approach to 
their humor, aping Clinton as a potbellied philanderer, Hillary Clinton as a 
commodity-trading Lady Macbeth, and Ross Perot as a jug-eared whiner in a 
watermelon-green 98-gallon hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suture yourself -- at home; suture yourself -- in front of the family," sang 
Brad Van Grack and Brian Ashe, satirizing the Clinton health care plan to the 
tune of "Consider Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Quayle took the stage amid boisterous applause and a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pronouncing himself glad to be out of the public spotlight for now, Quayle 
hinted broadly at a 1996 run for the presidency and recalled how his time in 
office made him the butt of jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see where President Clinton said he was the most assaulted American 
leader? President Clinton, read my book, " Quayle said, referring to "Standing 
Firm," his autobiography, autographed copies of which were snatched up by the 
audience between speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle also joked about his career as second fiddle to the President, 
recalling that the vice president's office was decorated with the bust of Henry 
Wilson, Ulysses S. Grant's second vice president, whom Quayle said "died there. 
He took a nap and never woke up." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was O'Rourke's blistering attack on the Clinton presidency that served 
as a political rallying cry for the Republicans in the room hoping for a 
victory in coming elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton is a disaster for the rest of our country, but he is meat for our 
table," O'Rourke told the group.

ATTACK ON TOURISTS STUNS IDYLLWILD; CRIME: QUIET MOUNTAIN TOWN LAMENTS ASSAULT 
THAT KILLED GERMAN WOMAN. HER WOUNDED HUSBAND IS EXPECTED TO SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As police struggled Tuesday to find clues in the killing of a German tourist 
who was gunned down at a highway turnout near here 24 hours earlier, residents 
of this close-knit mountain community tried to make sense of the brutal act and 
its effect on their bucolic home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a cold rain pelted them, three women placed a vase of wildflowers at the 
asphalt mountain turnout, lamenting a crime that left a German woman dead and 
her husband critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always felt that we lived in a sanctuary, and now we feel like we've 
been raped," said Michele Marsh, positioning the vase of mountain lilacs, 
manzanita blooms and a lone iris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is a cancer. It's been down there, in the city, and now it's spreading 
up here," she said. "Maybe people in L.A. are desensitized to it. But we're 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the flowers was a hand-printed sign, posted in the ground earlier by 
others. It was defiantly addressed to the unknown killer: 
</P>
<P>
 "We Are Not Afraid of You. May Justice Be Done." 
</P>
<P>
 Around noon Monday, a 64-year-old man and his 62-year-old wife, who arrived in 
Southern California on Friday from the western German town of Emmerlich to 
visit their daughter in Los Angeles, were shot in apparent execution style as 
they stood at the popular Indian Vista Point lookout, on the mountain highway 
north of Idyllwild. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's day trip was suggested by their daughter, investigators said: a 
leisurely drive up California 243 from Banning to Idyllwild. It is a winding, 
two-lane road affording sweeping views of the Coachella Valley beyond Palm 
Springs to the east and of the San Jacinto Valley to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple would have driven past Lake Fulmor, a popular fishing spot 
enshrouded in pines, before they pulled over half a mile later at Indian Vista 
Point. They walked past a signboard that read, "Welcome to San Bernardino 
National Forest," and strolled 50 yards along an asphalt path that ended 
beneath a striking coulter pine. Below them were the communities of Hemet and 
San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 No one except the husband knows exactly what happened next. The woman was shot 
several times, the head wound apparently killing her instantly. The man was 
shot in the back and then twice in the left cheek, shattering his jaw and 
blowing a hole in his windpipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the man survived and was able to struggle to his car to get help 
half a mile away was a source of amazement to the trauma surgeons who treated 
him at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs. Unable to speak and facing weeks of 
hospitalization, he is able to provide clues only by writing notes in German. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators in the Riverside County Sheriff's Department hope to 
learn more as soon as he is well enough to be questioned. At a news conference 
Tuesday, deputies shed little light on the events surrounding the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not say if the couple were ambushed or robbed, how many assailants 
there might have been or what kind of gun was used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea who the suspects are," said Deputy Mark Lohman. "We have no 
description. It is hard to stereotype the mentality of a criminal, but this was 
cold and callous, unique to our area. We have a case that seems very 
cold-blooded." 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said there was no reason to believe the couple had been targeted as 
foreign tourists; their car had no identification decals indicating it was a 
rental vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not released the names of the couple, saying they fear for 
the man's safety when he is released from the hospital in several weeks because 
he is the only witness to his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Ercoli, who operated on the man for several hours Monday, said he 
remains in critical condition and is on life-support equipment, but is expected 
to survive. He faces follow-up surgeries to reconstruct his face, Ercoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local townsfolk hope he will soon learn that the people here are pulling 
for him. On Tuesday morning, plans by a small group of residents to prepare a 
get-well banner swelled as several hundred residents signed their good wishes 
on it. "Get well. Our thoughts are with you. Your friends in Idyllwild," it 
reads in German, translated by a local woman, Meta Krosch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurses said they'd put it on the wall in his room so he'll see it," said 
Marsh, who brought the wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Krosch and her friends were bitter and scared as they thought about the 
shooting. Violence is not a total stranger in these mountains; in December, a 
Los Angeles man killed his estranged wife and their 13-year-old daughter at 
their cabin in nearby Pine Cove, then took off into the hills and killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was domestic violence. Monday's killing was different, the three 
women who brought flowers to the shooting site said. This was random, and that 
was the scary part. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know that it won't happen again," said Jane Stonehill. "Our freedom 
is being taken from us. We hike these mountains, and we don't know if we can 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh said: "We've never felt fear before. People seek these mountains for 
their solitude. And now we feel threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, crime is not part of the daily vocabulary in this community of 4,000 
people. It's quiet up here, where there is a multitude of weekend cabins but no 
skiing, no fast-food joints, not even a restaurant that stays open past 9. Some 
folks boast that they don't know where their house keys are because they've 
never been needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been an island in the sky, and now it has been invaded," said Stephanie 
Chase, who has lived in Idyllwild for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Others aren't resigned to changing times or the realities of city life 
creeping up toward their refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jan's Red Kettle Restaurant, the morning buzz over hot coffee and flapjacks 
was about the shooting -- and about the flood of television vans with satellite 
transmission dishes that cruised past the town circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a town where the streets fold up at 7 or 8, and where big news is a 
car crash," said Jan Boss, who runs the popular coffee shop. "My son came 
running up to me and said, 'Boy, there are television people all over the 
town!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel Idyllwild is a positive place in a pretty negative world, and I don't 
think that's going to change because of what happened. This is a real peaceful 
place, and I'm sure it's going to stay that way."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SECRETARY OF STATE; DEMOCRATS PUT ON SPIRITED RACE; 
OUTCOME UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may seem like one of the sleepier statewide elected offices, but just 20 
years ago a California secretary of state was able to detonate enough fireworks 
during a single term to be elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 More typical were the two Frank Jordans, father and son, who served quietly 
over more than half of this century, in a day when death and not the state 
Constitution set term limits for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, four candidates from the major parties are in the running for the 
post -- one of those jobs that can serve as the minor leagues for big league 
posts such as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 An unpredictable three-way contest among Democrats features former Los Angeles 
City Councilman Mike Woo, Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles, and the 
acting secretary of state, Tony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Republican primary, Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno is unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the candidates register on the Richter scale of public awareness -- 
with the exception of Woo, runner-up in the Los Angeles mayoral race last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All the competitors facing off in the primary have compiled substantial 
records in government service. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are liabilities for these candidates as well. Supporters of each 
have raised questions about what they say are the ethical lapses of the others. 
And those who watch the office closely believe that whoever wins ought to be a 
model of integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the post can ever again be a way station on the path to higher 
office, several observers agree that the job is an important one. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state coordinates elections and voter registration, collects 
campaign fund-raising reports, maintains the state's historical archives and 
handles a variety of business filings, including corporate records and 
trademark applications. The office also puts out the statewide ballot pamphlet. 
Despite the title, the job has nothing to do with foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 45, has received national attention as the first openly gay candidate 
for a statewide office, apparently anywhere in the country. His campaign has 
received only modest financial support from gay organizations, and he says he 
is not running as a gay candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is qualification and experience to do the job," said Miller, who 
took over as acting secretary of state when March Fong Eu stepped down in 
February to become ambassador to Micronesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, an attorney, has worked in the office for 18 years, first as its chief 
legal counsel and then as top deputy. Before that, he served briefly as a 
member of the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over, he has sued Gov. Pete Wilson for the Administration's 
allegedly slow response to the new, federal "motor voter" requirements, which 
will allow citizens to register to vote when applying for a driver's license or 
welfare. And under Miller's direction, the statewide voters pamphlet for the 
first time carries candidates' statements and photographs -- as well as his own 
signature prominently on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has attempted to break the link between lobbying and campaign 
contributions through a voluntary system of signing up lobbyists who say they 
no longer want elected officials to ask them for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as Watergate spawned the Political Reform Act of 1974, I clearly believe 
that Shrimpgate (a federal sting operation in the state Capitol) should spawn 
the reforms of the 1990s," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposes a ban on lobbyists' arranging clients' campaign contributions. He 
wants limits on the size of all contributions, opposes using public money 
directly to finance campaigns, but says the state ought to consider buying 
television time to sponsor candidate debates. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is backing a proposal to make the office nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's opponents contend that as chief deputy he was lax in enforcing fines 
against those who were late in filing campaign finance reports. These critics 
say Miller has forgiven millions of dollars in fines, including more than 
$25,000 that should have been collected from Eu. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says he has been evenhanded in administering the fines, reducing them 
only for "non-willful" violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 53, is the favorite of party regulars, labor unions and other 
traditional Democratic supporters and he hopes that that support will overcome 
Woo's wider name recognition and Miller's place on the ballot as "the acting 
secretary of state." 
</P>
<P>
 "My vision for the secretary of state's office is to move it into the 
Information Age," she said in an interview. Among her ideas: an electronic 
voters pamphlet available through libraries, schools and home computers, giving 
voters a full range of views and opinions by and about candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a Los Angeles County probation officer, Moore got her start in elected 
politics as a member of the Los Angeles Community College District board of 
trustees. She has been an assemblywoman for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore carried the landmark family leave act requiring most employers to give 
unpaid time off to employees to care for sick family members. She is also the 
author of bills that established "lifeline" reduced phone rates and ended state 
tax deductions for membership in clubs that discriminate against women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But her opponents focus on her unwitting role in the FBI Capitol corruption 
probe -- the elaborate sting operation that has resulted in the conviction of 
12 elected officials and their aides. In 1986 and in 1988, she accepted 
campaign money from undercover agents and carried special interest bills that 
would have allowed a bogus company to open a shrimp processing plant near 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy investigation, the U.S. attorney in Sacramento announced the 
indictment of her former aide Tyrone H. Netters, but said he would not 
prosecute Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 However, transcripts of recordings secretly made by undercover agents could 
prove embarrassing to the veteran lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tapes, Moore at times shies away from talking about campaign 
contributions with the agents, who were posing as Southern businessmen seeking 
favors. At one point she said she agreed to carry legislation because "I 
thought it was a good idea and not because of potential contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 But in another conversation, she referred an undercover agent's questions 
about campaign contributions to Netters, adding: "Don't you pay unless you 
clear it with me direct." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Moore is annoyed that her integrity should be questioned more than 
three years after the matter was dropped: "The fact is one of my staff people 
chose not to follow the law. . . . I was found completely innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Woo, 42, heads into the Democratic primary as the likely favorite after 
spending more than $5 million for a second-place finish in the Los Angeles 
mayoral race. He has name familiarity that could make a difference in a race 
among relative unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo got his start in public life as an aide to Democratic state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys). Since losing the mayoral race, he has been a fellow at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and has been teaching at UCLA and 
Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight years on the Los Angeles City Council, Woo was a champion of 
civil rights and rent control, and an opponent of police cooperation with 
federal immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeatedly clashed with former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates over police 
reforms and was one of the first to call for Gates' resignation after the 
Rodney G. King beating. But Woo has also backed efforts to put more officers on 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate for statewide office he is emphasizing his authorship of the 
city's sweeping ethics reform measure, which established partial public funding 
of campaigns and a ban on moonlighting by elected officials. He wants similar 
legislation at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do the most to fight corruption in state government," he said 
recently, adding that he is the only one of the four candidates "not connected 
to the status quo in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 His critics are quick to point out that Woo has had ethical problems of his 
own. The Fair Political Practices Commission fined him $2,000 for a conflict of 
interest, when, as a member of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, he voted on an issue affecting a contributor. His mayoral campaign 
took in nearly $6,000 in cash contributions in apparent violation of the city's 
elections law, but returned the money after a Times reporter raised questions 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents have allowed his opponents to accuse him of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations do not surprise him. "One of the main reasons why politicians 
don't want to lead the fight for reform is that it holds them up to higher 
standards," he said.MOORE, GWEN

POPULATION GROWTH AT NEW LOW; MIGRATION: INCREASE IN STATE RESIDENTS IS THE 
LOWEST SINCE 1940-41. WEAK ECONOMY IS TO BLAME, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

 The net migration to recession-battered California last year was the lowest 
since such record-keeping began in 1940-41, the state Department of Finance 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, an estimated 65,000 more people migrated to the state in 1993 than 
moved out, the department noted in its annual population report. Before this 
report, the lowest net migration on record was 81,000 people in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we seem to be seeing is that the sagging California economy is not 
attracting people to come here from other parts of the U.S. like it used to 
do," said John Malson, a state demographer who helped prepare the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is in such a state of flux that people who would normally leave 
their homes to move here are deciding not to do so -- or go elsewhere when they 
do move." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Levy of the nonprofit Center for the Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Palo Alto agreed with the state's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The falloff in migration is a direct result of the long California 
recession," Levy said. "People move primarily for jobs and there haven't been 
any new jobs to move to in California in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we would expect the migration trend to turn around when the economy picks 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California's population in 1993 grew by 1.4%, or 439,000 people, the 
smallest increase since the state added 404,000 people in 1976-77. The majority 
of the increase is because of births, although the number of births was also 
down for the fourth year in a row from the peak of 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also showed the continuation of a 1990s population trend, in which 
growth has slowed each year. In 1992-93, the state grew by 540,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's population reached 31,961,000 as of Jan. 1, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the Gold Country of the western Sierra grew by the largest 
percentage, at 2.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerically, the counties that added the most people were all in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County added 71,800 people; Orange County increased by 41,500; San 
Diego County grew by 41,200; Riverside County added 34,000, and San Bernardino 
County increased by 26,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two counties lost population. Sparsely populated Alpine County in 
Northern California declined by 30 people, and Monterey County dropped by 
3,700, mostly because of the closure of Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the 1970s, the city of Los Angeles did not lead the 
state's cities in population growth, the report said. Although Los Angeles 
added 12,200 people, San Diego and San Jose added more, 14,200 and 13,800, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on percentage, the fastest-growing cities in California last year were 
the small communities of Adelanto at 18.7%; Delano, 16.6%; Lathrop, 13.2%; 
Coronado, 12.7%, and Twentynine Palms, 12.4% 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the increase was because of a new state prison in Delano, while 
Coronado and Twentynine Palms added military housing, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The report tracked population for all counties and 468 cities in the state. Of 
the cities, 436 showed growth, while 30 cities lost population and two had no 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The report bases its estimates on a number of factors, such as construction of 
housing, the census average of people per household, driver's license address 
changes and school enrollment. A Tale of 10 Cities 
</P>

MISCONDUCT CHARGES FILED AGAINST JUDGE; COURTS: ORANGE COUNTY MUNICIPAL JURIST 
ALLEGEDLY DENIED POOR DEFENDANTS THEIR RIGHTS. HIS ATTORNEY SAYS HE IS A TOUGH 
SENTENCER BUT HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State judicial authorities filed misconduct charges Tuesday against Orange 
County Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney, who has been accused of denying 
hundreds of poor defendants their constitutional rights, including access to 
defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly 1 1/2 years of investigation, the Commission on Judicial 
Performance initiated formal disciplinary proceedings to determine whether 
Whitney violated the Judicial Code of Conduct while serving in one of the 
county's busiest arraignment courts during 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which operates largely in secret, declined to release 
specifics about the case. But Whitney's lawyer, Ronald G. Brower, said the 
judge is facing three charges related to improper sentencing, mistreatment of 
defense counsel and failures to advise defendants of their constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client welcomes the hearing," Brower said. "It is our position that he did 
nothing wrong. It's interesting to note that, by and large, the complaints have 
come from people who represent those sentenced by him, and he is known as one 
of the most severe sentencers in the courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney, 63, who was appointed to Central Municipal Court in 1989 by Gov. 
George Deukmejian, could not be reached for omment. He is running for 
reelection against Anaheim defense attorney Dennis P. O'Connell, who has ade 
the lengthy investigation into Whitney's alleged actions on the bench the 
cornerstone of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria B. Henley, the commission's director and chief counsel, said the 
decision to initiate formal disciplinary proceedings against a judge is 
uncommon and is reserved for cases that could result in public censure or 
removal from the bench -- the most serious types of professional punishment 
faced by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 During the proceedings, both sides will get to present evidence and question 
witnesses before a panel of judges appointed by the state Supreme Court. A 
report of the panel's findings will be sent to the judicial performance 
commission, which decides whether discipline is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which monitors the state judiciary and investigates 
allegations of wrongdoing, is made up of five judges, two lawyers and two 
members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's annual report indicates that out of the more than 900 complaints 
it receives annually, no more than 10 cases are ever taken to the formal 
hearing stage. Hearings for Whitney have not been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has been under investigation since January, 1993, when the Orange 
County public defender's office lodged a 325-page complaint against him, the 
first the office had filed against a judge in almost 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It alleged that Whitney sought to maintain a high rate of convictions by 
routinely denying constitutional rights to misdemeanor defendants who were too 
poor to make bail or afford attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint states that Whitney effectively punished defendants who asked 
for an attorney by sending them back to jail for seven to 10 days, saying it 
would take that long to find lawyers to represent them. Whitney also was 
accused of kicking defense lawyers out of his courtroom when they asked if they 
could talk to defendants, as well as handing down illegal sentences and denying 
defendants bail hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 After the complaint was filed, the Orange County Bar Assn., which has 5,000 
members, issued an unprecedented resolution saying "there was systematic denial 
of due process" for many defendants appearing before Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the presiding judge of Central Municipal Court signed a formal agreement 
with the Orange County public defender's office to ensure that the law would be 
followed during arraignments.

JURY SEES VIDEO OF HILL TAKING CHECK FROM AGENT; TRIAL: SENATOR PROMISES HELP 
IN PASSAGE OF BILL. TAPE IS CENTRAL TO CORRUPTION CASE AGAINST WHITTIER 
REPUBLICAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring "we'll do everything we can" to win passage of a special interest 
bill, state Sen. Frank Hill took a $2,500 honorarium check from an undercover 
FBI agent in a secretly recorded video played for the first time Tuesday to 
jurors in Hill's federal corruption trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be sure to count it all," admonished the agent posing as a Southern 
businessman after he handed the check to Hill, a Republican from Whittier. "We 
will," Hill replied before leaving the room to watch a heavyweight boxing 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds earlier, as the agent handed Hill the envelope with the check, 
the lawmaker said: "Appreciate all your help. Thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded in dimly lighted black and white, the tape provides a peek into the 
way business is conducted behind the scenes around the Capitol, and the endless 
hours of meetings, calls and meals that prosecutors contend are devoted to 
non-controversial legislation when large amounts of money are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape is a central piece of evidence the U.S. attorney's office is using to 
buttress its case against Hill, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of 
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering in connection with his acceptance of 
the honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1988 meeting was set up as part of an elaborate sting designed to ensnare 
lawmakers and aides in illegal activity. The money exchange occurred at the end 
of an hourlong chat in a hotel suite across from the Capitol. The meeting was 
held to discuss the FBI's bogus bill, which was aimed at helping a shrimp 
processing plant locate near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, Hill and the agent hardly discuss the legislation, carried by 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), but instead engage in lighthearted 
banter mostly about sports and hunting. The agent, using the name George 
Miller, speaks with a thick Southern accent and brags about a variety of 
pending business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors played the tape to boost their contention that Hill was 
illegally accepting money in exchange for his help on legislation. Hill's 
lawyers point out that it was legal at the time for a lawmaker to receive a 
speaking fee and that Hill was prepared to make informal remarks about 
legislation and "did not know the honorarium was supposed to be a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
 Karin L. Watson, a former Republican Assembly aide who accompanied Hill to the 
meeting, testified that when Hill promised to help with the measure, including 
talking with Republican Senate Leader Ken Maddy, he was alluding to "things he 
had agreed to do in exchange for the honorarium." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who drank several glasses of champagne during the meeting, testified 
that Senate Republicans were supposed to receive $10,000 in exchange for their 
help with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson pleaded guilty to extortion in exchange for her cooperation with 
prosecutors and a recommendation that she receive a six-month sentence in a 
halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
 In an excerpt of an audiotape played at the trial, Watson's boss, 
then-Republican Assmbly Leader Pat Nolan, told Watson the day after the hotel 
meeting: "Everything appears to be all right on it (the shrimp bill). We 
discussed it this morning with uh, Maddy, and the governor's staff. . . . 
Everybody says it's a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Nolan pleaded guilty to corruption charges and is serving a 
33-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy carried the measure on the Senate floor but has never been charged with 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Maddy said he has been questioned by the FBI and 
attorneys about his role as the Senate sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no memory or recollection of talking to anyone about this situation," 
he said. "Certainly, no money ever came to me or no one in my office was 
involved in money." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Hill's lawyer, Stephen D. Miller of Los Angeles, Watson 
said she asked Maddy "if he wanted to be on board" and he said the bill sounded 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller sought to tarnish Watson's credibility, peppering her with questions 
about how many drinks of champagne and other alcoholic beverages she had during 
meetings with FBI undercover agents and informants. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson acknowledged that she lied when originally confronted by the FBI in 
August, 1988, that she had been caught up in the sting. Watson said that she 
worried that disclosing the truth about raising money in connection with 
legislation would hurt Republican chances of taking control of the state 
Assembly and gaining more congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see that if I told the truth all that would crumble," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial resumes Thursday.

 A new peace effort by Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of 
Nagorno-Karabakh stalled, with Azerbaijan holding back from signing a 
cease-fire agreement.In talks in Moscow on Monday, the two sides agreed on a 
truce and a withdrawal of forces to form an exclusion zone around Karabakh. But 
the Azerbaijani delegation returned home without signing the deal. "The 
delegation is flying back to Baku for further consultations and will meet again 
with their counterparts later," said a spokesman at the Azerbaijani Embassy in 
Moscow.

U.S. YOUTH ESCAPES CANING IN SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government dropped vandalism charges Tuesday against a second U.S. 
teen-ager accused of spray-painting cars, sparing him the kind of flogging 
meted out to an Ohio youth two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 17-year-old Stephen P. Freehill of Chicago pleaded guilty to a 
reduced charge of possessing stolen property and was fined $520 by District 
Court Judge Khoo Oon Soo. 
</P>
<P>
 Freehill was among five teen-agers who were charged with going on a spree of 
mischief over two weekends last autumn, spray-painting cars, throwing eggs and 
switching license plates. In the end, Freehill admitted only to having stolen 
signs in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, pleaded guilty to two counts of vandalism in 
March and was sentenced to six strokes of a rattan cane, as well as four months 
in prison and a $2,230 fine. He received the flogging May 5, but the government 
reduced the number of strokes to four as a goodwill gesture to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's mother, Randy Chan, visited her son in prison Tuesday for the first time 
since the caning. She later told reporters that Michael was "OK" and "counting 
the days until his release." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was unable to see the scars left by the caning but added, "I 
think there will be a lot more to be said" when her son leaves prison. With 
time off for good behavior, he could be released as early as June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fay case became an international cause celebre, debated on television talk 
shows and in newspaper Op-Ed pages. Some argued that the United States needs to 
adopt similarly Draconian measures to deter crime, while others suggested 
caning is akin to torture. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Singapore police said in a statement Tuesday night that 
the charges were reduced against Freehill because statements by the other 
youths involved "have cast doubts on their reliability as prosecution 
witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 While the government evidently hopes the media scrutiny will now fade, the 
dispute refuses to go away. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has 
indicated that the United States will oppose Singapore as the site for a 
meeting of the World Trade Organization, successor to the Geneva Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. Singapore had campaigned to host the meeting.

LEGISLATION; KENNEDY HEALTH PLAN NOT COMING FROM LEFT FIELD; LONGTIME LIBERAL 
CHAMPION OF REFORM SIGNALS A WILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE. SO FAR, MOST REPUBLICANS 
APPEAR UNSWAYED. 
</P>

 By the time Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) stepped into the den of his 
Virginia home, it was after 9 p.m. on a day full of events momentous and 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 He had watched as his protege Stephen G. Breyer was presented as President 
Clinton's Supreme Court nominee, dashed to the South Lawn for a ceremony 
marking the passage of an education bill he had steered through the Senate, met 
with labor leaders on striker replacement legislation and rooted in vain for 
his stepson's Little League team. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day's work was far from over. Downstairs, his highly regarded Labor 
and Human Resources Committee staff was working feverishly on the biggest 
project of all -- sweeping health care legislation, which the committee will 
begin to debate and vote upon today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has championed the cause of health reform since 1970, long before it 
was politically fashionable. The responsibility now falls on him to revive 
Clinton's stalled effort to produce major legislation this year. Four other 
panels on Capitol Hill share jurisdiction over the issue, and to one degree or 
another all their deliberations have bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Kennedy was well-positioned to take command of the process last week 
when he produced his own version of Clinton's proposal -- one that he said 
addressed three of the four areas most criticized by the bill's opponents. His 
bill eliminated mandatory purchasing cooperatives, instead making them one of 
several options available to most people; eased up a bit on the smallest 
businesses, and found some extra deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final area of contention -- Clinton's proposal to rein in health costs 
with government-imposed premium caps -- Kennedy said he is willing to entertain 
other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the changes are minimal in some respects, they surprised many on 
Capitol Hill, given that Kennedy has enough liberal votes on his committee to 
pass virtually any bill he chooses. What they seem to represent is a signal to 
Republicans and moderate Democrats that the old warhorse of the left is willing 
to negotiate, if the compromise holds any chance of winning their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has been quietly working for months, meeting in small groups and with 
individual Democrats and Republicans, carefully taking note of their pet causes 
and their personal beefs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sen. William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.), he included an option under which 
anyone could enroll in the health plan now enjoyed by lawmakers and other 
federal employees; for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), there was more money for 
community health centers; for Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), funds for 
research. And to broaden its appeal, there are richer benefits for women, 
children and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, Republicans say they are not ready to take the bait. "I thought it 
would have come closer to the bipartisan middle. It's got an awful lot of 
regulation in it," says Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), who is considered a 
bellwether of moderate GOP sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives are even more blunt. "The Kennedy plan is an accountant's 
nightmare and a bureaucrat's dream," Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kennedy said he was not concerned by the rhetoric. "There's always a 
tightening up of emotion and feeling as you come closer to the time of 
decision-making," he said. "But eventually, the process moves forward." 
</P>
<P>
 It appears now that only one of his committee's Republicans -- James M. 
Jeffords of Vermont -- backs his bill. But he hopes Durenberger, Hatch and 
Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas will support at least part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it could give some guidance to the deliberations of the Finance 
Committee, which has a far stronger GOP minority. Hatch and Durenberger are 
also members of that panel. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong bill, Kennedy said, could also have "a profound impact in the House," 
where many members are afraid to take too controversial a stand for fear of 
being undercut -- as they have been in the past -- by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned against reading too much into what happens in any committee. 
"This has been a long process . . . toward the ultimate resolution, which I 
think will be on the Senate floor some time in the late spring or early 
summer," he said. "That will be the defining time."

HISTORY; NAZI-HUNTERS FEAR TRANSFER OF DOCUMENT CENTER'S CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent German physician had just been elected president of the World 
Medical Assn. when researchers probing his past discovered one noteworthy 
association omitted from his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Joachim Sewering had been a Nazi and a member of the dreaded SS during 
World War II. Records indicated that he signed an order in 1943 sending a 
retarded girl to her death as part of Hitler's euthanasia program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewering denied knowing the girl would be killed, but an international outcry 
forced him to resign as president-elect of the prestigious group last year 
after the World Jewish Congress revealed his wartime history. 
</P>
<P>
 This dark page from Sewering's past was uncovered by WJC investigators using 
records at the Berlin Documents Center, a repository of Nazi personnel records 
that for nearly 50 years has been a treasure trove of information for scholars 
and Nazi hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, researchers fear that the virtually unlimited access they have 
had to the American-run center is about to be curtailed under terms of an 
agreement returning custody of the files to Germany on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agreement guarantees U.S. officials will continue to have access to 
the files, Jewish organizations and other independent researchers are concerned 
that Germany's strict privacy laws will deny them similar entree. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials say these fears are unfounded because the accord 
stipulates that the transfer will take place only after a microfilm copy of all 
documents in the BDC files has been turned over to the United States. The 
microfilm -- 40,000 rolls of it -- will be housed at the National Archives, 
where it will be accessible as soon as user copies are made from the master 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from restricting access, the agreement ultimately should make the 
documents more accessible "by providing the means to use them to Americans who 
lack the luxury of a research budget to travel to Berlin," noted Mary Ann 
Peters, deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg and others who oppose the transfer 
to German control note that it will take the National Archives at least two 
years to generate a complete set of user copies of the more than 75 million 
pages of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 They worry about the access that private researchers will have to the 
originals in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Airing their concerns at a recent congressional hearing, two prominent 
scholars noted that historians frequently have had trouble gaining access to 
wartime documents under German control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access is often granted or denied in a completely arbitrary fashion," said 
Henry Friedlander, a professor of history at City University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 While some German archivists are helpful, others can be "downright 
obstructionist," added Geoffrey J. Giles, a University of Florida historian. 
"Archivists have lied about the existence of files, they have flatly refused to 
let scholars use them and occasionally they have even burnt Nazi files," Giles 
told the House Foreign Affairs' subcommittee on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said that while State Department officials do not expect that access to 
the documents will become a problem, the head of the U.S. consulate in Berlin 
would intercede on behalf of researchers if difficulties do arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Tom Lantos (D-Burlingame) and other subcommittee members appear 
unconvinced. "We are giving up something over which we now have control on the 
assumption of continued goodwill and cooperation (from Germany) . . . but it is 
no more than an assumption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lantos has threatened to introduce legislation to stop the transfer, 
congressional sources predicted that the issue will be resolved in the coming 
weeks with a protocol guaranteeing researchers access to the original documents 
until the microfilmed copies are available at the National Archives.

S. AFRICAN POLICE HUNT WHITE RIGHTISTS; VIOLENCE: ALLEGED RINGLEADERS SOUGHT IN 
BOMBINGS. THE CRACKDOWN COULD CRIPPLE EXTREMISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after the inauguration of this nation's first black-led government, 
police have intensified a crackdown on militant white extremists in what 
appears to be a severe blow to right-wing efforts to destabilize the new 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are searching for 21 avowed members of the far-right 
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi group allegedly involved in a wave of 
deadly pre-election bombings. Mug shots of eight alleged ringleaders of the 
terror campaign were splashed across front pages of newspapers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two other group members were arrested and charged with multiple counts 
of murder April 27 -- as the rest of the nation lined up to vote in the 
historic elections -- after four bombs in three days left 21 people dead and 
nearly 200 wounded. Police estimated damage at more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're after the big fish," police spokesman David Bruce said Tuesday. "These 
people have declared war on the people of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Cornelius van Wyk, commander of police intelligence, said at a bail 
hearing for the 32 suspects Monday that the extremists also had planned to 
detonate a massive bomb to disrupt the May 10 inauguration of Nelson Mandela, 
the newly elected president. He said Johannesburg's Jan Smuts International 
Airport was the apparent target and that "there was talk of three to five tons 
of explosives being used." 
</P>
<P>
 A car containing an estimated 200 pounds of explosives blew up at the airport 
April 27, injuring about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Afrikaner movement spokesman Fred Rundle called Van 
Wyk's allegations "absolutely ridiculous" and accused the police of 
sensationalism. "They want to impress their new communist masters at how 
diligent they are at hunting down their own people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the crackdown will further splinter the already fragmented 
and fast shrinking right wing, which once was feared as the most serious threat 
to the advent of black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen racist hate groups have vowed to fight for a self-ruled white 
homeland, but extensive press coverage has probably exaggerated both their 
influence and danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The new manhunt also further confirmed the loyalty of the nation's white-led 
security forces to the new political order, despite frequent boasts by 
right-wingers that the police are on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat isn't over, but they're getting a very clear message that the new 
government will deal with them severely," said Wim Booysie, a political 
consultant and expert on the right wing. "They've got them on the run." 
</P>
<P>
 The demoralization of the right wing became obvious after a ragtag army of 
white vigilantes was routed in disarray when members tried to prop up the 
apartheid-created regime in the now-defunct homeland of Bophuthatswana in 
March. Their humiliation was captured for the world when a black police officer 
executed two wounded group members in front of television cameras and the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other members were sentenced to death last week for the execution deaths 
and mutilation of four blacks, including a boy. The white extremists had pulled 
the blacks from their cars at gunpoint at an illegal roadblock outside 
Johannesburg late at night Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite a much-publicized boycott of the election by the Afrikaner 
movement and other pro-apartheid groups, an estimated four out of five 
conservative whites went to the polls, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Front, which campaigned for support to create a white homeland 
through legislative means, won 2.2% of the total national vote, enough for nine 
seats in the 400-seat National Assembly. The party won considerably more in 
regional elections, however, drawing about 638,000 votes in all.

2 ISRAELIS DIE IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING; MIDEAST: A THIRD SETTLER IS CRITICALLY 
HURT IN HEBRON ATTACK THAT EXTREMISTS SAY WAS MOTIVATED BY REVENGE. JEWS KILL A 
PALESTINIAN NEAR WEST BANK CITY OF NABLUS. 
</P>

<P>
 Palestinian extremists raked a Jewish settler's car with gunfire Tuesday, 
killing an Israeli man and woman and critically injuring the woman's 
21-year-old daughter in the embattled West Bank town of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-by shooting rekindled the national debate over the future of Jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings, part of a renewed cycle of violence between Jewish and 
Palestinian extremists in the territories, also deepened the anger and fear in 
nearby settlements such as Kiryat Arba. It was the home of one of Tuesday's 
victims, who was one of the more than 110,000 Jewish settlers living throughout 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the slayings -- which the Palestinian Islamic extremist group 
Hamas told two Israeli radio stations were in revenge for an attack by Kiryat 
Arba settlers that wounded 18 Palestinians on Monday -- armed Israelis fatally 
shot a Palestinian man near the northern West Bank city of Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army reported that the Israelis, who were being stoned by 
Palestinians along the roadside, opened fire on the Palestinian when he tried 
to snatch a weapon from their passing truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the latest violence, which came on the eve of today's scheduled 
ceremony marking the official liberation of Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and several Cabinet ministers 
suggested that settlers had provoked Tuesday's slayings by firing at 
Palestinian youths stoning them in Hebron the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin called Monday's shootings by about two dozen Jewish settlers, who were 
attacked with cinder blocks, stones and bottles while returning to Kiryat Arba 
from prayers in a Hebron graveyard, a "provocation." 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the settlers opened fire unjustifiably," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Tuesday, Israeli police arrested and jailed at least two of the young 
Jewish settlers involved in the Monday shooting, in which witnesses said 
Israeli soldiers also fired dozens of rounds into the crowd of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 As the settlers denounced the arrests and fumed over Tuesday's killings, 
Rabin's Cabinet bolstered the government view that the settlers had brought the 
attack upon themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban, a consistent advocate of removing Jewish 
settlements from the heart of Hebron, questioned the legitimacy of the prayer 
service that brought the settlers into town the day before. Monday was a Jewish 
holiday that some Kiryat Arba residents mark by visiting a tomb in Hebron's 
ancient Jewish cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow an artificial cult of ancient graves (to develop), we are likely 
to find ourselves with many new graves in Israel, and we have to prevent that," 
Tsaban said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli chief of staff, found himself on the 
defensive with most of Rabin's Cabinet, indicating that he expected attacks 
like the Tuesday killings to continue in the West Bank and the 13 Jewish 
settlements that the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed will remain in 
Gaza even after its liberation from occupation this week. "This struggle will 
continue," he said. "It's true that this situation isn't simple, and the 
security isn't absolute." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of Kiryat Arba's embattled residents, security was virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 As the settlers prepared to bury yet another victim on Tuesday -- Rafael 
Yairi, 36, who recently immigrated here from the Netherlands -- most Kiryat 
Arba residents declined to comment on the killings. They angrily said they felt 
that the world, the media and even their own government are against them. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who did agree to speak said the slayings underscored the daily 
danger and isolation that had become routine for them even before the 
Israeli-PLO agreement for limited Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
The agreement, signed on the White House lawn in September, triggered a violent 
backlash from extremist groups that oppose it from both sides of the 
decades-old Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's incident, Yairi was killed in the passenger seat of the car as he 
accompanied 48-year-old Margalit Ruth Shohat and her daughter, Yael, from a 
holiday celebration in the Gaza settlement of Gush Qatif. Neighbors said Yairi 
did not want the two women traveling alone through the territories; he sent his 
wife and two daughters home by bus. Shohat, who was killed, and Yael, who was 
in critical condition with a bullet in her head, lived in another settlement 
north of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence "is getting to be routine for us," said Pini Beno, 22, who was born 
and raised in Kiryat Arba. "I just want everything to be quiet. . . . Now, I'm 
always afraid."

PUBLIC PLACES; ALWAYS ON CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a few years, the tollbooth will be a thing of the past. Like soup cans, 
every vehicle will have a bar code.It will be read by roadside electronic 
scanners similar to those in supermarkets. Drivers will be billed every month 
by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners hope the "Intelligent Vehicle Highway System" will speed commute 
times and save money. But it also means that the government -- and maybe, 
someday, others with scanners -- will know who is driving where. 
</P>
<P>
 As surveillance equipment becomes smaller and less expensive, there will be 
lots more of it in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in the new and still-unopened Denver International Airport, there are 
no fewer than 1,500 surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of cities already use cameras to check speeders and red-light 
runners. The Blue Line between Los Angeles and Long Beach uses them at rail 
crossings. Others are testing the use of cameras at dangerous street corners to 
check crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During tests in New York City, the number of drivers who obeyed traffic 
signals increased by 80% when cameras were used. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Smith, the publisher of the Privacy Journal, a newsletter published in 
Providence, R.I., worries about a long-term "coercive effect" of compromising 
people's privacy. "It alters the culture because people don't take risks, they 
are less creative," he said. "Each person in the society keeps his nose clean."

MEDICINE; NO RESTRICTIONS ON DRUG DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the areas where personal information is accumulating most rapidly is 
medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 While the health care industry insists patients' identities and records are 
protected, prescription data is one way in which private medical information is 
sold and transferred to employers, insurers and drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the leading edge is Physician Computer Network Inc., a New Jersey company 
that is trying to create a nationwide computer network of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 PCN software links physicians to insurance companies, clinical laboratories 
and hospitals. The system allows the doctors to save time and money processing 
medical claims, receiving test results and changing medications and orders for 
hospitalized patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors get the service by leasing PCN computers at a discount. In exchange, 
PCN gets the doctors' patient records, which it compiles and then sells to 
pharmaceutical companies, insurers and others. 
</P>
<P>
 After some adverse publicity about the risks, PCN moved to create an 
intermediate entity to verify that PCN was not obtaining and releasing 
patients' names or identifying data. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law prohibits anyone from passing on information from medical records 
that is "personally identifiable," such as names and Social Security numbers, 
without getting a patient's permission. But enforcement can be difficult, 
privacy experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no such restriction on prescription drug information -- at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about roughly half the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled in the United 
States each year are sold to outsiders, usually to pharmaceutical companies 
interested in which products are moving. 
</P>
<P>
 PCS, a popular prescription discount card company, sells its database with 
patients' names deleted. However, it passes along the patients' sex, age and 
Social Security numbers and physicians' federal identification numbers. The 
buyer of the data, a company named Walsh, then voluntarily replaces the Social 
Security numbers with patient identification numbers. That, Walsh assures, 
protects patients' identities.

SHOPPING; SNOOPING AT THE CHECKOUT LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Safeway's radio ads in the Washington area, one customer raves that the 
grocery chain's new "Savings Club" cut her food bill in half. Another says she 
used the savings for a trip to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which offers discounts to shoppers in Safeway's Eastern stores, is 
supposed to build customer loyalty, company officials say. But spokesman John 
Deckard acknowledges that it also allows the chain to collect dossiers on 
individual customers' purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 And that information is a potential gold mine for manufacturers. Pepsi, for 
instance, has been building a list of Coke drinkers for years. Two years ago it 
delivered a million cases of soda to their houses in an effort to convert them. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeway so far says it will not sell its data to outsiders, although it may 
allow manufacturers to piggyback direct marketing appeals onto Safeway 
mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Marketing Corp. of Florida has developed technology it calls "Direct 
Checkout." Tommy Greer, chief executive officer, said this permits marketers to 
heap avalanches of promotional materials on consumers who are likely buyers, 
based on their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The program notes what a shopper buys and gives consumers targeted coupons at 
the checkout stand. If you buy one brand of cookies, for example, you may get a 
coupon for another brand with your receipt. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the trend for manufacturers and retailers is to want to do as 
much customer segmentation as possible," said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic 
Privacy Information Center, a private watchdog group on privacy issues. "The 
more information you have about customers, the more competitive and responsive 
you can be." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies disposable diapers, spent 
$3.5 million to develop a database that identifies 75% of new mothers in 
America through magazine subscriptions, child-care classes and hospital 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Most large banks, credit card companies and credit bureaus, while reluctant to 
talk about their policies, insist that they do not sell the data to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of their policies have been forged at the courthouse steps. The 
Federal Trade Commission forced TRW into an out-of-court settlement regarding 
its use of data. And only after being pressed by the New York state attorney 
general did American Express start notifying its cardholders that it sometimes 
profiles them based on their purchases and sells lists based on those profiles.

GERMAN MEDIA GIVE BROAD, TEMPERED COVERAGE TO CASE 
</P>

 The attack on two German tourists in California was widely reported in the 
news media here, but the tone of the reports was moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 The television news show "Heute" remarked Tuesday that just last week a group 
of Norwegian tourists was attacked in Florida, suggesting that this sort of 
thing could happen to a tourist from anywhere, and that Germans should not feel 
singled out. Some journalists here pointed out that this was the first attack 
on German tourists outside a crime-ridden urban setting. 
</P>
<P>
 At Frankfurt-based DER Tours, one of the biggest German travel agencies 
offering trips to North America, spokeswoman Antje Zimmermann said her 
organization has so far had no client reaction to the California attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we will go on recommending California to our customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 California is widely seen among German tourists as the state that epitomizes 
the American way of life. Tourists who want to sample America and its culture 
tend to favor California. Florida, by contrast, has until lately been the 
destination of choice among Germans who primarily want to lie on the beach. 
Florida is seen as similar to Spain, but more exotic and chic. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmermann said her organization's business in Florida declined 30% from 1992 
to 1993 because of the violence against tourists in that state. Since December, 
1992, six German travelers have been killed in the United States (the 
California victim was the sixth), and the first four of these victims died in 
Florida. The fifth was a German soldier shot in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, about 40% of the German tourists traveling to America have 
gone to Florida. Zimmermann added that at the same time the Florida business 
was falling off, tours booked through her company to the rest of the United 
States increased by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmermann said that the Germans who were attacked in California had not 
bought a package tour, but had written their own itinerary, and that this posed 
special problems for German travel agents. When customers book package tours to 
Florida, she said, her organization routinely gives them instructions on how to 
remain inconspicuous, stay safe in rental cars and avoid dangerous areas.

5TH MINISTER IN AS MANY MONTHS QUITS IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sergei M. Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister who first heard from reporters 
that he was being stripped of one of his posts, resigned on Tuesday from a 
Russian Cabinet that seems to be reshuffled almost as often as Italy's 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11 of the 25 ministers as of April, 1992, still hold Cabinet-level posts 
today. If Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin accepts his resignation, Shakhrai 
will become the fifth minister to depart in the past five months. 
</P>
<P>
 But some saw Shakhrai's being fired as minister of nationalities as a sign 
that Yeltsin, in fact, is unhappy with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence for this view was found in an unusual, late-night statement by 
Yeltsin's press service, which said that "Yeltsin urged Viktor Chernomyrdin on 
Tuesday to improve the work of his staff." Chernomyrdin immediately called a 
meeting of his deputies and the heads of the economic ministries and 
reprimanded them for poor performance, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 No slouches were singled out by name. But Yeltsin faulted their work style, 
their lack of control over the implementation of government decisions and their 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be trying to distance himself from the disastrous Russian economy. 
Production dropped almost 25% in the first quarter of this year compared with 
the same period in 1993, and plunged a further 3.3% in April, the state 
statistics committee said Monday. By April, 5,000 factories had closed, and 
more than 8 million Russians are now unemployed or on unpaid leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhrai left with a warning that, unless the ailing economy improves, 
Chernomyrdin may be the next to go. Shakhrai warned of a possible renewal of 
violent political strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhrai, a 38-year-old lawyer who wrote the 1991 presidential decree that 
banned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, had been in charge of Russia's 
sensitive nationalities and regional policy until Yeltsin abruptly stripped him 
of the post Monday. He is also the leader of a small centrist party with 19 
seats in the Duma, or lower house of Parliament, and is a possible presidential 
contender for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has already fired all but one of the reformers associated with the 
"shock therapy" policies blamed for the disastrous showing in December 
elections. The Kremlin rumor mill is now predicting an attempt to oust Deputy 
Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, whose controversial privatization program 
expires June 30.

INDIAN LEADER VISITS U.S. AS RELATIONS FALTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As P. V. Narasimha Rao begins the official segment of his trip to the United 
States today, a bureaucrat here suggested how to ensure that the first visit to 
Washington by an Indian prime minister in seven years is a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk trade," the External Affairs Ministry official said. "Don't talk 
security, nuclear weapons or non-proliferation." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the United States and India are so far apart on those important issues 
that it would hardly be a surprise if Rao, a cautious man who has been India's 
leader since June, 1991, essentially does as the diplomat recommends. 
</P>
<P>
 An arms control initiative that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
peddled in India and Pakistan last month has foundered, leaving both countries 
groping for what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Few expect Rao to offer a solution when he addresses both houses of Congress 
today, and experts say there is virtually no chance of agreement on touchy 
issues such as non-proliferation when he meets President Clinton at the White 
House on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the revival of Indo-American dialogue even more difficult is the U.S. 
conviction that the countries had a deal of sorts that Clinton Administration 
officials saw as ultimately lessening the danger of an Indo-Pakistani nuclear 
arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, according to the U.S. version of events, the Indians announced 
that they had agreed in principle to a multilateral disarmament conference on 
the Asian-Pacific region, with two weighty provisos -- the mandate and the 
participants would have to be mutually agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 But India later shot down a U.S. proposal outlining details of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a U.S. diplomat said, the Indians have reverted to a "global or nothing" 
approach, which would link nuclear arms control or reduction by India and 
Pakistan to worldwide cuts the Americans think are impossible to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms, that killed the U.S. plan. It had called for the United 
States to lift an arms embargo to allow delivery of 38 F-16 jets to Pakistan. 
In exchange, Pakistan was supposed to agree to a verifiable "cap" on its 
nuclear program, including a cutoff of enriched uranium production. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government has been 
adamant that it won't do anything India doesn't agree to as well, New Delhi 
holds effective veto power over the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been trying to broker a better security environment on 
the subcontinent out of fears that an Indo-Pakistani territorial dispute over 
Kashmir could escalate into a nuclear exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians call such concerns overblown and, while never admitting to have 
built nuclear weapons following the explosion of a "device" two decades ago, 
say their security equations need to take China into account as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the unsettled border with Kashmir, with a proxy war going on, and an 
unsettled border with China. In both situations, you have a nuclear weapons 
state on the other side," said Maj. Gen. Dipankar Banerjee, deputy director of 
the New Delhi-based Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday that Clinton expects his 
talks with Rao to cover a range of issues, including disputed topics such as 
proliferation, regional security and Kashmir, where there are widespread 
allegations of Indian human rights abuses against secessionist Muslim 
militants. But in a briefing for Indian reporters, a senior State Department 
official indicated that Clinton will not push India to change its positions.

EGYPTIAN LAWYERS' MARCH TURNS INTO MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the strongest public confrontations so far against the Egyptian 
regime, thousands of lawyers seeking to launch a peaceful march to the 
presidential palace were halted Tuesday with tear gas and rubber bullets, 
touching off a melee in which hundreds of citizens clashed with police as they 
stampeded through the downtown here. 
</P>
<P>
 Riot officers surrounded the headquarters of the Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate 
throughout the day as the besieged barristers, chanting slogans like "There is 
no God but Allah" and "Where is freedom?" threw stones and bottles and nursed 
the wounded in a makeshift emergency ward inside. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the city's largest thoroughfares was blocked off by hundreds of police 
after citizens, watching the tear-gas siege on the lawyers' headquarters, began 
raising their fists and running toward the police, shouting "God is great!" 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 100 people were injured, most of them slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 One young man, sweating and swooning, was lifted away on the shoulders of his 
colleagues as he attempted to rush toward the guns of the police. "I am Tarek 
el Awadi and I want to die!" he shouted. "Hosni Mubarak (Egypt's president) is 
a son of a dog!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a scene of pandemonium many activists said was reminiscent of former 
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's siege of the lawyers syndicate shortly before 
his assassination in 1981. The syndicate is controlled by Islamists, who view 
the Mubarak government as corrupt and undemocratic and urge its replacement 
with an Islamic state. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation was touched off by the arrest last month and subsequent 
death of Abdel Harith Madani, an Islamic lawyer who was seized in his office 
and taken away by security forces. Although authorities say he died of an 
asthma attack, syndicate officials claim he was tortured to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of their planned march from syndicate headquarters to the Abdin 
Palace a few miles away was to demand access to Madani's autopsy and 
investigation reports and seek the release of almost three dozen other lawyers 
who are being detained without charge or trial, some despite many court orders 
for their release.

JUSTICE DEPT. ASKS PRINCIPAL'S OUSTER IN RACE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department on Tuesday asked a federal court in Alabama to order 
school officials to explain why a rural high school principal should not be 
fired or reassigned for allegedly making racially derogatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move singling out a local school official for punishment, the 
Justice Department claimed that the principal's alleged statements reflect a 
school system that continues to discriminate against blacks despite two court 
orders prohibiting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Justice Department officials said privately that they could not recall 
ever before requesting that an official be fired for discriminatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph County High School Principal Hulond Humphries threatened to cancel 
the high school prom if interracial couples attended and said the child of an 
interracial couple was a "mistake," according to motions filed in federal court 
in Montgomery on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision outlawing 
public school segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Justice Department charged school officials in new motions in 
a longstanding desegregation suit with violating court orders by "disciplining 
black students more harshly than whites and failing to recruit or hire black 
teachers and staff." 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not just about one man who made a derogatory remark, but an 
entire school system that we believe has allowed an atmosphere of 
discrimination to persist," said Deval Patrick, assistant attorney general for 
civil rights, whose office initiated an investigation after complaints from 
county residents, the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
"Today's action demonstrates that some of the problems that once haunted us are 
still with us. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries and school officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal's defenders have said he meant no offense but was simply trying 
to avoid racial confrontation, according to published reports. Fights had 
erupted on campus when interracial couples were seen together, they said.

TOBACCO FIRMS CONCEALED RESEARCH, CALIFANO SAYS; HEALTH: CARTER ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIAL SAYS HE WOULD HAVE DECLARED CIGARETTES ADDICTIVE HAD FINDINGS ON 
NICOTINE BEEN KNOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The secretary of health, education and welfare during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration told Congress on Tuesday that -- had he and other federal 
officials known more about secret tobacco industry research into the properties 
of nicotine -- they would have declared cigarettes addictive and moved to 
regulate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately (we) were all victims of the concealment and disinformation 
campaign of the tobacco companies," said Joseph A. Califano Jr., who once 
smoked as many as four packs a day but has since become an anti-tobacco 
crusader who calls tobacco "history's No. 1 serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment, which has been conducting an extensive investigation of the 
tobacco industry, Califano described an intense debate in 1978 and 1979 over 
the government's role in regulating tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Dr. William Pollin, then director of the National Institute of 
Drug Abuse, urged Carter's surgeon general, Dr. Julius Richmond, to pronounce 
cigarettes addictive. But Richmond resisted, citing a lack of sufficient 
scientific evidence, Califano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we knew that the tobacco interests would attack any report we issued, 
we believed it was imperative that we be on unimpeachable ground in all we 
said," Califano said. "I therefore agreed with Dr. Richmond and we decided not 
to declare that cigarettes were addictive." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the dispute would have been different, "had we been privy to 
(industry) research," added Califano, who now heads the Center on Addiction and 
Substance Abuse at Columbia University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, noting that 
anti-smoking fervor was far more subdued during the 1960s and 1970s when 
Califano served in government than it is today, said "it would have been almost 
impossible for him to do anything more," regardless of the information he had. 
</P>
<P>
 "While today, his actions might not seem terribly radical, they were extreme 
for that period of time," Merryman said. "He's behaving as though, up until a 
couple of weeks ago, the entire world thought that smoking was safe." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the growing debate over smoking has focused on whether 
nicotine is indeed addictive, as numerous medical experts have maintained, and 
whether the tobacco industry has been manipulating levels of nicotine in 
cigarettes to keep smokers hooked on its products. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, chief executives from the nation's seven leading U.S. tobacco 
companies denied under oath in testimony before Congress that they had been 
deliberately increasing nicotine levels in cigarettes and insisted that the 
substance is not addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 But decades-old documents from at least one company, Brown & Williamson, which 
were recently leaked to the press and to anti-smoking members of Congress, 
indicated that executives there believed as early as 1964 -- when the first 
landmark surgeon general's smoking report was released -- that nicotine is 
addictive. Moreover, other company papers show that the firm had been working 
on developing a safer cigarette, although it never marketed one. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has scheduled a hearing 
for Friday and has asked Brown & Williamson Chairman Thomas E. Sandefur Jr. to 
appear. It was not clear whether Sandefur will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Griffin B. Bell, attorney general during the Carter 
Administration who now represents Brown & Williamson, obtained subpoenas 
seeking access to documents held by Waxman before advising his client whether 
to appear. Waxman, who had refused earlier requests to give up the documents, 
has turned the matter over to the committee's counsel.

AGENT GOES APE TO WIN CONVICTION; WILDLIFE: A MEXICAN ZOO OFFICIAL IS FOUND 
GUILTY OF BREAKING U.S. ENDANGERED SPECIES LAWS. HE TRIED TO BUY A 'GORILLA' 
THAT WAS A LAWMAN IN DISGUISE. 
</P>

<P>
 In a case that grew out of a celebrated sting operation in which a federal 
agent donned a gorilla suit and thumped his chest in a bizarre bit of black 
market theater, a high-ranking Mexican zoo official was found guilty Tuesday of 
violating U.S. endangered species laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Bernal, 57, faces as many as 17 years in prison and almost $1 million 
in fines for trying to pay $92,500 for a "gorilla" that turned out to be a U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service agent in furry disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal, director of zoos and parks for the central Mexican state of Mexico, 
was found guilty in U.S. District Court here of three felony and two 
misdemeanor counts having to do with the attempted illegal export of a great 
ape. 
</P>
<P>
 Also convicted on the same five counts was Mexican animal importer Eduardo 
Berges, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Federico A. Moreno set sentencing for July 18 and ordered both men 
jailed until a Friday bond hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal's defense was entrapment. He said that he was set up by U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service agents seeking retribution for the slaying of Enrique (Kiki) 
Camarena, 37, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was abducted, 
tortured and killed by drug traffickers in Guadalajara, Mexico, in February, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Alleging that agents referred to the gorilla sting as "Operation Kiki," 
defense attorney Donald I. Bierman told the jury: "They wanted to get a man in 
Mexico to show that Kiki Camarena was not to be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 12-member jury didn't buy that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Bernal wanted to buy a young gorilla to replace one 
that had died at the Toluca, Mexico, zoo, one of two national zoos and 16 parks 
under his jurisdiction. Bernal called Berges, and he made the contact in Miami, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several days in January, 1993, undercover agent Jorge Picone, posing as a 
shady animal dealer, chauffeured Bernal, Berges and Berges' partner, Jose Luis 
Alcerreca, 45, around Miami's zoos and wildlife parks to look at various 
primates. 
</P>
<P>
 The sting took place on Jan. 25, 1993, when Bernal and the others were 
escorted onto a DC-3 cargo plane parked in a remote corner of a small Miami 
airport to see the gorilla, crated for shipment. As they stood in front of the 
crate, which had been "seeded" with real gorilla feces from Miami's Metrozoo 
for olfactory effect, the ape suddenly opened the box and climbed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal screamed. He tried to jump out of the plane onto the runway six feet 
below the door. "We kept telling him, 'We're police! We're police!' But even 
after the agent took the hood off, he couldn't believe a gorilla wasn't coming 
after him," reported Monty Halcomb, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife agent posing as 
the plane's pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three weeks of trial, jurors listened to hours of testimony about the 
network of laws designed to protect endangered primates, and also watched an 
undercover videotape of the sting. As Bernal is being led off the plane under 
arrest on the tape, the ersatz gorilla, an agent with long blond hair, is seen 
following him, his mask off and smoking a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Bierman described Bernal, a lawyer, as a lifelong conservationist who recently 
had arranged for a breeding loan of an elephant from the Los Angeles Zoo, and 
was unaware that the fake gorilla being offered for sale would not have valid 
export papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted a gorilla for education and reproduction," Bierman said in closing 
arguments Monday. "We have here people being mugged and raped in the streets 
and we have 16 agents dealing with a make-believe gorilla." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Guy Lewis argued that Bernal was willing to skirt strict 
U.S. laws governing the sale of endangered species as a way of ingratiating 
himself with Mexican political bosses who had influence over his career.

STUDY LINKS 3 ALLERGY DRUGS TO CANCER IN MICE; MEDICINE: CANADIAN TESTS PROMPT 
USDA PROBE. BUT NO TESTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON HUMANS AND PATIENTS HAVE NOT 
BEEN ADVISED TO DISCONTINUE USE. 
</P>

 Tests by Canadian researchers show that three common allergy drugs promote 
cancers in laboratory mice, prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to 
begin its own investigation of the prescription antihistamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the researchers nor the FDA advised consumers to stop taking the drugs 
-- which are used by millions to combat symptoms of allergies and hay fever -- 
although they cautioned against long-term use. The FDA noted that no clinical 
studies to determine the effect on humans have been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they noted that the mice in the Canadian study did not develop 
cancer as a result of the drugs. Rather, the animals were injected with tumors 
beforehand, and the drugs seemed to promote more rapid growth of those tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency does not believe, therefore, that changes in the drugs' labeling 
or approval status are warranted," the FDA said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency said it is concerned enough about the results to duplicate the 
Canadian animal work and to consider conducting a statistical analysis of 
cancer rates among people who take the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal Canadian researcher, Dr. Lorne J. Brandes, also said that so 
far, the benefits of antihistamines appear to outweigh the risks. But he 
suggested that they should be used "for as short a period as possible and only 
when really needed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the study published today by the Journal of the U.S. National Cancer 
Institute, Brandes and his research team at the Manitoba Institute of Cell 
Biology in Winnipeg injected mice with a skin cancer and a cancer of the 
connective tissue, known respectively as melanoma and fibrosarcoma. 
</P>
<P>
 In three groups of mice, the tumors grew faster and larger after the rodents 
were injected with one of three antihistamines: loratadine, astemizole and 
hydroxyzine, all of which are prescription drugs. The doses were equivalent to 
those commonly prescribed for humans. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 to 21 days, the mice were killed and their tumors were removed and 
measured. The mice that had received the drugs had tumor weights of 150% to 
390% greater than mice in control groups, the researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer-ridden mice injected with a placebo showed no evidence of faster or 
larger tumor growth rates, the researchers said. Nor were accelerated tumor 
growth rates recorded in mice injected with two over-the-counter antihistamines 
-- doxylamine, used in Unisom and Nyquil -- or another drug, Reactine. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA statement pointed out that there is "no clinical data (to) support the 
findings" and said that "further study is needed to determine whether these 
kinds of animal data suggest a potential concern for human use of the drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Standard laboratory tests with loratadine and astemizole in mice and rats have 
not shown them to cause cancer, the FDA added. 
</P>
<P>
 Astemizole is the primary ingredient in Hismanal, manufactured by Janssen 
Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J. Loratadine is found in Claritin, made by 
Schering-Plough of Madison, N.J. Hydroxyzine is used in at least seven allergy 
products, but Brandes specifically linked his study with Atarax, made by the 
Roerig Division of Pfizer Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Francis Cuss, vice president for research at Schering-Plough, maker of 
Claritin, disputed the significance of the findings, saying there is no proof 
that chemicals capable of stimulating existing cancers in mice will have the 
same effect in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not accepted as validated studies," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Douglas L. Weed of the prevention division of the National Cancer 
Institute said that despite the Canadian conclusion, "we find no cause for 
alarm." 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial in the same NCI Journal, he recommended no changes in the use 
of the medication. But this could change in the future if warranted by new 
research, he added.

BROWN SUGGESTS BORROWING $3 BILLION TO ERASE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Tuesday proposed borrowing $3 billion to 
eliminate the state's budget deficit over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the leading Democratic candidate for governor, said borrowing the money 
by selling bonds to private investors and banks makes more sense than relying 
on an unlikely infusion of federal funds, which Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has asked the Clinton Administration and Congress to give the state 
$3.1 billion in new money this year, most of it to cover the cost of services 
to illegal immigrants. That is 10 times the amount Congress allotted for 
California's immigration costs last year and represents nearly 10% of the 
state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials and members of Congress have said California 
cannot expect anywhere near the amount Wilson has requested. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor is expected to stick by his proposal when he releases a 
revised budget plan Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Democrats in the Legislature have said they would agree to a budget 
along those lines rather than vote to raise taxes or cut popular programs. The 
Assembly approved a budget framework Tuesday that includes the Wilson figure 
for federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, said Wilson's assumption that the federal government will 
rescue California is simply a ruse to roll over the state's deficit for another 
year with no plan to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Brown's proposal, the state would adopt a five-year plan in which each 
year's tax revenues would equal or exceed the expected spending. The $3-billion 
deficit now on the books would be erased by selling bonds, which would be paid 
off from the state's general fund over five years, with payments starting at 
about $700 million in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said borrowing the money as part of a structured, five-year plan would 
be cheaper than borrowing it year after year in an unplanned fashion, as the 
state has been doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said Brown's 
approach is sound economically but flawed as a political strategy. If 
California solves its fiscal problem on its own, he said, the federal 
government no longer will feel obligated to help out.

HOUSE VOTES TO LIMIT ADDICTS' SOCIAL SECURITY PAY; DISABILITY: FUNDS FOR DRUG 
ABUSERS AND ALCOHOLICS WOULD BE CUT OFF AFTER 3 YEARS. TREATMENT WOULD BE 
REQUIRED. SENATE HAS PASSED A SIMILAR BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House voted unanimously Tuesday to impose a three-year limit on Social 
Security disability benefits for drug addicts and alcoholics, many of whom are 
believed to use their federal payments to feed their habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Like similar legislation approved by the Senate two months ago, the House 
crackdown would require drug addicts and alcoholics to receive treatment if 
they are to qualify for payments under the Social Security disability insurance 
program or disability payments under the Supplemental Security Income program. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the payments would stop after three years if substance abuse was 
the basis of a disability claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The government now pays $1.4 billion a year to 250,000 persons who receive 
disability payments because of substance abuse. Congressional critics have said 
that the safeguards are inadequate either to guarantee rehabilitation treatment 
or prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 One tavern-owner in Denver, for example, received $160,000 as "custodian" for 
alcoholic customers on the benefit rolls. In Bakersfield, Calif., a drug addict 
receiving disability payments died of a lethal overdose purchased with 
thousands of dollars in retroactive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The cut-off provision is part of a bill making the Social Security 
Administration an independent federal agency, breaking it away from the 
Department of Health and Human Services. The measure, approved 413 to 0, now 
goes to a House-Senate conference committee so that differences in the two 
houses' measures can be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should have been fixed a long time ago," said Rep. Porter J. Goss 
(R-Fla.) during House debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office reported last year that the number of substance 
abusers receiving SSI benefits had tripled from 1990 to mid-1993 and those 
receiving disability insurance payments had climbed by 35% over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the system is not working," added Rep. Gerald D. Kleczka (D-Wis.). 
He said that just 1% to 2% of beneficiaries "leave the disability rolls after 
rehabilitation treatment -- they usually die first." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to prevent disability checks from being sent to drug dealers, 
bartenders or other inappropriate custodians designated by beneficiaries, the 
bill would require that payments go either to family members or friends or, 
preferably, to government institutions or private agencies that would manage 
the money for the beneficiaries. Large lump-sum payments, usually made 
retroactively, also would be barred under the House bill. Past-due benefits 
instead would be paid gradually over a period of months. 
</P>
<P>
 The House legislation would require the Social Security Administration to set 
up agencies in all 50 states to find treatment programs for drug addicts and 
alcoholics, monitor their attendance and conduct periodic drug tests to see if 
they are recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 People with substance abuse problems who are receiving disability insurance 
benefits would be required for the first time to participate in treatment, if 
available, to retain their payments. Those who get SSI benefits already are 
required to take treatment but the bill would establish stricter penalties for 
those who fail to do so.

O.C. MUNICIPAL JUDGE FACING STATE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State judicial authorities on Tuesday filed misconduct charges against Orange 
County Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney, who has been accused of denying 
hundreds of poor defendants their constitutional rights, including access to 
defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost 1 1/2 years of investigation, the Commission on Judicial 
Performance initiated formal disciplinary proceedings to determine whether 
Whitney violated the Judicial Code of Conduct while serving in one of the 
county's busiest arraignment courts during 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which operates largely in secret, declined to release 
specifics about the case. But Whitney's lawyer, Ronald G. Brower, said the 
judge is facing three charges alleging improper sentencing, mistreatment of 
defense counsel, and failures to advise defendants of their constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client welcomes the hearing," Brower said. "It is our position that he did 
nothing wrong. It's interesting to note that, by and large, the complaints have 
come from people who represent those sentenced by him, and he is known as one 
of the most severe sentencers in the courthouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has been under investigation since January, 1993, when the Orange 
County public defenders office lodged a 325-page complaint against him, the 
first such complaint the office has filed against a judge in almost 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney, 63, who was appointed to the Municipal Court in Santa Ana in 1989 by 
then-Gov. George Deukmejian, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. He has 
maintained that he conducted court properly and with the sound advice of his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's decision to proceed with disciplinary hearings is expected to 
complicate Whitney's current effort for reelection in the June 7 primary. In an 
earlier interview with The Times, he conceded that the investigation makes him 
politically vulnerable, though he is viewed as a conservative in a conservative 
county and has been endorsed by some police groups. 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent is Anaheim defense attorney Dennis P. O'Connell, 44, who has the 
support of the Orange County District Attorneys Assn. He has hammered hard on 
the commission's inquiry as a sign that Whitney is incompetent and lacks 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this further supports my position," O'Connell said Tuesday. "The 
issue is not whether he is a tough sentencer, but whether judges should follow 
the law. He has failed to respond to that issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria B. Henley, the commission's director, said the decision to initiate 
formal disciplinary proceedings is uncommon -- happening less than 10 times a 
year -- and is reserved for cases that could result in public censure or 
removal from the bench -- the most serious types of punishment faced by judges 
for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 During the proceedings, both sides will get to present evidence and question 
witnesses before a panel of judges appointed by the state Supreme Court. When 
the hearings are finished, a report of the panel's findings will be sent to the 
commission, which then must decide whether discipline is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which monitors the state judiciary and investigates 
allegations of wrongdoing, is made up of five judges, two lawyers and two 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's annual report indicates that, of the more than 900 complaints it 
receives annually, no more than 10 cases a year are ever taken to the stage of 
formal proceedings. No date has been set for Whitney's hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement issued Tuesday, the presiding judge of the Municipal 
Court in Santa Ana said the court welcomed "the opportunity for Judge Whitney 
to finally and fully present his evidence in response to allegations in a fair 
and impartial forum overseen by special masters appointed by the California 
Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler, whose office prompted the investigation, 
declined to discuss the filing of charges, saying it would not be appropriate 
given the confidential nature of the commission's cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's deputies first accused Whitney of misconduct in late 1992 and 
obtained a formal agreement from the Municipal Court to ensure that the law 
would be followed during arraignments. Despite the agreement, and Whitney's 
reassignment to other duties, Butler thought his abuses were so egregious that 
he took the unprecedented step of forwarding his allegations to the judicial 
performance commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluminous complaint alleges that Whitney sought to maintain a high rate 
of convictions by routinely denying constitutional rights to misdemeanor 
defendants who were too poor to make bail or afford private attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney, the complaint stated, effectively punished those who asked for an 
attorney by sending them back to jail for seven to 10 days, saying it would 
take that long to find lawyers to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Whitney was accused of kicking defense lawyers out of his 
courtroom when they asked if they could talk to defendants, handing down 
illegal sentences, denying defendants bail hearings and failing to provide 
adequate foreign language interpreters for the accused who could not speak 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 After the complaint was filed, the Orange County Bar Assn., which has 5,000 
members, reviewed the allegations and issued an unprecedented resolution saying 
that "there was systematic denial of due process" for many defendants appearing 
before Whitney. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is also looking into the 
judge's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the main allegations against his client, Brower said the way Whitney 
advised defendants of their constitutional rights was legal, according to 
appeals court rulings. The deputy public defenders Whitney expelled from his 
courtroom were disrupting the proceedings, he contended, and were violating 
posted rules designed to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust of the charges are being made by defense attorneys," Brower said. 
"They complain about the man being a severe sentencer and an efficient judge. 
That combination will breed discontent and complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's office maintains that Whitney's sentences were sometimes the wrong 
ones under the law, and that the judge repeatedly refused to put defendants 
into various diversion programs for which they were eligible, instead 
sentencing them to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Brower said that since the investigation began, some lawyers who have appeared 
before Whitney have sent letters to the judicial performance commission to 
challenge the allegations made by the public defenders office.

ANGELS FIRE BUCK RODGERS AS MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, who seemingly pull off a caper each season that leaves the 
baseball world dumbfounded, came up with another Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a highly surprising move, the club fired Manager Buck Rodgers and hired 
former Angels pitching coach Marcel Lachemann from the Florida Marlins to 
replace him beginning Thursday. First base coach Bobby Knoop handled the team 
Tuesday in a 10-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox and will do so again tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the change because as an organization we feel we need to take a 
different direction," said Bill Bavasi, the Angels' first-year general manager. 
"I don't want to get into why we made the move, because saying anything would 
be negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be critical of the guy. I've probably done enough damage 
already. My actions speak loud enough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodgers, 55, an original Angels player who was instrumental in turning 
around the image of the organization . . . who refused to bash his bosses for 
trading away popular stars such as Jim Abbott and allowing others to get away 
while receiving little or nothing in return . . . who was nearly killed during 
a 1992 crash of the Angels' team bus . . . was whisked away for one major 
reason: 
</P>
<P>
 He talked too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, according to a highly placed source in the organization, was fired as 
much as anything because he was outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 He was much too candid in his opinions that appeared in newspapers, which 
irritated his players, and too opinionated in private meetings, which enraged 
his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office, according to sources, was infuriated when Rodgers was quoted 
after Sunday's 9-5 defeat at Seattle as saying of his pitching staff: "You have 
to realize John Dopson has been released (by another team). Mark Leiter has 
been released. Joe Magrane has been released. And we're trying to find spots 
for them on our club. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to look at what we've got to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a club official: "Come on, you just can't say those things. It wasn't 
like that was the first time. It just kept happening." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the underlying belief that the club had one too many general 
managers. Bavasi was hired on Jan. 12, replacing Whitey Herzog, but several 
front-office officials say Rodgers behaved as if he also had the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Team President Richard Brown and Bavasi told Rodgers several times of 
personnel decisions they wanted made, but Rodgers often steadfastly refused. 
This was his team, and he was running it the way he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship basically dissolved Monday during a private meeting that 
included Rodgers, the coaching staff and front office personnel. Rodgers 
accused the front office of being more concerned about budgetary restraints 
than winning, and there were several disputes over personnel, mostly which 
players were to be brought up from the minor leagues to fill holes in the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office wanted young pitcher Russ Springer to take a place in the 
starting rotation; Rodgers wanted veteran John Farrell. The front office 
thought first baseman J.T. Snow should be recalled if Eduardo Perez were placed 
on the disabled list. Rodgers wanted utility man Mark Dalesandro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no coincidence that on the day Rodgers was fired, the lineup was 
overhauled. Rookie Jim Edmonds was playing left field instead of Dwight Smith 
or Bo Jackson; third baseman Damion Easley was dropped from leadoff to seventh 
in the batting order, and Chad Curtis was moved up from sixth to second. And 
while Farrell will indeed replace Mark Leiter in the starting rotation, it was 
also decided that Springer will be up later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi said the Angels' 16-23 record before Tuesday's game had no bearing on 
his decision to fire Rodgers: The team was only two games out of first place in 
the American League West, baseball's weakest division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have done it if we were in first place," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, informed by Bavasi of the decision in a meeting about noon Tuesday, 
spent the rest of the day with a close friend who recently had a heart attack. 
He was unavailable for comment but will hold his own press conference today at 
2 p.m. and perhaps give some insight into his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea something like this would happen," said Judi Rodgers, his 
wife. "I don't even know what happened. He just called me and said, 'Well, I 
got the ax.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, who had been contemplating the decision for about a week, telephoned 
Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski in about the seventh inning of their 
game Monday night against the New York Mets and asked permission to hire 
Lachemann. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make a decision and offer the job to Marcel," Bavasi told 
Dombrowski. "The job's his if he wants it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dombrowski, who coincidentally fired Rodgers from the Montreal Expos on June 
3, 1991, told Lachemann after the game. Marlins Manager Rene Lachemann, 
Marcel's brother, hitting coach Doug Rader and Marcel stayed up until 4:30 in 
the morning discussing whether he should take the job. Rader was fired by the 
Angels on Aug. 26, 1991, when Rodgers took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I even had my mind made up when I woke up," Marcel Lachemann 
said, "because I'm not sure I even fell asleep. . . . My emotions have kind of 
run the gamut. There is sadness about leaving the Marlins and my brother, and 
all the good things happening there, to the elation of coming back to 
California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "At one time (managing) was a big goal, then it went to a period where it was 
not. This is probably the only place I'd think of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My next goal is to manage against my brother, and the only way for that to 
happen is in late October (at the World Series). That's our next dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann, who spent nine years as Angels pitching coach before joining 
the Marlins in the same capacity for the 1993 season, joins Rene to form the 
first brother tandem to manage simultaneously in the big leagues since 1879, 
when George Wright managed Providence and Harry Wright managed Boston. The 
Lachemanns are the fourth set of brothers to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn it, I can't believe it," said Herzog, the former Angels general manager. 
"How the hell can you fire a manager who didn't have his No. 1 pitcher (Mark 
Langston), didn't have his No. 3 pitcher (Joe Magrane), and his No. 2 and No. 4 
pitchers (Chuck Finley and Phil Leftwich) are pitching (badly)? 
</P>
<P>
 "That ain't too damn fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, Marcel will do a good job, and he's a very good baseball man, but I 
managed against Buck, and that's a pretty damn good manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, firing Buck Rodgers is not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will be responsible for the remainder of Rodgers' contract, which 
expires after the 1995 season. He is to be paid $600,000 for each of the two 
years. 
</P>

 In a surprise announcement, Marcel Lachemann was named Angels manager on 
Tuesday. He replaces Buck Rodgers who managed the team for 312 games over four

POLICE FATALLY SHOOT SUSPECTED BANK ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected in a string of at least 20 bank robberies throughout the San 
Fernando Valley was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Thursday in a church 
parking lot after a bank holdup attempt and a foot chase down a tree-lined 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man, who allegedly threatened police with a knife, was shot 
by officers who had staked out the California Federal Bank at 15054 Ventura 
Blvd., as well as an undisclosed number of other area banks they believed might 
next be visited by the holdup artist, according to police spokesman Lt. John 
Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as male, 35 years old, 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and 
weighing 200 pounds, and was reportedly driving a dark green Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said he might be the same man who robbed a Southern California 
Savings branch in Woodland Hills earlier in the day. And although police would 
not discuss previous incidents in which they believe he was involved, a man 
fitting a similar description robbed the Charter Pacific Bank in Agoura Hills 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:10 p.m. Tuesday, Dunkin said, the suspect walked into the California 
Federal Bank and produced a note demanding cash. When the robbery was 
"completed," according to a police statement, the teller alerted nearby 
Officers Jose Maldonado and Ronald Capra, who pursued the man as he fled out a 
rear door. 
</P>
<P>
 With Los Angeles police officers giving chase, Dunkin said, the man ran south 
on Noble Avenue and then briefly west on Dickens Street into the rear parking 
lot of the First Presbyterian Church of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornered and standing behind the Jeep police believe was the getaway vehicle, 
the suspect brandished a 6-inch knife, police said. When told to drop the 
weapon and surrender, according to the statement, the man turned and confronted 
the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He refused and advanced on Officers Maldonado and Capra," the statement read. 
Maldonado fired three shots and Capra fired twice, each using a 9-millimeter 
service weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both officers felt that the suspect was approaching them in a threatening 
manner," Dunkin said at the scene. "They had already warned him to drop the 
knife and believed the appropriate means to stop him was through use of their 
weapons. He was close enough that the officers feared bodily injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said no one in the bank was injured. He would not say if the man made 
off with any cash. 
</P>
<P>
 He also would not say how officers had chosen California Federal as one of 
their stakeout sites or how the teller had signaled them that a robbery was in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know who the guy was," Dunkin said. "If we did, obviously we would 
have preferred to take him into custody under different circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:15 p.m., three hours after the shooting, the man's body still lay in the 
parking lot, directly behind the green Jeep, as a dozen uniformed officers and 
detectives, dressed in raincoats on the gray, drizzly day, walked back and 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying face up, donned in sneakers, not far from a lone basketball hoop, the 
bloodied body was covered with a clear plastic sheet. The man's shirt had been 
ripped open in an apparent attempt to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, kept back by yellow plastic police tape, wide-eyed 
neighbors looked on at the scene, some discussing how they had heard the 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like fireworks -- blam, blam, blam, blam, blam," said resident 
Pollyann Gowrie, who stood on the lawn of an apartment building. "At first I 
heard sirens and then the gunfire. It was really weird. At first we just 
thought it was some traffic accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the chase, stand-off and shots all happened quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was over in an instant," resident Tim Tschopp said. "You heard the shots 
and then saw the guys running around with flak jackets with the words 'Police' 
written on them. The next thing you know, the police tape was up." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the quiet neighborhood, one block south of Ventura Boulevard and 
the popular Mel's restaurant, said the shooting sent a shock wave through an 
area not used to big-city violence. "This is stunning, really," Gowrie said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wagner, manager of the nearby Copperfield apartment building, said he was 
relieved the shooting did not occur at a time toddlers attending the church 
nursery were in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine what would have happened otherwise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who answered the telephone at the First Presbyterian Church Tuesday 
night said only that "most of the children had already left the nursery school" 
by the time shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors watched as the body was whisked away by the coroner's office. 
"Really, though, this is a great neighborhood," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just about to go out and walk our dogs when we heard the gunshots. 
What a surprise that was." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a woman ushered her two preschool-aged children along the sidewalk. 
"What happened, Mommy?" one asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing, honey," the woman replied quickly. "Nothing at all."

CITY TO ORDER STEEL-FRAME INSPECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to reports of quake damage to steel building frames, the Los 
Angeles City Council signaled Tuesday that the city will require the inspection 
of 400 steel-frame buildings in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Hal Bernson, the council voted unanimously to 
draft an ordinance that would require the owners of steel-frame buildings to 
pay for the costly inspections that must be completed within three months of 
notification by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the council still must vote on the urgency ordinance within two 
weeks, but city officials say the city is almost certain to go ahead with the 
inspection program as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results of the inspections, the council may consider ordering 
inspections of all 1,000 steel-frame buildings citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, owners would have one year to make any repairs ordered by 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's proposal generated concern from the head of a countywide property 
owners' association. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to recognize that this will be another expensive undertaking for 
building owners," said Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and 
Managers Assn., representing about 1,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely asked that the city provide building owners plenty of flexibility in 
completing the expensive inspections and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely told the council his group supports the proposal but wants the program to 
include time extensions for building owners who might face financial 
difficulties in meeting the proposed deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely said the city should allow deadline extensions if, for instance, a 
building is occupied or needs asbestos removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who represents the northwest Valley, said the inspection program 
would include extensions in hardship cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the program's top priority is ensuring that the buildings are 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the concerns expressed by Ely's group, Bernson's recommendation has 
generated no other serious criticism. The council approved the proposal with 
only brief discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of three other Valley council members -- Laura Chick, Richard 
Alarcon and Marvin Braude -- Bernson proposed the inspection ordinance in 
response to widespread reports that steel building frames cracked during the 
Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The frame damage surprised many engineers because steel-frame buildings are 
designed to bend without breaking in the enormous force of an earthquake. No 
steel-frame building came close to collapsing in the quake, inspectors have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the quake, inspectors reported finding cracks in the steel 
frames of at least 60 buildings up to 23 stories high in heavily damaged areas 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection program has targeted only buildings in the hardest-hit Valley 
and Westside areas. The inspections have to be performed by private structural 
engineers, sometimes using ultrasonic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, inspectors must tear into walls and strip steel columns of 
fireproofing to examine the frames for cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 It would cost between $4,000 and $6,000 to inspect buildings no more than six 
stories high and between $10,000 and $12,000 for taller buildings, city 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely said he does not know whether building owners can get financial help from 
the federal government to pay for the inspection and repair of damaged 
steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his group is looking into finding some financial assistance for 
owners.

POPULATION GROWTH AT NEW LOW; MIGRATION: INCREASE IN STATE RESIDENTS IS THE 
LOWEST SINCE 1940-41. WEAK ECONOMY IS TO BLAME, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The net migration to recession-battered California last year was the lowest 
since such record-keeping began in 1940-41, the state Department of Finance 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, an estimated 65,000 more people migrated to the state in 1993 than 
moved out, the department noted in its annual population report. Before this 
report, the lowest net migration on record was 81,000 people in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County experienced a similar sharp decline in migration. The county had 
a net increase of only 4,356 people last year, the smallest numerical rise 
since the state began keeping such records for counties in 1970. The smallest 
previous increase was 12,000 during the recession of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we seem to be seeing is that the sagging California economy is not 
attracting people to come here from other parts of the U.S. like it used to 
do," said John Malson, a state demographer who helped prepare the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is in such a state of flux that people who would normally leave 
their homes to move here are deciding not to do so -- or go elsewhere when they 
do move." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Levy of the nonprofit Center for the Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Palo Alto agreed with the state's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The falloff in migration is a direct result of the long California 
recession," Levy said. "People move primarily for jobs and there haven't been 
any new jobs to move to in California in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we would expect the migration trend to turn around when the economy picks 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California's population in 1993 grew by 1.4%, or 439,000 people, the 
smallest increase since the state added 404,000 people in 1976-77. The majority 
of the increase is because of births, although the number of births was also 
down for the fourth year in a row from the peak of 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also showed the continuation of a 1990s population trend, in which 
growth has slowed each year. In 1992-93, the state grew by 540,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's population reached 31,961,000 as of Jan. 1, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the Gold Country of the western Sierra grew by the largest 
percentage, at 2.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerically, the counties that added the most people were all in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County added 71,800 people; San Diego County grew by 41,200; 
Riverside County added 34,000, and San Bernardino County increased by 26,400. 
Orange County increased by 41,500 -- more than 37,000 due to births. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two counties lost population. Sparsely populated Alpine County in 
Northern California declined by 30 people, and Monterey County dropped by 
3,700, mostly because of the closure of Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the 1970s, the city of Los Angeles did not lead the 
state's cities in population growth, the report said. Although Los Angeles 
added 12,200 people, San Diego and San Jose added more, 14,200 and 13,800, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on percentage, the fastest-growing cities in California last year were 
the small communities of Adelanto at 18.7%; Delano, 16.6%; Lathrop, 13.2%; 
Coronado, 12.7%, and Twentynine Palms, 12.4% 
</P>
<P>
 The report tracked population for all counties and 468 cities in the state. Of 
the cities, 436 showed growth, while 30 cities lost population and two had no 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The report bases its estimates on a number of factors, such as construction of 
housing, the census average of people per household, driver's license address 
changes and school enrollment.

DETOUR ROUTE'S BUSINESSES WON'T MISS THE HASSLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Moe Disesso, 70, a Hollywood animal trainer, said his business went to pieces 
when the freeway did. 
</P>
<P>
 Disesso, who also sells Native American crafts at Moe's Trading Post (which is 
at his home) along The Old Road, saw his peaceful road become a congested 
detour of the Golden State Freeway after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how miserable we've been here," the Newhall resident said. 
"Every night we can't sleep. Every night someone is blowing their horn, getting 
in fights, cops are blowing their sirens. . . . Something is always going on 
all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Disesso was just one of the many Santa Clarita-area residents happy to see the 
southbound lanes of the freeway reopen Tuesday afternoon, nearly a month ahead 
of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Disesso said his movie animal training business came to a halt because a fence 
was placed across his driveway and companies refused to make deliveries through 
a temporary entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his trading post has done "no business at all" since the earthquake 
because potential customers experienced the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gavin Canyon bridge on the Golden State Freeway just north of the Antelope 
Valley Freeway interchange collapsed during the magnitude 6.8 temblor. Caltrans 
renovated 3 1/2 miles of The Old Road, creating a detour that could handle 
about half of the Golden State's normal traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and commuters praised Caltrans for its speedy work in providing an 
alternate route, but those who suddenly found themselves in the middle of the 
construction were much less enthusiastic when access to their homes and 
businesses proved difficult or impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin Orantes can almost breathe a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 He manages the Carrows restaurant near where Calgrove Boulevard joins the 
Golden State Freeway. Concrete barriers have been directing freeway traffic 
away from the eatery and onto the detour. The restaurant was only a quarter 
full at mid-morning Tuesday before the southbound lanes reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty excited," he said. "It's going to help us." But Orantes said he 
won't feel completely at ease until the barriers across Calgrove Boulevard are 
removed later this week, allowing traffic on the Golden State Freeway and The 
Old Road access to his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, motorists who wanted to get to Orantes' restaurant had to 
exit the freeway a mile north of the restaurant and take surface streets to the 
winding two-lane road that leads to the eatery. Orantes said most people 
apparently didn't want to go to all the trouble, causing the restaurant to lose 
up to 75% of its business and lay off about half its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But employees at some businesses said their worries aren't over yet. Judy 
Schuelke, office manager of the Oak Tree Gun Club, said she worries how 
customers will get to the shooting range at the southern end of the detour 
until The Old Road is back to normal. Southbound motorists have access to the 
range -- and to several other homes and businesses in the area -- only by 
exiting through a hole cut in a fence on the freeway shoulder, or by going 
several miles south to Roxford Street in Sylmar, then taking The Old Road back 
north to a bridge that leads to the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell someone who's never been here . . . to pull off the freeway 
through the orange cones and go through a hole in the fence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuelke said the club is only doing about 25% to 30% of its normal business 
and is still waiting for a Small Business Administration loan to help pay off 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 And the damage may be permanent at Calgrove Kennels at the detour's north end. 
The kennel closed after the earthquake when noise and fumes from traffic on The 
Old Road threatened the animals' health. Drivers carrying dog food, propane and 
milk also refused to make deliveries to the kennel because of the sudden and 
dangerous turns required to get in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lovingood, who said in an interview three weeks ago that he is not sure 
if he will reopen his kennel, declined comment Tuesday on the freeway's 
reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't print what I have to say. . . . I'm angry," he said.
