 ONE MORE TIME: Thousand Oaks voters, just recovered from the fall's bitter 
City Council campaign, can look forward to a special election to fill a vacant 
council seat (B4). . . . During a debate on the issue, the shrill chirp of a 
cricket punctuated the state-of-the-art sound system at City Hall -- leading to 
a mid-meeting search for the insect. "They're good luck in the Orient," said 
Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz. . . . Maybe the luck will trickle down to 
candidates mulling bids for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 SHORT SUPPLY: A nationwide blood shortage has prompted Ventura County health 
workers to step up the push for donors. . . . While the county's blood supply 
is not lacking, Los Angeles and areas of Texas and New Mexico are in need, 
particularly of type O-positive. . . . Year-end blood shortages are common, but 
the number of donors started declining earlier than usual this year, said 
Lauren Mourmouris of United Blood Services, the county's only blood provider. . 
. .. To make an appointment to donate, call 654-8104. 
</P>
<P>
 FINE DINING: School cafeterias and fine cuisine are usually mutually exclusive 
-- but not at Oxnard College (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Drawn 
together by a love of good food, aspiring chefs in the college's program for 
hotel and restaurant management prepare six meals a week and serve them in the 
cafeteria. Menus feature foods from around the world. . . . Budget-minded 
gourmets, take note: The program opens its doors to the public once a week, 
offering top-flight food at a bargain price. 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN TO SIZE: Get a phone bill, save a tree. . . . Officials at GTE in 
Thousand Oaks said they have started printing telephone bills on both sides of 
the paper, a move they say will save about 3,000 80-foot-tall trees a year. . . 
. The change was driven by demand from some of the company's 3.1 million 
customers weary of wading through lengthy bills, said site manager Phillip 
Williamson. The new version should trim the number of pages in the average 
customer bill -- if not the amount -- by about half.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: SIMPLICITY FIT FOR A QUEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Queen Margot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Based on Alexandre Dumas' novel, Catholic Marguerite of Valois -- 
also known as Margot (Isabelle Adjani) -- marries Protestant Henri of Navarre 
(Daniel Auteuil) in a plan arranged by their mothers to unite France in 
1572.Six days later, thousands of Protestants are murdered in the St. 
Bartholomew's Day Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Berlin-based theatrical-costume and set designer Moidele 
Bickel. Her other film was Eric Rohmer's "La Marquise d'O." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Sixteenth-Century lite. Stretching the timeline and muting the 
period's regal glitz, Bickel favors a streamlined theatricality. She employs 
humble fabrics, forgoes such elaborate flourishes as beading, and holds the 
starch in the accordion-pleated collars for mobility's sake. Jewelry is limited 
to pearls. Her budget dictated the uncomplicated approach, but she says she 
would have kept it simple anyway. Fancy clothing would mean that "I wouldn't be 
able to see the actor, and what interests me most is the actor's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: For Margot's wedding day, Bickel substitutes her historically correct 
crown -- a round, stiff number -- with a delicate tiara of wired pearls and 
stones that would suit any modern romantic bride. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Most of the costumes were made of cotton sateen and linen. 
Margot's lavish-looking "brocade" gowns and the opulent robes worn by Catholic 
bishops came from inexpensive fabrics printed with luxuriant patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The period is not exact. The real period, the French Renaissance, I 
don't like very much. I chose a fashion period which is a little more free, 
more Baroque," Bickel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: The paintings of Theodore Gericault, Jacopo da Pontormo and 
Francisco de Zurbaran for Margot's dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: All of the principals' costumes and 600 of the 800 extras' costumes 
were custom-made in Paris. BETTY GOODWIN

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: GUESS? WHO HAD THEM TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Monday's premiere of MGM's "Speechless" at the Mann National 
theater. A party followed at the Armand Hammer Museum. Co-star Michael Keaton 
described the romantic comedy concerning political speech writers as "a very 
light, fluffy, easy, go-to-the-movies, go-home, have-something-to-eat, 
put-the-kids-to-bed, hit-the-lights, kind of movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Keaton (co-star Geena Davis was in Malta filming "Cutthroat 
Island"); director Ron Underwood; plus a celebrity-lite crowd of 1,000 guests 
including Paul Reiser, Adam Baldwin, Robert Wuhl, Meg and Jennifer Tilly, Jay 
Thomas, Ron Meyer, Lou Pitt and studio execs Frank Mancuso, Mike Marcus and 
Greg Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 What Defines Celebrity-Lite?: One clue is when TV crews start interviewing 
Cathy Lee Crosby with desperation in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Standout Guest: The party's visual pinnacle came with the arrival of hefty 
Guess? model Anna Nicole Smith in a form-fitting, floor-length, green velvet 
gown with gold lame pumps and a matching handbag. (Her muscular bodyguard holds 
the purse while she dances.) Smith's look was described by guests as "Texas 
zaftig ," "Well, it's certainly not androgynous," and "This is one model who 
definitely doesn't worry about what she eats." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Smith said she was in town to film "Davanci's War II" (whose title the 
bodyguard spells out. "He does it better," she explained.) In it she plays a 
CIA agent. An intelligence officer? "Yeah," replied the larger-than-life model. 
"I've got to get off the bimbo route." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rains Came: MGM's PR department rushed out and bought 100 $12 
umbrellas at Bullocks to ferry guests dryly from theater to museum. The party 
was moved under the archways as the Hammer's underground heated courtyard sent 
up an eerie steamy mist. 
</P>
<P>
 Topic of Discussion: In the film, reporters drink beer while doing interviews 
and covering stories. Certain members of the press thought this would be a 
wonderful idea.

BOOK REVIEW / ESSAYS; TALES OF TIME, SCIENCE AND THE AWKWARD FEEL OF HUMANITY; 
GREAT TOPICS OF THE WORLD: ESSAYS BY ALBERT GOLDBARTH, DAVID R. GODINE ($22.95,

 Call them philosophical flea circuses: diverting, raffish, unexpected and with 
a remarkable ability -- once you note the tiny thread that hitches flea to tiny 
chariot -- to express a cosmos by other means. Also a flea circus because the 
conceits manage to jump 150 times their own length and about 80 times their own 
height; and because as we watch, we have the sudden urge to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a convenient way into Albert Goldbarth's four suggestive and 
purposefully disrupted essays. All four are about time, art, science, and the 
feel and awkward fit of humanity's skin upon humanity's back. And the first, 
"Delft," although it reserves important places for Vermeer's paintings, the 
Dutch microscope-maker Antony van Leeuwenhoek, and the workings of young lust, 
is held together by fleas and the exuberant literary tricks that Goldbarth -- a 
poet and you know it -- gets them to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delft" begins with Leeuwenhoek lying beside his mistress, as any man of his 
time might do, but knowing -- as virtually nobody could until his magnifying 
devices came along -- of the teeming, heretofore invisible life on her body. 
"He knows her busy micro-citizenry is going about its daily rounds 
clearheadedly, in alpine height, in swampy Venetian recesses. O, the krill of 
her! The rotifers! The roe!" Obligingly he relieves her of a flea here and 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in "Delft," Vermeer is waiting for the light to be right ("and now 
it hits -- no, it's so gentle I'd say it endorses -- the side of a building") 
and reaching down his model's bodice for the flea that won't let her be still, 
and for some quick canoodling. And here is the narrator -- young Goldbarth, it 
seems -- with Cynthia, an early bedmate ("love was so new and I was so new that 
my heart squeaked like a boot fresh from the box"); both engaged in a 
contemporary flea hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The author is immediately off on a flea hunt through erotic literature, from 
Ovid on. But simultaneously he has been on a hunt around smallness, as one of 
the symbolic pillars on which human consciousness rests. For millennia, the 
flea was just about the littlest thing that could be seen. Comes the microscope 
and "the flea, which had been the final blank wall of the world became the door 
to a new world . . . our last visible datum before we slip over into the 
silence between black holes, electron spin, quark iffiness. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As with space, so with time. Three one-thousandths of a second is the tiniest 
interval that we can hear between sounds; anything less and it is a continuous 
buzz. The reference to time is the heart of Goldbarth's method. As 
post-Newtonian physics declares space to be curved, Goldbarth curves time until 
everything is simultaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneity shapes the next essay, "The History of the Universe is Important 
to This Story," in which Goldbarth shifts from the tiny to the immense. We get 
the pushy young astronomer, Kepler, wrestling with Tycho, his mentor, for 
Tycho's planetary charts; we get both men as guests of Emperor Rudolf II in a 
Prague castle, and crossing paths with the legendary Rabbi Loew, creator of the 
Golem. We get the narrator taking a college astronomy course with Noschel, his 
best friend, and the heartbreak caused by Noschel's father's decades-long 
adultery with a Gentile woman. We get Noschel's mother telling Golem stories. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, back to 17th-Century Prague: to the Keplerian formulas that would 
change humanity's sense of its place in the universe, to the building of the 
Golem, a benevolent clay hulk brought to life to ward off a threatened pogrom. 
The yearnings of two Chicago adolescents intertwine with the histories of 
science and necromancy, themselves intertwined. Take clay, from which Adam as 
well as the Golem were made. Two legends -- yet clay is a matrix for the 
development of complex, organic molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Worlds," the narrator's grandfather -- real? fictional? both? -- is 
another organic molecule, a single crystal of time around whom a whole variety 
of figures and themes take shape. Louie arrives from Poland in 1907 and goes 
west. Aboard the train he makes friends with George Herriman, who would create 
"Krazy Kat" and to whom Louie, supplies at least one Yiddishism ("mooys" for 
cows). He gets a job as assistant caretaker in the laboratory set up by 
Percival Lowell, advocate of Mars canals and discoverer, by sheer reasoning, of 
Pluto. At one point he solves the observatory's difficulty with getting its new 
telescope in focus by shoving his pulp-fiction magazine under one leg. Its 
cover story: "Under the Moons of Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 "Worlds" is a beguiling dream of simultaneities. Amy Lowell, Percival's 
corpulent, cigar-smoking poet sister, arrives with her deep devotion to Keats 
and her shared cult of the moon. Flagstaff, Ariz., becomes a focusing-glass of 
times and cultures: the Navajos and their spirits, the eccentric Bostonian 
Brahmanisms of Percival the scientist and the artist Amy, Krazy Kat's 
grass-roots American version of moonbeams, and the resourceful blend of 
Polish-Jewish meditative practicalities. Goldbarth has taken time and bent it 
into a rainbow.

NIGHT LIFE: FINNHEAD GETTING ITS ACT TOGETHER; NEARLY YEAR-OLD BAND SMOKES, 
WITH TERRIFIC GUITAR SOLOS AND DANCEABLE TUNES -- WHAT THEY CALL TROPICAL ROCK. 
AND THE SHOW IS FREE. 
</P>

<P>
 As an intro to Finnhead's first song of the evening, "Stand Up," Finhead Dave 
himself questioned the wisdom of California's new "smoke a joint, lose your 
license" law, inviting his fans to complain in writing to Gov. Pete Wilson. But 
before anyone picked up pen and paper and actually proved they could write a 
complete sentence, let alone a whole letter, the vast majority became the 
dancing part of the food (and drink) chain as Finnhead kicked off its first of 
four sets Friday night at Harbor Lights in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Finhead Dave offered no further advice but did provide the smoke -- from band 
members who were clearly on fire. The process will repeat itself this Friday 
night. The cover charge is the ever-affordable nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnhead consists of three finheads (surfers) and a swimmer, a guest conga 
player, and what every band needs, a soundman/sniper. Finhead Dave Scharnberg 
plays guitar and sings. Thom Mason seems to have a mind-bending guitar solo in 
each and every song and swears he can swim farther than the others can surf. 
Pat McDonald pumps that bass and Mark Leon pounds the drums. Half of them wear 
baseball caps. There are black lights over the dance floor, no Lakers on the TV 
and a harbor full of boats just outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue itself has been through varying incarnations, but as Harbor Lights 
seems to have the upstairs entertainment lineup figured out. Since most club 
owners change their format more times than Howard Hughes would change underwear 
in a Fruit of the Loom factory, this venue seems to believe that building a 
regular clientele revolves around a regular schedule. Every week for a few 
months, it's been like this: Ska Daddyz on Thursdays, Finnhead on Friday and 
reggae with Irie Ites on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the place for us to get our act together, and sort out our music in a 
live situation," said Mason. "And the owners here are really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The band will celebrate its one year anniversary come February. Its first gig 
was at the long gone and lamented Midnight Hour in Ventura as the Below Average 
White Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Saturday night and the club was in deep bleep," said McDonald. 
"Someone canceled and the owner, Larry, asked us to play, but we didn't have a 
singer. We saw Dave in the parking lot and asked him to play. We ended up 
playing for four hours. It was one of those 'What do you know/What do you want 
to do?' gigs. I remember we played 'Mustang Sally' for a long time and made up 
a lot of new verses. In this band, all the players are good and we even get 
paid for doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 From that night on, everything just clicked, and now the band has 45 to 50 
originals, which is a lot. They do only four covers -- two by John Hiatt, one 
by Tommy Bolan and the wildest version yet of The Chantays' "Pipeline." All the 
players have been in a variety of bands, and Scharnberg came straight from that 
popular local band, Lion I's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lead singer and, I think, not that good of a guitar player. I was 
surprised when they hired me. Man, I worked my butt off in (Lion I's). I 
learned a lot but we never made that much money because we were paying for 
recordings and lawyers and stuff like that. I quit after about 10 months 
because I wanted to sing and play my own stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Their own stuff is some reggae, some Deadhead vibes, some ska, some surf 
music, some bluesy stuff and lots of rock 'n' roll guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it tropical rock," said Scharnberg. "We also play surf music, but 
we're not a surf band even though we have about a set of surf music and songs 
about the beach and the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night is pretty much it for Finnhead, partly because they don't have a 
tape. And 90% of club owners and managers, right after they tell you they can't 
pay much, ask for a tape. Some of them would ask the Stones for a tape, but 
that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did play Art's Bar in Santa Barbara a few times," said Scharnberg. "Art 
was the only one that would hire us over the phone without asking for a tape. 
He liked us and his son, Art Jr., really liked us. Right now, we're working on 
a seven- or eight-song demo tape, something we can sell at our shows. Plus we 
want to hit the road and go to San Diego, maybe up to San Francisco, and 
everybody wants a tape." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, everyone wanted to dance. Even Finhead Dave got into the act, 
playing a lead while dancing with The Blonde -- there's one at every gig. And, 
hey guys, there were many more girls than guys wanting to dance to some 
tropical rock by the band with the funny name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with a bunch of bikers, and they used to call me 'Finhead Dave,' " 
said Finhead Dave. "I heard that a writer had called the Ska Daddyz a bunch of 
finheads from Silver Strand, and I thought 'Yeah, Finnhead, with two Ns, that's 
us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure everything stays mellow, Finnhead has what every band needs, a 
soundman/sniper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, Chris the soundman just got out of the Marines," said McDonald. "He 
was a sniper. He was in the Gulf, Saudi and Somalia. Hey, he's skinny, but he 
sure can shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Come out dancing with your hands up. Finnhead takes no prisoners starting 
around 9:30 p.m.

SOUNDS: BALLET AND MASTER CHORALE TOP BILL OF WEEKEND FARE; 'NUTCRACKER' DEBUTS 
AT CIVIC ARTS PLAZA. A CAMARILLO CHURCH AND SAN BUENAVENTURA MISSION WILL BE 
SITES FOR VOCAL PROGRAM.

<P>
 If it's true that an arts compound isn't truly broken in until it hosts the 
perennial "Nutcracker," this weekend will be a landmark one in the life of the 
Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks. Doing the honors will be the California 
Dance Theater along with the Conejo Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you might think about Tchaikovsky's lavish ballet, it's one of the 
more benign of seasonal phenomena. It also enjoys special distinction as a 
piece that offers young concert-goers early exposure to classical music and 
dance. From "The Nutcracker" sprouts potential classical aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 For other holiday-minded music, don't forget "A Christmas Odyssey," the 
Ventura County Master Chorale's thinking-person's program. Vaughan Williams' 
"Carol Fantasy," Britten's "A Boy Was Born" and Santa Barbara-based composer 
Emma Lou Diemer's "A Feast for Christmas" all will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master Chorale will sing at Mount Cross Lutheran Church in Camarillo on 
Saturday night, but for more ambience, catch the program at the San 
Buenaventura Mission on Sunday at 4 p.m. SPEAKING OF THINGS CHORAL 
</P>
<P>
 Is Ventura County's classical music scene threatened by overcrowding, with its 
complement of classical organizations and the ante now upped with the 
programming at the Civic Arts Plaza? You wouldn't know it by head counts. 
</P>
<P>
 An overflow audience packed into the evocative confines of the Ojai 
Presbyterian Church a few weeks ago for the opening concert of the Ojai 
Camarata's short season. During the three years of its existence, music 
director Charles McDermott has honed his 24-voice ensemble into an admirable 
musical entity, often with an exploratory spirit in its programming. 
</P>
<P>
 With the title "Hispanica Viva!" the concert's theme was self-evident, but the 
range of music on the program defied easy categorization. Material shifted from 
that of Spanish Renaissance composer Cristobal Morales to a short piece by 
Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. Vocal works were interspersed by cameos 
from guest soloist Deborah Schwartz, a marimbist of no uncertain power. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the primary attention went to the premiere of a choral suite 
extracted from Miguel del Aguila's yet-to-be-produced opera "Cuauhtemoc." Del 
Aguila, the bold young Uruguay-born composer who now lives in Oxnard, wrote the 
opera, based on the last Aztec emperor, two years ago and is beginning to hear 
snippets of the huge opus manifested in concert settings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, del Aguila accompanied on piano as the Camarata spun through several 
themes detached and rewoven from the original operatic context. Even in this 
truncated form, we got a sense of the melancholic thrust of the story, about an 
emperor stripped of power and a once-mighty culture deflated by conquerors. 
</P>
<P>
 From the robust yet teasing evidence heard here, the musical language remains 
true to del Aguila's pluralistic tendencies, combining Latin American and 
Western European musical tradition and high and pop culture without apology. No 
apology necessary. ON THE CHAMBER FRONT 
</P>
<P>
 Another healthy-sized crowd filed into the Ventura College auditorium recently 
for the Ventura County Chamber Orchestra's program, "The Art of the Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal timing was auspicious. Somehow, chamber music, with its intimate 
scale and easily grasped vitality, is a form well-suited to this time of year. 
Add to that a mostly baroque program and the lovely repast of Corelli's 
"Christmas Concerto" to open and you had a concert in sync with the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber orchestra, under Burns Taft for two years now, is a taut yet 
flexible unit. The ensemble makes a persuasive case for the importance of this 
humbler orchestral force in the county's classical music scene, especially at a 
time when the Civic Arts Plaza tends to have us thinking in terms of bigger, 
better, brighter, more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 At this genteel and satisfying concert, a lot was made with a little. Flutists 
Carol Lockart and Charla Gulino shared the spotlight on Galuppi's Concerto for 
Two Flutes in E Minor and Telemann's Concerto in A Minor for Two Flutes, 
spinning crisp, amicable lines together and apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Flutists, not often called upon for soloist services, need love, too. Ditto, 
guitarists, whose opportunities as orchestral soloists are less than abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 Another guest soloist, guitarist Matthew Greif, brought clarity to Giuliani's 
early 19th-Century Concerto in A Major for Guitar. This is a smart guitarist's 
vehicle clearly built around the instrument, with its inherent dynamic 
limitations and capacity for precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif rose to the musical occasion, from the richly tuneful Andante to the 
digitally challenging Polonaise to close. Taft led his modest, deft complement 
of a dozen players over an orderly musical terrain and left a solid impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first two concerts of the Chamber Orchestra season have focused 
on older repertoire, newer sounds are imminent. The remaining two concerts in 
the season, on March 18 and May 20, will feature music by Hindemith, Falla and 
respected Ventura-based composer John Biggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite competition from other parts of the county, the still-fledgling 
Ventura Chamber Orchestra marches onward, armed with good intentions and a fine 
sound. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: COUSIN'S SPREADS HOLIDAY SPIRIT; MUSIC (BY LARRY DEAN AND THE 
SHOOTERS) AND FOOD ARE FREE OF CHARGE TONIGHT AT THE SIMI VALLEY CLUB. NOW 
THAT'S A PARTY.

<P>
 As holiday spirits soar it seems like everyone's gone country-Western 
Christmas crazy. So if it's country entertainment you're after this weekend, 
you've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun starts tonight with a Christmas party at Cousin's Country Saloon in 
Simi Valley. Larry Dean and the Shooters, a club favorite, will treat you to 
great danceable original and cover tunes. There will be free catered eats and 
no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean will also play Friday and Saturday. And on Tuesday and Wednesday you can 
catch Winslow, a Venice-based group playing in rotation at the club, that has 
received thumbs up from club patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin's opened its doors to country music and dancing about 2 1/2 years ago. 
But it's still the east county's best-kept country secret. The club, which gave 
us Platte River Crossing and Cactus County, has just changed hands. But don't 
worry -- the new owners, Mark Lucatorto and Craig Smead, plan to hold the 
country music flag high. 
</P>
<P>
 They've already expanded live music to six nights a week. On Sundays, deejay, 
Jmy "O", plays country karaoke hits. Fiddler Gary Howe and his band will be 
featured every Monday in December. And you can look forward to hearing local 
favorites Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers, the Rhythm Rangers, Shiloh and 
the Fender Benders in addition to Los Angeles-based country acts like Bounty 
Hunter and Lou Ann Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no cover charge in January. And innovations are already under 
way to move the stage to the corner, expand the dance floor and remove a pole 
in the floor. The club distributes a band and dance lesson calendar in addition 
to a newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dance lessons are going strong from 7 to 8:30 p.m. four nights a week. Miss 
Ila takes the floor on "Two-Step Tuesdays." Kathy Bailey adds her own style to 
"West Coast Swing Wednesdays." Gary Howells teaches a mix of couples and line 
dances on Thursdays. And Pam Donovan leads line dance night on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you go tonight, make sure Craig's mom, Katie, is practicing Black 
Velvet. She's just discovered line dancing and begged the guys to delay the 
party 'til she got back into town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Thunder Thursdays" at the Ban-Dar with Thunder radio deejay Bob Allen ends 
tonight. So don't miss a chance to win prizes, holiday country music CDs and a 
Stetson hat. Starting at 7:30 p.m. Robin Finnerty will teach a line dance, Take 
It Easy, and two partner line dances, Silver Buckle and the classic Waltz 
Across Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As you dance your way up the coast you'll find the crowd-pleasing Fender 
Benders playing up a storm tonight through Saturday at the Galleon Room in 
Goleta. The guys sounded great at the Crazy Bull a couple of weeks ago. And 
band member Dan Wilson assured me that although he wasn't wearing a hat, it was 
in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday and Saturday, the Rhythm Rangers will again be making country-boogie 
converts at the Breakers Lounge in the Holiday Inn in Ventura. Meanwhile, Sky 
King (soon to be called Caught Red Handed) will give you happy feet both nights 
at Santa Barbara's City Line Club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'll want to hit the boards running to enjoy all the family-oriented events 
planned for Saturday. K-HAY radio will host its annual Toys for Tots collection 
party from noon to 3 p.m. But the location has been moved down the road from 
the station to the parking lot of Just Tires, 4547 Telephone Road, in Ventura. 
Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers will provide the toe-tappin' music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You might want to make your K-HAY stop early. Because Ventura Harbor Village 
is the place to be for a country-Western Christmas celebration. Starting at 2 
p.m. you'll find caroling, pony rides, Santa Claus and dance exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Rangers band will perform and Rick Henderson will give line dance 
lessons from 3 to 6 p.m. in front of Carousel Marketplace. And Thunder 105.5 
radio deejays Bob Allen and Billy Gibson will broadcast live in order to accept 
food or cash donations for Food Share, Ventura County's regional food bank. 
Food Share serves 100,000 county residents each month through 260 distribution 
centers. Every dollar donated buys $35 worth of food from suppliers. And anyone 
who gives $40 or more will receive Merle Haggard's new tribute compact disc, 
"Mama's Hungry Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Then at 7 p.m. Thunder radio's boat will lead the annual Parade of Lights. And 
listeners are invited to join in the parade with the Friends of Channel Islands 
National Park and the Thunder crew. The Island Packer boats depart the dock at 
6:30 p.m. and return at 9 p.m. Thunder will provide hot apple cider. 
Participants are encouraged to bring a pot luck item and to dress warmly. The 
cost is $15 per adult and $7.50 per child, age 12 and under. To register and 
prepay, call 658-5740.

MUSIC; A LIFELONG AFFAIR WITH THE BLUES; THE HARMONICA MASTER, WHO GAME TO L.A. 
FROM MISSISSIPPI IN 1958, WILL PLAY AT THE UNDERGROUND IN SANTA BARBARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For veteran blues harmonica master Johnny Dyer, the good ol' days aren't then, 
they are right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer and his sidekick, guitar whiz Rick Holmstrom, play the Underground in 
Santa Barbara on Saturday night, where they will showcase tunes off Dyer's 
latest, "Listen Up." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have improved a lot for Dyer since the old days and his first gig in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about 13 years old at the time, and I made three bucks," said Dyer 
during a recent phone interview. "Some buddies and I put a band together. They 
paid us nine bucks -- three bucks each. We started getting other little jobs, 
like plantation gigs on Sunday afternoons. I'll tell you, when I first came to 
California, it was hard to make nine bucks. That's just the way things went 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer was born in Muddy Waters' hometown of Rolling Fork, Miss., in 1938, or 
back when FDR had fans other than PBS viewers. It sounds like a good place to 
be from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a blues place, man, when I was there," Dyer said. "In that part of the 
world, you worked in the fields six days a week, then Saturday night you got 
drunk on moonshine. There's really nothing to do except work, and some people 
just picked up a guitar and would play. It's changed a lot since I left; 
there's been a lot of generations since then. There's a lot of TV watching and 
people see different things they want to be like." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer began his musical career at a tender age. While most boys were busy 
playing with toy soldiers, Dyer was playing along with Sonny Boy Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started playing around the age of 7," he said. "I used to listen to Sonny 
Boy out of Helena, Ark., when he had his King Biscuit thing going. I always 
wanted to play some sort of instrument, and one of my friends lost his 
harmonica one day, and I found it. When he came looking for it, I hid it, and 
I'd go across the soybean field to learn how to play. Later, my mom made me 
give it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the latter part of the 19th Century, a steady stream of rural southern 
blacks -- lured in part by the promise of factory jobs -- packed up for New 
York, Chicago or other large northern cities. But Dyer didn't head north. Like 
those Dodgers, he headed West, arriving the same year, 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I had an uncle that left there and came here," he said. "He wanted me 
to come out here, and when I was 19 years old, I packed my clothes and left. 
When I got out here, I met George (Harmonica) Smith, Harmonica Fats, all those 
guys. After I was here about two years, I hooked up with George, and we played 
some as a father and son act." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1958, there were a few million fewer people in L.A., less traffic, few 
freeways and considerably less gunfire. What was L.A. like in those days? 
</P>
<P>
 "In '58, L.A. was great -- lotsa music all over the place. You could go 
anywhere and see good music -- all the big guys were always coming through," 
Dyer said. "Then in the early '60s, I stopped playing for awhile because there 
was no good blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then around 1968 or so, Muddy Waters came and George and I went to see him. . 
. . George went on the road with Muddy, I started playing again, and I've been 
at it ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Pay for the blues men is still at the $3 level compared to that of the current 
crop of rock gods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock musicians make so much money, they can afford to kick back after one 
gig," Dyer said. "Blues guys aren't gonna make that much. It's always been that 
way and always will be, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most fiftysomething overnight sensations, Dyer is getting by with a 
little help from his friends. Number 1 on the list has to be youthful guitar 
shredder, Holmstrom, a.k.a. "L.A. Holmes," an odd name for a guy from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick was working with William Clarke, and Clarke had to leave town so I sat 
in for him," said Dyer. "Then I recorded a song for one of Clarke's LPs and ran 
into Rick again. We started getting little gigs together and we recorded this 
tape just for PR purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent it to Black Top about a year ago, and it became "Listen Up." We've 
been getting some darn good response. We just finished another album which 
should be out in April. It used to be strictly down to earth, but we're trying 
to get it out of that old 12-bar blues stuff by adding some swing to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers may be on temporary hiatus 38 years later, but Dyer has no such 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, if I was making that kind of money, I wouldn't even think about no 
strike," he said. "I can't afford no strike." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Johnny Dyer Band. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Underground, 110 Santa Barbara St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday at 9 p.m.

GOINGS ON; AN AFFAIR OF NOTE WILL BOOST MUSIC EDUCATION; CLASSICAL ARTISTS WILL

 New York-based pianist Lincoln Mayorga feels strongly about supporting musical 
education for today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big concern all over the country. I'm particularly concerned about 
school music programs, which are continuing to lose ground," said the former 
Camarillo resident and onetime student at Santa Barbara's Music Academy of the 
West. "Anything I can do to help, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why he's making a homecoming of sorts, with his participation in "A 
Celebration of Music & Youth," a concert at the Lobero Theatre on Sunday, to 
benefit the Music and Arts Conservatory for Santa Barbara area junior and high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be playing music close to me, by Brahms and by Gershwin," said the 
versatile musician, whose credits include film and television soundtracks and 
an extensive touring schedule. "I really do cross over in the truest sense. 
When I give recitals, I try to make the connections between American popular 
music and its European cousins." 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Gilles Apap, the Santa Barbara Symphony concertmaster, will join 
Mayorga in concert, as will the Anacapa String Quartet and members of the music 
conservatory. Violinist Nina Bodnar, who made her debut with the Santa Barbara 
Symphony at age 8 and now serves as concertmaster of the St. Louis Symphony, 
will also be in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Brahms and Gershwin, the program will also include pieces by 
Mozart and a Gypsy trio. The concert will begin at 5 p.m. Tickets are $25 
(general), $50 (preferred seating and post-show reception). Call 963-0761. The

THEATER REVIEWS; HOLIDAY CLASSICS IN A NEW LIGHT; THE ORIGINAL 'NUTCRACKER' 
TALE GETS A DALI-ESQUE SPIN AND 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' IS REPRODUCED AS A 
BRITISH-STYLE PARODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of that perennial onslaught of "The Nutcracker" and "A Christmas 
Carol" revivals, it's refreshing to see adventurous new spins on familiar 
material -- which are downright exhilarating when they succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two wildly different but satisfying cases in point: Lit Moon Theatre Company's 
avant garde adaptation of "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King," the original 
Ernst Hoffman tale that inspired the famous Tchaikovsky/Petipa ballet, and 
Ensemble Theatre Company's riotous parody of British-style community theater in 
"The Farndale Avenue Housing Estate Townswomen's Guild Dramatic Society's 
Production of A Christmas Carol!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lit Moon's staging of the little-known Hoffman story as a drama with musical 
embellishment takes on a darker, more philosophical tone than the sugar-frosted 
ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the fluid borders between dreams, waking life and imagination are 
constantly shifting in the quintessentially German Romantic-era adventures of 
young Marie (Shana M. Lynch), who gets drawn into the realm of the mechanical 
toys created by her godfather, Drosselmeier, a mysterious clockmaker (played by 
various members of the ensemble at different periods in his life). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the exotic characters Marie encounters is the Nutcracker in the shape of 
a toy soldier (Matthew Tavianini), who turns out to be the clockmaker's nephew 
placed under a curse by the sinister Mouse King (Victoria Finlayson). Stan 
Hoffman and Michael Loring Andrews round out the cast in various roles. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the proper effect, picture a trip to Chuck E. Cheese as envisioned by 
Salvador Dali. Wildly imaginative masks and costumes by Lesley Finlayson, and a 
surreal set by Theodore Michael Dolas situate the wide-roaming plot in multiple 
overlapping realities. Just keeping track of where we are at any given moment 
is a challenging proposition -- and sometimes a losing one, for Hoffman's 
enthusiasm for ambiguity is clearly shared by the show's adapter and director, 
John Blondell. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it's an innovative and rewarding evening that puts Lit Moon's 
signature style of movement and visual-based storytelling to good use.

<P>
 While Lit Moon engages us with a dazzling puzzle box, the Ensemble Theatre 
Company aims right for the funny bone with the return engagement of those 
bickering matrons from the Farndale Avenue Housing Estate Townswomen's Guild 
Dramatic Society as they attempt to stage their disastrously bad production of 
"A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas Carol" is the most accessible of the satirical series by David 
McGillivray and Walter Zerlin Jr. in which the feuding biddies mangle the 
classics, Monty Python-style. 
</P>
<P>
 When the doomed production's co-director Phoebe Reece (Emma Jane Huerta), 
steps onto the stage to introduce the piece, we sense somehow that something's 
wrong. Maybe it's her offhand query, "This is just a shot in the dark, but has 
anyone in the audience ever played Scrooge?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the delayed performers arrive before Phoebe's time-killing banter 
has worn out its welcome. All the members of the 1992 ensemble cast reprise 
their roles -- Gretchen Evans as the imperious thespian playing Scrooge, 
Cherilyn Milton as the well-meaning ditz, Nancy Nufer as the plucky victim of a 
shopping cart pileup whose neck brace and cane somewhat hamper her sprightly 
roles, and Christopher Vore as the dour, bespectacled stage manager unwillingly 
drafted into some of the supporting parts. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the results are funnier than before. As the cast executes 
split-second timing under the assured guidance of director Robert Grande-Weiss, 
the polish of well-rehearsed routines is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 The best scene is the one whose snappy dialogue is between Evans, her head 
poking through a painted prop of Scrooge in bed, and Vore, still stuck in the 
door from his previous appearance as the ghostly apparition in the knocker. 
When she asks if he can sit down, we can well appreciate his ad-lib, "I prefer 
to stand, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 As before, TFAHETWGDSPACC (as it's affectionately known to the group's friends 
and family) is a welcome pay-back for the ghosts of Christmas plays we've all 
had to endure. Details

COVER STORY: COOKING UP A STORM IN THE CLASSROOM; CULINARY STUDENTS AT OXNARD 
COLLEGE GO OUT OF THE FRYING PAN AND INTO THE FIRE PREPARING SIX MEALS EACH 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Flames, two feet high, leap from the searing chicken teriyaki, steam pans keep 
noodles at the ready-to-serve temperature, plates sit in the warming oven and a 
stock pot the size of Rhode Island simmers with egg flower soup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two more vegetarians!" shouts the waiter. A smiling chef sprinkles some soy 
sauce, a little garlic powder and a little more Oriental seasoning over the 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner at a local Asian restaurant? No, the Wednesday luncheon at Oxnard 
College -- prepared by students in the hotel and restaurant management program 
-- features a Far Eastern menu this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations begin at 8 a.m. Ricardo slices red pepper and crushes peanuts. 
Val chops onions, cabbage and carrots. Gary cuts chicken and beef into 
bite-size pieces. Coral sautes bananas in butter and brown sugar, and Al goes 
from station to station -- tasting, advising and making sure everything 
proceeds on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Pans, all shapes, all sizes -- some 30 inches across -- sit at the ready. 
Twenty-four-inch-long whisks, eight tongs, 12 ladles and mixing blades as wide 
as Aunt Freda hang from ceiling-suspended hooks. The walk-in fridge houses 60 
dozen eggs, 20 gallons of pasta sauce, lettuce for about a hundred and enough 
cheese to keep an entire Wisconsin town in business. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a steamer that will do vegetables for 100 people in three minutes, a 
"buffalo chopper" that will chop 25 pounds of onions in 90 seconds, five pizza 
ovens, two convection ovens, a grill to die for and a 15-gallon stove inset for 
sauce preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no wimpy "home ec" kitchen. These people mean business. 
</P>
<P>
 By 11 a.m., it's all coming together. Lisa has collected leaves, berries and 
other foliage from the college grounds and made centerpieces for each table. 
Marco, today's headwaiter, has donned his green cutaway jacket and 
half-glasses; Thomas, Joan and Nancy are in cummerbund and tie, ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Tejeda, Valerie Ordone, Gary Billingsley, Coral Elandt, Lisa Beamer, 
Marco Batun, Thomas Balades, Joan Yates and Nancy Schumacher are all students 
in the hotel and restaurant management program at Oxnard College. Al Alviar is 
their mentor, one member of the culinary arts faculty at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the Oxnard program prepare and serve six full meals every week. 
Three are lunches for the college cafeteria, two are cafeteria dinners and one 
is a weekly luncheon that is open to the public. The latter is the best meal 
deal in town. For under $5, diners get food prepared to meet with the 
instructor's approval, with rotating weekly choices of American, Southwest, 
Middle Eastern and Far Eastern menus. (In January, the ambience will be that of 
an Italian bistro.) 
</P>
<P>
 Students in hotel and restaurant management come in every age, ethnicity and 
career background imaginable. But they share one abiding characteristic: They 
do now, and always have, loved cooking. And they are in this program to become 
chefs, sous-chefs, bakers, caterers or restaurant owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began as a part-time endeavor at Moorpark College some years ago 
but transferred to Oxnard College and full-time status in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program was put in the hands of Frank Haywood, who had been teaching 
in a similar program at Santa Barbara City College. Haywood brought Alviar with 
him from Santa Barbara and together they have seen the student body grow to its 
current turn-away capacity of more than 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable among the program's accomplishments is the way the culinary students' 
efforts have been meshed with the needs of the college cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, culinary students took on more than 90% of the food preparation for 
the cafeteria, which had been running in the red for some years. It took three 
years, but by 1990, the cafeteria budget went from red to black due to an 
expanded menu and reduced labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their classwork, the students plan, prepare and serve much of the 
cafeteria menu -- simultaneously getting exposure to the planning, purchasing 
and pricing of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just teach them how to cook and bake," Haywood said. "They learn how 
to manage food, how to make money from food." 
</P>
<P>
 "The management-by-menu class teaches us how to find out what's selling, how a 
particular menu item is doing," said Beamer, a second-semester student in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Beamer, a former secretary and receptionist who was laid off just before 
Christmas last year, says she is thrilled with her experience in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of teamwork and camaraderie with the other students," she said. 
"We're all ages, all colors, all sizes, but we really work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the program have a variety of alternatives from which to choose. 
The options begin with certification from the Ventura County Community College 
District in culinary-food service, restaurant management and hotel management. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, through cooperative ventures, a culinary certification is 
available from the American Culinary Federation Educational Institute, and 
management diplomas are offered from the Educational Foundation of the National 
Restaurant Assn. and from the American Hotel and Motel Assn. These are obtained 
after completion of additional courses recommended and approved by the 
professional organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Students may also opt for an associate of science degree, which means they 
must complete the general education courses required of all degree-seeking 
students. The associate degree is needed if a student plans to transfer to 
another institution for a baccalaureate. Oxnard College articulates with Cal 
Poly Pomona's hospitality program, which accepts all hotel and restaurant 
management units for transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding which route to take can prove difficult, however. When she entered 
the program, Beamer knew she would love the cooking aspects and was equally 
sure she would dislike the baking. "I've always hated baking, but since I 
started this (baking) class, I've completely changed my feelings about it. I'm 
now baking bread at home and making brownies from scratch," she said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow student Balades does not share her enthusiasm for baking. "I can't make 
an eclair worth a darn," he said. "I've definitely crossed pastry chef off my 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, however. Balades, in his fifth semester of the program, was 
recently accepted to Rhode Island's prestigious Johnson and Whales, the only 
school in the country that offers a bachelor's degree in culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
 While Balades found his niche early in life, coming to the Oxnard College 
program directly from high school, many of the students are career-change 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates is one such student. At 55, with a master's degree in speech pathology 
and audiology, Yates decided she needed some change in her life. "I was coming 
home so burned out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in her third semester, Yates holds down three jobs while she attends the 
food program. To help her meet the tuition requirements (Yates pays $50 a unit 
instead of the usual $13 because she already has a bachelor's degree), she 
applied for and received scholarships from the American Express Restaurant 
Writers' Assn. and from the HRM Club, an organization of students in the 
program who hold fund-raisers to provide financial assistance to other 
students. (This month, the club is selling personalized gingerbread men to add 
money to the scholarship coffers. For order information, see the Details box.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has answered everything I wanted," Yates said. "I love the 
hands-on aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend 12 to 18 hours per week in the lab -- the kitchen -- and about 
five hours a week in the classroom. It is during the lab time that students 
prepare lunch and dinner or cater for clubs and organizations in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Another favorite activity for students is running the Make-Your-Own Strawberry 
Shortcake booth at the Strawberry Festival each May. This year, they used 
10,000 pounds of strawberries to serve 11,000 shortcakes over the two-day 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also have the opportunity to serve as proxy contestants in the 
Berry-Off competition. The Berry-Off, an international recipe contest, holds 
its finals at Oxnard College each April. Contestants who are not able to make 
the trip to Oxnard may have a student stand in to prepare the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Former hotel and restaurant management students are scattered throughout the 
country. Some have gone on to Cal Poly, others to Oxnard's Mandalay Beach 
Resort, the Wedgewood Banquet Facility and the Hilton Financial Plaza. 
Billingsley will soon leave for San Francisco's California Culinary Academy. 
Recent husband-and-wife graduates have opened their own cafe and bakery in 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1:30 p.m., the Wednesday lunch rush has ended, all the patrons have gone. 
The "restaurant staff," looking only a little worse for the wear, finally sits 
down to enjoy the fruits of its labor. They look tired, content and more than a 
little proud. Cookies for the Masses 
</P>
<P>
 Having the family over for the holidays? How about the family and all their 
friends? The following recipe for cinnamon pecan cookies from Oxnard College's 
hotel and restaurant management program may be just the thing. The recipe makes 
27 pounds of cookies. You can divide ingredients for a lesser crowd.

 What triggers an idea, fires the imagination and keeps a writer plotting and 
plodding for years? 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Cocquyt invested years of research and four more years writing "Celtic 
Heart" a 600-page historical novel set during the Roman invasions of the 
British Isles in the 1st Century A.D. The author, who raises horses in the Simi 
Valley, was researching an alternative to metal mouth bits when she discovered 
material about the equestrian skills of the ancient Celts.

ART EXHIBIT; AN INVITING LOOK AT PRE-COLUMBIAN CREATIVITY; PRESENTATION AT 
SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM INCLUDES FASCINATING EXAMPLES OF WORKS FROM COLLECTIONS OF 
SEVERAL MUSEUMS.

 Exotic, pagan unfathomable. If you are anything like me, these are words you 
would use to describe the objects that constitute a pre-Columbian art exhibit. 
Add exceedingly erudite text and descriptions and you have the all-too-typical 
and oh-so-forgettable museum experience that many of us have come to expect. 
Then again, as fascinated as we Westerners are with distant and ancient 
cultures, we don't necessarily want our exotica served up too familiarly. It 
would lose its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The current exhibit at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, "Sacred Gifts: 
Pre-Columbian Art and Creativity," which runs until March 12, has struck a 
proper balance. It doesn't bludgeon the average person over the head. It makes 
museum-goers work a little to gain an appreciation of the select meso-American, 
Central American and Andean objects in the exhibit. There are no simulated tomb 
excavations, replete with ornate grave goods and a soundtrack of distant macaws 
and howler monkeys, but the exhibition does educate in a user-friendly sort of 
way. This is largely due to the persistence and scholarship of exhibit curator 
Jeanette Favrot Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson is a professor of art history at UC Santa Barbara, specializing in 
the ancient American civilizations. She organized the diverse array of objects 
-- from bizarre clay figures with oversized heads to black-stone masks and 
feather headdresses -- according to the materials they were made from. This 
simple format for Santa Barbara's first pre-Columbian show is the key to its 
success. Ranging from polychrome pottery, textiles, and objects made of stone, 
precious metals, shell and feathers, the artifacts on display demonstrate the 
variety of materials used in the Americas before the Spanish conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson sees the exhibit as an opportunity to reach beyond the classroom and 
expose the general public to pre-Columbian art and the distinct cultures that 
produced it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have grown weary of scholarship that has become excessively esoteric and of 
academicians who can only be understood by those who speak the same language," 
she said. Her goal is to demystify the ancient cultures of the Americas by 
stressing the strong unifying elements that existed among the different groups 
represented in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-Columbian people held a "fundamental belief in the sacred landscape," said 
Peterson said. The gods, ancestors and spirits who controlled natural cycles 
and the earth's fecundity were thought to be receptive to the offerings and 
ceremonies through which humans petitioned their generosity. Works of art often 
signified elite status and, when used in ritual, were thought to enhance their 
owner's influence in the supernatural realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson is widely regarded, by students and colleagues alike, as an 
exceptional scholar and teacher. Much scholarly and scientific investigation 
was required to determine the authenticity and provenance, where possible, of 
each piece considered for the exhibit. Museum curators and private collectors 
worldwide are re-sorting their storeroom shelves and displays to separate the 
cunning forgeries from genuine pre-Columbian artifacts. This is why Peterson 
began her selection of artifacts for the current exhibition in the museum's 
basement. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye well-trained in the design elements of pre-Columbian cultures, 
Peterson culled out aberrant pieces -- those that did not conform to the design 
qualities, spatial relations and iconography within the various canons of 
pre-Columbian art. 
</P>
<P>
 "All objects have stories to tell, largely through a visual and pictorial 
language," Peterson said. Anthropologists and art historians study the visual 
information provided by pre-Columbian works of art for clues vital to 
reconstructing a more complete picture of the society to which they belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with chief curator Robert Henning and six UCSB graduate students over 
several months, Peterson determined that only 20 of the nearly 100 objects 
represented in the museum's permanent pre-Columbian collection were suitable 
for "Sacred Gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, an assortment of objects spanning a period from 3,000 B.C. to the 
time of European contact in the 16th Century, were assembled from eight museums 
including the UC Santa Barbara's University Museum, UCLA's Fowler Museum of 
Cultural History, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Mexican Museum 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate students who helped organize "Sacred Gifts" benefited from working 
with experts and original materials while they developed their research topics 
and documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it will probably be visitors who will get the most out of 
Santa Barbara's debut exhibit of pre-Columbian art and its accompanying written 
materials. Details

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; BRONZE STATUE PAYS HOMAGE TO ROCKY'S LEGEND; SLY 
STALLONE'S HEROIC LIKENESS STANDS 10 FEET TALL. THERE WILL BE AT LEAST 18 OF 
THEM, DESTINED FOR THE PLANET HOLLYWOOD RESTAURANT CHAIN.

<P>
 The legend of Rocky gets bigger and bigger. Right now it's about 10 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 A monumental bronze homage to the fictional palooka rolled out of a Westlake 
foundry last week. It was commissioned by Rocky himself, Sylvester Stallone, 
and cast by Westlake artist De L'Esprie, who agreed to the project even though 
her specialty is Western and Art Deco. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue is one of many that will be installed in Planet Hollywood 
restaurants, a chain owned in part by the beefcake actor. He's contracted for 
18 of the statues, but the number will go higher as the theme restaurant opens 
more franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 De L'Esprie made five visits to pose and measure Stallone. What resulted is a 
bronze that is as heroic in posture as it is in stature. Stallone's chest is 
thrust out so gallantly, his back arched so bravely that he looks more like 
he's in pain than celebrating a stunning victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted it to look more emotional than realistic," De L'Esprie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least the attention Stallone poured into the molten bronze will spare 
us "Rocky XV."

 Here's a gift idea for the TV-aholic in your family. How about a video tape 
containing the year's best commercials? 
</P>
<P>
 The trade organization Communications Arts hands out annual awards for 
creativity and quality of execution. 
</P>
<P>
 The $215 tape includes Nike ads, of course. There's that spot for milk, where 
the daddy finds no milk for his morning cereal and both his toddler and the cat 
are unwilling to surrender their cow juice. There's the Dreyer's ice cream ad 
in which a grandma lifts up an Eisenhower-era sedan to retrieve a tub of ice 
cream that's rolled under her car. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not deterred by the price tag, call (800) 258-9111.

 While they were slapping backs at the recent opening of the Edwards Camarillo 
Palace 12, they were wringing hands over at the Camarillo Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater manager Sally Sung was wondering how she could compete with the new 
behemoth and a similar United Artists theater slated to open this summer. 
Independent theaters often get trampled when major cinemas open because 
distributors prefer to give their big pictures to big theaters. More money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get the A and B pictures," Sung said. "Independents get the C and D 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Sung spent the weekend polling the crowd at her cinema, asking them what (if 
anything) she could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people said we should change into a bargain house. Others said 
art house. It was about 2 to 1 in favor of the bargain house."

ON THE ROAD: WHIMSICAL ART OFFERS WINDOW ON YULE CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dentist thinks it would be good to show that even Santa Claus gets his 
teeth cleaned. So Dr. Dianne Applegate's sketch for her office window painting 
shows Santa in the chair with Dr. Applegate approaching for the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 How merry. How painless. 
</P>
<P>
 The window-painting artist, Vicki Ramirez, shows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it would be better, Ramirez offers, to show Rudolph the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer getting his teeth brushed by an elf. Or by one of Applegate's many 
child patients. 
</P>
<P>
 No -- perhaps the elf should be cleaning Santa's teeth. Or would the elf 
himself get a cleaning? In any event, Rudolph with his teeth bared might look 
less than friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez gently notes that real-life likenesses -- such as that involving the 
painting of Applegate herself -- can be risky when window painting is actually 
a form of cartoon, or caricature. Often, the individuals don't recognize 
themselves as themselves, and that makes them unhappy. Maybe, Ramirez suggests, 
the simplest is best: Santa laughing in the dentist's chair with a tree and 
decorations all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate nods: Go for it. Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez goes outside, puts a piece of spattered cardboard on the concrete 
sidewalk, and sets up her paint "palette:" open jars of red, sky blue, cobalt, 
tangerine, flesh-tone, brown, black. Within three minutes she is slathering the 
window with white paint -- an outline of Santa in the chair and a Christmas 
tree in the corner. The image will be large -- perhaps 3-by-4 feet -- and occur 
quickly, in less than an hour if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Applegate appears. She's reconsidered. Back to the original sketch. 
She wants in the image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," says Ramirez, without missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to a visitor, Ramirez notes, "Well, this might be a little more 
difficult than planned." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is probably the region's busiest artist at this time of year. She 
rents her considerable talents out for a minimum of $50 and often gets $400 or 
more for large-scale holiday depictions on plate glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores want holly and snowmen. Some want choo-choo trains with Santa 
hanging on for dear life. Others want images that reveal the hobbies of 
employees within: a beach bum under a palm tree, a surfer. Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez has been doing this for 19 years and has never advertised. From a week 
before Thanksgiving till today , she paints Ventura County storefront and 
office-front windows for six days a week and up to 10 hours a day. It's a 
word-of-mouth business. This year she turned down dozens of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take anymore," she says, "though I do hate to say no, particularly to 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the year, Ramirez is a self-employed, Oxnard-based commercial 
artist, painting signs and doing illustrations. She went to college and taught 
studio art to elementary and high school students before going on her own. 
"What I like to do most of all is paint," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The current holiday business is a special joy, however, because the results 
are so immediate, so positive. People look at the finished job and, like their 
customers, are amazed. "It's like getting a pat on the back all day," she says, 
painting glasses onto a rapidly forming Dr. Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why. The images are at once fantastic and kitsch, beautiful 
and silly, well-wrought and rough-hewn. They are neither finished, permanent 
art pieces nor so crude as to be considered mere decoration by an amateur. They 
are inspired but ephemeral pieces of a seasonal vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 In this particular case, Santa is smiling broadly but displays two teeth the 
color of day-old French's mustard. Ever the sport, he's brandishing his own 
blue toothbrush, and approaching him with outstretched arms is a bespectacled 
Dr. Applegate. 
</P>
<P>
 Propaganda never looked so good. It would make any kid want to hop into the 
dreaded chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Applegate reappears. The painting -- whoosh -- is done, 52 minutes flat. 
Ramirez is about to pack up and head to Thousand Oaks for the next job. 
</P>
<P>
 Applegate looks only sort of happy, however. She's fixed on herself on the 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't wear glasses," she says, feigning good cheer. (She wears them for 
protection while working.) "And where are my eyes? Can you put blue eyes in? 
Can you make me look like a model?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," says Ramirez, without missing a beat. Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 And she commences to slop on the flesh tone, erasing Applegate No. 1 and 
creating a blank face. Waiting for this new base to dry, she jokes with 
Applegate: "I'll make you fat for this!" 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't. But the overworking of the image does mar things. Applegate No. 
2, in its strain for likeness, becomes a haunting apparition, a blue-eyed 
zombie with outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa doesn't seem to notice. Neither, likely, will the children who view it. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the image maker, Vicki Ramirez, and the dentist, Dianne Applegate, really 
know how complex and difficult it can be to do something simple and fitting in 
the name of holiday cheer.

FASHION; HUMBLE T-SHIRT EMERGES TO MAKE BOLD STATEMENT; ONCE JUST AN ORDINARY 
PIECE OF CLOTHING, IT NOW IS A BEARER OF MESSAGES THAT RANGE FROM THE SERIOUS 
TO THE RIDICULOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There are many forms of self-expression: theater, dance, music, T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this garment has in a few short decades evolved from benign underwear to 
a fashion statement / personal billboard that offers public voice to the common 
man. (And the common woman, of course; but women prefer not to think of 
themselves in those terms.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, pundits still write letters to the editor. The conversion-bound hand out 
Scripture on the streets. And pallid students still gather in stark 
coffeehouses to read existential verse. 
</P>
<P>
 But, might they only realize: There is no medium as sweet as bold letters on 
one's chest. 
</P>
<P>
 That Americans should launch this form of communication seems fitting after 
long years of toting banners to proclaim their feelings, such as "Don't Tread 
on Me" or "Down With Demon Rum!" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the earliest recorded T-shirt slogans was political. "Dew it 
with Dewey," was emblazoned on shirts in 1948 for presidential candidate Thomas 
E. Dewey, a man who was at least aphoristically ahead of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he become President, Mr. D might have brought the fad to fruition sooner. 
As it was, Harry Truman did nothing whatsoever to promote T-shirt expression, 
instead popularizing gaudy Hawaiian leisure wear. 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of this setback, the message T-shirt has made it into popular 
culture and has evolved to include diverse current themes. Protest is still one 
of these, especially as adopted by the eco-hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Save the Whales" is a favored motto of the genre. This particular plea has 
been around long enough to produce spinoffs, such as "Save the Males" and the 
newly coined "Save the Ales," although there is no indication what might be 
threatening malted liquor. Possibly tea drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Observing shirts, one notes that protest itself is becoming better humored, 
from the well-known "Stop the Violins" and "Visualize Whirled Peas" to the 
whimsical "Free the Bound Periodicals!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other shirts promote bonding with ones peers. These include feminist Tees 
("Anonymous was a Woman") and macho Tees ("The First Rule of Manhood: Never Ask 
for Directions"). 
</P>
<P>
 Arrogant messages have long been common ("This is no ordinary person you are 
dealing with") and gaining favor is their antithesis, the self-deprecating tee: 
"Bad Spellers of the World, Untie" or "If Found, Drop in Any Mailbox." 
</P>
<P>
 A sub-genre of this category is the shirt declaring infirmity due to age, such 
as, "Insufficient Memory at This Time" and our personal favorite: "OVER THE 
HILL -- What Hill? Where? I Didn't Notice Any Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the culmination of Tee diversity is found in the individualized Tee, 
intended to express any imaginable personal sentiment. And here in Ventura 
County is a plethora of shops ready to supply them on request. 
</P>
<P>
 The local population may not be using this option to its full potential, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, what people want is a shirt that says, 'Chuck is so and so old,' " 
said Amber Mullenix, store manager of Wild Tops in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big sellers, she said, are "Fifty is Nifty" and "Forty and Sporty," also 
inspired by birthday observances. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar report was given at Plum Pretty, a shirt printing booth in the 
Oxnard Esplanade Mall. Said owner Dolores Gragg: "Most of it is: 'I love my 
Grandma' or 'Mom Always Liked You Best.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say that no unique messages are ever coined. Not that long ago, 
Mullenix printed a shirt for a customer reading, "Tonka, Tonka." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a saying that her husband would say all the time when they were playing 
poker," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local shops had trouble recalling innovative shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lisak of Factory Screen Printing in Camarillo conceived a shirt reading 
"I Survived the Malathion," which has been popular in that city. But by and 
large, retirements and birthdays dominate the local slogan scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it so? When you think of the sentiments expressed in daily dialogue -- 
are none of them worth wearing? 
</P>
<P>
 We determined to combat the trend, to choose a message that would set us apart 
from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as easy as it sounds. Should the phrase be philosophical, 
flirtatious, witty? What if it offends? 
</P>
<P>
 We came to understand the common dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we turned to the idea book that Wild Tops keeps handy to help customers 
brainstorm. Right away, we were reassured. Here, agreeable titles abound -- on 
such subjects as diets, sports, hobbies and pets. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a while. But, after careful deliberation, we found our personal 
manifesto: "Backgammon Players Clear the Board." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a certain elan about it. And, it hasn't offended anyone yet.

FOR THE KIDS; SNOW IN FORECAST FOR SANTA BARBARA ZOO; THERE WILL BE TONS OF THE 
STUFF FOR YOUNGSTERS TO FROLIC IN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Christmas is almost here. The tree is up, the presents are wrapped and maybe 
the stockings are even hung. So where's the snow, your kids ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Tell them Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Zoo will have literally tons of the white stuff for kids to 
play in Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo people call it their Wild Winter Wonderland and, along with the snow, 
they will have Santa, a North Pole exhibit and such activities as making tree 
ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second year that the zoo has done this, according to Craig Issod, the 
zoo's public relations coordinator. Last year's snow extravaganza drew some 
4,000 people -- four times the usual weekend crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow actually comes via North Hollywood Ice, a Los Angeles area company 
that makes snow. They will be trucking 300-pound blocks -- 64 of them -- to the 
zoo before it opens. Then they feed the blocks into a snow blower that spits 
out what the ice pros call "fluffy" snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow, four to six inches deep, will cover a hillside 40 feet by 80 feet. 
Kids can make snow angels or snowmen and roll down the hill. Sledding won't be 
allowed, though, and snowball fights are discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of children, it's their first exposure to snow," Issod said. Even 
though it may be balmy, kids should wear boots and mittens and maybe bring 
along a change of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo will use the snow as an opportunity to spread knowledge about such 
cold weather animals as polar bears, penguins and ptarmigans. For instance, 
polar bears can swim more than 100 miles without stopping, and ptarmigans have 
feathers growing between their toes that act as snowshoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for these guys at the zoo, though. Southern California's weather is 
too balmy for them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clement C. Moore's famous poem, "The Night Before Christmas," was written in 
1922 in Troy, N. Y., where snow is no big deal. Now, Ojai's Illusions Theatre 
has put a Southern California spin on the poem. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's production, which winds up this weekend with shows Saturday and 
Sunday, weaves a Christmas Eve tale from the perspective of the mice and the 
family living in the house. It has everything from a silly sugar plum fairy 
dance to the story of "The Giving Tree." And, it's all to live music performed 
by Michael Bolotin. 
</P>
<P>
 Show times are 2 and 4 p.m. both days. Tickets are $6.50 for adults, $4.50 for 
senior citizens and children under 12. The theater is at the Ojai Center for 
the Arts, 113 S. Montgomery St. For information, call 649-2324. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can make some last-minute holiday decorations Saturday. Ventura's 
Department of Community Services has a one-hour class for kids 5 to 12 years 
old at the Barranca Vista Center. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll make three glittery ornaments to go on wreaths, mantels or trees 
during the class, which will run from 9 to 10 a.m. The cost is $7. Call 
658-4726 for information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to escape the holiday razzle-dazzle, here's a way. Nursery Nature 
Walks has openings for some of its December walks. (This is the group that 
promotes nature outings for parents and their kids, 2 months to 6 years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled this month in the Santa Monica Mountains are: two walks in Big 
Sycamore Canyon, just below Point Mugu, at 10 a.m. Friday and 3 p.m. Dec. 22, 
and a jaunt in Rocky Oaks park, near Agoura Hills, at 10 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group requests donations from walkers. For reservations, call (310) 
998-1151. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Wild Winter Wonderland at the Santa Barbara Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Cabrillo Boulevard and Ninos Drive, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>

EARTHWATCH: SOME WAYS TO RECYCLE THE BEST OF THE HOLIDAYS; THOUGHTFUL IDEAS AND 
GIFTS CAN CUT DOWN ON WASTE AND HELP MAKE THE SEASON BOTH HAPPY AND 
ECOLOGICALLY SOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The idea of a "green" Christmas isn't really startling to anyone living in our 
county. Our coastal climate means that a "White Christmas" is highly unlikely. 
But in recent years, the meaning of green has broadened -- especially in the 25 
years since Earth Day has been an annual event. Of late, ideas about a green 
Christmas have gone way, way beyond stringing colored lights on palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many important aspects of the holiday have taken on an environmental 
coloration, so to speak. Even the venerable Christmas tree has become a thing 
that is routinely recycled, replanted, even returned to companies that lease 
them to homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The county of Ventura operates two information lines dispensing "Tips for 
Eco-Holidays" (also the title of a county newsletter). Several local 
municipalities have an expert available by phone to explain how to save the 
planet, save money and save on landfill costs -- while still having a happy 
holiday. Last year, for instance, this resulted in 80,000 trees being recycled 
into garden mulch, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local fire departments, concerned more about the fire hazard posed by 
dry, inflammable Christmas trees than broader environmental concerns, have let 
it be known that a plastic version in your home would make them very happy. It 
would make this columnist happy to know if there is tree made from recycled 
plastic available. (I'm serious. Please respond if you know a source.) 
</P>
<P>
 This holiday season, some quaint customs of Christmases past are being joined 
to timely eco-consciousness. "Give a gift certificate redeemable at a local 
plant nursery," suggests Toni Moran, spokesperson for the Ventura County Solid 
Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, live, potted, and therefore reusable Christmas trees of a novel 
character -- actually sculpted rosemary bushes -- are on sale at local 
nurseries such as Green Thumb and Matilija Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Craven, Oxnard's recycling person, invoked an old California notion of 
decorating a live -- and presumably reusable -- cactus at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they're drought tolerant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ideas of local environmentalists are more recent -- indeed they would 
have been unthinkable decades ago. Had a child in the '50s been presented with 
a Christmas gift wrapped in the Sunday comics there might have been jeers or 
tears. Today's planet-wise tyke might offer a "way cool" before opening the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 For a century stale popcorn has been strung on a thread and festooned 
Christmas trees, but only since Earth Day I has it been used as packing 
material to mail breakable gifts, after which it is composted. 
</P>
<P>
 Another county recycling worker, Lorraine Timmons, provided Earthwatch with 
some ideas that businesses can adopt to green the holidays, such as leasing a 
big, living Christmas tree for the waiting or conference room. Such a 
forest-saving service is available locally. Mark Grant of Tree Concern/Plant 
Manning in Thousand Oaks (499-4385) will deliver and pick up what he called a 
"Grade AA Colorado Spruce," starting at $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's Copies, with headquarters is in Ventura, makes a big effort to use 
bags and other packing materials with a high recycled content -- and urges 
customers worldwide to specify that copying work be done on recycled paper. 
This sort of thing should, of course go on all-year round. 
</P>
<P>
 The powers that be in Ventura City Hall have taken up the cause by putting up 
a holiday display of various kinds of recycled gift wrapping suggestions. It 
surely is a sign of the times when there can be, side by side in a government 
building, fetchingly laid-out displays praising a detective-story writer (Earl

SHOP TALK; NIGHTS IN BLACK SATIN DRAW NEAR; CALIFORNIA'S CASUAL CHIC TAKES A 
HOLIDAY FOR SEASONAL GLAMOUR. AND DRESS-UP APPAREL CAN BE FOUND FOR A LOW-DOWN 
PRICE.

 Here in sunny Southern California, "The Look" has always been casual. 
Peoplewear jeans almost everywhere, even to the theater, fine restaurants and 
parties. If you are one of those women who love to dress up, you're either 
terribly frustrated or you're making plans to move to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But the holiday season does offer a brief window of opportunity for you. These 
few weeks of holiday parties -- and especially New Year's Eve -- are about the 
only time you can dress in your finery and not draw snickers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion magazines have been screaming "Glamour Is Back!" throughout this 
past season. Happily, the stores are full of velvet, silk and mohair. If you 
look in the right places, you just might find some glamorous clothes at prices 
low enough to leave room in your budget for more jeans and T-shirts in the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeding the call for more glamour, and copying big-name designers, the Gap has 
truly outdone itself. One personal favorite is a long-sleeved, ankle-length 
black velvet dress for $68. We also picked out a long black slip-dress in silk 
for $39.99. This looks great with one of the mohair cardigans (if only we could 
bear the scratching) for $42. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gap also has a great selection of luxe accessories, including velvet hats 
($16.50) and silk and velvet scarves ($26). Velvet evening bags and crocheted 
backpacks are offered at $24 and $38. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ross Dress for Less, there were velvet tunic tops by BCBG Paris for just 
$29.99, down from the original price of $84. Another favorite was a crocheted 
mohair pullover in silvery gray by the Limited for $19.99 (from $50). 
</P>
<P>
 At Marshall's, we admired velvet coordinates by ABS from $39.99 to $79.99. 
Silk blouses by KIKIT were $29.99, down from $96. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you've got a really special occasion coming up . . . like New Year's Eve 
with Warren and Annette. Try Designer Labels for Less in the Oxnard Factory 
Outlet. The men's store carries drop-dead gorgeous formal wear for men and 
women. (We've even seen black label Giorgio Armani in the past.) 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, they've got Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren dresses and gowns at 60% 
to 80% off retail. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you decide, don't forget the red lipstick and the high heels. 
Fabulous, darling!

RESTAURANT REVIEW; 'HOMEMADE' DISHES CALL FOR CAREFUL CHOICES; THINGS CAN GO 
WRONG AT MANNY'S EL TACO DE MEXICO CAFE IN NYELAND ACRES. BUT THERE ARE SOME 
DELICIOUS OFFERINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 I usually can't wait to try a new Mexican restaurant. It is especially hard to 
resist one that boasts, as the menu at Manny's El Taco de Mexico Cafe does, 
that all dishes are "homemade in our kitchen -- daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I'd been driving past the Manny's alongside the Ventura Freeway in 
Nyeland Acres, on the edge of Oxnard, for the two years it has been open, I'd 
never stopped in. There is a real down-home country bar next door -- which 
you'd think would be an enticement in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I've eaten at the Nyeland Acres location a few times -- the other 
Manny's are in Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and Moorpark -- the "homemade" claim 
is giving me less comfort. It may, at least, explain why the quality of the 
dishes is inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get a good chile relleno ($2.20), deep fried and spicy and oozing with 
cheese. Most importantly, the stuffed pepper is covered with a mixture of fried 
and seasoned sliced onions, bell peppers and tomatoes. This relleno isn't just 
sitting there, drowning in a pool of red sauce, as they frequently are. And, 
the cheese enchiladas ($1.35) are excellent -- firm and flat, the way I prefer 
them, and not puffy and soft. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't say the same, though, for the sopes ($2.75), or for the soft shelled 
tacos of carne asada ($1), both victims of the same malaise -- all that meat 
they're so busy chopping behind the counter is overcooked and dried out. The 
tacos and the sopes are almost, but not quite, saved by generous layers of mild 
or hot salsa and lots of cilantro and chopped onions. But still, it's a shame 
they can't take it easy on the meats. Manny's pork tamales ($1.35) suffer from 
the same problem -- pieces of nondescript meat buried in a dry cornmeal masa. 
</P>
<P>
 They serve a lot of guacamole at Manny's. And the quality is good -- chunky, 
with just enough seasoning and chili spices ($2.50 side dish). 
</P>
<P>
 But don't go away. They've got a dish of birria de chivo -- roasted young goat 
($5.95) -- that's a big, hot, savory dish, served covered with either hot or 
mild red sauce. Most goat dishes in this area come as a sort of stew, so it's a 
nice change to get one that isn't steeped in liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny's huevos rancheros ($3.25) may look greasy due to the oil in which the 
crisp corn tortillas are fried, but they are especially good, with eggs served 
appropriately over easy. What makes them distinctive is that they're not 
sitting in the usual pool of enchilada sauce. They do come with sauce but, like 
the chile relleno, they are layered with the same fried bell peppers, tomatoes 
and onions, and the juices from the vegetables pretty much make up the ranchero 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see that things can go wrong at Manny's El Taco de Mexico, but with 
proper selection, they can also go deliciously right. Details

 It's about that time when people generally toss out their plans to diet their 
way through the holidays. There are way too many temptations for the 
weak-willed. Here are a couple of those temptations: 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Louis Ludwig of Ventura's Pierpont Inn has released his menu for "The 
Champagne Winemaker Dinner of the Year," set for New Year's Eve. For the 
occasion, Ludwig will be pairing his creations with a line of Champagne Louis 
Roederer. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the evening's fare include a barbecued fresh foie gras; a 
braised moon stone Alaskan scallop and giant prawn wrapped in salmon bacon 
served in a pool of Uni sauce; and a pineapple frappe served over Johannisberg 
Riesling ice chips. The main course will consist of breast of American pheasant 
with gala apple coulis, alligator fritters with a French-Quarter sauce, and 
white asparagus tips with a carrot and sauce supreme. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, dessert (at which point the New Year's resolutions start to 
include heavy exercising). It will be the "Choc-La-Tier," three layers of 
chocolate-laced meringue interspersed with hazelnut, passion fruit, and 
raspberry mousses, and served with vanilla, caramel, and mango sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Hors d'oeuvres will be served at 7:30 p.m., dinner at 8:30. Dancing will 
follow the dining, so a few of those calories should slide right off. Cost is 
$75 per person. Call 653-6144 for reservations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Restaurateur Giovanni Tromba has also designed a New Year's Eve menu, this one 
for Giovanni's Restaurant in Camarillo, the oldest of his several Ventura 
County establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening will begin with a salad of mixed greens with fagioli, marinated 
mushrooms, roasted peppers and Reggiano cheese. Then comes a chicken ravioli 
dish served with sun-dried tomato pesto cream sauce, followed by grilled 
Chilean sea bass with brandy papaya-ginger sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Tromba's main course is veal scaloppine, sauted with shitake and porcini 
mushrooms in red wine, with rosemary roasted potatoes and stuffed yellow 
squash. For dessert, it will be a chocolate torte and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner will begin at 9 p.m. with dancing to follow. Cost is $60 per person, 
wine not included. Call 484-4376 for reservations.

 Season's grappling: Misty-eyed parents and grandparents were engrossed in a 
children's Christmas show at a Westside elementary school when suddenly there 
arose such a clatter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a '90s kind of clatter. A man had stood up and struck his head on the 
video camcorder of another spectator who was on his feet in the row behind. One 
witness said that the outraged filmmaker pushed the other man over his seat 
while onlookers gasped in horror. More shoving ensued until someone shouted, 
"Go outside and settle it like adults!" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the combatants changed seats. 
</P>

 They can let the lawyers settle it later.

 Roll over, Ludwig: Friday marks the 224th birthday of Beethoven -- the 
composer, not the dog. His statue resides in Pershing Square and, as you can 
see, he apparently can't bear to look at the park's new decorations, which 
include pink cylinders, orange spheres, yellow buildings and a purple tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beethoven bronze was cast before World War II through the efforts of local 
musicians. They not only raised the funds but provided inspiration to sculptor 
Arnold Foerster by playing Beethoven compositions in his studio while he 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 When then-Mayor Frank Shaw dedicated the statue, he observed that the city was 
lucky to have such a splendid Los Angeles "Sympathy" Orchestra. A classical 
gaffe.

 We're shocked that "L.A. Law" was canceled: As we mentioned, Simpson attorney 
Robert L. Shapiro was one of a dozen individuals named to Vanity Fair's "1994 
Hall of Fame." (Another honored act was the Rolling Stones.) And, now, ABC's 
Barbara Walters has included in her list of "The 10 Most Fascinating People of 
1994" Menendez attorney Leslie Abramson.

 * An ad for a package of chicken breasts with "ribs attacked." (Mary 
Fosselman) 
</P>
<P>
 * A crime log that reported juveniles "throwing rocks and homes and cars." 
(Nancy Podesta).

 And, finally, a restaurant flyer sent in by Bob Sherman that said, "Fresh Cook 
When Ordering." Sherman wonders if the cook ever gets slapped. Or attacked by 
chicken breasts. miscelLAny:

 Whimsical Will Simpson, the wild newscaster on Dr. Demento's radio show, says

"Pre-Minstrel Syndrome."

SCOTT HARRIS: TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS FOR THE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a story about drains and the money that goes down them. That giant 
sucking sound we've been hearing lately has nothing to do with Mexico. It's $2 
billion of taxpayers' money going down the tubes in Orange County. But all 
politics is local. And at my house, I've been more concerned about the slow 
gurgle of the kitchen sink and the chronic backup of the sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what I get for buying an old house and turning a weed-covered slope 
into a jungle of bougainvillea, plumbago, jacaranda and apple red: The roots 
invade the sewer line and, when worse comes to worst, my toilet runneth over. 
More than once I've erected bath towel dams and desperately phoned Roto Rooter 
or George Brazil or Action One. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, a plumber rooted my sewer but was stymied by the clog in the 
ancient kitchen drain. To replace those old pipes and repair the sewer line, he 
told me, he would have to bust through two sections of concrete walkway and do 
a lot of digging. His estimate was $3,200. I said thanks and goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend recommended his neighborhood plumber. I called John, and one of his 
men promptly came out and cleared the kitchen line. A day later, John himself 
replaced my busted garbage disposal. The bill was about $300. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was a $300 Band-Aid, of course, and not a cure. When the gurgle 
interrupted my vacation last week, I resolved to fix the sink once and for all. 
John snaked the old pipe and dug up the spot where the sink drain joins the 
sewer line, just beyond the walkway. To John, busting through the concrete was 
a last resort; his idea was to tunnel under. He warned me that it wouldn't be 
cheap, perhaps $500. I told John I might dig out the pipe myself -- or hire 
somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that would save you money," John said. "We charge $55 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 I got out the shovel and started digging. A couple of blisters later I decided 
this job required a pro. So on Sunday morning I drove down to the corner where 
the men gather each day, hoping for work. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked Almado. He said he understood plumbing and seemed eager for work. His 
hometown is Tijuana, but Almado said he's been in the United States long enough 
to have qualified for amnesty, if only he'd done the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Almado was skillful with pick and shovel. He expanded the trench and tunneled 
about a foot under the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast iron pipe was so old and brittle that it snapped in two. Almado 
pulled half of it out, then got under the house to free the other half. John 
would just have to poke the new pipe through and connect it to the sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd promised Almado $6 an hour, but paid him $40 for four hours work. We were 
both happy. A plumber might have charged $220. Almado suggested I hire him and 
a friend, an unlicensed plumber, to finish the job. But I was already committed 
to John, and I suppose there's a reason we license plumbers. John finished the 
job Wednesday, billing me $254.55. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up and it seems that my $3,200 plumbing nightmare has been cured 
for about $600. All that's left is to shovel the dirt back into the trench. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, meanwhile, has a $2-billion hole to fill. The county treasurer, 
his advisers and supervisors have rightly been blamed, but this fiasco is a 
symptom of deeper corruption: a value system that produced Michael Milken and 
Charles Keating and plumbers who propose work you don't need; a society that 
sells lottery tickets as a way to finance schools, builds poker palaces to put 
cops on the street and promotes litigation as a dandy way to make money. It's 
not surprising that a culture that prizes fame and fortune, that rewards risk 
more than hard labor, would blame its troubles on people like Almado. Remember 
the American work ethic? Now the idea is to work the angles, the margins. The 
ultimate goal is to get something for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame these tax-and-speculate problems didn't surface before the 
election, and not just for Orange County. The nature of this $2-billion loss 
would have helped put Proposition 187 in perspective. Consider this: According 
to the General Accounting Office and the Urban Institute, the net cost of 
public services to illegal immigrants in California next year will be about 
$600 million less than Orange County's losses. The hubris of a few public 
officials will cost taxpayers more than all the Almados in California. 
</P>
<P>
 And think about this: Orange County's $2 billion is gone, an utter waste. The 
money spent on illegal immigrants would educate children, protect public health 
and serve justice by putting criminals behind bars. That money wouldn't go down 
the drain; it would help maintain society's plumbing. It would pay for 
teachers, nurses, prison guards. If these folks buy this newspaper, some of my 
taxes come back to me. 
</P>
<P>
 And if I need some more serious work around the house, some of it may trickle 
to Almado.

A VALUABLE LAW-ENFORCEMENT LESSON; REPORT ON SHERIFF UNDERSCORES IMPORTANCE OF 
CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; NOW FOR THE LAPD . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The third semiannual Kolts Commission report on the Los Angeles Sheriff's 
Department was issued the other day, and what another good and helpful report 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 While filled with appropriate praise for the efforts of Sheriff Sherman Block 
in reforming his troubled department, it also had constructive and specific 
criticism of what he still needs to do to get the Sheriff's Department into 
better shape. The report reminded Los Angeles anew of the value of citizen 
participation in civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by volunteer Tuttle & Taylor lawyer Merrick Bobb and a small volunteer 
staff, the report systematically ticks off virtually every reform recommended 
by the Kolts Commission in its original report of 1992 -- the report that tried 
to do for the Sheriff's Department what the Christopher Commission sought to do 
for the Los Angeles Police Department in the aftermath of the Rodney King 
beating. The only difference is that when the Christopher Commission went out 
of existence -- after its landmark report was published but before some of its 
recommendations were adopted -- that was the last time the LAPD was subjected 
to a thorough, up-and-down public examination of what has been accomplished and 
what still needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with the Kolts panel, chaired by retired Los Angeles County Superior 
Judge James G. Kolts. Because the Sheriff's Department does not have a standing 
police commission, as the LAPD does, to oversee the progress of reform, the 
members voted to keep in place a mechanism whereby every six months the 
commission's chief counsel would issue a public progress report. That decision 
looks very wise in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
 To date the Los Angeles Police Department has had nothing comparable. And it 
would only be oversimplifying the matter slightly to suggest that this is a 
major reason why reform proceeds apace in the Sheriff's Department but seems to 
be moving at a snail's pace in the LAPD.

TOGETHERNESS A MUST IN THE BONDS FIASCO; A STATEWIDE COMMITMENT TO RECOVERY 
WILL PAVE WAY TO RESTORED CONFIDENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the week and a half since Orange County filed for bankruptcy, it has become 
abundantly clear that the state needs to take a more prominent role in 
restoring confidence among residents, investors and businesses.

<P>
 When New York City faced fiscal disaster two decades ago, Albany sent in the 
cavalry, rounding up investment bankers, creditors and politicians to help. 
Banks and insurance companies bought municipal bonds to help bail the city out. 
There was a feeling that the various communities that made up New York were in 
it together; united they stood. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of cooperation is needed now for Orange County, even though its 
fundamental social and economic structure is stronger than was New York's. 
Sacramento must reassure the bond market that it will keep a closer eye on 
Orange County when the day comes, as it will, for the county to try again to 
persuade investors to buy its bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the state is facing its own budget problems. But a good argument can 
be made that Orange County got into this mess by allowing one man, resigned 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, to take great investment risks with 
public funds because for years he earned money that helped the county make up 
for budget cuts in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has suggested financial advisers whom the county could hire 
and he has dispatched state auditors to help assess the damage. However, his 
acknowledgment that Sacramento has a role to play has been, at best, grudging. 
Why not, for example, form a commission of business people, academics and 
others with expertise in the area to look independently at the county and 
recommend methods of recovery? Orange County has plenty of expertise in those 
fields, and the experts' commitment to the county's future could help stem 
feelings of panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did acknowledge that state law requires the state to provide education 
for students if the school districts go bankrupt; that is a real concern, since 
the county's 31 districts were required to put their money in the county fund 
and now face major problems. And he was correct to draw the line short of 
covering the losses of five districts that borrowed money to invest with 
Citron. An attorney for one school district, Irvine Unified, honestly conceded 
that the borrowed money will not be fully recouped. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery will require local resolve as well as state help. The county, 
cities, schools and special districts are going to have to find ways of 
streamlining even more than they have been forced to by previous budgetary 
pressures. That will be difficult, but unsnarling this imbroglio will require 
the resolve and commitment of everyone from Sacramento to county and local 
government.

ISLAMIC TROOPS TO THE RESCUE?; THE FRENCH PROPOSAL COULD DISGUISE THE ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday, French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, joined by U.S. Secretary 
of Defense William J. Perry, called Monday for a strengthened NATO defense of 
U.N. operations in Bosnia, contradicting a position in favor of U.N. withdrawal 
taken just last week by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. However, the 
measures Leotard and Perry mentioned in their Washington press conference -- 
concentrating the U.N. forces in just a few places, opening a well-defended 
corridor to the Adriatic and changing the rules of engagement -- may only be 
disguised preparation for a Bosnian Dunkirk. 
</P>
<P>
 The British are reportedly cool to the proposal, though nothing proposed 
Monday would prevent U.N. officials and Sir Michael Rose, who commands U.N. 
peacekeepers, from barring, as they have hitherto, any inconvenient NATO 
action. By contrast, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, meeting in 
Morocco, has declared the readiness of its members not just to replace European 
U.N. troops but to do so even if the U.N. arms embargo is lifted, a measure the 
Europeans have argued would endanger U.N. forces. That suggestion attracted 
notice in France, which is in the middle of an electoral season. Perhaps the 
embarrassment of a precipitous French departure from Bosnia followed by the 
arrival of Islamic troops on European soil may have dictated a delay of the 
debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 At this confusing juncture the American policy options remain, in declining 
order of preferability (not probability): 
</P>
<P>
 1) Lift and strike: Lift the U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia and use NATO air 
strikes to support ground defense by Bosnia's own troops. This is the option 
that President Bill Clinton favored as he came into office and what the 
Republican majority leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives 
still favor. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Defense of the U.N. forces. If Leotard's proposal is not a Dunkirk 
disguise, here is where it could count. The United States has nothing to lose 
by taking the proposal at face value. Even an orderly retreat, as opposed to a 
humiliating rout, may save U.N. lives now and U.N. credibility later. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Evacuation of the U.N. forces. If Leotard's proposal is rejected by NATO 
(in which every member state has a veto) or frustrated by a U.N. commander too 
fearful of -- or favorable toward -- the Serbs to risk actively defending his 
own forces, then the humiliation of those forces will continue and will end 
only in potentially chaotic evacuation. At that point, whatever the domestic 
grumbling, the United States should assist in an expeditious evacuation. 
Effectively, these remain the U.S. options even in the wake of a peace proposal 
Wednesday by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. A declaration of victory 
more than a peace proposal, Karadzic's offer is likely to be rejected by the 
Bosnian government but welcomed by a United Nations that at this point may want 
only a safe exit.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, the OIC countries want their forces to work as a part of UNPROFOR. 
Under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, however, they may also come to Bosnia's 
defense directly, without U.N. approval. Short of intervention, rumors are rife 
of a unilateral OIC lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia. If the OIC 
attempts to land troops or deliver arms to Bosnia by sea, will the French and 
British now patrolling the Dalmatian coast try to stop them? Will the world see 
a Christian-Muslim naval war in the Adriatic? 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcely. Yet if the OIC action turns into measurable support for Bosnia, the 
Europeans may discover that by refusing to defend this Muslim-dominated 
European state they have succeeded only in enlarging the Muslim presence on 
their continent. With the OIC in the background, a NATO evacuation of the U.N. 
forces acquires a meaning that otherwise it would not have. The Balkans War may 
be evolving before our eyes into a world war in miniature.

JOBS RECOVERY CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An interesting counterpoint to your Dec. 3 headline, "Jobless Rate Hits 4-Year 
Low," in which not a shred of credit is given to the Clinton Administration for 
accomplishing this, is a companion story about the "rudderless" Democratic 
Party! It seems that no matter how much this Administration accomplishes, The 
Times and other Republican-owned papers will find ways to slam Clinton and cast 
him in a negative light. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the same jobless rate been achieved under Reagan or Bush (hah!), The Times 
would be drooling with praise for the economic strategies and policies that 
produced the happy result, with scores of fawning editorials celebrating the 
"recovery" achieved by the GOP super-heroes! Instead, The Times resolutely 
focuses on the downside so that people will be led to put down Clinton no 
matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, I must publicly admonish you for your biases.

ORANGE COUNTY FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To blame Republicans, Democrats or Proposition 13 is naive at best and 
non-dimensional at worst. Orange County residents are now getting the 
opportunity to wake up to the political realities of a world where money speaks 
louder than idealism. Lobbying, campaign contributions and controlling laws to 
benefit not the constituency but the people who make money off of money are 
just the tip of the iceberg.  
</P>
<P>
 The most foolish notion expressed so far is not to be terribly concerned since 
this is just a "paper loss." But we are dependent upon that paper to function, 
are we not? If anything, some people are just blessed with a head-in-the-sand 
faith in their own elitism. Paper or no paper, those sands are shifting with 
the dry-winds weather of the times. 
</P>

<P>
 * "Get the government off the people's back." "What we need is deregulation to 
spur the economy." That's right, Republican-controlled Orange County. Just like 
the deregulation of the savings and loan industry. Blub, blub, blub. 
</P>
<P>
 It has long since been obvious what citizens are entitled to: less influence 
by powerful corporate interests over vital governmental decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 ZANVILLE S. GREEN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The $2-billion loss has implications far beyond Orange County. This debacle 
raises yet another question about the ability and efficiency of any government 
bureaucracy. Former Treasurer Robert Citron unwittingly provided another reason 
why many voters want government to do less whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now painfully obvious county government was gambling with our 
hard-earned tax money. To now claim the risks were unknown only confirms 
bureaucratic incompetence and/or cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM L. STRONG 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Peter King often shows a remarkable gift for getting to the fundamental 
issues; but never more so than in his column on how and why everyone ignored 
GOP treasurer candidate John Moorlach's dire predictions about the financial 
crisis that has exploded on Orange County (Dec. 11). His observation: "If 
Moorlach had revealed that Citron employed illegal immigrants, or chased skirts 
in the '60s, he might have won" is right on the mark.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't elect people based on any rational standards, but rather on how they 
look on TV and come across in sound bites, and on whether they've ever violated 
the vague and arbitrary rules we set for everyone but ourselves. Then we whine 
about the quality of government we get. Our solution is term limits, an idea 
that can only have grown out of the notion that anyone whom the voters elect to 
public office has, by that fact itself, proven himself or herself unfit to hold 
that office for long. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM HART 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Why would federal investment laws allow anyone to borrow as extensively as 
the Orange County government to speculate on derivatives?  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Wall Street is under lax supervision, and regulatory responsibility 
in this debacle transcends government levels, with no one authority really 
concerned with what some single politician may do with the public money. Makes 
one think of the health and insurance industries where federal money should not 
go without some real regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD TOLBERT 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * I was interested to see an article about Tom Hayes, who has been retained to 
advise Orange County in its financial crises (Dec. 9). Hayes served as state 
treasurer and was defeated in an election for that position by Kathleen Brown. 
In your article you report that Brown criticized him during their campaign for 
earning less on the state's investment fund than Orange County was earning on 
its money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Commentary section of that same issue appeared an article by Brown, in 
which she claimed to have "sensed" the problems of Orange County two years ago. 
She goes on to laud herself for her conservative fiscal policies, which I 
strongly suspect were already in place when she assumed the office from Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 While I did not vote for Brown, I did have considerable respect for her. That 
respect is now gone. Her use of this serious financial crisis for 
self-promotion, in contravention of the very arguments she used to defeat 
Hayes, is the height of hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES R. GREEN 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * A very simple solution to preventing the problem experienced by Orange 
County and others in the future is to make the municipality publish its 
investments in a general circulation newspaper on a regular basis for the 
taxpayers to see. Then make a lengthy jail sentence and heavy fine for any 
irregularities in disclosure. This would almost eliminate this problem without 
government intervention.

RENAMING FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 I'm opposed to renaming the Simi Valley Freeway for Ronald Reagan. The 
tradition in the greater L.A. area is to name freeways for places served by 
them (Hollywood, Santa Ana, the Harbor, the Foothill, etc.), not people.  
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't be surprised, however, at the whole issue being moot since so many 
already refer to the route in question as "the 118."

MOVING TO MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My husband and I wanted to retire to Mazatlan and have diligently found out 
what is required of us. As a couple, we must have a proven income of 
approximately $2,200 per month.Should we purchase property, it must be jointly 
owned by a bank that we would pay annually for representing us if there was a 
problem. We must pay for health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no welfare in Mexico and everyone must pay for health insurance. We 
have no rights. We are subject to the rules and laws that can change in a 
moment.  
</P>
<P>
 How can this country have these requirements and the United States allow 
illegal immigrants to obtain welfare, the finest in health care and free 
schooling and we, the American people, are paying for it? What a joke on us.

GREEN CARD BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you been down to the Immigration and Naturalization Service lately or do 
you know of anyone who has? If not, then let me paint a picture for you. I was 
living overseas for the last two years and in that time the INS decided it was 
necessary for people with pre-1979 green cards to get new ones and pay $75 for 
them. My mother, a green card holder for 30-plus years, is a petite senior with 
arthritis in her hip. We hoped we could take care of this business in one day, 
waiting however long need be. 
</P>
<P>
 With all our necessary paperwork filled out, we went downtown to the Federal 
Building one morning, where we waited 3 1/2 hours before we could even step 
foot in the building. A few minutes later an INS employees, who decided not to 
use the bullhorn sitting on the counter in front of her, softly whispered into 
the crowded room that there were no more tickets left. Huh? What were these 
tickets? I was not sure. I could sympathize with the Spanish-speaking people in 
line who were more clueless to the English-only announcement. Apparently, we 
needed a ticket in order to get to the next line. We went home and my mother 
spent several days in bed physically recovering from standing so long. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week we arrived at 6:45 a.m. and had to wait only to 8:10 a.m. 
to find out that there were no more tickets. I concluded that the people who 
were able to get into the building had been waiting since 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. As 
we left, my mother told me she had thought about applying for citizenship while 
she stood in line, but decided she did not want to be part of a government that 
would treat her so inhumanely.  
</P>
<P>
 Waiting was not frustrating. It was waiting and leaving with nothing 
accomplished that made us bitter. I phoned the INS to try to set up an 
appointment and, after countless recorded messages and waiting, I finally got a 
hold of a live representative who told me appointments could not be arranged no 
matter how poor a person's health is. She did give me the names of different 
private organizations recognized by the INS that could handle this for us. The 
numbers I phoned told me they do not handle replacement of green cards because 
the holder must go down to the INS in person to take care of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like I am caught in this grand circle that is going nowhere. I cannot 
figure out why a simple matter such as this seems almost impossible to 
accomplish. I would appreciate it if someone could explain how to replace a 
green card without having to spend thousands of dollars on lawyers' fees or 
sleeping outside the Federal Building.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; DON'T SQUEEZE ORANGE COUNTY; IT IS IN EVERYONE'S BEST 
INTEREST FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO THE BANKRUPT 
COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD PEISER, Richard Peiser is director of the Lusk Center for Real 
Estate Development at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the recriminations die down about how one of the richest, most 
conservative counties in the nation could have gone bankrupt, the question will 
remain: What do we do about it? 
</P>
<P>
 People outside of Orange County may feel it made its own bed and deserves to 
lie in it -- as the county would be expected to preach if another county went 
bankrupt. Liberals may protest the prospect of a government bailout for an area 
that perhaps most represented the opposition to such assistance. Nevertheless, 
when all the finger-pointing stops, we are left with the reality: It is not 
just a bunch of rich people who lost money. The damage hurts the economic 
health not just of the county, but of the entire state. This is one time when 
the public interest is served by government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 While people may be tempted to gloat over Orange County's predicament, this is 
a disaster that affects us all. The aftershocks will reverberate throughout the 
state for years. The state should not make up for all the bond losses; however, 
it is in everyone's interest to ensure that public services continue 
uninterrupted and that vendors and employees be paid on time. Also, the state 
should provide some form of credit enhancement so that future bond issues can 
be sold. The costs of these measures can and should be reimbursed by Orange 
County residents to the state over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the losers? It isn't just the bond holders who lose money when the 
bankruptcy stops payment on their bonds and forces a reorganization of debt, 
although they will feel the losses most directly. Nor is it just the 
participants in the bond fund -- the 180 government agencies who have seen 
their investments in the fund drop in value by $2 billion or more, depending on 
the latest estimate. Virtually all of us with money invested in mutual funds 
stand to lose. Bonds throughout the nation have dropped in value as interest 
rates shot up this year. Even if one does not hold Orange County bonds, the 
entire municipal bond market has dropped in value as the fear of similar 
bankruptcies washes over Wall Street. Funds with similar debt have seen 
withdrawals in excess of 20% since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout from the bankruptcy is just beginning. The most immediate impact 
will be a sharp rise in interest rates on public indebtedness. The impact on 
credit affects a county just like it does an individual. When lenders fear they 
might not be repaid, they charge higher interest rates. After a bankruptcy, it 
takes years for them to regain confidence in the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, public services will be cut. Badly needed construction 
improvements will be delayed. Laguna Beach, for example, must now wait to start 
construction on the fire-damaged Thurston Middle School. Santa Ana teachers 
worry that they may not get paid this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy hurts the entire Southern California region. 
Tourist draws like Disneyland may delay expansion. Concerns about the county's 
ability to sustain public-service levels will impede the region's ability to 
attract new companies to move here. And at least one state, Iowa, has beefed up 
its mission to entice California businesses to relocate in Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
 Should the state come to Orange County's aid? The answer is yes. It is not 
just the rich who lose out if they do not. The bankruptcy significantly impairs 
Southern California's economic recovery. It destroys confidence in public 
services and hurts those people who are most vulnerable to cuts in public 
services, especially education, health and safety. The state must help out, 
because no one else can.

ONE ELECTION DOESN'T MAKE A REVOLUTION; POLITICS: WOMEN DIDN'T GAIN INSTANT 
PARITY IN CAMPAIGN '92 NOR WERE THEY CONSIGNED TO HISTORY BY CAMPAIGN '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH B. MANDEL, Ruth B. Mandel is the director of the Center for the 
American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the "women and politics watch," the ghost of 1992 lingers. "What happened 
to women?" is intoned with disbelief. Were the high spirits of '92, the 
yester-Year-of-the-Woman, so short-lived or misplaced? No, not misplaced. Just 
premature and ahistorical in entertaining a notion that one election year might 
overcome centuries of political practice, granting women power with one Olympic 
leap. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the hellfires of Campaign '94 did not immolate women. Political woman 
is alive and well, even if not a prime-time story. Progress takes place 
nomination by nomination, inch by historical inch. That has been happening for 
more than two decades, and will continue for many more before women achieve 
political parity. 
</P>
<P>
 While headlines trumpeted 1992 the "Year of the Woman," that year's particular 
news was that women sprinted forward in national office. When the 103rd 
Congress convened, women occupied 10% of 535 Senate and House seats, four 
points over the previous 6% high. The extraordinary success produced four new 
female senators, while women in the House nearly doubled their ranks. A close 
look shows almost all newcomers winning open seats; all but three were 
Democrats, and a number won in traditionally Republican or highly competitive 
House districts. In the state legislatures -- a marker level of steady, 
incremental progress for women throughout two decades -- 1992 resulted in a 
rare gain of two percentage points rather than the more typical one-point 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the 1994 gender sweepstakes. How would women outpace themselves? 
Expectations were unrealistic. The political ballyhoo was about something else 
in 1994. Change was still an energizing issue, but this time women were not 
center stage as the positive symbol of change and difference. The electorate's 
energy was focused less on empowering newcomers than on ejecting old-timers. 
Old-timers, including those who had been in office only a term, translated as 
Democrats.

 Elected women encountered this year's ballot box anger. Especially vulnerable 
were Democratic women in marginal seats where the 1994 Republican tide swept 
out interlopers in traditionally Republican areas. Where challengers faced 
incumbents, incumbents were vulnerable in 1994 regardless of gender if they 
were Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In state legislative races, a remarkable 25% of female Republican challengers 
defeated incumbent Democrats, whereas a mere 4% of female Democratic 
challengers defeated Republican incumbents. When state legislatures convene in 
January, 1995, Republican women will hold 87 additional seats and Democratic 
women will be down by 104 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitions for open seats followed suit. Where there were open seats in the 
Senate, Republicans were likely to win in 1994. In House races for open seats, 
Republican women won 67% of the time versus 40% for Democratic women. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall picture for 1994 shows that in keeping with recent elections, 
increasingly women competed for the most coveted offices -- governors and 
senators in powerful states such as California, Texas, Illinois, New York. 
There were even several "double feature" races in which two -- sometimes more 
-- women won nominations for their state's top positions. When the new Senate 
convenes, for the first time in history, eight women will serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the loss of 11 departing or defeated congresswomen (almost a 
quarter of their delegation), women in the House managed to hold onto their 47 
seats. In the states, record numbers of women have been elected to statewide 
executive offices. In legislatures, women held onto the level of representation 
achieved in the record-setting elections of 1992. One by one, inch by inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Coronations were as inappropriate for '92 as funerals are this year. The 
epilogue to 1994 is that women returned to their familiar position -- pushing 
forward here, stalling a bit there, chalking up political firsts or near-firsts 
for gender politics. Election 1992 was one year, not a generation; election '94 
is but another year in the long push to parity. Neither year switched direction 
for women in politics. While nothing about social and political progress is 
inevitable or should be taken for granted, while vigilance and organization 
remain essential, the trend line for women in politics is uninterrupted and 
upwardly inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far too soon to switch off or change channels. Stay tuned.

COLUMN LEFT/ VICTOR NAVASKY: MCCARTHYISM? NO, HISTORIC U.S. NATIVISM; 
EXPLOITING FEARS IS AN OLD TRADITION, AMPLIFIED TODAY BY TV TABLOIDS AND THE 
RELIGIOUS RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By VICTOR NAVASKY, Victor Navasky, the author of Naming Names, a study of the 
McCarthy era, is a senior fellow at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at 
Columbia University while on leave as editor of the Nation. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day, I had a call from an Italian journalist asking whether the 
United States was in for another bout of McCarthyism. 
</P>
<P>
 My initial thought was not at all. In the first place, these days there's a 
communist shortage, and the red menace, after all, was the predicate of 
McCarthyism. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the term McCarthyism has been carelessly bandied about ever since the 
early 1950s when it was used to describe a social pathology that most serious 
Cold War scholars would now agree commenced long before the senator from 
Wisconsin arrived on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, what did such discredited old practices as guilt by association, 
shoddy methods ("I disapprove of his methods but not his goals"), anonymous 
accusers and all the rest have to do with the current situation? Even the most 
troubling conservative initiative -- the proposal that prayer be permitted in 
public schools -- would involve amending the Constitution rather than ignoring 
it, as did so many Fifth Amendment-bashers and First Amendment-ignorers of old. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked my Italian interrogator what prompted his question. It seems that 
Robert Redford had been quoted in La Stampa, the influential Italian daily, as 
predicting a new wave of McCarthyism; did I have any comment? My comment, 
arrogantly assuming that the Italian press was more interested in the star than 
the story, was to say somewhat patronizingly that I could see why an 
actor-director like Redford might be worried. After all, there was talk of 
cutting back, if not abolishing, the National Endowment for the Arts and the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 But on further reflection, it occurs to me that artists are almost always the 
first targets in times of trouble, so why shouldn't we take them seriously as a 
political Distant Early Warning line? Why shouldn't a man like Redford, who 
starred with Barbra Streisand in "The Way We Were," one of Hollywood's more 
ambitious attempts to comment on McCarthyism, and who played investigative 
reporter Bob Woodward in "All the President's Men," be sensitive to the 
difference between the sort of orderly impeachment proceedings triggered by the 
constitutional crisis of Watergate and the Whitewater hearings so demagogically 
threatened by the newly empowered junior senator from New York, Alphonse 
D'Amato? It was probably no accident, as they used to say, that the 
about-to-be-anointed chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse 
Helms, landed on an NEA-sponsored avant-garde artist like the late Robert 
Mapplethorpe as his way of making the front pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps what those in the arts intuitively understand is that McCarthyism was 
not about the senator's slipshod methods in combatting the red menace. Whatever 
the Russians might have intended internationally, as any Hollywood blacklist 
survivor could attest, there was no internal red menace of the sort 
irresponsibly charged by McCarthy, Richard Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover and other 
red-hunters. Even the House Un-American Activities Committee gave up the search 
for communist propaganda in the movies. The so-called red menace was merely the 
scapegoat of the moment. The heart of McCarthyism had to do with exploiting our 
fear of the unknown, the old nativist impulse that goes all the way back to the 
Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, equating the foreign with the immoral and the 
radical. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, come to think of it, was what the controversy over the homoerotic 
themes of Mapplethorpe's photographs was about; what the battle over 
Proposition 187, which scapegoated those foreign (and presumably immoral and 
radical) illegal immigrants, may be said to have been about and what Newt 
Gingrich's pathetic attempt to blame a child-murdering mom on years of 
Democratic permissiveness was all about, not to mention his weird charge that 
"McGovernik" counterculturalist druggies have taken over the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 When one considers that the new nativism is accompanied by Rush 
Limbaugh-inspired know-nothingism, deeply rooted Christian-right fundamentalism 
and four or five, depending on how you count them, newly tabloidized television 
networks collectively poised to amplify all of the above, whether history ends 
up calling the post-election political culture McCarthyism II, Helmsism, 
D'Amatoism or Gingrichism . . . perhaps Redford is on to something and perhaps 
celebrity journalism, Italian style, has something to teach us.

By ROBERT DAWIDOFF is a professor of history at the Claremont Graduate School. 
He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In founding the United States, the leaders of the Federal Convention 
proclaimed themselves students of history. They consulted human experience to 
help them decide between institutions.It was, for instance, the wars of 
religion that racked Europe in the Reformation's wake that caused them to make 
public life a secular preserve. They read history to indicate that freedom and 
flourishing of religion depended on keeping this most individual and least 
compromisable of human expressions free from the inevitable incursions of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich says we read history to find ourselves back there. He recommends 
Irving Stone and Tom Clancy as equal to nonfiction. But the historian's whole 
point is to distinguish fact from historical fiction. To do so, you have to 
accept a gap between what history teaches and what people need or want to know. 
And history is almost always ambiguous in its prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be wary of Gingrich the politician to be alarmed by his 
understanding of history. Plenty of his conservative allies know better than he 
the dangers of a convenient history as an argument for an expedient public 
course of action.

 The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers may be as much a triumph of merchandising as 
imagination, but there's no denying that the helmeted, high-flying defenders of 
goodness are a major hit with the preteen set. Rangers-inspired toys and the 
Fox TV show are wildly popular, and Tuesday night at the Universal Amphitheatre 
loyal Morphin fans got to see their heroes in the spandexed flesh at the 
opening night of the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Live" tour.  
</P>
<P>
 This first of 20 shows served as a benefit for DARE, the anti-drug 
organization that has adopted the Rangers as National Teen Ambassadors. There 
were some empty seats in the house, but the screams, giggles and excited cries 
of "Go, go, Power Rangers!" filling the amphitheater prior to show time gave 
the room a pint-sized rock 'n' roll buzz. And, like rock fans hoping to hear 
favorite songs from a beloved band, the Morphin fans were hoping to see all of 
their favorite characters in action. Five-year-old Michael Torma and his 
brother C.J., 4, had a long list of favorites. "We like Billy, Tommy, Trini, 
Goldar, Squat, Baboo, Zordon and Alpha," Michael explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Many small Ranger devotees came in homemade costumes, and some were already 
well-schooled in Morphin-style combat. "I like the way they move and the way 
they fight," explained 6-year-old Alison Silver, dressed as the Pink Ranger. "I 
practice it at home with my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Andrew Adelman, suited up as the Blue Ranger, was looking forward 
to an action-packed show. "I want to see the Rangers fight the Putties and the 
monsters. I want to see them kick Lord Zedd." 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what was on the evening's program, but opening-night glitches 
made it hard for the Rangers to get going at first. As a pair of menacing 
aliens came through the crowd and took the stage, a painted scrim refused to 
pull away, and the evil, irascible Lord Zedd's first scene was obscured. The 
aliens covered for a while with impromptu moonwalks and a bit of soft shoe, but 
a break was needed for repairs to be made.  
</P>
<P>
 When the program started again, things ran smoothly, and fans were treated to 
a colorful, kinetic spectacle that incorporated laser lights, pyrotechnics, 
giant video screens, stage illusions and plenty of Ranger-threatening monsters. 
The 75-minute show is not a musical, but an energetic soundtrack and highly 
effective sound effects kept the action moving at a brisk pace. The loopy story 
line offered a mix of Flash Gordon adventure, Three Stooges comedy and Kabuki 
drama, and had the Rangers relying on the help of the audience to get them out 
of several tight scrapes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers have gotten some heat from parents' groups that find them too 
violent, but in the live show the fight scenes played out as a kind of 
off-kilter ballet and were never brutal or frightening. To make their wholesome 
nature even more clear, the upstanding Morphin crew delivered a few overtly 
instructive messages to their fans in the final moments of the show -- "Be 
nice," "Always try to do the right thing" and "Don't ever hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Those maxims, along with the Rangers' examples of teamwork and self-respect, 
may offer some laudable lessons to young fans. But even with the White Ranger's 
last-minute admonition that martial arts should only be practiced by trained 
professionals, it's a safe bet that there will be a lot of little legs 
launching Mighty Morphin karate kicks while the Rangers are in town. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Live" continues at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City. Shows are tonight at 
7:15, Friday at 4:15 and 7:15 p.m., and Saturday-Dec. 22 at 12:15, 4:15, and

 Soprano's Square: Milan, Italy, home of the famed La Scala opera house, 
honored soprano Maria Callas on Wednesday when it renamed a new square after 
the diva. "It's only right that a figure who gave so much to Milan and its 
people is still remembered with such affection," said Mayor Marco Formentini. 
The new square, named Largo Maria Callas, is close to the city's center and a 
block away from Via Puccini, named after the noted Italian composer. The 
U.S.-born Callas, who was first lady at La Scala from 1950 to 1961, died in 
1977. TELEVISION

ART REVIEW; RICHARD TUTTLE, A MINIMALIST WHO LIKES GOING TO EXTREMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Tuttle takes slightness to such extremes that he makes more well-known 
Minimalists look like bombastic showoffs driven to overstatement. Tuttle's 
unusually delicate yet tough-to-categorize works are initially almost 
invisible. Only slowly do they open onto curious formal conundrums, before 
further unfolding to encompass and enliven the entire space in which they're 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
 At Burnett Miller Gallery, five understated suites of drawings from the late 
1970s form a quirky, abstract alphabet that invites viewers to play an 
impressive array of surprisingly fresh logical puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Tuttle's pieces consists of a page torn from a spiral sketchbook onto 
which he has glued a smaller piece or two of carefully cut paper, often folded 
back over part of itself. These little strips and shapes form straight and 
curved lines, arcs, angles, scallops and rectangles. Delicate layers of 
watercolors have been applied to parts of these odd, unreadable symbols and to 
adjoining portions of the pages on which they're glued, efficiently confusing 
the differences between figure and ground, collage and illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny shadows cast by the double and triple thicknesses of creased and 
wrinkled paper turn out to be as consequential as any of the cut or painted 
shapes in Tuttle's drawings. Two nearly identical images -- which resemble an 
off-center and tilted letter T -- have decidedly different characters simply 
because one consists of a single strip of folded paper and the other is made up 
of two overlapping pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 These subtleties are more vivid in Tuttle's largest drawings. Unframed and 
taped to the wall, this set of 16 pages supports cutout elements that 15 years 
ago were glued directly to the walls of Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. Their 
current incarnation resembles a child's pop-up book. With more dramatic 
shadows, the real space of architecture is evocatively reconfigured in a few 
inches of abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle's wonderfully unaggressive art makes a lot out of almost nothing, 
transforming a few formal elements into tiny spaces that fold back on 
themselves, yet leave plenty of room for ambiguity.

 Glass as Class: Dale Chihuly's ravishing glass sculptures at Dorothy Goldeen 
Gallery are made like bowls but function like paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of their delight derives from the way they exquisitely confuse the craft 
of blown glass with the art of abstraction, but most of their fun is due to 
less intellectual pleasures. Shamelessly decorative excesses, such as vibrant, 
light-drenched colors and sexy, undulating shapes, endow Chihuly's fragile 
sculptures with so much verve and vitality that they're anything but 
peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine large circular pieces attached to the gallery wall recall the demure 
wallflowers of high school dances, except that the Seattle-based artist's 
radiant works draw every eye in the room to their sinuous contours and 
semitranslucent surfaces. Light pours through their petal-shaped exteriors, 
inviting admiration from every angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scale shifts radically in front of these captivating orbs. It's as easy to 
imagine that each one is a mysterious planet enshrouded in a thick, gaseous 
atmosphere as it is to fantasize that they're tiny sea creatures seen under a 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Shells and jellyfish are even more explicitly evoked by Chihuly's 
pedestal-mounted sculptures, whose hot, tropical colors combine the 
high-voltage glow of Las Vegas at night with the natural fluorescence of exotic 
fish. By short-circuiting the normal usefulness of glass vessels, Chihuly loads 
meaning and metaphor into his gorgeous sculptures.

 Photos From a Distance: In William Klein's black-and-white street photographs, 
worlds don't collide as much as they shuffle by one another. The anonymous 
people in his abrupt, grainy pictures rub shoulders, cross paths and physically 
jostle each other, but still seem separated by unbridgeable distances. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Klein's earliest and one of his most recent photos in a sweeping, 
70-work survey at Fahey/Klein Gallery give vivid pictorial form to the 
invisible buffer zones that contemporary city-dwellers habitually carry around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four Heads, New York" (1954) is a tightly cropped close-up of two men's and 
two women's faces in remarkable proximity. Compositionally, the image is held 
together by its equal, gridded quadrants. Conceptually, however, nothing links 
its four subjects. Their wide range of expressions and gazes aimed in different 
directions suggests that each inhabits a disparate world. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, "Marathon, Florence" (1986) portrays urban space as a stage on which 
diverse dramas play out alongside one another, without overlap or intersection. 
A runner, concentrating on his race, is framed by several spectators who look 
on with various degrees of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein's fashion photographs similarly emphasize the incongruities of urban 
life, contrasting the otherworldly beauty of graceful models with pimply-faced 
service men awkwardly doing their duty, as in "Pont Alexandre III and Marine, 
Paris" (1960). These influential shots bring a jolt of grittiness to a placid 
genre, but because of their obvious staging, lack the impact of Klein's more 
spontaneous, uncommissioned pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 65-year-old artist's best photographs, made between the mid-1950s and 
the mid-1960s (when he turned to film), modern alienation takes palpable, 
positive shape. Emotional distance, rather than appearing as a sinister force 
that isolates and dehumanizes people, provides protection and a small slice of 
space in which privacy and mystery flourish. 
</P>

 Inside, Outside: "Collaborations: Inside the Armory, Out on the Street" is a 
dispiriting display of five art-related public projects undertaken by four 
pairs and one trio of L.A.-based artists. Organized by curator Karen Moss for 
the Armory Center for the Arts, and funded by the Pasadena Art Alliance, it 
meant to emphasize the links between what transpires inside galleries and what 
happens outside their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, nothing very interesting takes place in the gallery. Most of 
the installations mimic the methods of amateur sociology: Facts are gathered, 
tallied and presented, always ending with a solicitation of the viewer's 
opinion. As these works exclusively refer to external endeavors, art becomes an 
empty signifier that points to (presumably) more important activities taking 
place elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental problem is that the exhibition is based on a belief that art 
is not only much less important than social work, but that ultimately, 
art-making is a hopelessly self-indulgent exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 This deeply cynical type of thinking, prevalent today among bureaucrats and 
professional fund-raisers, forgets that museums and art centers are themselves 
public places, not significantly different from the collectivist fantasy of 
"the street" propounded by the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the practical value of some of the works, particularly Renee 
Edgington's and Matthew Francis's clean-syringe exchange program, "Inside the 
Armory, Out on the Street," plays into the hands of conservatives by willfully 
emptying art of its content.

ART REVIEW; ENJOYABLE, ENDEARING PAEAN TO 'ROMANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's rare to run across a contemporary art exhibition where every single piece 
is endearing. Enigmatic, subversive, esoteric and challenging we are used to 
but, lovable ? All the same, each of the 30 artists represented in the current 
show at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design sends you home humming. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have something to do with the sentimental season that is upon us. It 
certainly has to do with the exhibition's theme. It's called "Romance." Ah, 
that borderless, bottomless miasma of bliss. Nobody knows if it's real or just 
a cotton-candy myth disguising a biological drive. Everybody knows how great it 
feels when it happens and how bad it hurts when it stops. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of the fun of this show comes from empathizing with the various 
postures assumed to deal with the romantic urge in a decidedly unromantic time. 
The lyric tends to the bittersweet -- more like the hard-boiled 1930s of 
Rodgers and Hart than the sentimental 1950s of Rodgers and Hammerstein. But the 
show proves mainly that the varieties of the romantic urge are not bound by 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Adest's "Eros" is a violin bow with a barbed shaft, serrated steel 
arrowhead and wax flowers for feathers. There's a fetish-like twist to much of 
the work suggesting the degree to which romance is seen as healing magic and 
deadly curse. The piece is at once primitive and Victorian. There's some of 
that in Jill Giegerich's juxtaposition of candelabra and sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The romantic symbolism of violins gets into Millie Wilson's "Easel/Mirror." 
The mirror is etched with a tale of a flying violin that extends the theme 
beyond infatuation into a darkly romantic view recalling Edgar Allan Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people romance is a species of fetishization of types. Deborah Small 
introduces this notion in "Our Bodices, Ourselves." It consists of a wall of 
deliciously lurid covers and quotes from pulp fiction novels devoted to 
heroines obsessed with strong, silent "half-breed" heroes who are reciprocally 
gaga over buxom blondes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those whose romantic mania fixes on a particular individual. 
Often these days the adored object is a public icon worshiped from afar. Maria 
Lafia's piece consists of about 1,000 child-like love letters addressed to 
artist Mike Kelley. Displayed on the floor under a sheet of plastic, the viewer 
is invited to walk on them, just as the artist is invited, figuratively, to 
walk on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally partners in a romance actually know one another personally. Or 
think they do. Working together, Laura Cooper and Nick Taggart produced a 
Polaroid of her, still asleep, every morning so far this year. They have that 
wonderful quality of watching one's lover looking innocent and almost immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 When young, we all wonder what attitude we should cop to both find romance and 
protect ourselves in the clinches. Alexis Smith's "Blue Denim" evokes the 
tough-tomboy posture of the '50s when everybody with any class was a juvenile 
delinquent. It's a collage of trashy graphics like the paperback cover for 
"High School Confidential." The piece is festooned with telling bits like a 
toddler's saddle shoe and a license plate that says "JOY." Best of all is a set 
of those jumper cables used to get a charge from somebody else's battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists like Joseph Kosuth and John Souza try to get some intellectual 
distance on the subject with the usual humorous result. Dan McCleary and Robin 
Palanker each notice that kissing couples resemble animals devouring one 
another. Ed Ruscha, Joann Callis and Nancy Reese just surrender to the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 We owe one to guest curator Irit Krygier for concocting this witty and 
affectionate proof that romance is alive in the nasty '90s.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; HARBOR COMMISSIONER QUITS OVER LAND SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harbor Commissioner Joel Friedland abruptly resigned last week after tangling 
with the city's Redevelopment Agency over the sale of a piece of property his 
family has owned for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedland, a seven-year port commissioner, claimed later that he had been 
forced to resign by agency members and longtime political foes who reneged on a 
deal to buy the one-acre parcel, the site of his family-owned furniture-lacquer 
business.  
</P>
<P>
 Friedland had been trying to sell the land for more than a year, and said that 
he and Susan F. Shick, executive director of Community Development, had made a 
spoken agreement last year on a transaction contingent on environmental reports 
ensuring the site was not toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the property was deemed clean and the purchase was finally placed on 
the Redevelopment Agency's agenda, three board members voted against the sale, 
Shick said. She said the commissioners were concerned since Friedland had 
special access to the city as a harbor commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Friedland's resignation was not a condition of the sale, the agency 
agreed to purchase the property for $860,000 after he submitted his resignation 
Friday. Shick said the property, an L-shaped parcel that spans Cota and 
Seabright avenues, is to be used for police department storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Friedland said he was angered by what he called political maneuvering 
by agency members. "I was forced out of office, no question about it," he said. 
He added that his role as a commissioner had never been an issue in prior 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the City Council echoed Friedland's sentiments at Tuesday's session. 
"I think (the incident) smacks of strong-armed robbery or blackmail," 
Councilman Les Robbins said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Beverly O'Neill said she was unaware of any politicking, and was stunned 
by Friedland's resignation. "He was a good, honest commissioner who people 
liked working with," she said. "I'm sorry to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill said she will appoint a new commissioner after the first of the year. 
Friedland had served 1 1/2 years of a six-year term. JILL GOTTESMAN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; CITY EXTENDS DEADLINE ON CARD CLUB PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have given a developer another six months to secure a deal with 
a financial partner to build a card club in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 last week to set a new deadline of June 13, 
1995, to begin construction.Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux opposed the 
extension.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the second extension granted to the developer, Compton Entertainment 
Inc., which requested the delay to finalize an agreement with the investor, 
Hollywood Park Inc. In July, Hollywood Park opened a casino at the Inglewood 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park spokesman Tyrone Smith assured council members last week that 
the company is interested in investing in the $40-million casino project, which 
would be built on a seven-acre site off Auto Drive South, near the Artesia (91) 
Freeway. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; EX-CANDIDATE FILES SUIT OVER CITATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While campaigning at the Tweedy Mile Street Fair for a congressional seat in 
June, Charles Green and three of his supporters were rounded up by a city 
employee and ticketed for violating South Gate's Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense? Distributing pamphlets without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much for the First Amendment," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Green, a member of the Democratic National Committee, has filed a lawsuit 
against the city, claiming the code violates free-speech provisions in the 
state and U.S. constitutions. The suit, filed in Norwalk Superior Court, seeks 
$1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the June 4 incident, Green received a letter from South Gate 
City Manager Todd Argow apologizing for the citations, which were issued by a 
temporary employee in the code enforcement bureau. In the letter, Argow told 
Green the citations were canceled and expunged from city records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if Green and his supporters -- who were cited under sections of the 
South Gate Municipal Code requiring city-approved licenses for handbill 
distributors and door-to-door peddlers -- were never ticketed in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not how it appeared to Green, a veteran of civil rights marches in 
the 1960s. "They treated me without dignity," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman, who maintained that the city's 
code complies with the Constitution, said the city had hoped that Argow's 
letter would quickly resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Green lost the 33rd Congressional District Democratic primary to incumbent 
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). SIMON ROMERO

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SIGNAL HILL; SEPARATE ZIP CODE, POST OFFICE SOUGHT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has asked the U.S. Postal Service to give Signal Hill its own ZIP 
code and post office. 
</P>
<P>
 By unanimous vote, the City Council directed City Manager Douglas N. La Belle 
to write a letter asking Long Beach Postmaster Ed Jenkins to include a new post 
office in the Postal Service's five-year capital improvement plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jenkins includes a Signal Hill facility in the five-year plan, the Postal 
Service will ask all Signal Hill residents and businesses whether they want 
their own ZIP code. The Postal Service will build the post office if a majority 
supports the new ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
 Signal Hill, which is surrounded by Long Beach, is served by three Long Beach 
post offices, each with a separate ZIP code. STEVE EAMES

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; COUNCIL REJECTS CLAIM IN POLICE SLAYING CASE

 City Council members have rejected a $125-million claim filed by a witness in 
a murder case who said his mother was killed as a result of his scheduled 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Cooksey, the key witness in the murders of two Compton police officers, 
said authorities ignored a July 24 note threatening his mother and other family 
members.On Aug. 6, his mother, Viola Pirtle Woods, was shot to death as she 
pushed her shopping cart near the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooksey contends that his mother was killed in revenge for his scheduled 
testimony against Regis Thomas, who has been charged in the deaths of Compton 
Police Officers Kevin Michael Burrell and James Wayne MacDonald.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe a street gang to which Thomas belonged was involved 
in Woods' death, but that her death was an accident rather than an act of 
vengeance. Woods was caught in a cross-fire and was not the intended target, 
according to Los Angeles Police Detective Otis Marlow, who is investigating the 
case. PSYCHE PASCUAL

AREA INVESTMENT WATCH; HIGH-ROLLING MONTEBELLO WATCHES FORTUNES CRUMBLE; 
FINANCES: CITY HAS $47 MILLION TIED UP IN ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY CRISIS. 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE ASSURED THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Borrowing money to make money sounded like a good idea to Montebello officials 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a while, it paid off handsomely. In three years, the city raked in 
almost $5 million by borrowing millions of dollars at low interest rates and 
putting them into Orange County's high-paying investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a profitable deal," City Administrator Richard Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a Las Vegas gambler caught up in the euphoria of a winning streak, the 
city kept raising the stakes. It started off investing $7.8 million in the 
Orange County pool. In 1992, it was $23.7 million. This year, it anted up $47 
million, borrowing $31 million to pour into the fund in anticipation of greater 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montebello's luck ran out two weeks ago when managers of the Orange County 
investment fund disclosed that their $7.5-billion pool had lost at least $1.5 
billion. Last week, the county filed for protection under the federal 
Bankruptcy Code, leaving Montebello and 186 other cities, school districts and 
special districts that contributed to the pool in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know all the ramifications of the bankruptcy," said Torres, who has 
been shuttling between City Hall and Orange County in search of answers since 
the crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clearly is in a world of financial hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how much of the city's $47 million has been wiped out. 
Orange County officials now say the value of the pool has dropped by $2 
billion, or about 27%. For Montebello, a 27% loss would be $12.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also are uncertain how much interest income from the Orange 
County pool will materialize in the 1994-95 fiscal year. The city had expected 
to receive about $1.9 million from the pool and had included that amount in its 
$32-million budget this year.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most critical problem facing the city is how to pay off a $25-million 
loan that comes due Dec. 30. The city had borrowed the money to invest in the 
county pool and had counted on withdrawing $25 million from the pool to pay the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said the city has appealed to Orange County officials to release the 
$25 million. Torres and his staff are exploring other options to avoid 
defaulting, including extending the loan and borrowing $25 million from a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council met Sunday and hired the Los Angeles law firm of Clark & 
Trevithick to help the city deal with Orange County's bankruptcy. The council 
spent 3 1/2 hours behind closed doors with city and bankruptcy attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials insist they have no intention of following Orange County into 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in that," Councilman Edward C. Pizzorno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Torres says he is confident that the city can pay all of its bills 
this year, the uncertainty over the Dec. 30 debt payment has led Standard & 
Poor's Corp. to lower its rating on two outstanding notes -- the $25 million 
due Dec. 30 and $6 million due in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello was one of only a handful of local governments outside Orange 
County that invested in the Orange County pool. Its $47-million stake was the 
fifth-largest among 37 cities. Only Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Irvine and Santa 
Ana invested more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Montebello decided to invest in Orange County, many cities were 
desperate to find new sources of revenue. The recession was sapping them of 
retail sales taxes, and the state was taking away some of their property taxes 
and other income. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello's need for new revenue was acute, according to its annual financial 
reports. The city's general fund, which pays for basic government services, had 
run deficits of $2.5 million in fiscal 1989-90 and $4.1 million in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials decided to borrow money against future revenues -- which cities are 
allowed to do to avoid cash-flow problems -- and invest it in the Orange County 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello had actually started borrowing money to make more money in 1988, 
but it invested the funds in the state's investment pool, which pays less 
interest but has a more conservative investment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, John Fitzgerald of Seidler & Fitzgerald Public Finance Inc., the 
city's bond underwriter, recommended investing in the Orange County pool, which 
was paying a higher interest rate, said Ted Nix, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Salazar, who was on the City Council then, defended the decision. "Based 
on the information given us at the time, it sounded like a good investment," 
Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1991, the city moved $7.8 million from the state pool, which was 
paying about 7.2% interest, to the Orange County pool, which had a yield of 
8.6%. The city was paying 4.75% on the money it was borrowing to invest in the 
pool, so it was earning about $40,000 a year on every $1 million invested, 
according to city financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1992, the city shifted another $2.4 million in surplus city funds 
and $13 million in redevelopment reserves to the pool, which was then producing 
yields of 9.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool's rate of return peaked at 9.6% two months later, and then began a 
slow but steady decline to 6.4% last month. But it was still better than any 
other investment, and the city kept pouring in more and more money. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, when it came time to take out another short-term loan to invest 
in Orange County, Mayor Art Payan apparently became edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to minutes of the April 5 council meeting, the council directed city 
staff to set up a study session on the city's investment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was scheduled for June 7. Beforehand, Payan, Councilman Jesus 
(Jess) Ramirez, Finance Director Ted Nix and City Treasurer Phillip M. Ramos 
flew to New York City to confer with officials of two investment rating firms, 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I specifically asked them how solid the Orange County pool was," Ramirez 
said. "Both of them said it was very solid." 
</P>
<P>
 At the June 7 briefing, Ramos assured the full council that the Orange County 
pool was providing the city with "the safest and highest interest-bearing 
investments available in today's economic environment," according to the 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council considered borrowing the $25 million that must be repaid Dec. 
30, Payan voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Payan has declined to discuss his vote. "This is an issue that the council is 
pulling together on," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilwoman Salazar, who was at that meeting, recalled Payan saying 
the city should not "put all of our eggs in one basket." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramirez was equally adamant about putting the money in the pool, Salazar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall exactly what I said back then," Ramirez said, but he confirmed 
that he had no qualms about keeping much of the city's money in the pool. "I 
was comfortable with it," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he learned of the Orange County pool's troubles "the same time as 
everyone else. We felt all along it was a safe investment." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Montebello's investments have gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, former City Treasurer Thomas C. Wong was accused of losing $4.4 
million on city investments. In one transaction, the city bought $8 million 
worth of so-called stripped U.S. Treasury bonds that were to mature in 2011. 
But when interest rates fell, the value of the bonds plummeted. Wong sold them 
at a $3.2-million loss to avoid a deeper decline in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong blamed the City Council for the loss, saying it sold the bonds too 
quickly when the value started falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong lost his bid for reelection in November, 1987, to Ramos, a former 
councilman who helped engineer the city's investment in the Orange County pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was bad enough," Salazar said of the $4.4-million loss 10 years ago. 
"What the heck is going to happen now?"

 While Montebello was pumping $47 million into Orange County's ill-fated 
investment pool, other Southeast-area cities were playing it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach and other cities opted to put most of their surplus money in the 
state's investment fund, Treasury bills and certificates of deposit -- 
investments that paid less interest than Orange County's fund but proved safer. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they place a higher priority on safety and accessibility 
of the invested money than on potential earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Safety is our foremost objective," said Dick Hilde, Long Beach city 
treasurer. "Rate of return is important, but not anywhere near safety of 
principal." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds in the state pool are invested mostly in U.S. government securities, 
certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (short-term loans to major 
corporations). 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has dabbled in reverse-repurchase agreements, a key tool in Orange 
County's investment pool, but there are stricter limits, officials said. In a 
reverse-repurchase agreement, a city uses some of its holdings as collateral to 
borrow money to invest in other securities.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach had $63 million in reverse repurchases June 30, according to the 
city's annual financial report. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing inherently evil with reverse repos," insisted James C. 
Hankla, Long Beach city manager. "We structure ours a lot differently than 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County ran into trouble because it extensively used short-term 
reverse-repurchase agreements to make long-term investments, said J.C. Squires, 
deputy city auditor in Long Beach. In Long Beach, reverse-repurchases must 
mature at the same time as the bonds in which the proceeds are invested. These 
investments are limited to 25% of the city's holdings.

<P>
 An $18.6-million job-training center is planned for a former naval housing 
site in west Long Beach, federal officials announced this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be built on 17 acres at the former Savannah-Cabrillo housing 
project, and will be operated by the U.S. Department of Labor. It will house up 
to 264 students in dorms on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed at the end of 1996, the center will offer job training mainly 
to low-income Long Beach residents between 16 and 24 years old. Trades such as 
auto repair, landscaping, telecommunications and tile installation will be 
taught at the center. JILL GOTTESMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; $43 MILLION TO BE SPENT ON WATER RECYCLING PLAN

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles will spend about $43 million to convert the Terminal 
Island waste-water treatment plant into a water recycling facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant treats sewage from Wilmington and San Pedro and then discharges it 
into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, the city has been unable to prove that the quality of discharged 
water meets state guidelines, said Jerry Gewe, water resources engineer at the 
city Department of Water and Power. In 1985, the California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board ordered the city to improve water quality. SUSAN WOODWARD

 Young Wayne Gretzky wanna-bes will have a new ice arena to practice shots on 
goal next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A former McDonnell Douglas warehouse is being converted into a skating 
facility that will include a professional hockey-size ice rink, an 
international-size rink for figure skating and ice dancing, and a rink for 
in-line and roller-skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting hockey teams in town to play the Mighty Ducks or Los Angeles Kings 
might practice at the facility, which will be named the Glacial Garden Ice 
Arena, said Ron White, the arena's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning commissioners unanimously endorsed the project earlier this 
month, but imposed a number of conditions, including security in the parking 
areas on weekends, signs discouraging loitering and an 8 p.m. closing time for 
the roller-skating portion of the arena, said Chuck Ebner, community 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice and in-line hockey leagues, figure-skating programs and general skating 
lessons will be offered in addition to free skating, White said. The arena will 
be at Carson Street and Paramount Boulevard. JILL GOTTESMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; MARINA PANEL TO WEIGH COMPLAINTS IN SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to increasing vacancies and complaints from boaters docked at the 
Downtown Marina, the Marina Advisory Commission is considering possible 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters complained in a survey about unfriendly marine patrol officers, lack 
of parking, disturbances from special events, messy restrooms, vagrants and 
thefts.Boaters also questioned why the city charges the same rate at the 
Downtown Marina as it does for the more popular Alamitos Bay Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown Marina is "just way overpriced and people realize it," said Paul 
Breul, vice president of the Long Beach Marina Boat Owners Assn., who compiled 
the survey results. About 60 of the 1,133 slip holders in the Downtown Marina 
responded to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission discussed the possibility of lowering prices downtown to make 
the marina more appealing. More than 500 of the 1,830 slips downtown are 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one boat owner said he had no problem with the marina. Charlie 
Batton, who has rented a slip there for 10 years, said the price and facilities 
suit him fine. "It could be worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will submit its findings and recommendations to the City 
Council. TY TAGAMI

COVER STORY; IN A DISMAL ERA FOR BALLET, DANCE TROUPES ARE RELYING ON SOME 
102-YEAR-OLD TCHAIKOVSKY MAGIC AND THE FACT THAT, TRADITIONALLY, THE HOLIDAYS 
ARE. . .; 'NUTCRACKER' TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Tis the season when otherwise normal people think seriously of dallying with 
fairies and living toys in the Sugar Plum Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is the theory among most classical dance promoters. There's 
such a seasonal appetite for Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker," they say, that it 
guarantees a big box office every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, that may have been true. But in recent years, producing the 
holiday favorite has become a financial gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of a dismal period for classical dance in Southern California, 
resident companies and a few touring groups -- from the Joffrey Ballet to the 
Channel Islands Ballet -- are optimistically staging versions of the 
102-year-old chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most elaborate, the Los Angeles Classical Ballet production, opened 
Friday at the Terrace Theater in Long Beach, complete with 140 dancers, half a 
dozen headliners including prima ballerinas Cynthia Harvey and Evelyn Cisneros, 
a live horse and a 60-piece orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we do it, we do it full-out," says David Wilcox, artistic director of 
the group. "The Nutcracker" runs through Sunday at the Terrace, then moves to 
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium Dec. 22-24. 
</P>
<P>
 The $750,000 production is the only one of the year for the struggling Long 
Beach-based dance group, which once aspired to be the resident dance company of 
the Los Angeles Music Center and the Orange County Center for the Performing 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other dance groups in Southern California, the Los Angeles Classical is 
only a true "company" during the six weeks it takes to rehearse and stage a 
ballet. It has six permanent employees, none of them dancers. "We're as 
permanent a company as you get (in Southern California)," Wilcox says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, the Los Angeles Classical's "Nutcracker" is the company's only 
chance this year to bring in some significant revenue. Despite the ballet's 
popularity, dance companies have discovered, the payoffs are not guaranteed. 
Two years ago, the company's "Nutcracker" broke even instead of producing an 
expected $300,000 in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sales were just not there," says Louis Skelton, former board chairman, 
who added that the production made money last year. Some recent productions of 
the classic by other companies have lost money, dance professionals say. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete with television and other forms of entertainment, Wilcox says, 
ballets have to aim for the spectacular. "Our audience has to be blown away by 
spectacular balletic feats, dazzling scenery, fantastic music," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With no standing corps of dancers, putting together a "Nutcracker" is 
something like raising an army from scratch in four weeks -- complete with 
front-line soldiers, reserves and logistics units. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days leading up to opening night, the company's headquarters on Wardlow 
Road percolated with so much activity that the walls seemed to bulge outward. 
</P>
<P>
 Production manager Monique L'Hereux and staff worked their way through an 
hour-by-hour schedule of essential tasks, from "add lights and spots" to 
"dry-ice rehearsal" (for fog and dream scenes). A squad of sales operators 
handled ticket orders, which came in at a greater pace than last year, they 
said. Carpenters were dispatched to a warehouse to pick through huge scenery 
panels, repaint sets and repair props. 
</P>
<P>
 And in three big rooms with mirrored walls, dancers rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Napoleon for this dancing army is Wilcox, the usually unexcitable artistic 
director, an energetic man with pale blue eyes and receding sandy-gray hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective here is that the dancers are so well-rehearsed that at no time 
during the ballet do you see them fumbling or tripping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen dancers at that moment glided and spun through a Tchaikovsky waltz 
under the hawk-like gaze of ballet mistress Julia Ellis. There was a measure of 
fumbling and tripping, as well as a few near-collisions and, at the end, some 
gasping for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the dancers listened to a rambling critique from the London-born Ellis, 
concluding with an appeal for more precise technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls, quite a few of you are doing bent-kneed chainees ," Ellis said, 
referring to a standard turning movement. "Work on this." She pointed to her 
own slightly bent knees, which she straightened with deliberate movement and a 
grunt. "Eh! Straighten those legs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox's company was born in 1982 as the Long Beach Ballet. In 1991, seeking 
to give the organization a broader regional base, he renamed it the Los Angeles 
Classical Ballet. Those were flush times for the company, which had 
performances of "A Midsummer's Night Dream" and "Coppelia" under its belt and 
planned an ambitious 36-week season. 
</P>
<P>
 But late in 1991, the company began experiencing funding problems. According 
to former board chairman Skelton, the problems began with the region's 
recession and defense cutbacks, which prompted large-scale layoffs at McDonnell 
Douglas, Long Beach's largest employer, and elsewhere. Suddenly, people had 
less money to spend on show tickets, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simultaneously with all of that, we had just invested $200,000 in costumes," 
Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, economic times were so hard that even "Nutcracker" sales plummeted. 
Corporate donations dropped as well, he adds. Last year, the company was more 
than $500,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's strategy has been to ride out the doldrums, limiting its 
productions to the tried-and-true "Nutcracker," and to come back in 1995 with a 
more ambitious program, Wilcox says. "We pulled way back. We wanted to make 
sure we got through this period." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual season has been reduced from 20 weeks to six, and debts are slowly 
being paid, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $175,000 of the company's short-term debts were paid off last year with 
"Nutcracker" profits, Skelton said. Most of the remainder, Wilcox said, will be 
paid off after the current production, which had sold $700,000 worth of tickets 
by early this week. The company needs to sell about $850,000 to cover 
production and administrative costs, Wilcox said. 
</P>

 As a sign of the company's rebounding health, Wilcox has scheduled a new 
production of Prokofiev's "Cinderella" at the Terrace for next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Classical Ballet's financial difficulties are hardly unique, 
dance professionals say. Even nationally prominent groups are struggling. For 
example, the Joffrey recently canceled part of its spring season, and the 
American Ballet Theatre also canceled some performances, including a three-day 
January engagement at the San Diego Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 By regional standards, the Los Angeles Classical, with its apparent upward 
financial trend, is doing relatively well, says Serena Tripi, board president 
of the Dance Resource Center of Greater Los Angeles, a support group for local 
dance professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no big companies in Los Angeles (and the surrounding region), but 
there are tons of smaller ones," Tripi says. "Finding funds is a constant 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By last week, the Los Angeles Classical production was beginning to come into 
sharper focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Master carpenter Bill Yates and a crew of 10 had moved the ballet's 30,000 
pounds of scenery from the company's warehouse on Daisy Street to the 
3,117-seat Terrace, which is part of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. 
They had also repainted most of the props, such as a throne and giant Christmas 
gift boxes, and replaced worn scrims on the show's assortment of drop sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenery fills the Terrace to overflowing," Yates said with a touch of 
wonder in his voice. "We had to hang one piece off the back wall because it 
doesn't fit in the rigging." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, calls for tickets were lighting up the pad on the telephone in 
Wilcox's office. "Look at this," he said, watching the telephone admiringly. 
"It's going bonkers this year!" 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, in the stuffy loft office where six ticket representatives handled 
telephone sales, there were a few stray calls for tickets for Steve Lawrence 
and Eydie Gorme, who preceded the ballet at the Terrace. But "Nutcracker" 
calls, said supervisor Elaine Graham, were arriving in big, 
cash-register-ringing waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the matinees are already close to being sold out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the busiest people on Wardlow Road appeared to be wardrobe 
mistress/costume designer Donna Dickens and her assistant, Brenda Wyatt, who 
were still fitting dancers and stitching clasps two days before opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with 130 to 140 people here," Dickens said in her makeshift 
shop in a trailer, where dancers were hopping in and out of costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens poked at a dress draped incongruously around David Markham, a brawny 
man who plays Mother Ginger, out of whose tent-like skirts pop two dozen 
schoolchildren in jester costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably be working 18 to 20 hours a day from here on," said Dickens, 
who has designed the production's new flare-skirted Spanish dancer costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox, a former principal dancer with the Berlin Ballet, is a seemingly 
unflappable presence in all of this, working out a scheduling problem with 
stage manager Diana McGuigan, meeting with a few of the more than 100 
volunteers and chaperons for children in the show and explaining a step to one 
of his dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 But occasionally, he is blindsided. On this day, Anton Labuschange, associate 
director and the dancing Cavalier in "The Nutcracker," is the messenger. One of 
the prima ballerinas, who appears in the show with her dancer husband, is 
demanding toe shoes. For free. 
</P>
<P>
 The principals buy their own, Wilcox says, clenching his jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "She insists," Labuschange says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the thousands of dollars we're giving her?" Wilcox says. "What 
about the hotel room? The per diem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he relents, allocating three pairs of shoes to the ballerina. "And 
her husband gets two," Labuschange said. Wilcox throws his hands up in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dancers in the ballet have performed in "Nutcracker" so many times 
that they must search for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done every single part," Labuschange says. "I've done it so many times, 
I feel like Yul Brynner doing 'The King and I.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Cisneros, a Long Beach-born dancer who is now a principal with the San 
Francisco Ballet, says she draws inspiration from the audience. "You try to 
find something new to play with -- the musicality, playing the character," 
Cisneros says. "You gain the lightness and sparkle from the children in the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cisneros is a kind of traveling Sugar Plum Fairy this season, 
performing the role in such cities as Toledo, Detroit and San Francisco. With 
the Los Angeles Classical, she shares the demanding role with Cynthia Harvey, 
former Bolshoi Ballet dancer Lilia Mousavarova and Lisa Cueto, a Wilcox 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the dress rehearsals, the four weeks of practice and planning were 
beginning to show results. Wilcox stood at the edge of the stage, watching 
every move critically. 
</P>
<P>
 There were still some staging problems. The battle between the toy soldiers 
and the mice was a muddle, with young dance students playing the mice looking 
confused about what they were supposed to do. Mother Ginger's broad skirts -- 
which covered a rolling platform as well as her brood of children -- got 
tangled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ballet orchestra, directed by Cal State Long Beach professor Roger 
Hickman, was sounding crisp, giving the dance numbers on stage an added 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox is scornful of ballet groups that perform "The Nutcracker" with taped 
music. "To perform without a symphony orchestra is artistically a major 
failing," he says. "People don't go to the theater to listen to a CD." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Classical first performed "The Nutcracker" in 1983, in a 
modest $50,000 production. This year's $750,000 production is the company's 
12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asks Wilcox if it gets easier each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easier?" he asks, brushing a hand through his hair. "That's like asking, 
'Does life get easier?' "

AROUND; CUTBACKS THREATEN CARSON YOUTH CYCLING PROGRAM ON OLYMPIC OVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a pass around the banked oval bicycle course, James Hardy, 11, zips his 
gear-less, brake-less bike up the steep bank and pedals madly past the other 
members of his team. Slipping back into the line, he grins good-naturedly at 
the boy he passed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Training for track bicycle racing in a youth program at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, Hardy has developed strength, balance and endurance, but the program has 
had more than just physical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come out here, you focus on one thing," Hardy said. "That gets 
things off your back -- especially your parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy is one of more than 400 youngsters ages 10 to 18 who learned competitive 
cycling through a free program offered at the Olympic Velodrome last year. But 
that group of riders will probably be the last, if adequate funding can't be 
found, program officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the cycling program's inception in 1987, a grant from the Amateur 
Athletic Foundation has provided more than half its funding, with the 
university making up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAF was formed to administer $95.4 million it received as one-third of the 
profits from the 1984 Olympic Games. The foundation's mission has been to fund 
youth sports programs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last three years, the AAF has cut the program 20% each year. Last 
year's grant was about $26,000, said Velodrome General Manager Nick Curl. The 
AAF has informed the university that the grant will continue to shrink by 20% 
each year until it is depleted. 
</P>
<P>
 Further cutbacks in the AAF grant may mean the end of the youth cycling 
program because the university may not be able to make up the difference, and 
alternate grants are hard to find, Curl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Velodrome is also a leftover from the 1984 Games. The special 
track was built to host Olympic track cycling events, and afterward was left to 
the university to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides salaries for instructors and administrators, costs for the cycling 
program include providing helmets and $1,000 racing bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 During consecutive four-week sessions, the young boys and girls learn how to 
control the bikes and formulate racing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy's mother says the intensive training has paid off in other ways. "This 
has really helped him and motivated him," Mia Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year a team of 12 youngsters from the program won more than 25 medals at 
the U.S. Junior National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, Curl said, the track provides an after-school alternative to keep 
youths out of trouble. But for some of the participants, the pleasures are much 
simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenyae Rollings, 15, said he loves to go fast on a track bicycle: "You feel 
the wind in your face."

 La Mirada High was braced for a high-scoring game in the Southern Section 
Division VIII final against Bloomington, a team that set the national 
single-season scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to break a couple here and there," La Mirada 
cornerback Eric Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Matadores didn't count on were three turnovers in a 48-32 defeat 
Friday night at La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 The most costly was a fumble on the La Mirada 15-yard line in the fourth 
quarter with Bloomington leading, 42-32. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington (14-0) drove 83 yards in 11 plays to take a 48-32 lead on Cheyane 
Caldwell's second touchdown, a 29-yard run with 2 minutes 27 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada (13-1), which trailed, 28-11, in the second quarter and 34-18 midway 
through the third quarter, closed to 34-32 on Brett Darnell's four-yard scoring 
run with two minutes left in the third quarter. Darnell's run was set up by 
Hugo Corral's 89-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral had 174 yards and two touchdowns in nine carries and Mike Palumbo 
passed for 153 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy was to stay close and hope they would tire in the second half," 
La Mirada Coach John Mele said about Bloomington, a 27-player team that had 
nine two-way starters. "There's no question their offense is for real. We had a 
chance to win it but we had the (fumble) and they jumped on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington, which averaged 62.9 points and scored 82 points or more three 
times, finished with 880 points to break the 1975 record of 827 set by Big 
Sandy, Tex., in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' double tight end, double-wing offense featured only eight running 
plays and two passing plays, but racked up 560 yards. Greg Oliver, the Southern 
Section record-holder with 352 points in a season, rushed for 245 yards and 
four touchdowns and Caldwell ran for 196 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They send a lot of guys at you and you really don't know who the ball carrier 
is," Martinez said. FIRST OF A KIND 
</P>
<P>
 Bell High defeated Birmingham, 25-3, to win its first City Section football 
title in the 3-A final Friday night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Benard rushed for 183 yards in 17 carries and a touchdown for Bell 
(11-3), which lost in the 3-A final in 1972, 1975, 1976 and the 2-A final in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored 25 consecutive points, 18 in the second quarter, to overcome 
a 3-0 deficit. Gus Valenzuela completed eight of 19 passes for 167 yards and 
finished the season with a school-record 2,143 yards passing. FOOTBALL AWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Montiel of Montebello and James Sherman of Whittier were named Southeast 
back and lineman of the year and John Mele of La Mirada was named coach of the 
year at The Times' All-Star prep football brunch Sunday at the Cerritos 
Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel made The Times' Southeast team on defense last season. The Almont 
League's most valuable player saw action at quarterback, outside linebacker and 
punter. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound senior completed 62 of 129 passes for 10 
touchdowns. He also rushed for 479 yards in 74 carries and eight touchdowns. On 
defense, he led the Oilers with 39 tackles and 48 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, a 6-4, 290-pound senior tackle, was selected to the The Times' 
Southeast team for the second year in a row. Nicknamed the "Sherminator" by 
teammates, the Del Rio League lineman of the year can bench-press 430 pounds 
and has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA, USC, Washington, Colorado and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mele guided La Mirada (13-1) to the Division VIII final for the second time in 
three years. The Matadores went undefeated in Suburban League play and had 
their first unbeaten regular season since 1984 under Mele, in his 16th year of 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Fletcher of Paramount and Taeao Salausa of Long Beach Poly were 
named South Coast back and lineman of the year and Mike Ono of Jordan was 
honored as the South Coast coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, a 5-11, 185-pound quarterback, rushed for 1,318 yards and 18 
touchdowns in 110 carries and passed for 1,126 yards and 12 touchdowns to help 
Paramount to a share of the San Gabriel Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3, 230-pound Salausa, who had 12 quarterback sacks and a fumble 
recovery, was an integral part of Poly's drive toward a share of its third 
consecutive Moore League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Ono directed Jordan its first playoff victory in 47 years, a 46-21 victory 
over Crespi in the first round of the Division I playoffs. Jordan (8-4) 
finished in a three-way tie with Poly and Lakewood for the Moore League title 
for a share of its third championship in seven seasons. BEACH FRONT 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State volleyball team failed to qualify for the national final 
four for the first time in four years, losing to Ohio State, 15-5, 14-16, 15-9, 
15-5, in the final of the Northwest Regional Saturday at the Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle Burton and Brita Schwerm had 24 and 19 kills for second-seeded Long 
Beach (27-5), the defending national champion which won its fourth consecutive 
Big West Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second victory of the season over Long Beach for top-seeded Ohio 
State (29-2), the Big Ten champion. The Buckeyes defeated the 49ers in four 
games in the first match. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton led with 24 kills as the 49ers defeated Hawaii, 15-12, 12-15, 15-11, 
11-15, 15-10, in the semifinals Friday. Traci Dahl added 21 kills, including 
three in the fifth game, and Schwerm had 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Melissa Gower of Long Beach State has been selected as the Big West 
Conference women's basketball player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-2 senior center had 36 points and 14 rebounds in a victory over Southern 
Utah and 27 points and 13 rebounds in a win over Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Gower is averaging 28 points and 14.3 rebounds for Long Beach (2-1), which 
plays at No. 8 Colorado Monday and Colorado State Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Long Beach State men's crew team and Coach Michael Vescovi have been 
named the Regional crew and coach of the year by the United States Rowing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Beach State Assistant Athletic Director Scott Cathcart served as a back 
judge in the Division I football final between Mater Dei and Bishop Amat 
Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. NAMES IN THE NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Whiting has resigned as co-football coach at Long Beach Poly. Whiting, 
who has been at Poly since 1981, coached with Jerry Jaso the past 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 With Whiting directing the offense, Poly amassed an 81-30-3 record. The 
Jackrabbits won a share of the Moore League title nine times and tied 
Huntington Beach Edison for the Southern Section Big 5 title in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly finished 10-2 this season and advanced to the Division I quarterfinals. 
Jaso will assume all the head coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting, who will remain at Poly for the rest of the school year, plans to 
move to Northern California in order to be closer to his son Brandon, who 
finished his freshman football season at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrea Anderson of Long Beach Poly has signed a letter of intent to run 
track at UCLA. Anderson, who has run 11.57 and 23.74 for the 100 and 200 
meters, placed second in the 100 and third in the 200 in the 1993 state meet as 
a sophomore. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton women's basketball team is off to a 5-2 start. Elana Adams had 30 
points and Eugenia Mays added 19 to help the Tartars defeat Oxnard in a 
nonconference game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton men (4-7) will be searching for their fifth victory in seven games 
in the Glendale tournament that begins today and continues through Thursday.

PEOPLE; LITERACY CLASSES LIFT IMMIGRANTS' SELF-CONFIDENCE 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the modest back room of the Cudahy Roman Catholic Church, Salvadoran 
immigrant Emma Amaya has held sway over the minds of 22 adults two nights a 
week for the past year: She is teaching them how to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Under flickering fluorescent lights, amid walls adorned with portraits of a 
suffering Christ and sermons copied in a child's cursive script, Amaya conducts 
her Spanish-language literacy class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed out on so much before I started this class a year ago," Helda 
Romero, 42, said in the gentle Spanish of her homeland of El Salvador, 
swallowing all her S's and slowly rolling her R's.  
</P>
<P>
 "All of my information came from television. Now I'm able to read newspapers 
like La Opinion, and learn more about what happens here and in El Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero came to Los Angeles 21 years ago as an illegal immigrant, fleeing civil 
strife that only recently ended. Six years ago she was granted amnesty when 
U.S. law allowed her to apply. Now she has become literate in her native 
language, Spanish, and soon hopes to learn English well enough to apply for 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's necessary (for the students) to learn how to read in Spanish first," 
said Amaya, adding that all the students plan to learn English because they 
want to become citizens. "First, for reasons of pride; second, because it makes 
learning English much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to read in their native language boosts self-confidence and gives 
them learning skills that will help with English, Amaya said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful gift to receive, learning how to read. Now there are so many 
more opportunities," said Romero, the mother of two sons, 16 and 8, both born 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The students recently completed their first year of lessons in the barren back 
room of the church they all attend. Some have been to more classes than others 
whose schedules conflict with the Monday and Thursday night meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The students contribute what they can for the class by holding tamale sales or 
selling raffle tickets after church services. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they have managed to save enough to purchase a few notebooks and 
pencils. Their texts are donated by student groups from universities in Mexico 
City and El Salvador.  
</P>
<P>
 The program they participate in is called El Proyecto de Educacion Popular del 
Sureste de Los Angeles (PESE), the Popular Education Project of Southeast Los 
Angeles. It is affiliated with California Literacy and the Instituto de 
Educacion Popular del Sur de California, two established literacy services that 
have generated community-based programs such as the one run by Amaya.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very effective system that's been used throughout the world to teach 
adults to read," Amaya said.

SPECIAL EVENT; PLEASE TOUCH THE EXHIBITS; FROM THE BOWERS COMES KIDSEUM, WHERE 
THE LEARNING IS HANDS-ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 When Bowers Museum executive director Peter Keller went out for a sandwich one 
day last spring, he didn't plan to pick up anything more substantial than a ham 
on rye. 
</P>
<P>
 But his lunch-hour walk turned out to be the first steps in an eight-month 
process that, through a serendipitous mix of good timing and combined efforts 
by Bowers and city staff and community members, is about to bring a new 
learning center to elementary school-age children and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning at 10, the Bowers' Kidseum will open its doors to the 
public. Housed in an 11,000-square-foot building two blocks from the Bowers' 
main Museum of Cultural Art, it will feature interactive exhibits targeted to 
kids ages 6 through 12, along with a children's art lab and gallery and a 
resource library for teachers. The majority of Kidseum's exhibits and programs 
will focus on the three cultures emphasized at the main museum: The Americas, 
the Pacific Rim and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening festivities, which will include storytelling, art activities, ethnic 
games and live music and dance, will be free to the public and will continue 
till 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidseum is opening just a little more than two years after a three-year, 
$12-million expansion of the main museum. And frankly, the plans for it came as 
something of a surprise even to the Bowers staff.  
</P>
<P>
 On the day Keller took his lunchtime stroll, the Bowers administrators had 
been poised to begin a $165,000 renovation of their existing education center 
-- then housed in a down-at-the-heels former strip mall just north of the 
museum -- with funding from Santa Ana's Community Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But while walking down the alley that runs parallel to Main Street from the 
museum, Keller noticed the vacant former California Federal Savings building on 
the corner of Main and 18th. It struck him that the museum could make good use 
of the building for its educational programs, and when he returned to the 
office, he mentioned the idea to Janet Baker, the Bowers' chief of education 
and curator of Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks that followed, planning sessions between Keller, Baker and 
Patricia Korzec, who would be named Kidseum coordinator, along with input from 
members of the city's redevelopment agency refined the initial plan from a 
simple expansion of existing programs to a full-blown children's museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The process has been fast and furious from the start, Baker says.

 "When Peter told me he'd like to open (Kidseum) by Christmas, I said 
'Christmas what year?' It's amazing to think all of this came about in just a 
few months. We're still a little dizzy around here." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials helped move the project along by quickly transferring the 
$165,000 earmarked for the old education center to the Cal Fed building 
project. Most of the money was spent modifying the building to comply with 
fire-safety regulations and to improve access for disabled visitors. The 
building is owned by the city's redevelopment office and is being loaned to the 
Bowers through a special operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidseum doesn't stand to be a big moneymaker for the Bowers: Admission is only 
$1.50 to $4.50 -- and the tickets also will be good for admission to the main 
museum. The money to develop exhibits and programs and to meet operating costs 
has to come from somewhere, so the Bowers launched an $850,000 fund-raising 
campaign to cover the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about $700,000 has been given or pledged by corporate and private 
donors, including the Weingart Foundation, Disneyland and New Line Cinema. 
Monterey Carpets has donated custom floor coverings, and dozens of $100 donors 
have created hand-painted tiles to hang near the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it won't be ready by Sunday, a 6-by-20-foot mural is being drawn by 
Chuck Jones, the internationally known creator of the Road Runner and Bugs 
Bunny (among other characters) who lives in Corona del Mar and is an honorary 
Bowers fellow. The mural, which will feature Jones' characters, will hang in 
the main hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors of $50 or more gathered Sunday evening for a party that featured a 
sneak peek at the Kidseum, a dinner and a performance by Santa Ana's St. Joseph 
Ballet troupe of inner-city youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation process had been in high gear for weeks. Five days before the 
party, construction workers still were installing lights and building exhibit 
areas. The Discovery Bridge, a free-standing suspension bridge that visitors 
can use to cross into the main exhibit area, was a skeleton of poles and cross 
beams; toilets awaiting installation stood sentry in the back parking lot. 
Power tools whined while Howard Stern blared on a worker's portable radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling among the chaos in shirt sleeves, Keller explained the motivation 
for establishing a separate children's center. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though hundreds of schoolchildren tour the Bowers' California history 
rooms every weekday, he said, "we've felt for a long time that we had 
underserved families with young children." He noted that Bowers patrons -- 
including his own 8-year-old son -- had expressed this view as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Baker pointed out, children are not the only ones who might benefit 
from the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our target audience is 6- to 12-year-olds, but by and large I hope we will 
educate parents and teachers, too," said Baker, who had put aside her academic 
work to schlep garbage bags full of cardboard bathroom tissue tubes and empty 
tennis ball canisters into the Kidseum art lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a changing world. Our demographics are changing, and we are living in 
communities where people are from diverse backgrounds," she continued. "This is 
what the future holds, and (we hope that the multicultural emphasis of Kidseum) 
will help the younger generation get a step ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Kidseum organizers have established a central theme of adventure 
and exploration to carry visitors through the museum's separate areas. As he or 
she enters, a child will be given a Kidseum passport to be stamped at each area 
when the child completes a task. The first stop is the Explorer's Backpack 
station, where visitors can check out one of 21 brightly colored packs, each 
containing a different self-contained lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Korzec showed how a parent and child would use the packs by demonstrating one 
labeled "Bountiful Bazaars." Inside was a script, one of many written for the 
series by Korzec and Baker, to help the parent guide the child through lessons 
on textiles, communication and other aspects of various cultures. The scripts 
offer information and suggest questions to peak the child's observational and 
problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 On the average, a backpack project takes about half an hour to complete, 
depending on a child's age and the degree of difficulty, said Korzec, who has a 
bachelor's in art education and is completing a master's in museum education. 
"Bountiful Bazaars" asks you to identify a strip of African kente cloth, to 
estimate how many you would need to make a shirt for yourself, and to write 
your name using a set of hieroglyphic stamps. At other points in the lesson, 
one can trace figures with a Chinese brush, take a stab at chopsticks, finger 
the wool of a toy llama or send a message with a small African drum. 
</P>
<P>
 Other titles in the backpack series include "Cracked Pot," an exercise in 
archeology; "Fit for a King," a lesson in international textiles, and "Swingin' 
Safari," an overview of African instruments. Korzec says the format allows 
children to contrast and compare aspects of various cultures through hands-on 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times we segment the study of cultures," she said. "But in the 
backpacks, kids will see there are a lot of similarities between them." 
</P>
<P>
 From the backpack station, children can cross the Discovery Bridge into the 
main gallery, where they will find a variety of interactive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 They can dig through trunks filled with ethnic costumes and stage impromptu 
performances on a raised stage. An organization called the Fashion Group of 
Orange County has donated many of the costumes and will continue to add to the 
collection, Korzec said. The stage also may be used by visiting groups, she 
added; on Sunday, Fiesta Folklorico, a children's dance troupe, will perform 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is a storytelling alcove with a glass wall facing the gallery. Here, 
children can pull up "magic carpet" squares to listen to international tales 
spun by volunteer storytellers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the lineup will include Paul Apodaca, the Bowers curator of Native 
American exhibits, telling Navajo and Hopi stories. Storytelling sessions, 
developed by Bowers docents using artifacts from the museum's collection, will 
continue Saturdays from 1 to 2 p.m. initially and will increase as time goes 
on, according to Dottie Weingarten, the volunteer coordinator. Organizers hope 
soon to offer stories in Spanish and Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Cal Fed bank vault, its foot-thick steel door propped permanently 
open, has been transformed into the Time Vault, dedicated to Native American 
history. Here, against murals painted by local artist Higgy Vasquez, children 
can explore the evolution of Native American culture and traditions through a 
variety of artifacts, pretending to grind corn with a stone mortar and pestle, 
trying on a ribbon shirt or beaded moccasins, or playing the hoop and dart game 
of the Yokuts tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Artifacts will be rotated every few months so repeat visitors will "always be 
able to see and try new things," said Korzec. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anything going on in this place that's not touchable," 
she added. "The whole concept is to be able to touch and experience. . . . I 
have a feeling that after they've been in the Bowers (main museum, where the 
artifacts cannot be handled), adults will enjoy (Kidseum's) accessibility just 
as much as the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the vault, a large art lab appointed with tables, sinks and a kiln 
will be open weekends from noon to 3 p.m. for drop-in art classes. Projects 
will tie in to the Kidseum exhibits (on Sunday, children can make Native 
American rain sticks and rattles). 
</P>
<P>
 Korzec also plans to implement a "Rainbow Exchange," a monthly program in 
which Kidseum visitors will create artwork to trade with children of other 
cultures. The art received at Kidseum will be displayed in a children's gallery 
in the community room (Korzec hopes to mount a display by children in Africa 
there in the spring). 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor of the facility is for offices, a teachers' resource room and 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the county's arts and business communities have been instrumental 
in getting Kidseum on its feet, said Baker, noting that an advisory committee 
has helped her develop educational programs and fund-raising and will help 
attract local artists to display and perform. Baker and Korzec also received 
direction from representatives of some of the area's established children's 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Cathy Michaels, executive director of the 17-year-old Children's 
Museum at La Habra. Though she expressed some concern over competing with 
Kidseum for community funding, Michaels said she views the new facility as a 
positive addition to the county's cultural landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Johnson is director of the Discovery Museum, which operates a hands-on 
history facility in Santa Ana as well as the Launch Pad, an interactive science 
center in Costa Mesa's Crystal Court mall. Johnson hopes to open the Discovery 
Science Center, a 76,000-square-foot interactive learning center and Imax 
theater, on Main Street in mid-1997. If that happens, the Discovery Science 
Center would join Kidseum and the Bowers in Santa Ana's "museum district," a 
downtown area city leaders hope to establish as the cultural heart of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her science center would be less than a mile away from Kidseum, 
Johnson doesn't view Kidseum as competition but welcomes it as a positive step 
for arts groups and their audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased," she said, "because I think the City Council and the city staff 
are making the arts a priority in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't nearly enough cultural opportunities for kids in this county. 
Having a strong program like Kidseum will be a great advantage for us, and vice 
versa."

Club Recordings," call TimesLine and press * 5531 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when the 42 songs on this two-CD set were recorded, the Ferriday 
Fireball was still fully capable on a good night of playing rock 'n' roll and 
country music as good as either gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing two or three times a year at the Palomino in North Hollywood, he had 
a lot of good nights. This live document beautifully captures the musical 
fireworks -- the only thing missing are the visuals: the sight of Lewis glaring 
out at the crowd over the top of his sunglasses, assailing a verbose drunk at 
the bar or raising his foot for a heel kick at the keyboard at any given 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The utter unpredictability of his performances was intoxicating -- I attended 
every Lewis show in the Southland I could, and was at most of these. Even on 
successive nights his shows were rarely similar, the set list changing on his 
whim. You can hear that here, when he'll launch a song without first giving his 
band so much as a song title or a key signature. A few bars later, they catch 
on and join in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, his band was as extraordinarily flexible as it was gifted. 
Seminal rock guitarist James Burton was a regular guest, along with 
fiddler-guitarist Kenny Lovelace, drummer Buddy Harmon and bassists Bob Moore 
and Joel Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs range from his '50s Sun Records hits -- among them, "Whole Lot of 
Shakin' Goin' On" and "Great Balls of Fire" -- to his late-'60s and '70s 
country material, including "Another Place, Another Time" and "Middle Aged 
Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But he never just sings any of these songs -- he moves in and sets up his 
furniture. His performances paralleled his temperament at any given moment, 
running the gamut from unfettered braggadocio to heartbreaking regret to 
sincere repentance. His honesty could be as embarrassing as it was inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks Brooks & Dunn are as wild and crazy as country music gets 
should listen to this and get a dose of the real thing. RANDY LEWIS

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

<P>
 The UCLA Madrigal Singers 
</P>
<P>
 "Hark, How the Bells . . ." (1993) 
</P>
<P>
 Cambria  
</P>
<P>
 * Times Line (TM): 808-8463. To hear an excerpt from "Hark, How the Bells . .

</P>
<P>
 A little gem of unconventionality in a sea of fairly generic Christmas 
releases, this collection of holiday works by the UCLA Madrigal Singers ought 
to appeal to anyone who has just heard "Here Comes Santa Claus" for the 500th 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by its conductor of 25 years, the now-retired Donn Weiss, this 
ensemble of 22 male and female singers offers 22 selections on this CD, many of 
which are likely unfamiliar to most Christmas music fans. Only eight of the 
songs bear immediately recognizable names ("Angels We Have Heard on High" and 
"Joy to the World," for instance). The rest are a blend of the modern, the 
stylistic and the traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular note is Vaclav Nelhybel's "Estampie Natalis," a chant-like piece 
with insistent and tricky rhythms. The work's Middle Eastern overtones show off 
the singers' principal assets: a fine rhythmic point and crisp diction. 
Hungarian composer Zoltan Kodaly's "A Christmas Carol" and "De Tierra Lejana 
Venimos," the latter a Puerto Rican folk song arranged by conductor Weiss, also 
allow the choir to stretch both stylistically and linguistically. 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners hoping for great sonority may be a bit disappointed, however. These 
are finely drilled voices belonging to competent musicians -- and Weiss makes 
the most of them -- but they are also college-age singers. Expect an occasional 
edginess or dominance in the women's voices and nasality in the men's. And 
don't look for rumbling bassos or burnished tenors. A bit more mileage on those 
vocal cords will do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are lovely moments, as in the tender and heartfelt "Bring a 
Torch, Jeannette, Isabella," arranged lushly by Dan Wells. Here, the singers 
show a rich sound and sensitivity beyond their years. 
</P>
<P>
 This CD is a fine addition to the home Christmas repertoire, with the variety 
of a well-programmed choral concert. PATRICK MOTT

COMEDY; JUGGLING WORDS; AFTER YEARS OF TOSSING INDIAN CLUBS, CHRIS BLISS 
DECIDED TO GET VERBAL -- AND TOPICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's reputation as a conservative audience tough on comedians with 
a viewpoint doesn't faze social observer Chris Bliss. He has a simple credo: 
Smart comedy transcends politics and narrow-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for what's funny to me and then try to make it as funny as possible 
for other people," said Bliss, who is the middle act at the Irvine Improv 
through Sunday, then returns Jan. 10 as the headliner. "The idea is to 
communicate some ideas without being preachy. I don't believe in comedy that is 
accessible only to the comics at the back of the room, unless it's one of those 
nights when the audience is on life support. Then it's OK to be hipper than 
thou." 
</P>
<P>
 He sees his task as not unlike the court jester of yore, pointing out that the 
emperor is naked. His goal is not to take cheap shots, but to open a dialogue, 
make a connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a comedy vulture feeding off the corpse," said Bliss, who 
grew up in Washington, the son of a corporate lawyer. "The reason I'm on stage 
is I have a strong desire to communicate. What good is intelligence if you 
can't communicate? And it has to be funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Irony and absurdity count, too, and Bliss need go no further than a bankrupt 
Orange County to underscore that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not funny, but is it ironic? You bet. They got taken by their own 
people, the brokers." 
</P>
<P>
 But for perhaps the ultimate irony, the veteran cable-TV performer turns to 
fallout from the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 19 years the Vietnamese were living off shrapnel. It was the second 
leading export. They sold the shrapnel to Japan for cars, which (the Japanese) 
sold to us. That is unbelievable, as sweet an irony as you can find. The 
emotion is out of the cycle at that point. They're just selling us back our 
bombs. Something in there shows how we're all tied together. I'm always looking 
for some symbol of unity." 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss wasn't always so verbal and keenly aware of life around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people still remember him as a world-class juggler who set his act to 
music -- with black lights and strobes, but no words. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister taught him the basics when he was in his teens, and it became a way 
to kill time for the self-described (back then) egghead and acerbic guy before 
he entered college and studied comparative literature in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early '80s, he was tossing Indian clubs around the globe, and in 1984 
he opened for Michael Jackson's Victory Tour. But a couple of years later, 
while touring with Julian Lennon, he tired of being a variety act and decided 
to try his hand at stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part of doing stand-up was to walk away from something I was 
excellent at," the Van Nuys resident said earlier his week after returning from 
Cleveland to a pile of junk mail. ("It's the gift of the information age. 
There's a reprocessed redwood on my table.") "I was doing 15 minutes of bad 
stand-up and 15 minutes of great juggling. It finally hit me that I was really, 
really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But with constant work, the comedy soon overtook the juggling portion of the 
show, and Bliss was headlining on comedy alone. For a while he abandoned 
juggling altogether, but has restored some of it to the routine as he gained 
confidence in his humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last two years, I've found a voice as a comic," said Bliss, who is on 
the road 30 to 35 weeks a year, flying about 50,000 miles. "I wound up back in 
the verbal world. And I like it here." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he has found something else to like: his first "Tonight Show" 
gig. He appeared in the middle of September, after being bumped a few weeks 
earlier by Max the Sea Lion, who played Andre the Seal in the movie "Andre." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a picture, and I didn't," Bliss said. "I understand it. There's a 
pecking order." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he still got paid and had a fine time -- such a fine time that Bliss 
expects to do his second "Tonight Show" set within six weeks of completing his 
Irvine shows.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was completely professional. They make sure you are completely 
comfortable, completely welcome. Basically, your questions are answered before 
you can ask them. There's nothing to think about except your performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Bliss' motivation comes from his frustration at watching society 
function in an Us-vs.-Them manner. He rails against the powerful who perpetrate 
that structure. He's afraid they don't understand the divisions such an 
adversarial approach opens in society. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought up a show he did after last month's elections, when a man in the 
audience yelled out, "We're the taking the country back!" 
</P>
<P>
 "From whom!?!?" Bliss asks, incredulous. "He was just some dittohead in the 
Us-vs.-Them mentality. I don't think it's a very good way to run a society. 
What works in business doesn't necessarily work in society. It's more like a 
family-run business. Nobody understands where the other person is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It disturbs me in this country we have people living separate realities (who) 
can't relate to anyone different. They have views, not facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Not knowing the facts and blindly accepting the status quo worries Bliss. That 
tells him no one is thinking. And that's not helping the democracy run.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the Gulf war was happening, it was very inspiring. Who wants to toe the 
party line? The propaganda machine? I mean, tie a yellow ribbon around the 
Exxon pump. There was nothing funny, but a lot was absurd. I can smell a 
falsehood in Denmark or Limbaugh Land. These things make you have a point of 
point of view. The L.A. riots give you a point of view.

WANNA DANCE?: HARD ROCKERS HAVE KNACK FOR A BANG-UP GOOD TIME

 What's a head-banger to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-rock fans have been badly hit by their evil nemesis hip-hop as nightclubs 
have either changed format or, like the Marquee, closed. Another blow has been 
the news of KNAC's pending departure in February, leaving many metalers 
wondering about the future of their scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Orchids' KNAC Nite on Wednesdays refuses to die, making the 
Orange venue one of the last in the county to offer a genuine head-bangers' 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by deejays Dangerous Darren and Eveready Ed of KNAC, the evening 
features live rock bands and other metal mania. But don't even try to squeeze 
past the doorman without an ID proving you're 21, as so many younger fans try 
to do -- you'll never get in. 
</P>
<P>
 With volume fully cranked, monster riffs resonate throughout. Free KNAC 
stickers and Jack Bucks are handed to patrons on entry. This play money is used 
for gambling at the club's blackjack table, where you can win glasses, hats and 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls and ceilings stand black in the shadows. Queen-size mirrors in faux 
antique, gold-leaf frames let patrons check their hair. Small spotlights and 
metallic-coned ceiling lamps cast hazy white beams over black tables in the 
300-capacity room. Each rectangular table seats four comfortably with an 
unobstructed view from all angles of the three-foot-tall, 30-foot-long stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage heads a roughly 1,000-square-foot wooden dance floor. A black, 
pinholed backdrop on the stage is back-illuminated, lending the illusion of a 
starry sky. Multicolored spotlights flash above. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak dance time is late -- around 11 p.m. Dress is casual, but don't be 
shocked to spot a generous share of scantily clad metal heads on the floor. 
They're fully decked in thigh highs, skin tights, crop tops and big hair -- 
traditional rocker threads, shredding clear across the gender board. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin short bars are centered along two walls. Complementing the sleek decor, 
the bars are constructed of black lacquer and illuminated glass blocks that 
look like stacked ice cubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Well drinks range from $2 to $6. Bottled import and domestic beers go $3 to 
$4. A glass of wine is $4. Sodas are $2.50 and bottled water $2. On "Low Dough 
Nights," there's usually no cover charge for shows by local acts. Performances 
by well-known bands such as Bang Tango or Gary Hoie, however, will set you back 
about $8.

JAZZ; GOING WITH WHAT WORKS; HE TAKES HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD -- AND INTO THE 
STUDIO 
</P>

 When it's time to record, saxophonist Richard Elliot doesn't follow the 
conventional wisdom employed by many contemporary jazz artists. Rather than try 
to boost sales by including a gaggle of big-name guest artists to work as 
sidemen, Elliot, who plays the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana tonight, sticks with 
his regular band, the one he has out on the road for more than 100 performances 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens if you use different bands, one for the studio and one for the 
road," he explained from his Woodland Hills home earlier this week, "is that 
the touring band, performing the material night after night, gets insight that 
the studio band won't have. They get a feel for the music. Sure, the studio 
musicians will do a good technical job of playing the music, but the touring 
band will give you a more personal performance." 
</P>
<P>
 That thinking has worked well for the former Tower of Power saxophonist. His 
previous recording from 1993, "Soul Embrace," went to No. 1 on Billboard's 
Contemporary Jazz Chart. His new CD, "After Dark," has been in the Top 10 since 
its release in October. The group playing the Galaxy tonight is the same heard 
on the album: guitarist Richard Smith, drummer Dave Reinhardt, bassist Naoki 
Yanai and keyboardist Ron Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Dark" isn't entirely void of special guests, however. Singer Jefferey 
Osborne takes a turn on "If Tomorrow Never Comes." The Tower of Power horns 
appear on the tribute Elliot has written for them, a tune called "The Boys From 
the Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist credits his five years in the mid-'80s with Tower of Power for 
instilling the enthusiasm that he brings to each performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tower of Power was very aggressive on stage, and I learned early on how 
important that was. It doesn't just mean playing fast and loud, but, even on a 
ballad, you have to stand and make a statement. If you didn't make every note 
count with Tower of Power, you'd get swallowed up, and people didn't know you 
were there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I'm playing now, I make sure it's a statement. If we come off the 
stage exhausted, I want the audience to feel that too. I'm not looking to give 
them a passive experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Passive is the last word that comes to mind after watching Elliot, who often 
falls to his knees to wail on his tenor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go out of our way to give a sincere visual as well as musical experience," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's often said that Elliot brings a vocalist's passion to his delivery, and 
the saxophonist agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sax, by nature, is very close to the human voice. Like the voice, it has the 
ability to be expressive. There's thousands of ways each note can be played; 
you can really put a lot of personality into it. Most sax players recognize 
that and try to exploit it as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 And after all, he said, personality is what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably the most important thing to me," he said. "Not how fast I can 
play or how well I can run the scales, but to sound like myself and no one 
else. It's the hardest thing to do."

WET & WILD; TIME FOR ANGLERS TO HEAD TO SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Edition.

<P>
 Fishing in Orange County in December can be the pits. 
</P>
<P>
 Early mornings along the coast are often foggy. Exposed beaches offer little 
protection from increased wind and surf. And you can spend hours dangling a 
hook off a pier without getting a single bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently my children and I found a solution. On a Sunday afternoon, we all put 
on our coats, hopped in the car and drove to Davey's Locker, a sportfishing 
shop at Newport Harbor at Balboa Pavilion. And for the next 4 1/2 hours, 
anchored at various points off the coast aboard a 77-foot sportfisher called 
the Western Pride, we pulled fish in so fast that we barely had time to get our 
hooks in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, Dad!" my 7-year-old son, Drew, shouted as a glistening mackerel 
performed midair somersaults at the end of his line. "I got one!" 
</P>
<P>
 Declared my 10-year-old daughter, Adina, after reeling in her third fish: 
"This is more fun than I expected!" 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently we're not the only ones who have thought of going fishing this way 
in winter. According to manager Norris Tapp, about 300 people -- at least half 
of them novices -- ride the shop's three fishing boats each week, and Davey's 
Locker is just one of several sportfishing companies based in Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good time of the year to learn the fundamentals," Tapp said. "The 
crowds are light, and crew members can pay a lot of attention to you. They're 
very anxious to help, and it's a little bit more relaxed during the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever possible, the deckhands will show you how to bait your hook. When 
your line gets tangled up with the guy's next to you, they will untangle it for 
you. And when you catch a fish, they will pull it off your hook, identify it 
and tell you what its legal size and bag limits are so that you can decide 
whether to keep the thing or throw it back. When not too busy, they'll even 
conduct on-deck fishing seminars en route to a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Davey's Locker offers a variety of fishing trips seven days a week. Popular 
among novices are the two half-day trips; the first from 6 a.m. to noon, the 
second from 12:30 to 5 p.m., each at a cost of $22 an adult and $14 a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with a little more experience, ambition or money may opt for the 
three-quarter-day Catalina trip -- from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily -- or the 
full-day trip to the outer Channel Islands leaving at 11 p.m. each night and 
returning the next evening. Cost of the three-quarter-day trip is $35 for 
adults and $25 for juniors, while the full-day trips are priced from $55 to 
$75, depending on destination. 
</P>
<P>
 On any trip, for an additional $19 a person, Davey's Locker will sell you a 
one-day fishing license and outfit you with all the gear you need. That was the 
option we took. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning our rented rods in niches carved conveniently into the ship's wooden 
railing, we settled down for the short but glorious ride through the harbor and 
down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being out here," said fellow passenger Lance Hoglund, 50, the breeze 
blowing through his hair. "It takes your mind off everything else, and no one 
can get hold of you." 
</P>
<P>
 In what seemed like no time, we were anchored a few miles down the coast off 
Crystal Cove, ready to drop our hooks in the water. Suddenly, the fish started 
biting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing out there during winter months is better than off a beach or pier 
because of the greater stability of deeper water, said Marty Igleheart, 
assistant manager of Davey's Locker. In winter, the shallow water -- more 
affected by tidal surges, wind and weather -- turns colder, while the 
temperature of the deeper water remains more constant. As a result, he said, 
offshore fish either migrate south or go deeper. The ones that remain in 
shallow water become sluggish, less aggressively hungry and therefore less 
likely to bite.  
</P>
<P>
 The situation begins changing back again, Igleheart said, as the shallow water 
heats up in late March or early April. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, the fishing is good from a boat offshore where lots 
of rockfish, lingcod, sculpin, mackerel, calico bass, sand bass and even an 
occasional bonita can be caught. While average sizes are three to five pounds, 
Igleheart said, every once in a while a winter angler will reel in a 30-pound 
halibut or a 2 1/2-foot sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
 When renting out gear, he said, the shop routinely supplies customers with the 
strength of line, style of hook and size of reel appropriate for the day's 
destination. If you're bringing your own, he said, it's a good idea to call in 
advance for advice on all those matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, once aboard, you can fish all you want while breaking up your day with 
visits to a well-equipped galley featuring, among other things, hamburgers, 
eggs, toast, coffee and a wide array of candy bars and other sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, my children spent their share of time there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet by day's end, we had more fish than the three of us could handle. Our 
take-home: five large mackerel, two sand bass, three whitefish and seven perch 
-- 17 fish in all, just under the legal limit of 20 and not counting the 15 
mackerel we had thrown back as too small. 
</P>
<P>
 While the kids watched wide-eyed, the deckhand filleted their catch with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come out here to relax," he explained as he worked. "We try to keep it 
low-key and take care of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill White, 35, a Huntington Beach facilities maintenance engineer, came out 
for a day of fishing with his 6-year-old son. "I like the thrill of catching 
fish and eating them afterward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For my children, though, the thrill seemed to be in the catching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being out here," Adina said as we finally approached port late that 
afternoon. "I like how you can feel the wind on your face, and it's exciting 
feeling the tug on your pole. The best part is reeling it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Concluded Drew: "It's pretty hard, but fun hard. You can catch fish and give 
them to your mother. You make her feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 With just a little luck, you can make your mother feel good too. To book a 
trip, call (714) 673-1434.

DO IT!: HOLIDAY-THEMED RIDES GEARED TO KIDS, ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Edition staff.

<P>
 Jessika Nelson is not the first person you'd think of to lead one of the 
holiday rides for the Orange County Wheelmen this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She is 7 years old. And that's just one of the things that makes this ride a 
bit out of the ordinary for the Wheelmen, the county's biggest recreational 
bicycle club. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will be along, of course, but the focus of the Saturday morning ride 
will be the kids. The ride starts at Food Park in Irvine, the club's usual 
rendezvous point, and will roll from there to Crystal Court, where the 
youngsters can see Santa and gawk at the huge Christmas tree in the middle of 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this would be a fun one for the kids to just ride their own bikes," 
said Theresa Nelson, Jessika's mom. The elder Nelson said kids sometimes come 
along on the adult rides, but in a trailer or on the back of a tandem bike. 
</P>
<P>
 A kid-focused ride is new for the club.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be all sidewalks, so the little ones can come along safely," 
said Theresa Nelson, who will help her daughter supervise. "It's pretty easy, 
because it's going to be a three-mile ride, then a big break and a three-mile 
ride back." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is also a leader of another holiday-themed ride in Huntington Beach on 
Sunday night, this one with a grown-up focus. It's sponsored by Teamwork 
Tandem, a Wheelmen chapter devoted to tandem bikes, but any kind of bike is 
welcome. Because it's an evening ride, participants must have legal road 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "People decorate their bikes with battery-operated Christmas lights and wear 
Santa hats," she said. "It's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The route runs from Sea Bridge Park to Huntington Harbour, where riders will 
check out the lighted homes along the canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Both events are expected to be low-key, with no rushing and perhaps a couple 
dozen participants. Both are open to non-members of the Wheelmen, but Nelson 
asks that people call ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Wheelmen organizes dozens of group rides every month, for 
cyclists of every ability. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Children's Christmas Ride, Christmas Bike Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Children's ride: Saturday, Dec. 17, 9 a.m. Bike parade: Sunday, Dec. 
18, 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Children's ride departs from Food Park, Irvine; bike parade leaves 
from Sea Bridge Park, Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: To reach Food Park, take the MacArthur Boulevard exit from the 
San Diego (405) Freeway and go north one-tenth of a mile to Main Street; park 
behind RL's Cookery. To reach Sea Bridge Park, take Golden West Street south 
from the San Diego (405) Freeway and turn right on Edinger Avenue. Continue on 
Edinger to the end, just before the bridge into the marina, and turn left on 
Countess Drive. Park's at the end of the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: FREE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 892-6545.

VIDEO REWIND; AN EARLY TASTE OF POLANSKI VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roman Polanski's first feature was "Knife in the Water," a disturbing mind 
game of a movie that established him as the new hotshot on the international 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is spooky in a very mundane way. Polanski wants to tap into 
uncomfortable feelings we face in situations that appear ordinary but actually 
may be exceptional, even dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 He creates that sense by putting three people in an innocuous setting, a 
sailboat on a nice day. "Knife in the Water" starts with Andrzej (Leon 
Niemczyk) and Christine (Jolanta Umecka) driving toward a dock, having a 
typical husband-and-wife talk. Out of nowhere, a young hitchhiker (Zygmunt 
Malanowicz) throws himself in front of the car, presaging the drama to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially angry, Andrzej becomes curious and impulsively invites the 
unidentified man to join them on the lake. Once there, the conversation is 
basically amiable but punctuated by dagger-like comments that come out 
unexpectedly. Andrzej and the hitchhiker begin to compete, their manhood at 
stake, with the beautiful Christine as both prize and cynical jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing much specific happens; Polanski, known for spurts of violence in his 
later films, is more interested in hinting at the rage that begins to well up 
in both men. Most of the momentum is provided by the dialogue and the actors' 
facial expressions and body language. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski adds to the uneasiness by making "Knife in the Water" (the title 
comes from the young man's only possession, a stiletto) nearly claustrophobic. 
The only environment is provided by the small boat, and the actors always seem 
to be pressing against it or each other in the tightly shot scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the scenes are hypnotic, especially when the two men explode in the 
confrontation you knew was coming. It's dynamic not only because it provides 
the action we've been craving, but also because of how it affects Andrzej and 
Christine. Now they must face who they really are and whether they can stay 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knife in the Water" (1962), directed by Roman Polanski. 94 minutes. Not 
rated.

SPECIAL SCREENING: '49'S 'LITTLE WOMEN' A LITTLE WEEPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pert heroines of Louisa May Alcott's novel "Little Women" have proved 
pretty sturdy over the years, at least when it comes to film. They've inspired 
a couple of theatrical pictures and at least one TV movie. Now Hollywood has 
another remake. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest "Little Women," starring Winona Ryder, is set for release around 
Christmas. It will undoubtedly be compared to the first, made in 1933 and 
featuring a young Katharine Hepburn, and the second, released in 1949 with 
Elizabeth Taylor and June Allyson. 
</P>
<P>
 The stiffest test will be Hepburn's picture, directed by George Cukor and also 
starring Joan Bennett. It's gone down as the favorite, most tear-ready 
adaptation of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1949 version (screening Friday afternoon in a free presentation at the 
Cypress Senior Citizen Center) isn't quite as popular, but it, too, will 
provide competition. This one, directed by Mervyn LeRoy for MGM, can get more 
than a little sappy as we watch this house of pretty adolescents take pretty 
steps toward their destinies, but it's also affectionately rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a real weepie -- even more than the 1933 movie -- the kind of flick that 
always seems to make more sense during the gushing emotions of the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we have the four March sisters, sometimes happy, sometimes woeful, 
as they grow from gay innocence to an almost chastened adulthood in New England 
around the time of the Civil War. Jo (Allyson) is the leader, brazen and 
active; Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) is the vixen; Meg (Janet Leigh) is ambitious and 
strong, and Beth (Margaret O'Brien) is the youngest, a soulful lass facing her 
doom. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie skips along well enough when the girls are enjoying themselves, 
which they do a lot, just like any pleasure-seeking adolescents. LeRoy believes 
in the directness of simple moods and keeps the good feelings sunny -- the 
rainbow hues of Technicolor (a favorite technology of MGM at the time) help 
energize everything. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Beth starts creeping toward her end, with O'Brien playing her frailty 
as loudly as a big drum, the picture gets awfully emotional. Jo takes all this 
very hard; too bad Allyson isn't Hepburn, who brought more level-headed 
perspective and resonance to Jo in the original. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Taylor is fresh and lovely, and Leigh is rightly vivid. 
Peter Lawford brings a smidgen of humor to Laurie, the neighbor cute enough to 
inspire crushes in these little women faced with large hormones getting larger 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie also provided an important role for Leon Ames, the veteran character 
actor who lived in Laguna Beach for several years and died there in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames -- as he often did in pictures (including "Meet Me in St. Louis" with 
Judy Garland) and television (the '50s series "Life With Father") -- plays the

 Long-brewing plans have come to a frothy head with the launching of two new 
pubs in Orange County, and a third opening is planned within days. A fourth 
venture is up and running but hopes you'll do most of your openings at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dishes at the Pilsner Room, which opened Monday at McCormick & Schmick in 
Irvine, are made with beer; crawfish risotto ($9.25) is flavored with brown 
ale, Peruvian corn and potato stew ($4.95) with Pilsner. The microbrewery 
aspect of the joint venture with Oregon microbrewery management group 
Willamette Valley Inc. is called Orange County Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 According to brewmaster Richard Wong, the first keg of -- what else? -- Orange 
Ale will not be ready before late January; honey and blond ales are also on 
their way. In the meantime, they're serving a dozen other microbrewed beers on 
tap and another eight in bottles. Open Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 1 
a.m.; Saturday, 5 p.m. to 1 a.m, and Sunday 5 to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Avenue Brewery, which opened Friday, offers Laguna Beach Blonde, Honey 
Wheat Ale and Bird Rock Red. The Italian menu includes prosciutto panini 
(sandwich) with red sauce, Emmentaler cheese and plum tomatoes on focaccia 
($7.25) and pappardelle pasta with prosciutto, pine nuts, sage and apples ($9). 
</P>
<P>
 Open Sunday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Thursday through 
Saturday till 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Avenue's director of restaurant operations, Michael Poates, acknowledged 
that promotional materials for nearby Laguna Beach Brewing Co., slated to open 
Monday, have touted it as the city's first brewery. But "they're not the 
first," he crowed.  
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Brewing Co. is "not to be confused with the Ocean Avenue 
Brewery," countered LBBC brewmaster Alex Puchner. The new brewhouse is in the 
Heisler Building, above the Jolly Roger; its copper cooking vessels and 
two-story stainless steel fermenting tanks provide an aesthetic focus. LBBC 
also offers Laguna Beach Blonde as well as Greeters Pale Ale, Salt Kriek and 
Thousand Steps Stout. The menu includes pizzas, pastas and Cajun "Lambaaa" 
(spice-coated baby lamb chops, $4.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Open Sunday through Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to midnight, and Friday and Saturday 
till 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign up for microbrew-of-the-month club Malt of the Earth, and for about $20 a 
month you'll receive a dozen 12-ounce beers or six 22-ounce beers from among 
450 U.S. microbreweries, plus a newsletter.

RESTAURANTS; ITALIAN AT ANY COST? ONLY IF YOU INSIST ON RICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Caffe Piemonte was born of shipboard romance. Owners Amy and Luigi Ravetto met 
aboard a cruise liner. She was a passenger; he was one of the chefs. They got 
married and started a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 A storybook ending -- about a picture-perfect restaurant -- would be pretty, 
and Caffe Piemonte is a big success, full even on weeknights every time I've 
visited, noisy and buzzing with obviously happy diners. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, nothing, unless you think about price or attitude. This simply 
decorated, mini-mall restaurant in Orange charges as much as $18.95 for a pasta 
dish, a price you'd be hard pressed to match even in magnificently appointed 
establishments such as the Westside's Valentino. You pay a $14 corkage fee if 
you bring your own wine -- the highest in Orange County and exceeded in 
Southern California, so far as I know, only by Patina in Hollywood, a 
restaurant with a far more sophisticated wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is cheerful if narrow, mostly white, with yellow tiles and countless 
posters of the Piedmont, which lies just above the French Riviera and below the 
Swiss Alps in northwestern Italy. Chef Ravetto and the maitre d' (his brother 
Giovanni) are natives of this colorful region, home of the white truffle and a 
hearty, rustic cuisine that is closer to French than to what we in America 
think of as Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't, however, find many Piedmontese dishes here. Much of what Ravetto 
cooks is the sort of thing found in most of our popular Italian restaurants: 
roast meats, creamy pastas, grilled vegetables. A few dishes, notably polenta 
and panna cotta (a baked cream pudding), do indeed come from Piedmont, but this 
menu is largely terra already pretty well cognita . 
</P>
<P>
 How enticing it would be if Ravetto offered carne cruda , the delicious 
Piedmontese version of steak tartare, or an authentic maltagliate , a rough cut 
pasta eaten with Robbiola cheese, pine nuts and arugula. The polenta here is 
made from imported Italian cornmeal, but instead of ordering it as a side dish, 
you have the option of getting it tarted up with a rich, overindulgent cheese 
sauce for $10.95, or with salmon and cheese sauce for $12.95.  
</P>
<P>
 To start a meal, you can't go wrong with O.C.'s best version of fried 
calamari. The squid is cut into tiny pieces, dredged in a delicious light 
batter and skillfully fried. On the side, there is an abundance of fresh lemon 
and a bowl of fine, flavorful marinara sauce. If everything at Caffe Piemonte 
were as good as the calamari, I'd be more comfortable paying these prices. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also do well with the fine antipasto Piemontese, which varies from day 
to day and is invariably delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time to order pasta, I recommend requesting the chefs go real 
easy on the sauce. Even when I requested mine light, it came up with more sauce 
than I have ever seen on a plate in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, you can order the pastas with confidence, because this kitchen 
never overcooks them. Farfalle al pesto is a trencherman's version of the 
Ligurian favorite, in this case with far more cream than basil. Whole pine nuts 
are mingled into the sauce, which is also a touch heavy on the Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Penne puttanesca is another good one. This is the "without anchovies" recipe, 
its hearty flavors accented by capers, olives and garlic. If you don't mind the 
price, special pastas such as gnocchi with lamb sauce ($16.95) and pheasant 
ravioli ($18.95), with mushrooms and cream, should be more than adequate for 
your main course. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, I prefer the main courses to the pastas. The best is probably 
bistecca alla Milanese -- despite the name, not a beefsteak but a version of 
the well-known breaded veal cutlet. The kitchen handles this pounded cutlet 
with intelligence, breading it lightly, sauteing it to a golden brown and 
sprinkling it with butter, lemon and parsley. Arista di maiale al burro e 
salvia also succeeds because the kitchen treats the basic product, in this case 
pork loin, with respect. It's cooked simply with sage and butter, and it's a 
treat. 
</P>
<P>
 My swordfish, the fresh fish of the day, had a fishy aftertaste. Eaten as a 
main course, the restaurant's deliriously buttery risotto with porcini 
mushrooms ($18.95) is wonderfully tasty, but more than anyone's reasonable 
appetite possibly could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Save room for desserts. Panna cotta , when done well, is one of the world's 
great sweets, and this one is quite good. It's a white, custard-like pudding 
topped by a thin layer of caramel sauce -- smooth and creamy. Ravetto makes a 
good gianduja , chocolate cake with a hazelnut butter cream, and does a mean 
semifreddo , literally "half-cold," vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and 
espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 I just wish he'd lose the habit of serving dreadful, commercial biscotti with 
every dessert. These rock-hard cookies lessen the status of these good sweets 
and dilute their effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Service rarely misses a beat at Caffe Piemonte. The staff is solicitous and 
friendly. There is a small market toward the back of the restaurant. Caffe 
Piemonte will be closed from Dec. 24 to Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Caffe Piemonte is expensive. Antipasti are $7.75 to $10.25. Pastas are $8.75 
to $18.95. Main dishes are $16.75 to $21.50.

PARKER'S PLACE: A BIT OF HISTORY COMES OUT IN THE CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week I embarked on a journey through my past. It was an accident. I had 
no idea when I set out to wash my truck that the quest would lead over miles of 
asphalt and years of history to the land of my youth, Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was blighted to the point that no vacuum tech at any car wash could 
be trusted to get it right. We're in the heart of the hunting season now, so 
the poor Bronco interior was sporting over two months' worth of desert sand, 
dog hair, bird feathers and mud. Not that I hadn't bothered to wash it -- do 
you think I'm a pig? -- but that kind of world-class dirt requires the kind of 
world-class attention that only a self-carwash vacuum can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 So I headed off to Tustin where, well more than two decades ago, I used to 
take the family car to the self-wash. I didn't even know whether the place 
would still be there, but it's difficult to find self-wash places in the phone 
book because they don't have phones. Always willing to do something the long, 
hard, stupid way, I set out. 
</P>
<P>
 To my good fortune, it was not only still there, but someone had just pulled 
out of the vacuum station and entered the hallowed shade of the exterior wash 
bay. I roared in, cut the engine, flung out the floor mats, inserted my three 
quarters and sucked away. Four batches of quarters later, the inside of the 
truck looked pretty decent, although I can state for anyone interested that the 
hairs of yellow Labradors are more difficult to get out than those of chocolate 
lab, springer and golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, the truck was clean, so I headed to Larwin Square to check Trak 
Auto (I hate people who spell words wrong just to make us notice, but it was 
the closest auto parts store) to look at cheap seat covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Larwin Square had been the shopping center of my boyhood, and Trak Auto, I 
realized as I left the store, was right next to one of my favorite places to 
visit a short few decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, the store was called Kresge's, and I'm not sure what kind of store 
it really was. Now, it is something called Christmas Magic, and as I wandered 
the aisles past the dreary schlock meant to warm our holidays, I was 
transported back to those halcyon days when here -- yes, right here in the 
Kresge's "Garden Shop" -- you could purchase a living infant alligator (a 
caiman, actually) for $7.98. 
</P>
<P>
 And that wasn't all. You could get chameleons (anoles, actually) for 99 cents; 
red-eared slider turtles for a buck something; parakeets dirt cheap and iguanas 
practically for free! Your mom could score all manner of flowers, bulbs, 
planting soil, fertilizer. And that garden shop smelled so good -- rich soils, 
flowers and plants, the dank aromas of fish aquariums blending with the 
pine-shaving potpourri of the hamster cages. God, it was heaven! 
</P>
<P>
 I continued my tour of the square. Where there once was Wynn's music, there is 
now Dave's Bicycles. Where once stood Alexander's Market (where I had my first 
job), there is now a Von's. Winchell's Donuts has given way to K's Donuts. The 
Golden Crown cafe, in which I discovered the pleasures of coffee and falafel 
(go figure) has deceased completely, unless it's been partially reincarnated as 
the Golden Spoon Yogurt place, which is on the other side of the square and 
does not serve falafel. 
</P>
<P>
 I ducked into the barber shop, still exactly where it was three decades ago 
when you'd always have to ask for the "regular boy's" because your mother had 
ordered you to. The place hadn't changed much. 
</P>
<P>
 When I walked in, owner Les Franklin rose from one of the 1961 Paider chairs 
(padded, reclining, handsome) and motioned me to sit. There was in his gestures 
-- right hand indicating the chair while the left snaps open the fresh bib that 
will go around your throat -- the same kind of finality I remember sensing as a 
10-year-old. It was a little like going to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that I wasn't in for a cut, just for a visit to an old haunt. He 
looked at me askance, likely because of the new hairdo I recently got that 
sticks up. Hair styles like mine cut little ice in the world of the '61 Paider 
chair, the $8.50 haircut and people like Les Franklin, who consider themselves 
barbers as opposed to hair sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked for a while. Fondly, we remembered Con Adams, who used to own the 
shop when I was a kid and would drive around to his other shops with a barber 
pole atop his car. I remember wondering, as a kid, if his baldness was an omen 
for my own head of hair. (So far, no.) 
</P>
<P>
 I asked about a barber named John. John was my favorite because he was the 
youngest and hippest and because he had sideburns I admired -- big, dark 
accessories shaped like Italy and not ending until the very bottom of his 
earlobes, where they ceased on a line so straight it could have been etched by 
a laser. 
</P>
<P>
 Les didn't remember any such sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
 I inquired about a coat of arms hanging from the far wall -- a big shield with 
a bunch of ornate designs and swords on it. As I stood there looking, it eased 
into my memory, jostled around a little, then finally fit in perfectly, like an 
old hand sliding into an old mitt. Yes, he said -- it had always been there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Les said the place had changed a lot since he took it over. Gone, for 
instance, were the mirrors in which, as a boy, I could see my ears lowering as 
Con Adams buzzed away at me. 
</P>
<P>
 A paying customer came in then, so I left the shop. But, softened by memory, I 
decided to take a spin down Beneta Way, the street of my boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked a lot like it used to: well-kept, forthright and suburban. I looked 
at the houses and felt the histories. Some of my old neighbors still live 
there. Approaching my old house, I noted two young boys playing in the 
driveway, just as I had played there so many years before with my brother, 
Matt. 
</P>
<P>
 I steered up to the driveway and stopped in the middle of Beneta Way. My heart 
kind of flip-flopped, did something odd and mildly comforting in my chest. I 
had to roll down the Bronco window (clean) for a better look. I couldn't quite 
believe what I was seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 There we were, Jeff and Matt, ages 8 and 6, goofing around in the driveway 
like we always did. I was the older one with the darker hair and plainly 
aggressive expression on my face. Matt's head was rounded and his hair much 
lighter and the look on his face more curious than pugnacious. We were doing 
something involving bikes, maybe, or skateboards, or tennis balls or who knows 
what, but there I was, staring back at me thirtysomething years later behind 
the wheel of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatta you want?" I asked me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not 'nymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope." 
</P>
<P>
 "This's my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know." 
</P>
<P>
 A curious look from me to me, exactly what I would have expected. He yanked up 
his little brother and herded him toward the house, taking a long look back at 
me as he opened the door.

3-HOUT TOUR: A LITTLE LIGHT HOUSEKEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lights are on, but nobody's home -- they're all out looking at the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 5:40 p.m.: You can start your holiday lights tour in almost any 
neighborhood. Baja Oso is a Mission Viejo development that's had elaborate 
decorations in the past and that also happens to be on the way to Rancho Santa 
Margarita's "Candy Cane Lane." 
</P>
<P>
 The standout there was a winter scene with lots of mice, one warming his 
bottom on a little fire, and a cat wearing a bib (26992 Banderas). There was a 
miniature village in the picture window with the houses lit, a life-size 
Rudolph the red-bulbed reindeer on the lawn with his nose lit, and a trio of 
party-type reindeer that looked lit in another sense entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 5:40 to 6:40: Daddy-O's looks out onto Lake Santa Margarita. There are 
surfboards on the ceiling and a jukebox on every table; vintage ads hang on the 
walls. When Babe Ruth says, "It's the finest cola drink I ever tasted," he 
means Red Rock Cola, 5 cents. Marilyn Monroe says, "Yes, I use Lustre-Creme 
Shampoo." Lucy, in a still from her TV show, pitches Vitameatavegamin. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakes and malts are around $2.50. Li'l Bopper dinners (12 and under), such as 
corn dog, grilled cheese and spaghetti, are served in a "Classic Daddy-O 
Mobile" with milk or soda, fries and an ice cream sundae; normally $2.99, 
they're free on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Big boppers can order a T-Bird Burger ($5.25), "a double-fisted double-decker 
delight"; turkey burger or veggie burger are available upon request, and both 
are great. Other entrees range from "The Mamas and the Pastas" (around $6) to 
"The Platters," complete chicken and/or rib dinners ($6.95 to $11.45). 
</P>
<P>
 Further "Temptations" include an old-fashioned banana split ($4). My son, 
Ryan, and I resisted and instead walked down to the lake. What appeared to be 
scores of fireflies skimming the surface turned out to be the bills of swimming 
ducks reflecting the surrounding lights. 
</P>
<P>
 6:40 to 7:30: Even near Via Lantana (a.k.a. Candy Cane Lane) there are pretty 
good decorations. Garage doors were gift-wrapped. One house really captured the 
spirit of the season; it had flashing lights that looked just like a mall. 
Another had a girl working out on a Trackmaster, with a Rottweiler nearby -- 
oops, that's an open garage! 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoooooooa!" we both said rounding the corner onto Via Lantana. "Whoa, ho, 
ho! " Ryan said. The displays before us were dazzling. We parked. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Mele Kalikimaka Aloha" sign initially confused us, but we soon realized 
that most houses on the block offered their Christmas messages in different 
languages; the first house also had a wooden train and a palm tree flocked with 
snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door were Bambi and bunnies, and blond angels with tinsel halos, then 
came "Santa's Pit Stop" -- with a sign warning reindeer parking only -- then 
gingerbread boys and girls and six-foot lollipops. 
</P>
<P>
 The next home, however, designated itself "Candy Cane Lane," and it was, 
indeed, the "North Pole" of them all (10 Via Lantana). Its "Santa's Workshop" 
featured a fully automated Santa and bespectacled old elves sawing, hammering 
and painting away. Near the "Prettige Krestmis" sign were skating ice skaters 
and a working choo-choo. 
</P>
<P>
 The next home proved quite the corrective. "Keep Christ in Christmas," it said 
on the garage door. At this point, judging by the number of displays, Santa's 
definitely got the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street was another Nativity, and a sign that read, "Gledelig Jul." 
"That's Merry Christmas in Norwegian," explained homeowner Andy McSorley, who 
was working on his display when his electric saw blew a fuse. 
</P>
<P>
 What could we say? "Nodlaig Mhaith Chugnat!" 
</P>
<P>
 7:30 to 8: The gift shop Willow Manor is stuffed with Christmas accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Just inside the door is a Magic Reindeer Wand, a branch with one end sharpened 
to a nose and two smaller branches for antlers ($10). There are skiing, fishing 
and sailing Santas, reindeer mugs and plates, and reclining-angel candles. 
Miniature snow-covered towns include Squashville, Christmas cookbooks include 
"Hollyhocks and Radishes," and among Western-themed ornaments were covered 
wagons, bison and Happy Trails guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 Crabapple legend tells us that no one knows for sure where the first Crabapple 
people came from, but now there are several of them at Willow Manor. There's 
also a whole display of Snowbabies, and more is known about them: They "gather 
stars on a cold winter's night to light up the snowy pines," and they all wear 
one-piece fleece-like suits. Elsewhere, caroling figurines have clay heads and 
flexible bodies; the ones I liked best were the singing dogs.

CLIPPERS' RESURGENCE SHORT-LIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers might have had trouble beating a CBA team the way they played 
Wednesday night against the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had made a lot of progress after opening the season with 16 
consecutive losses, winning two of their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 But they regressed against the Trail Blazers, falling behind by 53 points and 
losing, 121-73, before a sellout crowd of 12,888. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clipper Coach Bill Fitch didn't lose his sense of humor after his team 
suffered its worst defeat of the season and scored the fewest points in a game 
since the team has been in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play well, and if there's anyone on our team that doesn't know 
that, they have Robert Parish's number (00) for an IQ," Fitch said. "Any of you 
guys ever go to the dentist and (not get) Novocain? That's very similar to this 
ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "How bad was this? I wasn't at Bataan, but is must have been something like 
this. How long was the game? It seemed like all day in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 At times it appeared that the Clippers, who shot a season-low 32.6%, didn't 
know the plays as they ran into each other and didn't know where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a display of total nothingness," swingman Malik Sealy said. "We 
didn't do anything tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by 117-64 with 57 seconds remaining, were on the 
verge of breaking the franchise record for largest margin of defeat (51 
points), but guard Terry Dehere, who had a team-high 17 points, made three 
three-pointers in the final 46 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten in nearly every phase of the game, the Clippers were outrebounded, 
66-29, as Portland posted the second-largest margin of victory in franchise 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We improved so much in the last three games, it's tough to understand why we 
didn't play well," Dehere said. "This league is too good to get down by more 
than 50 points and be able to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch was concerned about stopping Trail Blazer guard Clyde Drexler, who 
averaged 33.5 points against the Clippers in their season-opening games in 
Japan last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried everything except a gun over in Japan (to stop Drexler), and if that 
had been legal we would have tried it," Fitch said before the game. "This is 
the time for good cheer, the Christmas spirit. I think he should have the night 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fitch should have worried about stopping center Chris Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley, who outscored and outrebounded the Clippers in the first quarter, 
11-10 and 11-6, finished with season highs of 15 points and 20 rebounds, one 
shy of his career high, as the Trail Blazers beat the Clippers for the third 
time in three games this season. Dudley, who made his first five shots, tied 
his career high by making seven of 10 shots as Portland shot a season-high 
54.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the key tonight is that we didn't take them lightly," Dudley said. 
"They had played three really good games in a row, winning two of them and 
taking Seattle to (double) overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 James Robinson had a team-high 21 points in 23 minutes as a reserve, and Cliff 
Robinson and Mark Bryant each had 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing by 24 points, 50-26, at halftime, Fitch changed his 
starting lineup, inserting forward Harold Ellis in place of Sealy, who missed 
five of six shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't do any good as the Trail Blazers took a 40-point lead into the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers waived seven-foot center Bob Martin before the game. Although all 
NBA contracts are automatically guaranteed on Jan. 10, Martin, who signed a 
$250,000, one-year deal last summer, had a clause inserted in his contract that 
guaranteed the deal on Dec. 15 so that he'd have time to catch on with another 
NBA team or a European team if he didn't make it with the Clippers. "Coach 
(Bill) Fitch evidently didn't know until last night what the deal was," Martin 
said. If Martin clears waivers, the Clippers can re-sign him. Martin, who was 
on the injured list for the first 16 games because of a bruised right heel, had 
played in one game this season, scoring two points. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous Los Angeles Clipper record for fewest points scored in a game was 
set in a 104-75 loss to the New Jersey Nets on March 1, 1988. The Clippers tied 
the record in an 85-75 loss to the Lakers in a nationally televised game on 
Christmas Day in 1991. The San Diego Clipper record for fewest points in a game 
was set in a 98-74 loss to Seattle on Dec. 13, 1981. The franchise record for 
fewest points scored in game was set by the Buffalo Braves in a 91-63 loss to 
the Milwaukee Bucks on Oct. 21, 1972.

NEWSWIRE: FALDO SAYS PROPOSED WORLD TOUR WON'T HAPPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Faldo called the proposed World Tour "just short of ridiculous" Wednesday 
and said "it's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo made his statements while preparing for the Johnnie Walker World 
Championship at Montego Bay, Jamaica, where players were handed brochures 
outlining plans to change the proposed tour from eight tournaments to six. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, they're pushing this brochure this week with some of the changes 
they have come up with, and still nothing makes sense at the moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour, backed by the Fox network, would include the top 30 in the 
Sony rankings and 10 sponsor exemptions. PGA Commissioner Tim Finchem has 
threatened to suspend any player who chooses to play in a World Tour event that 
conflicts with the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Faldo's concerns is how a player could qualify for the Ryder Cup if he 
is banned from the American or European tours. College Football  
</P>
<P>
 Memphis officials, concerned about attendance and a lack of fan enthusiasm at 
Tiger games, fired Coach Chuck Stobart. Stobart, 60, led the Tigers to their 
third consecutive 6-5 season, the first time in 17 years that Memphis, a 
football independent, has had three straight winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Cooper, a USC football player accused of cheating on his American 
College Testing exam last month, has left school, university sources said. 
Cooper and running back Delon Washington were accused in September of having 
someone else take their ACT tests. School officials said last month that 
Washington had been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Weldon English, defensive back Calvin Robinson and wide receiver 
Eric Yarborough of Southern Methodist, who were recently charged with the 
aggravated sexual assault of a teen-age girl at a Denton, Tex., motel were 
suspended from the university.

 Linebacker Kevin Greene of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a former Ram, boasting of 
his blitzing style to Tim Panaccio of the Philadelphia Inquirer:  
</P>
<P>
 "I have flat-out knocked the . . . out of Phil Simms, Joe Montana and John 
Elway. I mean a flat-out, steel on-target, sabot round in the throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabot? A sabot is a soft, armor-piercing shell shot from a tank. Greene is an 
Army reserve captain who happens to drive tanks when he isn't driving through 
quarterbacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the Clippers aren't going to finish 0-82, can we please focus on our 
other NBA team? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The best-kept secret in town is that the Lakers are off to a successful start. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 They have the most road victories in the league: eight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, they didn't win their eighth on the road until Feb. 9. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Del Harris has them running, gunning, hustling and playing Del-ball, not to be 
confused with dull-ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos, Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel have brought respectability 
back to a proud franchise that is perhaps only one strong inside player away 
from becoming a contender again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise, surprise, surprise: On the same Tuesday night, Willie Burton scored 
53 points, the Golden State Warriors lost their seventh in a row and the 
Sacramento Kings won their fifth of the last six. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also are better dressed this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Cleveland Cavaliers belong on Mr. Blackwell's worst-dressed 
list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny how the Warriors and the two teams involved with them in major 
trades, Washington and Miami, all have gone sour. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What were the chances that Robert Pack would become a more important NBA 
player than his former USC teammate, Harold Miner? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Knicks are tired of John Starks, I'm sure a lot of teams would trade 
for him in a New York minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter three-point shot is far from being a gimme, as illustrated by the 
Indiana Pacers' one-for-14 performance against Cleveland on Tuesday.Reggie 
Miller was one for seven. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 From "You Heard It Here First!" a compilation of ideas for basketball coaches 
and players by USC assistant Jack Fertig: "Shooting is just like eating. It's 
all muscle memory." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My only complaint about the first John R. Wooden Classic was the lack of the 
four schools' pep bands at The Pond of Anaheim. The recorded music didn't quite 
do it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Williams might have the talent to match his coaching ability this season 
at Kansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Fears, the Pro Football Hall of Famer, doesn't have Alzheimer's disease, 
as had been believed. His illness has been diagnosed as a form of Parkinson's 
disease that can be controlled by medication. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Aren't those picking the Raiders to reach the Super Bowl forgetting that they 
were manhandled by the Pittsburgh Steelers, 23-3, Nov. 27 at the Coliseum? . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati General Manager Mike Brown is half right when he says the Bengals 
need more playing talent, not better coaching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's good to see that Nebraska placed three players and Penn State two on the 
Academic All-American first team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites' reputation already is such that probably only four or five 
rivals will face him in the $500,000 Hollywood Futurity on Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank probably will stage programs at the Grand Olympic only once every two 
months this year, instead of once every two weeks, as had been planned. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where They Are Now: Michael Nunn will challenge World Boxing Council 
super-middleweight champion Frankie Liles on Saturday at Quito, Ecuador. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 George Latka celebrated his 80th birthday by sparring three rounds with a 
partner half his age at a party in Huntington Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Latka, the former referee and boxer, will be inducted into the Orange County 
Sports Hall of Fame on Sunday at 1 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium along with Nolan 
Ryan, Brian Downing, Rich Saul, Mary Decker Slaney, Steve Scott and Josephine 
Cruickshank. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was surprising about the Angels' signing of free agent Lee Smith is that 
they outbid the Baltimore Orioles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gross gave the Dodgers a lot of innings, but his record never was what 
it should have been. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 All this wheeling and dealing by major league clubs couldn't be coming under 
crazier circumstances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It sure beats the 1994 World Series highlight film: The California League 
champion Rancho Cucamonga Quakes have put together a 25-minute highlight video 
that is on sale for $14.95.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL'S PLAN: TAKE CROWD OUT OF GAME

<P>
 For years, the Raiders spent the week before a trip to Seattle preparing for 
the noise generated by fans at the Kingdome, which can make it difficult for 
other offensive players to hear the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no sound-proofing techniques being practiced this year by the 
Raiders, who will face the Seahawks in the Kingdome on Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been purposely staying away from doing that," Coach Art Shell said. 
"Years ago when (the Raiders) first started (going to Seattle), we were 
worrying about the noise. . . . But you don't want your team to be worrying 
about the crowd noise (so much) that they lose concentration on the game plan 
and what we're trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to take the crowd out of the game is what we did in San Diego. Strike 
quick, whether defensively or offensively, and that takes the crowd out of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders scored on their first offensive play in San Diego 10 days ago on a 
76-yard bomb from quarterback Jeff Hostetler to receiver Alexander Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said the Raiders might combat the anticipated noise in Seattle by going 
to a silent count, meaning the offensive linemen would have to look at the ball 
to see the center snap because Hostetler won't be calling out the count. 
</P>
<P>

 Safety Eddie Anderson sat out practice because of a groin pull, but Shell 
wouldn't rule Anderson out of Sunday's game. STEVE SPRINGER

 Safety Anthony Newman, who has started the last 46 games, will take a seat on 
the bench Sunday so the Rams can take a look at rookie Toby Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been struggling the past three or four games," Newman said. "If I'm 
going to hurt the team I shouldn't be out there. I've been pressing, and I 
haven't been taking care of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good wake-up call, and to be honest, it takes some pressure off my 
back. I've been thinking and thinking about why we're not winning, and then 
there's been all the talk about the move and this is almost like a break. It's 
a demotion, but I can rest my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Coach Chuck Knox said the team would play its best players in an 
attempt to win the last two games, rather than experiment and play young 
players such as Wright, quarterback Tommy Maddox and defensive end Brad Ottis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will use Wright at strong safety and move Marquez Pope to free safety 
on early downs. They will bring in rookie safety Keith Lyle on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater, who is wrapping up season No. 19, said he is close to 
making a decision on his future. Slater, who has been sidelined because of an 
elbow injury, indicated before the season that he would like to play 20 years. 
"He hasn't said this is his last year," Knox said. "I think he probably could 
play another year; he'd played well when he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams added linebacker Brett Collins, who was with the team earlier this 
season, to their 53-man roster because of injuries to linebackers Tom Homco 
(foot) and Chris Martin (calf). The Rams put rookie tackle Ronald Edwards on 
injured reserve because of bone spurs in his ankle. Knox said Edwards suffered 
the injury in training camp. T.J. SIMERS

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; ARKANSAS STARTING TO PUT THE PIECES 
BACK TOGETHER 
</P>

<P>
 With another week until his next game, Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson has had 
lots of time to figure out how the Razorbacks could get waxed by Massachusetts 
in the season opener and then win their next six. 
</P>
<P>
 The homespun version: 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we had gotten to that game, the smoke had been blown . . . so 
much that we didn't know what to do," Richardson said earlier this week. "That 
game got our attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, fourth-ranked Arkansas has beaten Georgetown, Jackson State, 
Missouri, Centenary, Southern Methodist and Murray State--not exactly 
Murderer's Row, but not Washington Bible College, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Richardson has some problems to solve if the Razorbacks want to visit 
Seattle for the Final Four in April. The short list: 
</P>
<P>
 --Somebody--Richardson is blaming agents and NBA scouts--told senior guard 
Alex Dillard over the summer that he needed to shoot more off the dribble. So 
Dillard junked his deadly set jumper and started forcing shots on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing has been a disaster, enough so that Richardson recently told 
Dillard to quit the Meadowlark Lemon stuff and start popping the jump shot. 
Dillard, who figured it's tough to reach the NBA when you spend your senior 
season on the bench, got the message. 
</P>
<P>
 --Disappointed with Corliss Williamson's performances, Richardson ordered the 
Final Four MVP out of the weight room. The 6-foot-7, 245-pound junior was 
beginning to look like Karl Malone, but without the bulked-up numbers on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 His stats: 15 points, seven rebounds vs. UMass, 22 and 16 vs. Georgetown, 20 
and four vs. Jackson State, nine and nine vs. Missouri, nine and five vs. 
Centenary, 21 and four vs. SMU and 13 and seven vs. Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a big difference, a big difference," said Richardson of the pre- 
and post-weight room Williamson. "Corliss had a cast (on his shooting wrist) 
for 90 days during the summer, and he didn't play basketball. He worked out 
with weights, but it limited his motion. I told him, 'I don't want you like 
Hercules. I want you to be strong, but I'd rather you be more flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Since prohibiting him from heavy lifting, Richardson said Williamson "has 
looked a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 --For the first time in his career, star forward Scotty Thurman is out because 
of an injury. He sprained his ankle Dec. 6 against Centenary and sat out two 
games but is expected back for the Dec. 21 game against Florida A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Thurman, Richardson hasn't been able to experiment with his bench and 
refine his substitution patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "And our bench was the reason we won the national championship," Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 --Arkansas' lone scholarship signee, Brooklyn point guard Kareem Reid, just 
missed on his SAT scores and didn't qualify. Rather than lose a year's 
eligibility, Reid is enrolled as a part-time student at Arkansas. He took the 
test again last Saturday but misses out on daily lessons from the underrated 
Corey Beck, a senior and one of the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 --Expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus choice to repeat as NCAA champions, the Razorbacks have 
discovered what it's like to get everyone's best shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to that," Richardson said. "We're used to doing the shooting. 
Now they're shooting at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson will live. So will the Razorbacks, who should inch their way back 
atop the polls before long. Thurman is on his way back. Williamson is more 
interested in rebounds than reverse curls. Dillard is shooting jumpers. And as 
an added bonus, guard Clint McDaniel has come out of nowhere and nearly doubled 
his scoring average of a season ago, from 8.1 to 16.1. TALE OF THE TAR HEEL 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is a nice guy--and because his playing time would have been reduced 
to near zilch--North Carolina senior forward Pat Sullivan "voluntarily" 
red-shirted last season. Sullivan missed the Tar Heel gag-athon against Boston 
College in the NCAA tournament, but was it worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan returned to school this fall, a starting position his for the taking, 
and then suffered back spasms several days before North Carolina's opener 
against Texas Nov. 26. By the first week in December, he couldn't bend over to 
tie his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, doctors removed two bulging disks from Sullivan's lower back. 
If all goes well--and there's no reason to think it will, given his rotten 
luck--Sullivan may be back in uniform by mid-February. Otherwise, the 
top-ranked Tar Heels are thinking of petitioning the NCAA for a sixth year of 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, substitute-happy Coach Dean Smith is reduced to an eight-player 
rotation, including sixth-man Pearce Landry, a former walk-on who attends North 
Carolina as a Morehead Scholar, one of the university's most prestigious 
academic awards. Landry, a senior guard, spent the previous seasons on the 
junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the undefeated Tar Heels are fine. Landry actually made a big shot 
against Villanova and played well against Cincinnati. Sullivan's replacement, 
6-4 Dante Calabria, has done OK as a guard trying to imitate a forward. Best of 
all, Smith can't constantly tinker with his lineup, which means the best 
players get the most playing time, unlike last season when Jerry Stackhouse had 
to wait until the halfway point to become a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina has it easy until January, when the Atlantic Coast Conference 
schedule begins. If the starters stay injury-free, the Tar Heels can stay No. 
1. But one more injury and you'll have a whole new meaning for Carolina blue. 
HIGH SCHOOL PHENOM, COLLEGE BUST? 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Beard went to Duke a season ago with the kind of credentials that make 
recruiters hyperventilate: McDonald's All-American . . . Virginia player of the 
year . . . accustomed to winning . . . 6-9 and growing . . . only the second 
player in his high school's history to start as a freshman--Grant Hill was the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 So naturally everyone on Tobacco Road assumed Beard would follow in the 
footsteps of such Blue Devils as Danny Ferry and Christian Laettner. Beard had 
the big-time reputation. He had one of the best coaches in the business. He had 
the aura of Duke at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, Beard followed in the footsteps, all right, but they weren't the 
sneaker prints of Ferry or Laettner. Instead, try Crawford Palmer, who left the 
Blue Devils a few years ago for Dartmouth. Or Billy McCaffrey, who ditched Duke 
for Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 For only the fourth time in Mike Krzyzewski's 15 seasons at Duke, a Blue Devil 
player has quit the team and announced his plans to transfer. No official 
announcement has been made, but in all likelihood Beard will attend Boston 
University, where former Virginia assistant Dennis Wolff is beginning his first 
year as the Terriers' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff recruited Beard for the Cavaliers, loved his game and probably can't 
wait until next season's second semester, when Beard will be eligible to play. 
Meanwhile, everyone wonders how the can't-miss-kid missed--and badly too. 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski and his staff don't often miscalculate, but in this case Beard 
simply couldn't make the transition from high school star to the high-level 
demands of the Atlantic Coast Conference and Duke's national schedule. Beard 
averaged only 1.3 points and four minutes of playing time as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 This year was supposed to be different. With Hill and Antonio Lang gone, Beard 
was expected to see his minutes zoom and maybe his scoring average do the same. 
Instead, Beard got mononucleosis, missed preseason practice and never dressed 
for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils say privately that it was a good move for everybody. Beard 
gets to play for a coach he knows, at a school that can use him, in a league 
(North Atlantic Conference) that won't overwhelm him. Duke gets an extra 
scholarship and no messy infighting. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 The Big East Conference's leading rebounder didn't play organized basketball 
last season. The same goes for the league's leading scorer, who spent last year 
in jail. Both play for Georgetown and are the main reasons Coach John Thompson 
no longer looks as if he wants to cry in his white shoulder towel. Jerome 
Williams, a 6-9 junior forward, is averaging 13 rebounds, and freshman Allen 
Iverson is scoring 22.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Blair, Arizona's 6-9 power forward, was back in uniform Monday after 
having been suspended by Coach Lute Olson for academic problems. And depending 
on his grades, prized transfer Ben Davis could make his Wildcat debut in 
Saturday's game against Texas El Paso. Davis is academically ineligible until 
his first-semester grades are acceptable and posted by the school's registrar 
office. The news isn't so good for Olson, who strained his lower back last week 
lifting weights. He stood the entire game against Houston last Thursday, didn't 
attend Sunday's practice, vowed to be on the sideline for Monday's game against 
LaSalle, but was a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 Big East honks weren't kidding when they said the league would feature lots of 
new stars. Of the conference's 10 members, only one senior leads his team in 
scoring, Providence's Eric Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Since rejoining the team after being AWOL for one day, Indiana freshman guard 
Michael Herman has played only one minute in the last four games. Herman bolted 
after missing a potential game-winning shot against Notre Dame on Nov. 29. The 
Hoosiers lost in overtime, prompting Herman to return to hometown Chicago 
because: a) He felt responsible for the defeat, or b) He felt he was being 
blamed for the loss. Herman, who was left in Bloomington for last week's games 
against Evansville and Kentucky, dressed but didn't play against Morehead State 
and a got a minute's worth of playing time against Miami of Ohio, hasn't 
offered a public explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 You can expect the same code-of-silence stuff from Coach Bob Knight, who is 
trying to overcome a 4-4 start. Apparently star forward Alan Henderson is 
driving Knight crazy with his inconsistent play. One bright spot: freshman 
guard Neil Reed. Moved into the starting lineup after the Hoosiers' dismal trip 
to the Maui Classic, he has played 196 minutes and committed only five 
turnovers. He is averaging 13.5 points and about five assists. Kansas visits 
Indiana on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of codes of silence, Evansville Coach Jim Crews, a former Indiana 
player and Knight assistant, has ordered his team not to talk to reporters 
because he is mad at local writer Tom Collins. After the Aces' 84-63 loss to 
Indiana on Dec. 3, Collins, who covers the team for the Evansville Courier, 
wrote that the game was nothing more than "a good workout for the Hoosiers." 
Crews, whose skin apparently is as thin as a water balloon, announced the gag 
order a few days later.

<P>
 Marcus Camby scored a season-high 30 points to lead fifth-ranked Massachusetts 
to an 88-67 victory over Princeton on Wednesday night at Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-11 Camby was too much for the defense of the smaller Tigers. And 
the slowdown tactics that Princeton Coach Pete Carril uses to stay close to 
teams with more talent didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Princeton (3-4) gave up more than 59 points for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't expect a Princeton team to beat the No. 5 team in the country, do 
you?" Carril said. "That's like our football team going in to play Florida 
State." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Hielscher led Princeton with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Camby missed his career high by two points. He had 18 in the second half, 
including eight in a 14-3 run that gave the Minutemen (4-1) a 64-44 lead with 
10:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camby was a man tonight," Massachusetts Coach John Calipari said. "Obviously, 
they couldn't guard him. When we figured that out, we just kept going to him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Georgia Tech 86, Georgia 78 -- James Forrest scored eight of his 26 
points in a span of 2:14 at Atlanta to help the Yellow Jackets hold off the 
Bulldogs, who had cut a 23-point deficit to one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Claxton's second consecutive three-point play cut Georgia Tech's lead 
to 69-68 with 5:01 remaining before Forrest started a 10-2 Yellow Jacket spurt 
with 4:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'No way this will be a blowout,' even though I wanted one," 
Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said. "We hung on." 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Best had 21 points, eight assists and three steals for the Yellow 
Jackets (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Shandon Anderson led Georgia (5-1) with 21 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Wisconsin 90, Wisconsin Milwaukee 64 -- Michael Finley scored 23 points 
to lead the Badgers at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashard Griffith added 18 points and 14 rebounds for Wisconsin (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Milwaukee (0-7) missed its first eight shots, fell behind, 12-0, and 
never again got closer than eight points.

MARYLAND OKS AT-HOME BETTING TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Maryland Racing Commission approved Wednesday the testing of a system that 
will allow people to place bets from their homes -- a move officials hope will 
increase interest in horse racing and boost track revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group we're responding to is the under-30 crowd," said Mark Brenner, 
president of On Demand Services, a Tulsa, Okla.-based communications company 
developing the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, which will be installed in 25 homes in suburban Baltimore next 
month, is similar to pay-per-view television, Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 It works by hooking a cable box to a television set with one cable going into 
the television and another entering the telephone line. When a person wants to 
make a bet, he can slide a credit card in the box and then punch in a PIN 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 A menu is displayed on the television screen offering options such as "Today's 
Racetracks," "Account Information" or "Help." A flip of the channel gives a 
person a list of all races, a description of the weather conditions on the 
tracks and information on each race's handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The person uses the remote to choose a race, horse and wager. Money is 
deducted from an account that is established when the system is hooked up. Once 
the bet has been placed, the person can flip a channel and watch the race. 
</P>
<P>
 A bettor will be able to place bets on up to 100 races at racetracks across 
the nation, Brenner said. The minimum bet will be $1. There is no maximum 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up costs for the system in Maryland will be between $250,000 and 
$500,000, Brenner said. ODS will pay for most of the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 During the program's initial phase, the 25 testers will use play money and 
will only be able to bet, not watch video feed of the races. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually video feed and channels will be added so viewers can bet on races 
at tracks in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, Kentucky, Nevada and New York, 
Brenner said.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; BAZE ECLIPSES JOCKEY RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For winning 433 races, 72 more than any other jockey, Russell Baze received 
two votes out of 274 cast for the Eclipse Award in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Baze has won 400 races again this year, clinching another national 
title, the thought that he will do just as badly in another Eclipse vote is not 
humbugging his Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voting's up to the guys doing the vote," Baze said in that aw-shucks, 
down-home way of his. "It would be nice to get one (an Eclipse Award). But it 
won't ruin my life if I never get one." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday at Bay Meadows, on owner David Milch's T.V. Producer, a 3-year-old 
gelding who gave Baze five other victories this year, the 36-year-old jockey 
reached the 400-win mark for the third consecutive year, matching a record set 
by Kent Desormeaux in 1987-89. When 1994 ends, Baze will lead the country in 
victories for the third year in a row, equaling the streaks of Desormeaux, Bill 
Hartack (1955-57) and Pat Day (1982-84). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Day won the first of his four Eclipse Awards, missing the 400 mark by 
one victory and finishing 27 ahead of Baze, who was second in his first year of 
riding with more than 300. 
</P>
<P>
 Day won 36 stakes races, four more than Baze, but, counting all races, Day's 
horses earned $7.9 million to Baze's $4.4 million. That is the distinction 
Eclipse voters inevitably make when casting ballots. In baseball terms, Baze 
was hitting singles at Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields, while Pat Day was 
knocking home runs in big races at major tracks all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trainers who win a lot of races but don't run for the big purses never do 
much in the Eclipse voting either," said Ray Harris, who has been Baze's agent 
in Northern California since 1980. "Maybe there should be two awards, the one 
they have now plus one for guys in Russell's category." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Turf Writers Assn., a partner in the Eclipse Awards voting with 
the Daily Racing Form and track racing secretaries, will introduce its own 
award in 1996, for the jockey with the highest winning percentage. The award 
will be named after Isaac Murphy, the legendary 19th-Century jockey who won the 
Kentucky Derby three times and won at a 44% clip during a remarkable career. 
</P>
<P>
 Baze has never ridden in a Kentucky Derby and has been in a Breeders' Cup race 
only once. He has won almost 100 stakes races at Bay Meadows alone, but most of 
his victories in major races have come in Southern California, including those 
aboard Both Ends Burning and Hawkster in the Oak Tree Invitational at Santa 
Anita. Baze was a last-minute replacement for an AWOL Pat Valenzuela in the 
1989 Oak Tree. Baze and Hawkster rolled home in world-record time. 
</P>
<P>
 His victory with Hawkster came in the middle of a frustrating three-year 
attempt to carve out a niche on the much tougher Santa Anita-Hollywood Park-Del 
Mar circuit. Baze won only 286 races in 1989-90, his win percentage sinking to 
11.1%, about 15 points below the last three years and seven under his lifetime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention was to stay down there," he said. "I got off to a good start, 
but after that business wasn't so good. The main difference was that I didn't 
get a chance to ride many of the better horses." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Baze' first full year back in Northern California, he won 433 races, 
seven on one April day at Golden Gate, a record output at a Bay Area track. 
It's at these tracks where Harris frequently has a choice of three or four 
horses in a race for his client. Said leading trainer Jerry Hollendorfer after 
his T.V. Producer won Sunday: "My only problem with Russell is that I can't get 
him enough for my horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said it's no coincidence that Baze's three 400-victory years followed 
his return from Southern California. "Russell really is a good rider," Harris 
said. "His time in Los Angeles made him a better rider. He was a tolerant and a 
patient rider, but after coming back from down there, where there's such an 
emphasis on speed, he's been willing to send his horses more." 
</P>
<P>
 Few suspensions, and fewer injuries, have been the keys for Baze in a 433-win 
1992, a 410-win '93 and a 400 and counting '94. Since 1980, he has won titles 
at every Bay Meadows and Golden Gate meet in which he's ridden, a string of 22 
championships that will be extended by the current Bay Meadows meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Baze's 400th victory left him with a lifetime total of 4,734. He rides at 115 
pounds, so without a weight problem the probability of riding at least another 
10 years is not unrealistic. Let's see, 400 victories a year for 10 more years 
. . . that puts him at the threshold of Bill Shoemaker's record 8,833, 
providing the redoubtable Laffit Pincay doesn't get there first. 
</P>
<P>
 Baze laughed at the possibility. "I'll just keep riding as long as I enjoy 
it," Baze said. "Until I get injured or until I can't be successful at the 
level I'm at." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 John Giovanni, national manager of the Jockeys' Guild, is scheduled to meet in 
New York on Friday with Brian McGrath, commissioner of the Thoroughbred Racing 
Assns., to see if they can agree to a contract for the jockeys' health and 
accident insurance. The TRA made the guild what was called "a final offer" last 
week and gave the jockeys until Friday to respond. Giovanni discussed the offer 
with the guild's executive committee in a conference telephone call Tuesday. 
The current three-year contract expires Dec. 31. . . . Ron McAnally saddled the 
winners of three consecutive straight races Wednesday.

NBA ROUNDUP; CAVALIERS FIND IMPROBABLE WAY TO WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Jersey Nets took losing to the extremes of the clock Wednesday night 
in dropping a 95-88 decision to the Cleveland Cavaliers in double overtime at 
East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's Tyrone Hill made a dunk off an inbounds play with three-tenths of 
a second left in the first overtime to tie the score, and the Cavaliers 
outscored the Nets in the second, 11-4, to run their winning streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like this was meant to be," said Chris Mills, who made the pass on 
the inbounds play. "Whenever you play two overtimes and hold a team to less 
than 90 points, you deserve to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Cavaliers had to steal this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets were walking off the court at the end of the first overtime, thinking 
they had an 84-82 victory, when the officials put three-tenths of a second back 
on the clock after a shot by Hill went out of bounds off a Net. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavalier Coach Mike Fratello drew up a new play on the sideline during the 
subsequent timeout. The Cavaliers ran an inbounds play from the right sideline, 
and Hill dunked a pass from Mills in one motion to tie the score and leave the 
Nets shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 John Williams led the Cavaliers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 120, Denver 96 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 24 points to help the Magic 
remain unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal scored six points to start a 22-6 run that gave the Magic an 89-56 lead 
with a little more than a minute to play in the third quarter of a game it 
dominated from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 111, Seattle 93 -- Charles Barkley scored 10 of his 20 points in the 
fourth quarter to lead the Suns at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in as many games against the SuperSonics, the Suns made a 
franchise-high 12 three-point shots, all but three in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 103, Minnesota 95 -- Karl Malone scored 31 points and the Jazz held the 
Timberwolves to eight baskets over the final 16:46 at Minneapolis for its fifth 
consecutive road victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves led, 63-59, on a jump shot by Chris Smith with 4:46 to play 
before David Benoit scored seven points in an 11-0 Jazz run. Minnesota made 
only seven shots the rest of the way to remain winless in 10 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 99, Philadelphia 96 -- Rookie Glenn Robinson scored a season-high 32 
points and the Bucks withstood a late rally by the 76ers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Burton, who scored a career-high 53 points against the Miami Heat on 
Tuesday night at Philadelphia, led the 76ers with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 106, Detroit 93 -- Muggsy Bogues scored 18 points at Auburn Hills, 
Mich., as the Hornets handed the Pistons their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogues had his second big game against the Pistons this season. In the first 
meeting between the two teams, Bogues had 22 points and 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 122, Boston 110 -- David Robinson scored 32 points, 12 in the 
fourth quarter before fouling out, to lead the Spurs at San Antonio.

 Indiana 81, Atlanta 79 -- The Pacers led by as many as seven points in the 
fourth quarter but could not pull away at Indianapolis.

<P>
 Government reports indicating continued economic strength with little 
inflation pushed stocks sharply higher in heavy trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 30.95 points at 
3,746.29. Stocks' gains were broadly based; advancing issues outnumbered 
declining ones by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on the 
Big Board came to a hefty 355.12 million shares, up from 309.37 million on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields of Treasury securities were mixed, with investors 
wondering whether the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates again 
this month or wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year long bond ended at 7.86%, up from Tuesday's 7.85%. The 
bond's price, which moves inversely to yield, fell 3/32 point, or 94 cents per 
$1,000 invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose by a relatively 
modest 0.3% in November. The price index had risen 0.1% in October and 0.2% in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Fed reported that industrial production rose by a strong 
0.5% in November and pushed the operating rate of U.S. factories, mines and 
utilities to 84.7% of capacity. It was the highest level of output since April, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inflation reports were not as bad as some investors had worried they 
might be," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper 
Securities. "They indicate that inflation might not be the problem going 
forward (that) many had thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, because of the strong economic data, analysts disagreed as to whether 
the figures might soon lead the Fed to boost interest rates for a seventh time. 
Fed policy-makers are to meet Tuesday for the last time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * J.P. Morgan dropped 1 1/8 to 58 after it said its fourth-quarter earnings 
will be below those of the third quarter due to decreased trading revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprint rose 3/8 to 30 3/4 after it said it plans an alliance with Telefonos 
de Mexico. Telmex ended 3/8 higher at 51 5/8 in U.S. trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike said it plans to buy all outstanding shares of Canstar Sports, the 
Montreal maker of ice skates and other hockey equipment, for about $395 
million. Nike leaped 2 to 68; Canstar surged 6 1/8 to 19 1/8 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * National Health Laboratories rose 1 1/2 to 13 1/2 on the news that it will 
merge its U.S. clinical lab operations with those of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell fell 1 3/8 to 15 7/8 in heavy Nasdaq trading after posting a drop in 
fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T rose 1 3/4 to 51. The company received a $1.2-billion contract from 
Flag Ltd. to build an undersea cable system. In addition, AT&T's chairman gave 
an upbeat speech to industry executives in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes also finished higher. The NYSE's composite index rose 
2.61 points to 248.33, while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.82 points 
to 454.97. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks rose 6.18 points 
to 725.67. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly higher elsewhere. In London, the Financial Times 100-share 
average surged 34.2 points to close at 2,980.6, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
average average rose 13.52 points to 2,024.77. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei 
average gained 56.01 points to end at 18,931.49. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index closed down 6.44 points at 2401.55. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was weakened slightly against other major currencies except the 
Japanese yen, as traders ignored more government data showing strong U.S. 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar ended at 100.28 Japanese yen, up from 100.19 on 
Tuesday, and at 1.569 German marks, down from 1.579. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, coffee futures tumbled in a continued reaction to the 
U.S. Agriculture Department's global supply forecast. Green arabica coffee for 
December delivery finished 6.5 cents lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa 
Exchange at $1.443 a pound, a six-month low.

 Countrywide's Earnings Plunge: Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., continuing 
to suffer from this year's rise in mortgage interest rates, said fiscal 
third-quarter earnings fell 62%. Net interest income fell 44% in the 
quarter.The earnings drop follows declines of 22% and 59% in the first and 
second quarters, respectively, as rising interest rates make home buying more 
expensive. The rise in interest rates has also caused mortgage bankers to offer 
incentives on new loans to entice customers. This has cut into the industry's 
profit margins. Earnings for the Pasadena-based company, which is one of the 
nation's largest mortgage bankers, fell to $16.2 million, or 18 cents a share, 
for the quarter ended Nov. 30, from $43 million, or 46 cents a share, a year 
ago.

 AT&T Corp. Wins Undersea Cable Contract: The company said it was awarded the 
$1.2-billion job of laying the world's longest undersea fiber-optic 
communications system, which 40 telecommunications carriers have signed up to 
use. Gabriel Yackanich, president and chief executive of Fiberoptic Link Around 
the Globe, said it will be the first privately financed cable system that 
"permits carriers to purchase capacity at true market rates." The 17,000 miles 
of cable will reach from Britain to Japan, with "landing points" in Spain, 
Italy, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong 
Kong.

 Dealer Satisfaction With Auto Makers Flat: Car and truck dealers may be 
selling everything in sight and collecting bigger profits this year, but their 
satisfaction with auto makers hasn't grown, a new survey says. J.D. Power & 
Associates said its annual index of dealer attitudes shows no improvement in 
how dealers feel about car companies.The main reason is too much success, the 
Agoura Hills marketing firm said. Auto makers can't build enough hot-selling 
models to meet buyer demand. Auto makers have streamlined their operations to 
respond more quickly when demand increases. But the new, leaner operations 
can't build popular models fast enough in a year when overall vehicle sales are 
up more than 8%.

 Vino! The Exciting Game of Wine!, is a wine trivia board game with some pretty 
easy questions (does Marsala come from Italy, Greece or Spain?), some pretty 
hard (when was the first Mendocino winery established?). Sometimes you have to 
propose a toast (the other players decide whether you deserve to get another 
question), and since this is a wine-lover's game, everybody gets one card that 
entitles him to disagree with another player's answer. Available in wine stores 
such as Wally's in West L.A. and Gordon Winery in Thousand Oaks, or by calling 
(800) 8466-386 (that's VINO-FUN). Hey, What Ever Happened to Tin Cans?

 "We're aggressively exploring the shift from aluminum to steel in certain 
parts of the world," says Randy Donaldson, a Coca-Cola spokesman. Already about 
half of Europe's Coke is sold in steel cans, and the ratio is even higher in 
Japan. The reason: Since last January, when Russia and Western nations signed a 
controversial agreement that limits aluminum production, aluminum prices have 
risen 81%. Steel cans are also sturdier, since they can be made in one piece. I

ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; BOOK REVIEW; AN ARMCHAIR GUIDE TO THE INDIAN TABLE; 
INDIAN FOOD: A HISTORICAL COMPANION BY K. T. ACHAYA (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: 
1994; $35; 290 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two undeniable facts: 1) India has one of the richest cuisines in the world, 
and 2) the average American -- even the average American foodie -- doesn't know 
much about it. If you want to get an idea just how little you do know, look 
into "Indian Food: A Historical Companion," which is not a cookbook but a 
compendium of information about Indian food. 
</P>
<P>
 Wow! All these unfamiliar fruits and vegetables, this vast, mind-boggling 
swarm of local traditions. The 8th-Century Assamese curry made from a salty 
extract of banana roots, cooked with aquatic plants. The medieval aphrodisiac 
called vrsyapupalika -- an omelet of crocodile eggs and rice flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, you discover that a lot of what people believe -- even in India 
-- about Hindu vegetarianism is wrong. It turns out that vegetarianism, like 
the avoidance of beef, is not an eternal Indian phenomenon but one that grew up 
slowly. In olden times, religious duty actually required Hindus to give a 
Brahmin a gift of meat (beef, in fact) on certain holidays, unthinkable as that 
would be today. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the book covers the history of food in India from the Stone Age to 
the present day. India has no ancient cookbooks, but there are descriptions of 
foods -- sometimes quite detailed -- in ancient and medieval literature, in 
some cases written by royalty. King Someshwara III (1226-1238) was the James 
Beard of the Chalukya Dynasty, writing loving verses about, for instance, a 
dish of liver cut into balls the size of betel nuts, grilled, fried with spices 
and served in yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the book treats various topics such as Indian medical beliefs 
about food, ritual food practices (in some Bengali tales, Achaya points out, 
everyone is served different food, according to temperament and station in 
life) and cooking utensils. The most interesting chapters are probably the ones 
on Indian foodstuffs and the 18 detailed pages on regional cuisines, which give 
the feeling that even this book has barely scratched the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indian Food" has a couple of flaws, however. It seems to have been written 
primarily for Indian readers, possibly because it grew out of a research 
project sponsored by the Indian National Science Academy. If you don't have a 
lot of Indian vocabulary at your fingertips, starting with elemental terms such 
as curds (which we call yogurt) and lakh (the number 100,000, as in "one lakh 
rupees"), you'll be hitting the vocabularies at the back of the book pretty 
often. Here's a typical sentence about grain cookery in Gujarat: "Roasted jowar 
cobs yielded hurada , and jowar rotis were called didari ." ( Jowar is a grain, 
roti is a kind of bread.) 
</P>
<P>
 The other flaw is more serious. Achaya has clearly read a lot about Indian 
food, but it was in what historians call secondary sources. In other words, 
he's mostly reporting what other people have concluded from the primary 
evidence. Rarely, if ever, does he go to the original data to verify their 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dangerous practice, particularly in India, because certain Indian 
scholars like to claim that everything in the world originated in India a long 
time ago. Unfortunately, Achaya makes no attempt to winnow the wheat from the 
chaff. He'll quote from a serious scholarly work such as Om Prakash's "Food and 
Drinks in Ancient India," and then a few pages away he'll blithely repeat 
daydreams like: The Latin word for olive oil comes from the Tamil word for 
sesame, there was a direct land connection between India and Africa 250,000 
years ago, the Aztecs and Mayas worshiped Indian gods, and the inhabitants of 
Easter Island used a script that resembles that of the ancient Indian city of 
Harappa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Achaya even invents one or two myths of his own. He says there is evidence 
that south Indians were making pilaf 2,000 years ago, but if you look up the 
book he footnotes, you find that the Old Tamil word pulavu had nothing to do 
with pilaf. It meant raw meat or fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there's not much of this sort of dubious information, and it's 
concentrated in the two chapters on prehistoric India (there are also some wild 
tales in the chapters on Indian medicine and New World ingredients). It's a 
shame that there's any, though, because when you talk about Indian food -- or 
India itself -- there's so much gee-whiz stuff that's really true.

ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; COOKBOOK COLLECTING: A RAGE FOR RECIPES

 Sandra Lee Smith has lost track of the number of recipes she has for tamale 
pie. Smith, who lives in Arleta, has collected cookbooks for 30 years. The last 
time she counted there were 3,000 -- they fill shelves in practically every 
room of her house.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only place I don't have cookbooks is in my kitchen," she says. "They 
might get messed up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith loves all types of cookbooks, but her favorites are those put out by 
churches and charities to raise money for every cause imaginable, from 
supporting temperance unions to purchasing hymnals. 
</P>

 "When I first started collecting I would buy virtually anything I could get my 
hands on," says Smith. "A friend got me interested in community cookbooks -- 
regionals, we called them back then. I put an ad in this collectors' magazine 
saying I'm interested in buying these old cookbooks and got more than 200 
letters. I had no idea what I was getting into."

 "People don't come in and just buy one cookbook," says Janet Jarvits, who owns 
a Burbank bookstore devoted entirely to used, out-of-print and rare cookbooks. 
"They'll usually buy a whole lot of them. They go into a feeding frenzy." 
</P>
<P>
 People collect cookbooks for various reasons. Some buy them as investments. 
Others simply want to try new recipes. For some, cookbooks provide good bedside 
reading. And there are those who acquire cookbooks for their historical and 
sociological value. Nostalgia is a big factor. Open an old cookbook and the 
past comes rushing back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a third of the cookbooks I sell are because people want to have the 
cookbook their mother used to have," says Jarvits, 28. "They remember what they 
ate when they were 10 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jarvits, Bookseller, which carries 10,000 volumes, is a mecca for 
cookbook lovers wanting to add to their collections. Since opening in early 
June, Jarvits has purchased 5,000 volumes that belonged to the late cookbook 
author Helen E. Brown. Walk into her long, narrow shop and you'll find it 
crammed with everything from "The Joy of Cooking" to "The Gay Cookbook" to 
"Eating Together" by Lillian Hellman and Peter Feibelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of crossover collectors," says Jarvits. "Somebody that 
collects film might also collect cookbooks by film stars." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of celebrity cookbooks. Paul Newman published one. So did 
Vincent Price, Sophia Loren, Danny Kaye, Dinah Shore, film director Joseph 
Pasternak, singer Kate Smith, ZaSu Pitts, James Joyce, Marjorie Kinnan 
Rawlings, mystery writer James M. Cain, Salvador Dali, Toulouse-Lautrec, even 
Elsie the Cow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practically everyone writes a cookbook," says Marion Gore, who has been 
operating a mail-order used and antiquarian cookbook business for 35 years out 
of her San Marino home. Gore still searches for out-of-print titles, but not as 
often as she used to. "I like the authors who write and don't just give a 
laundry list of recipes. I've gotten to the point where I don't buy them unless 
I enjoy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since no one can possibly own every cookbook anyway, most people select a 
topic and build a collection around it. The subjects are endless -- food 
history, wartime cookery, California cookbooks, signed first editions, favorite 
authors, children's cookbooks, cocktail books, appliance cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd sell a fondue cookbook," says Jarvits, "but when I opened 
the store, it was one of the first requests I got."

 John Biklen, a Pomona cookbook dealer, predicts diet cookbooks will become 
highly sought after. "It's the least collectible thing right now. Yet it's an 
area that has radically changed." Goodbye Adelle Davis, hello Rosie Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the interest in collecting cookbooks, many dealers are now focusing 
on current authors, attempting to predict who will become the next Charles 
Ranhofer (the former Delmonico's chef who wrote "The Epicurean," published in 
1894) or Irma Rombauer ("The Joy of Cooking," published in 1931). David 
Strymish, president and co-founder of the cookbook catalogue Jessica's Biscuit, 
buys huge quantities of remainders -- cookbooks that didn't sell for various 
reasons -- and stores them in a warehouse. He's waiting for the books to be 
rediscovered and become hot sellers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do see fabulous cookbooks that grow steadily over time," says Catherine 
Van Orman, who buys books for Massachusetts-based Jessica's Biscuit. "For 
instance, when Paula Wolfert's couscous book ("Couscous and Other Good Food 
From Morocco") came out, it was met with instant acclaim within a small world 
of food experts, but not by the general cooking public. Her 'World of Food' was 
remaindered too. But now she's known across the board, and her books are 
immediately valued. They no longer get remaindered. People like her can go 
through a hot cycle if they live long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Cunningham was another author Jessica's Biscuit was quick to cash in 
on. "She's got two new books coming out next year, yet her 'Supper' book was 
remaindered four months ago," says Van Orman. "We knew how good it was and 
bought as many copies as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Jessica's Biscuit signed a deal with Harper & Row to print a new 
edition of Nancy Silverton's "Desserts" book, which was published in 1986. "It 
will be printed only for us," says Van Orman. "Later on, as it becomes rare 
again, David can inch the price up." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's their most requested bread book, the company has just published 
an American edition of Elizabeth David's 1977 "English Bread & Yeast Cookery" 
under its Biscuit Books label. Except for a foreword by Marion Cunnningham and 
introduction notes by Brinna B. Sands of King Arthur Flour, David's text 
remains unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the thrill of collecting, though, is having something no one else has. 
That's why some die-hard collectors would never order a book from a catalogue. 
Isn't it far more fun to find a signed first edition or some rare volume at a 
church rummage sale? It's a lot cheaper too. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona book dealer Biklen advises those wanting to start a serious cookbook 
collection to have a reason to collect. "You can collect on a shoestring budget 
or you can collect with big bucks," he says. "but you should only collect 
because you like them."

 Anyone interested in cookbooks knows enough to hang on to anything written by 
M.F.K. Fisher or Elizabeth David. Their works are already considered 
classics.Books by the late Helen Evans Brown, Jane Grigson, Waverly Root, James 
Beard and Vincent Price are also very collectible. (Price's books aren't just 
wanted for his celebrity name, but for his recipes -- they actually work.) 
</P>
<P>
 We asked cookbook dealers to speculate which contemporary food writers might 
one day become classic. The following list, in no particular order, was 
compiled from their responses.

ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; BOOKS ON CD-ROM; FROM DISK TO PLATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compact disk drives are becoming standard on home computers. The reason is 
obvious: A single CD-ROM disk can hold as much data as dozens of floppies, 
making it the logical way to market reference materials such as encyclopedias . 
. . or cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most CD-ROM cookbooks to date have simply been books transferred to a disk. In 
other words, recipe collections -- particularly convenient recipe collections, 
to be sure, where you can look things up quickly and print out recipes you 
like. However, a CD-ROM disk's huge capacity makes it practical to get a lot 
more fun out of your computer. So far, the quaintly titled "4 Paws of Crab: An 
Interactive Thai Cookbook" has taken the most advantage of multimedia features 
such as music, narration and on-screen action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MICRO KITCHEN COMPANION GOLD EDITION (Lifestyle Software Group, 1994: $49.95)  
</P>
<P>
 "Micro Kitchen Companion Gold Edition" is not a cookbook in itself but a 
format for accessing cookbooks on CD-ROM (if the cookbooks are designed to go 
with it, as indicated by a Micro Kitchen Companion seal on their boxes) and for 
managing recipe collections on a hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
 This is worthwhile. To use a CD-ROM, you have to install a certain amount of 
software on your hard disk. The files typically go into several different 
directories, so if you decide you don't want to use that particular CD-ROM disk 
any more, just deleting its directory won't free up all the disk space it was 
occupying. There will still be an indeterminate number of cryptically named 
files hanging around, using up resources long after their function has been 
forgotten, in the manner of government agencies. Install a couple of CD-ROMs 
and your WINDOWSSYSTEM directory may start to look like the Washington phone 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Micro Kitchen Companion" greatly reduces that sort of overhead. Once you have 
its software installed on your hard disk, CD-ROM cookbooks that run with it add 
only minimally to your hard disk. This makes the disk worth having in itself, 
at least if you're interested in books available in this format. So far they 
include "The Southern Living Cookbook," "The Healthy Heart Cookbook," "The 
Urban Peasant," five Betty Crocker books and at least a dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
 The format is basically a database, like a cookbook with a lot of indexes. You 
can look up recipes by ingredients used, cuisine, nutritional information and a 
lot of other ways. You can have the program screen out recipes that call for 
allergenic ingredients. It can link recipes to wine selections (it includes a 
wine cellar log).  
</P>
<P>
 It will also resize any recipe for up to 999 servings, with the ability to 
convert odd fractions to sensible measurements (resizing is done by 
mathematical formula, though, so for large numbers the quantities may be off). 
It converts measurements to or from metric, plans meals for weeks ahead and 
reminds you of what you served your guests the last time they came over. It 
sorts shopping lists by item, store, and even aisle of the store, if you want. 
The coupon organizer keeps track of expiration dates.  
</P>
<P>
 You can enter or copy recipes onto your hard disk to create your own personal 
collection, and cross-reference between it and other CD-ROMs in the series. 
There are pronunciation guides and narrated action demonstrations of 
techniques, such as filleting fish and making pastry dough.  
</P>
<P>
 The two recipe collections that come on this disk seem to be mostly for 
demonstration purposes. They are the large (453 recipes) but undistinguished 
"New Currents in American Cuisine" and the more interesting but more 
higgledy-piggledy "A Taste for All Seasons," a sampler of recipes from other 
disks in the series.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 GREAT RESTAURANTS, WINERIES AND BREWERIES (Deep River Publishing, 1994: 
$39.95)  
</P>
<P>
 "Great Restaurants, Wineries and Breweries" is not primarily a cookbook, 
though it contains more than 200 recipes from the restaurants it lists. As the 
name indicates, it's a guide to American restaurants, wineries and breweries.  
</P>
<P>
 It provides more fun than a mere database. A map appears; you click on a 
state, mouse your cursor around on it and then pick from a list of restaurants 
(or wineries, or breweries) in the area. Click on the name of a restaurant and 
you see a color photo of the place and a list of specialties. You can click to 
see a page of the menu, hours and accommodations information, etc.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant selection is surprisingly up-to-date, but not quite complete. 
The L.A. selection, for instance, omits Patina and Spago, just as the Bay Area 
selection does not include Chez Panisse. New Orleans lists K-Paul's, Emeril's 
and Commander's Palace, but not Antoine's, Galatoire's or Brennan's. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a third of the restaurants have provided recipes. Some are old warhorses 
we've seen a million times, like Chasen's hobo steak or the Arches' steak 
Diane, but Citrus, for instance, gives a great summer tomato tart with basil 
crust and a cream of wheat filling that The Times Test Kitchen has tried. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 4 PAWS OF CRAB: An Interactive Thai Cookbook (Live Oak Multimedia, 1994: 
$44.95)  
</P>
<P>
 "4 Paws of Crab" was chef Bancha "Bird" Leelaguagoon's mistaken way of calling 
for crab claws . Characteristically, the creators of this CD-ROM disk decided 
to make it the disk's title. They saw "4 Paws of Crab" not just as a cookbook 
but as an exploration of cultural contact. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that there's a lot of stuff you don't ordinarily expect to find in 
a cookbook. Little wise sayings pop up on the screen from time to time. When 
you page through the guide to 63 Thai ingredients ("Happy Market"), you 
sometimes come upon a Thai scene with a voice-over anecdote. One of the four 
sections of the program, "Mirrors," consists of "Bird" and one of the creators 
of the disk trading impressions about each other's country. 
</P>
<P>
 Another section of the program, "Time Romp," tells you what was happening on 
30 dates in either Thai or American history. The Thai history will be 
unfamiliar to most Americans; the American history will be all too familiar. 
It's the politically correct sort of information, focusing primarily on race, 
class and gender conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe collection is the most impressively developed section. The whole 
time you're in it, there's an evocative background of Bangkok street sounds. 
The recipe you pick appears over a snapshot of someplace in Thailand. Every 
recipe includes a "demo" -- photos of various stages in the preparation -- and 
many (all but three of the curries, for instance) also have "video demos," 
which show the preparation and cooking in slightly jerky motion. The voice-over 
narrative is often really informative. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any of the other disks, this one makes it easy for you to print out a 
copy of the 44 recipes. Some people might think that is not many recipes, but 
once they get to play around with this entertaining disk they may change their 
minds. Note 
</P>
<P>
 Not every home computer can use CD-ROM. Apart from the CD-ROM drive itself, on 
a PC you need a 386 or higher chip (the higher the MHz rating, the better), at 
least 4 megabytes of RAM and an SVGA monitor. "4 Paws" requires at least a 40 
MHz chip and 8 megabytes of RAM. (At lower CPU speeds, expect not only slowness 
but flickering and false color while the screen is being repainted.) A PC 
should run Windows 3.1. The disks reviewed in this article were for the PC. "4 
Paws" is available for the Macintosh, for which it was originally developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everything else in the personal computer world, CD-ROMs tend to be 
discounted, so the suggested retail price is somewhat arbitrary. I found "Micro 
Kitchen Companion Gold Edition" and "Great Restaurants, Wineries and Breweries" 
selling for $29.95.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: KID 'N' PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a big plate of roast kid crudely chopped into wallet-size chunks -- 
the snips of cartilage; the crunchy burned rib ends; the sweet little wisps of 
flesh that attach themselves to membrane or hide between slivers of bone; the 
muscly, fist-size knots of pure meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Birria -- chile'd goat -- might be the most primal dish of Mexican cuisine, 
and the word birria itself roughly translates as "brutish." It's possible to 
order dishes such as carne asada or cocido without imagining anything more 
vivid than poly-wrapped supermarket chuck; you can eat mild tacos de tripas 
without thinking of the calf intestines on your plate. But with goat, there is 
no getting away from the funky animal reality of the thing. Maybe it's the cold 
weather or something, but I've been a little goofy about birria recently. Goat 
is strong meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Birrieria Chalio has sat forever on an eastern stretch of 1st Street, amid a 
row of burger stands and dime stores, in one of the few bits of the Eastside 
that still has an old-fashioned city flair. Inside, the happy buzz, the 
three-generation families, the elaborate Christmas decorations, the wait for a 
table makes you suspect you've stumbled into the best restaurant in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalio occupies a tall room, with goats' heads and stags' heads high on the 
walls, a norteno- stocked jukebox in one corner, and on each table a squeeze 
bottle of sauce that seems hot enough to set off a fusion reaction in your 
silver fillings. As soon as you sit down, a waiter brings over a plate of 
chopped onion, shredded cilantro, halved limes and a small plastic molcajete 
filled with fresh salsa. Vendors wander through selling flowers and bargain 
banda cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been to Eastside restaurants where roving bands of mariachis dispense 
tunage to anybody with a couple of bucks; musicians come through here too, but 
they're just as likely to set their accordions down on the floor and eat lunch 
as they are to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalio has creditable bowls of menudo and the hominy stew pozole , saucy 
enchiladas, giant tacos made with hand-patted tortillas and what seems like a 
full quarter-pound of grilled beef, but birria is the most popular dish to the 
extent that you may not realize Chalio even has a menu -- the waiters don't ask 
you what you're going to have, they ask you what you're going to drink with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the waiters at many birrierias periodically come by to top off the 
tomato-laced broth ( consome ) on your plate, at Chalio a few dollars gets you 
all the goat you can eat. Just as you finish one plate, sop up the superb 
consome with a tortilla and pick up a rib to gnaw off an overlooked scrap of 
flesh, the waiter comes by to see if you'd like another. On weekends, it's not 
unusual to see guys plow through three or four plates of birria and as many 
baskets of tortillas and cans of Modelo beer.  
</P>
<P>
 The birria here is flavored with a strong hit of a mint-like herb, which may 
be a trademark of the Zacatecas-style birria Chalio serves (most restaurants 
advertise birria made in the style of neighboring Jalisco) or an interesting 
quirk in the family recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn tortillas are big, stretchy, unusually tan, handmade in-house except on 
Sundays, when you'll have to make do with factory tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've been coming here a while, you learn to specify the cut of goat you 
want -- the crisp, oily rib section, teeming with little bones; straight 
boneless goat meat cut from the flank or the leg; lean loin of goat -- but 
until then, you'll get sort of a combo platter with a little bit of each.

ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; BOOK REVIEW; THE ESSENCE OF GOOD COOKING; ESSENCE BRINGS 
YOU GREAT COOKING BY JONELL NASH (AMISTAD: 1994; $29.95; ILLUSTRATED, 465 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's turkey ham in the collard greens and skim milk in the mashed potatoes 
in this collection of recipes from the African-American women's magazine 
Essence. Jonell Nash, the food editor, has shaped the book to modern trends in 
light, low-fat eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Such hallowed staples as salt pork, ham hocks, lard and cracklings are 
relegated to a passage titled "Let Them Rest in Peace." They're hardly missed 
in a collection that ranges from Africa to the Caribbean, the American South 
and other parts of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Essence, which turns 25 next year, goes to a million readers, and the recipes 
are as varied as their tastes. Fajitas, Thai fried rice and salmon teriyaki 
share space with such old Southern favorites as catfish gumbo, corn bread and 
crispy fried chicken (fats may be limited, but they're not totally banished). 
</P>
<P>
 Curried chicken from the West Indies, joloff rice from West Africa, Jamaican 
jerk chicken and Cuban black beans represent home cooking in those areas, while 
macaroni and cheese, navy bean soup and budget beef Burgundy are typically 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of this book is in this remarkable diversity. If you're stumped for 
a menu, it provides lots of solutions. The recipes sound awfully good; they're 
clearly written, not elitist and complex, and each is accompanied by a 
nutritional analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some to consider for the holidays are acorn squash stuffed with apple 
dressing, baked yam casserole with Cognac, roast turkey with old-fashioned 
giblet gravy, Southern corn-bread dressing and spicy orange-glazed turkey 
drumsticks. Dessert could be ambrosia, sweet potato pie with whipped cream 
topping, or apricot-brandy pound cake. The cake, says Nash, is one of the 
magazine's most requested recipes. APRICOT-BRANDY POUND CAKE

HOME COOK: THE MAGIC PUMPKIN: IT'S A BREAD, IT'S A CAKE 
</P>

 If you want to "eat your cake and have it too," at least for several days, 
bake this pumpkin bread/cake. It is easily made in large quantities that can 
then be turned into several different dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plain, it's pumpkin bread. If you serve it with butterscotch sauce (or 
butterscotch icing, which is the same thing with the addition of powdered 
sugar), it can become a Christmas cake. Toasted and served with ginger cream 
cheese, it's a wonderful holiday breakfast. Baked in miniature loaf pans it's a 
Christmas gift. You can even sprinkle the crumbs, buttered and toasted, over 
sliced Fuyu persimmons with cream. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan ahead, you can bake half the batter in loaf pans and the rest as 
cupcakes. It freezes well double-wrapped in plastic wrap. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Don't feel guilty if you use canned pumpkin. Unlike peas or beans, pumpkin 
loses little flavor when canned, and in any case this is an assertively spiced 
recipe. But if you are a purist and have a sugar pumpkin, the quickest way to 
prepare it is to cut the pumpkin in half, remove strings and seeds, slice into 
1 1/2-inch slices and steam 30 minutes. Remove and trim off the rind, and it is 
ready. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This cake-like quick bread can also be baked in an eight-inch round cake pan 
plus six standard cupcake or muffin pans.  
</P>
<P>
 PUMPKIN BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup shortening 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups mashed or pureed pumpkin 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, 
cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Stir well with fork or whisk.  
</P>
<P>
 In another large bowl combine shortening, pumpkin, eggs and sugar. Mix 
briskly. There will be some little lumps that will disappear when baked. Stir 
in milk. Mix again. Add dry ingredients. Mix well. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread batter evenly in buttered and floured 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake at 350 
degrees about 40 minutes, but test at 30 minutes by inserting wood pick into 
center of bread. Pick should come out dry and clean. Cool 10 minutes before 
removing from pan. Cut and wrap bread in several parts to use later as needed. 
Double-wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. Makes 12 servings.

BOOK REVIEWS; ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; THE YEAR'S TASTIEST PAGE-TURNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cookbooks tend to to pour out of publishing houses much like water from a 
spigot, and this year, in particular, was a deluge. There were texts devoted to 
fusion, meat-free, gluten-free and "nurturing" cooking -- and heaven only knows 
how many more pasta recipes have been added to the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The following selection includes some of the year's best books. Although the 
range of these books is representative, the list is far from comprehensive; I 
chose these books simply because once I started reading them, I couldn't put 
them down. There are two memoirs, one of a cloistered Sicilian girlhood, the 
other from a year spent with a famous stepmother in Coyocan, Mexico. There's an 
encyclopedic book of home desserts, and a gorgeous picture-book guide to Paris 
bakeries. Two regional cookbooks cover the Eastern Mediterranean and the 
Northern U.S. heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 You could read any one of these books and learn a great deal that you probably 
didn't already know -- about cooking, foodstuffs, history and people in 
general. I now know that sugar used to come in loaves that were cut with 
special knives; I know that orphan girls in Sicilian lay convents had to march 
in every funeral procession as a kind of public service whether they knew the 
deceased or not. I know that the Chippewa had their own names for the months 
and that December was "Spirit Month" and that January was "Big Spirit Month." I 
know that Frida Kahlo read Freud. I know that the man who owns La Maison du 
Chocolat in Paris, a Mr. Linxe, eats 10 to 15 chocolates a day and makes 35 
tons of chocolate a year. I also now know how to make kibbeh.

 CLASSIC HOME DESSERTS: A Treasury of Heirloom and Contemporary Recipes From 
Around the World By Richard Sax (Chapters: 1994; $29.95; 688 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 After spending years poring over cooks' handwritten notebooks in the Rare 
Books and Manuscript Collection at the New York Public Library, after gathering 
everybody's great-aunt's favorite cobbler recipe, and after resuscitating, 
refining and/or reinventing any number of long-loved or forgotten desserts in 
the kitchen, Richard Sax now gives us a big wonderful "treasury of heirloom and 
contemporary recipes from around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Classic Home Desserts" has a practical design, with clearly presented recipes 
and pink margins for anecdotal material, but it's not beautiful. Anne Disrude's 
food styling has a certain homey charm and photographs by Alan Richardson are 
adequate, but the photographs are poorly reproduced on bad stock, and wind up 
looking like those old, discolored recipe pamphlets from the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The book deserves a classier and costlier presentation, for it is an amazing 
and useful encyclopedia of food history, cooking knowledge and amusing arcana. 
Sax is a good, feisty, honest writer, an impressive researcher and lover of odd 
facts. The book contains, he says, only the best example in each category of 
home dessert. Still, it seems exhaustive: there are four chapters on pies alone 
(five if you include the chapter on tarts) and four chapters on cakes; the 
first, "Plain Cakes and Cakes with Fruit," includes sub-sections on 
gingerbreads and apple cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classic Home Desserts" was written with the home cook in mind, which means 
there is nothing too professional -- too time consuming, too technically 
demanding. No Napoleons. No Danish pastries. "Home bakers," writes Sax, "are 
not likely to make three different fillings for a cake." 
</P>
<P>
 In formulating his recipes for contemporary tastes, Sax has cut down, when 
feasible, on sugar and fat, although he pointedly states, "I do not believe in 
making low-calorie imitations of old-fashioned desserts." His recipe for panna 
cotta did seem to have the least amount of cream possible for an alleged "cream 
custard," but the final result was marvelous, redolent of vanilla bean and 
fresh lemon and just rich enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The margins are full of old recipes, asides and literary tidbits. There are 
quotes from "Mary Poppins Comes Back," from Thoreau's "Walden," from Dorothy 
Alison's "Bastard Out of Carolina." There's a recipe for spelt or farina 
pudding from the late 4th Century, and, printed in full, Alice B. Toklas' 
recipe for hashish fudge (Toklas suggests, " . . . it might provide an 
entertaining refreshment for a Ladies' Bridge Club or chapter meeting of the 
DAR"). 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the book is a joy to cook from; instructions are clear, easy to 
read, the results dependable: It's the book I'll be giving this Christmas. 
</P>

 BITTER ALMONDS: By Maria Grammatico and Mary Taylor Simeti (William Morrow and 
Co.: 1994; $20; 200 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 In 1952, in impoverished, post-war Sicily, Maria Grammatico's father dropped 
dead of a heart attack leaving 12-year-old Maria, her four siblings and her 
pregnant mother with virtually no means of support. So, five days before 
Christmas, she and a sister were dropped off at the Convent of San Carlo in 
Erice. Maria would not see her mother again for almost a year -- the nuns 
forbade the pregnant woman to visit, lest the girls glimpse her "big belly." 
</P>
<P>
 The cloistered Franciscan convent may have kept the Grammatico girls fed, but 
life there was one of unrelenting poverty and deprivation. As Grammatico tells 
Mary Taylor Simeti, "The food was always the same: beans, cauliflower, beans, 
cauliflower, and then sometimes they'd give us peas. You know the kind? The 
dried split peas? They always stuck to the pot and burned. The stink was enough 
to kill you. Down the toilet! Baah! We managed to survive, though, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 To generate income, the nuns and orphans made almond pastries and cakes that 
were sold to the general public through an iron grate. These were simple items: 
cookies, biscuits, marzipan fruit, Paschal lambs for Easter, the occasional 
quince or cream tart by special order. Nothing went to waste. Even burnt 
pastries were ground up with an orange, sugar and spices and recycled into 
another sort of pastry. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years at San Carlo, Maria Grammatico, thinking she had a vocation for 
the religious life, went to take a look at a cloistered Carmelite convent. 
There she suffered from a nervous collapse and was brought home, paralyzed and 
comatose. Back in her mother's house, she recovered and soon, at age 24, found 
her true vocation: With a wood-burning oven, a hand-cranked nut grinder and a 
rolling pin, she opened her own pastry shop. Today Pasticceria Maria Grammatico 
is a large, successful enterprise and mecca for tourists. Simeti wrote about 
Grammatico's pastries for Gourmet magazine several years ago and decided then 
that Grammatico's life and recipes deserved a book. "Bitter Almonds' " text 
comes from transcribed, edited tapes and reads like the rough draft of a 
novella by someone like Alice Munro.  
</P>
<P>
 Recipes are adapted for the home cook, but The Times Test Kitchen had problems 
with the simple almond cookies called "Suspiri," or "Sighs," made from the 
basic almond pastry dough: The cookies kept spreading out into thin lacy wafers 
instead of the plump rounds pictured in the book. At home, I got a slightly 
rounded cookie if I ground the almonds quite fine (directions read medium-fine) 
and found the cookies held their shape even better if the dough sat for a 
couple of days in the refrigerator. Still, even the flattest cookies were quite 
delicious.

 PARIS BOULANGERIE PATISSERIE: By Linda Dannenberg (Clarkson Potter: 1994; $35; 
160 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 The prettiest book of the season is a lavish picture book of Parisian 
bakeries, "Paris Boulangerie and Patisserie," by Linda Dannenberg, who last 
gave us the equally gorgeous "Paris Bistro Cooking." While the text is written 
in a serviceable, pedestrian journalistic prose, the bakeries are so 
beautifully photographed by Guy Bouchet, this book soon had me down on the 
kitchen floor poring over a large map of Paris, plotting a bread and pastry 
tour. (Is it true you can go round-trip for $799?) 
</P>
<P>
 The Parisian boulangers Dannenberg profiles are, she writes, "committed to the 
concept of old-fashioned handmade breads, pain d'autrefois. " The patissier, on 
the other hand, "is an artist who wants his creations to be as individual as he 
is -- which is the reason there are so many variations on a theme in the pastry 
shops of Paris."  
</P>
<P>
 The book's design, by Louise Fili, was not created with the cook in mind: 
Recipes are run continuously in the text in a typeface that's difficult to 
read. (Fractions, in particular, are so teeny they're almost illegible.) Best 
copy out any recipe you want to try (and you'll also spare the book butter 
spots). Boulangers and patissiers have adapted their recipes for the home cook, 
though some of these adaptations are approximations and may cause 
disappointment, especially when it comes to the bread: All the bread recipes 
use packaged yeast, whereas the unforgettable flavor of so many Parisian 
artisanal breads comes from a process of fermentation with starters not 
familiar to most home cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these bakers also overestimate the ambition and abilities of the home 
cook: I, for one, won't ever make patisserie Dalloyau's coulibiac de la mer , 
an elaborate brioche filled with layers of fish mousse, langoustine, scallops, 
leeks and brill. Other recipes send one scurrying to the supermarket: Boulanger 
Bernard Ganachaud submits a recipe that puts stale croissants to lavish use, La 
Maison du Chocolat provides Le Pleyel , a simple, almost flourless chocolate 
loaf cake. Easy orange-and-raisin sables from Jean-Luc Poujauran are well worth 
a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, book a flight to Paris and eat the real thing.

 FRIDA'S FIESTAS: Recipes and Reminiscences of Life With Frida Kahlo By 
Guadalupe Rivera and Marie-Pierre Colle (Clarkson Potter: 1994; $35; 224 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 The other visual knock-out of this season is "Frida's Fiestas," a memoir with 
recipes written by Kahlo's stepdaughter, Guadalupe Rivera, and Marie-Pierre 
Colle. Photographs by Ignacio Urquiza are one dreamy, colorful feast-scape 
after another. Archival photographs of Kahlo and Rivera and reproductions of 
Kahlo's paintings are also liberally seeded throughout the book.  
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Rivera describes her stepmother Frida as affectionate, intelligent, 
and spirited: "Everything about her, from her hairstyle to the hem of her 
dress, breathed a kind of roguish glee . . ." Kahlo apparently could not pass 
up a special occasion. "She celebrated saints' days, birthdays, baptisms, and 
most of the popular holidays, both religious and secular. She got everyone 
involved . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Structured around the months of the year, the book has 12 chapters and 
presents menus for 12 celebratory feasts. Many of these feasts took place in 
1942-3, the year Guadalupe Rivera lived with her father and stepmother, 
although the first month in the book, August, commemorates the Rivera-Kahlo 
marriage in 1929. Kahlo's life may have been an ongoing series of celebrations, 
but not all of these celebrations were strictly joyous. When buying a cake for 
the Epiphany dinner, Kahlo, in "extravagantly ornate Tehuana attire and 
pre-Hispanic jewelry," is taunted in a public coffee house. At another dinner, 
Diego Rivera taunts his daughter's suitor. Having heard of her husband's affair 
with a beautiful Hungarian painter, Kahlo "disappears" for a few days in March 
to Teotihuacan, where she consults her friend and seer, don Tomas, and eats a 
Lenten meal (recipes given). At the public Feast of the Holy Cross in May, 
Kahlo sings a song for all to hear about "the pain and contempt" a wife feels 
for her adulterous husband. "Instead of angering Diego Rivera," the author 
writes, "the song made him nearly die of laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Recipes are simply written and require a certain basic knowledge and 
competence with Mexican ingredients. The photographs provide some guidance -- 
it helps to see what the finished product is supposed to look like -- but how 
the almond macaroons, which are dropped by the tablespoon onto baking sheets in 
the recipe, end up inexplicably square in the photograph is a mystery. The 
Times Test Kitchen had a problem with the otherwise easy Enchiladas Tapatias: 
the recipe says to puree the chiles with two cups of water and "drain," but the 
correct command is to puree the chiles and strain -- otherwise you'll end up 
with a mound of ground chiles and no sauce at all.

 SAVORING THE SEASON OF THE NORTHERN HEARTLAND By Beth Dooley and Lucia Watson 
(Alfred Knopf: 1994; $25; 394 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 This latest addition to the handsome Knopf Cooks America Series of heritage 
cookbooks is by food writer Beth Dooley and chef Lucia Watson, who owns the 
highly acclaimed Lucia's restaurant in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides 200 recipes, this fetching and thoughtful book presents amusing 
historical photographs and graphics, apt literary snippets, cooking tips, and 
other food lore from the Ojibwa, Chippewas, Italians, Norwegians, Swedes, 
Germans, Hmong and other settlers in the nation's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 I went through "Savoring the Seasons" looking at all the photographs the same 
way I sit down to read cartoons in the New Yorker -- they're that amusing. 
There's an old coot in a visor with a beautiful white turkey on his lap, and 
the dazed champions of the 1933 Ortonville, Minnesota corn-eating contest. A 
bespectacled, bobbed woman holds an enormous mushroom like an umbrella over her 
head, and two men pass a bottle behind a winched-up 95-pound sturgeon (two more 
bottles lie empty on the ground). Best of all: 72-year-old Arthur Schlegal of 
Blakely, Minnesota, wearing a pretty apron over his overalls, sifts flour while 
preparing to compete for the 1952 spice cake prize at the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Meridel Le Sueur is quoted throughout the book and in such highly 
edited form, her normally purple prose is actually quite palatable: "I was 
always surprised," she writes, "to see my gentle grandmother put her foot on 
the neck of her favorite hen and behead her with a single stroke of a 
long-handled ax." 
</P>
<P>
 Historical, sociological and/or culinary asides, set apart graphically in 
ochre-colored boxes, include two 1925 recipes for lutefisk (dried, 
reconstituted cod), the history of flour milling, a good tip for skimming scum 
off soups, and a description of contemporary ice fishing. (On large open lakes 
in northern Minnesota, "entire ice-fishing communities are erected, with named 
streets as well as garbage collection and delivery services. Some huts have 
color TVs, refrigerators, heating units and running water.") 
</P>
<P>
 Recipe notes are also full of curious information: "The woodcock, or 
'timberdoodle,' with its mottled brown-and-black speckled feathers, often 
escapes hunters simply by staying perfectly still. It also has such keen 
hearing that it can locate worms by listening to them underground." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly written recipes range from the Italian-inspired porchetta to spaetzle 
to "Hmong Market Soup." While I'd add a bit more spice to the poultry stuffing, 
a bit more cinnamon to the cinnamon roll, the basic directions are sound. There 
are the usual cookbook chapter divisions (bread, poultry, meat and fish) as 
well as other chapters that reflect the region's individual character: a 
chapter each on game and on pickling and preserving. "Come for Coffee" reflects 
the region's passion for coffee klatching; "The Communal Pot" gives recipes for 
the regional one-dish dinners often called "hot dishes" which, the authors 
insist, are not to be confused with those "dinners bound in canned cream soup 
and topped with potato chips" associated with other schools of Midwestern 
cooking.

 THE COOKING OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN: 215 Healthy, Vibrant and Inspired 
Recipes By Paula Wolfert (Harper Collins: 1994; $30; 429 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 Paula Wolfert recently spent five years traveling, eating, cooking and 
shopping in Slavic Macedonia, Northern Greece, Turkey, the Levant and the 
Republic of Georgia and this book is the result of that journey -- jam-packed 
with firsthand experience, lore and invaluable instruction for cooking these 
regional cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 The four appendixes alone (on pepper pastes, home-prepared spice mixtures, 
stocking the larder, and yogurts) amount to a graduate seminar in Middle 
Eastern kitchen sensibility. Recipe notes provide colorful facts: Black lentil 
soup from Gaziantep is made with long, droopy tarragon leaves and therefore 
called "soup with a mustache." In Turkey, anchovies are so well loved they are 
baked in bread and in fig leaves and made into pancakes. In Northern Greece, 
there's a genre of food called "hidden meats" -- dishes devised by Greek 
guerrillas that are cooked in sealed containers amid embers so no rising smoke 
could alert enemy Turks to their whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real way to learn about this food is to cook it, and Wolfert's 215 
recipes are each a course in themselves. She gives clear, undaunting directions 
for making 11 types of kibbeh, those three-inch long, stuffed footballs she 
calls "the masterpiece of the Middle Eastern table." Cooking even a simple dish 
of okra braised with tomatoes and onions, one learns to soak okra in a vinegar 
bath (to avoid stringiness and sliminess), to arrange and cook the pods in a 
pretty spoke-like pattern, and finally the technique Wolfert calls "the 
flourish" -- adding sizzling oil or butter scented with pepper, dried mint or 
other spices at the last minute to add a blast of flavor.

GOOD COOKING: DUCKING THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't go wrong when you base your holiday entertaining menus on seasonal 
ingredients such as duck, wild rice, dried cranberries and root vegetables. 
Served up with a flourish, they signify festivity as well as tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 This menu incorporates all of these foods in easily managed recipes -- most of 
which can be at least partially made ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The roasted crispy duck with tangy orange sauce can be prepared in two steps, 
with last-minute cooking requiring very little attention from the cook. 
Garnished with fresh orange slices, it has appealing style without much effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wild rice with fennel and dried cranberries is earthy and lively at the 
same time, with a nice crunch adding a textural contrast. While mashed potatoes 
are always popular, the addition of rutabaga gives them just the right 
distinction and depth to serve with duck. Both of these side dishes are easily 
made a day ahead and reheated at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trick with duck is to roast off as much fat as possible so that the skin 
is crisp but the meat still moist. Preparing the duck in two steps helps to do 
this. The fresh ginger gives this orange sauce a nice oomph.  
</P>
<P>
 CRISPY ROAST DUCK WITH TANGY ORANGE SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground paprika, preferably Hungarian 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 (5-pound) ducks, rinsed, patted dry 
</P>
<P>
 Tangy Orange Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 navel oranges, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 In small dish combine thyme, paprika, salt and pepper to taste. Season cavity 
and surface of ducks with mixture. Place breast-side up in foil-lined roasting 
pan large enough to hold both ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roast at 450 degrees about 80 minutes until just lightly browned. Discard fat 
midway through roasting. Cool on rack. Pour fat and pan juices into skimmer. 
With kitchen shears, cut duck into 6 pieces of 2 breasts, 2 thighs and 2 legs. 
With fingers, remove any visible fat. Can be made to this point day ahead and 
refrigerated. Discard fat. Refrigerate pan juices for sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to serve, heat cast-iron skillet or heavy roasting pan in 
450-degree oven until hot, about 10 minutes. Add duck to skillet, meaty side 
down. Do not overcrowd. Sear until skin is dark-brown, about 15 minutes. Turn 
pieces and roast until crispy, about 5 to 10 minutes more.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, use tongs to transfer to warm platter. Brush lightly with Tangy 
Orange Sauce. Serve hot, garnished with orange slices. Pass remaining sauce 
separately. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 4 servings, with Tangy Orange Sauce, contains about:

</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 3 large shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons ginger root, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup orange marmalade 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch dissolved in 6 tablespoons reduced-sodium chicken 
broth 
</P>
<P>
 Skimmed duck juices 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in 10-inch nonstick skillet. When hot, add shallots, garlic and 
ginger. Cook until shallots are tender, about 4 minutes. Add chicken broth, 
orange juice concentrate, orange marmalade, balsamic vinegar. Season to taste 
with salt, pepper and cayenne. Bring to boil. Whisk in cornstarch mixture. 
Return to boil. Simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Strain through fine 
sieve. Adjust seasonings to taste. Can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, gently reheat sauce in 1-quart nonreactive saucepan. Add skimmed 
duck juices. Heat through. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot. Makes about 2 
cups 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here, wild rice gives an earthy counterpoint to the crunch of the fennel and 
the sweet-tart flavors of the dried cranberries. It's a delicious combination 
that reheats very well. Cooking the wild rice in chicken stock or broth makes a 
big difference in its depth of flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 WILD RICE WITH FENNEL AND DRIED CRANBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 large shallots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 large fennel bulbs, diced 
</P>
<P>
 4 1/2 cups cooked Wild Rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 12 small green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. When hot, add 
shallots. Cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Add fennel. Cook over medium-high 
heat until very hot but not too tender, about 3 minutes. Add rice, cranberries, 
salt and pepper to taste. Heat through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir 
in green onions. Can be made day ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, reheat, covered, in 350-degree oven until hot, about 25 minutes. 
Alternately, reheat in microwave oven. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot.

 In 2-quart saucepan bring chicken stock to boil. Add wild rice. Return to 
boil. Simmer, covered, until liquid has evaporated and rice is done to taste 
(al dente or fully cooked and fluffy), 30 to 50 minutes depending on freshness 
of rice and desired texture. Can be refrigerated 3 days or frozen up to 1 
month. Makes about 4 1/2 cups.

WINE: ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE; HUGH'S BACK . . . AND BIGGER THAN EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the myriad ways to categorize wine, the most basic is by the region in 
which the grapes grow. It was that simple premise that led Hugh Johnson to 
write "The World Atlas of Wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Simple though that approach may seem today, back in 1971 the project was seen 
in this country as novel, for it codified what all France has known for 
centuries: The area in which the grapes grow dictates pretty much what the 
wines will be like. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was arranged simply enough: Each region of the world that grew wine 
grapes got its own brief section with detailed, full-color maps, pictures and 
labels. The text gave tyro and expert alike insight about each area's wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the history of wine is so long, I would have thought constant revision 
of the atlas unnecessary, but the fourth edition of "The World Atlas of Wine" 
(Simon & Schuster: $50; 320 pages) breaks new ground and remains atop the 
latest news from the world's wine regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine years since the last edition, much has changed in the wine 
business. The text here is completely re-written from the third edition; the 
maps and charts are better than ever; the commentary is more analytical, the 
design more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is not just a stupefying gazetteer, but a remarkable achievement 
that could teach a number of governments about their own wine-growing regions. 
This is a work that must be on every wine lover's book shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the wine books to hit the market this year, the weightiest, in more 
ways than one, is Jancis Robinson's monumental and astoundingly thorough 
"Oxford Companion to Wine" (Oxford University Press: 1994; $49.95; 1,088 
pages). 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson did massive amounts of research on this work that fits well within 
the scope of the Oxford Companion reference series. 
</P>
<P>
 One could, I suppose, read this bowling ball of a book cover to cover, but its 
fascination is in two other uses. First, it may be used to settle bets and 
answer knotty questions arising in wine-speak chat. (If a snobby friend says he 
wishes you had been there when he opened a Banyuls, you don't have to fret over 
what Banyuls is, just look on Page 89.) 
</P>
<P>
 Second, you could open it at random and read odd vin -related subjects treated 
with care and detail, including a four-page section on wine literature and a 
number of biographies of wine personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson spent four years on the research and writing. Her expertise shows in 
a lively, informed, literate writing style. No, you might not want to carry 
this companion around with you, but as a constant source of lore and data about 
wine, it should be on the tasting table of every oenophile. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine wine in California started in Sonoma County, but the Napa Valley lays 
claim to the state's greatest wine heritage, and historian Charles Sullivan has 
sewn up the threads of this often tattered quilt.  
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's "Napa Wine: A History" (Wine Appreciation Guild: 1994; $29.95; 438 
pages) has neither the lurid details of James Conaway's land-use epic "Napa" 
nor the detail of William Heintz's "Wine Country: A History of Napa Valley," 
but it is beautifully written and is charmingly illustrated by local 
legend/artist Earl Thollander. What's more, it contains photos from archives I 
never knew existed. A superb work that adds much to -- and clarifies 
misconceptions about -- the nation's most famed wine region. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine encyclopedias abound, and Johnson's "Modern Encyclopedia of Wine" is so 
complete it seems the "Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine" (Larousse: 1994; $40; 608 
pages) is unnecessary. However, the work is well written and well organized, 
has an excellent index and is a good introduction for newcomers to wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely for the wine expert is "Vintage Talk," by Dennis Schaefer (Capra 
Press: 1994; $15.95; 304 pages). Twenty California winemakers, in 
question-and-answer format, tell what they do to make great wine. There are 
drawbacks: The emphasis is on the Central Coast, a number of brilliant 
craftsmen are left out, and the book desperately needs an index. But the text 
is interesting reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Two updated pocket wine guides are both worth having, since they are 
structured differently and each has value for dedicated wine lovers. "Hugh 
Johnson's Pocket Encyclopedia of Wine 1995" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster: $12; 
216 pages) remains the king of such works for its succinct, incisive tone and 
good vintage charts, among other attributes. This 18th edition, "designed to 
take the panic out of buying," as Johnson says, is arranged by region. It is a 
marvel of detail in a space that still fits in purse or glovebox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oz Clarke's Wine Advisor 1994" (Fireside: 1994; $12; 288 pages) offers the 
British critic's witty perceptions about various producers with a different 
format: all alphabetical. Some subjects get full-page treatment, others scant 
attention, but the layout is easy to use and the text fun to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Another pocket guide that may help in buying wine is the 12th annual 
"California Wine Winners," ($6.95, or $8.75 including postage from Varietal 
Fair, 4022 Harrison Grade Road, Sebastopol, Calif. 95472; 174 pages). It is a 
compilation of the top award-winning California wines from nine of the nation's 
major wine competitions. Wines are ranked by a system that awards more points 
for a gold medal than a silver. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious and scientific is "To Your Health: Two Medical Doctors Explore 
the Health Benefits of Wine," by Martin R. Lipp and David N. Whitten 
(HarperCollins West: 1994: $18; 192 pages).  
</P>
<P>
 The authors address questions such as fetal alcohol syndrome, sulfites in 
wine, and how wine affects the function of the heart. Much of this material is 
drawn from scientific literature, most of which already has appeared in other 
forms (notably in the 1992 book, "The French Paradox and Beyond," by Lewis 
Perdue). 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly interesting section is Teach Your Children, in which the 
doctors tackle the question of how children, teen-agers and under-age-21 
youths, both here and in Southern Europe, typically deal with alcohol -- and 
how America may be on the wrong track with its "just say no" approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The following three works on wine are not recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Champagne and Caviar, A Connoisseur's Survival Guide," by Arthur von 
Wiesenberger (Capra Press: 1994; $39.95; 237 pages). The owner of the 
successful Nipper's Champagne and caviar clubs has bitten off more than he 
could chew. The profiles of 20 of Champagne's finest producers aren't bad, but 
the question-and-answer sessions with winemakers are as tame as warm milk, and 
much of the material seems awfully dated. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wine Magic," by Alan R. and Sandra L. Putnam (Salandi Publishers: 1994; 
$14.95; 260 pages). Intended as a lighthearted guidebook, the text isn't as 
funny as I had hoped. It has a number of errors, and the research is scanty and 
not as up-to-date as a 1994 book ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Parker's Wine Guide" (Franklin Electronic Publishing: 1994; $79.95) is a 
calculator device that is small and compact. It gives ratings for hundreds of 
the world's wines from "Robert Parker's Wine Buyer's Guide," which was released 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles with the electronic version are many. First and foremost, the 
viewer gets only raw scores for wines -- most of which are no longer available 
-- and only vague prices (such as "$25 to $50"). Moreover, there is little 
commentary on the wines, to let the viewer know if a wine is ready to drink or 
should be cellared. 
</P>
<P>
 Better is "Wine Spectator Magazine's Ultimate Guide to Buying Wine," (M. 
Shanken Communications, Inc.: 1994; $22.95; 751 pages). The numerical scores 
are often accompanied by descriptions of the wine and accurate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, a charming bit of wine whimsy: Joni McNutt's "In Praise of Wine," 
(Capra Press: 1994; $12.95; 236 pages). McNutt has compiled hundreds of wine 
quotations and poems. 
</P>
<P>
 And what better way to close a dry recitation of vinous literature than with 
one of McNutt's better quotes, from the late Bordeaux proprietor and author 
Alexis Lichine: "There is no substitute for pulling corks."

SAVE THE BLOTKAKE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drifts of whipped cream make Norwegian blotkake as snowy as a white Christmas. 
This stunning cake appears at any important occasion, from Norwegian 
independence day May 17 to year-end festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Blotkake is so significant that the Sons of Norway, a national organization 
headquartered in Minneapolis, encourages members to make it. The Sons operates 
a cultural skills program that includes a unit on traditional cooking. Working 
like Scouts earning badges, participants progress from general cooking to meat 
and fish dishes and baked goods and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the baking guidelines, Norwegian custom is to serve seven kinds 
of baked goods at Christmas and other holidays. Blotkake would be one of these. 
And sure enough, there it was at this year's julebasar (Christmas bazaar) at 
the Norwegian Seamen's Church in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 After purchasing Christmas wares from Scandinavia, shoppers lined up at a 
buffet that started with yellow pea soup, moved on to smorbrod (open-face 
sandwiches) and wound up with blotkake and kaffe (coffee). 
</P>
<P>
 The luscious blotkake was layered with apricot puree and whipped cream, topped 
with more whipped cream and decorated with kiwi. Liv Nilsen, a church hostess 
who made the cake, says in Norway she would use cloudberries at this time of 
year. But blotkake adapts to whatever is available. The only requisites are 
whipped cream and fruit of some sort. Even bananas and canned fruit cocktail 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsen remembers eating blotkake at Christmas in Farsund in southern Norway. 
The family dinner centered around freshly caught cod with a rich sauce of 
butter, egg yolks and cream. There were also vegetables, hard lefse (bread), 
red wine and rice porridge fluffed up with whipped cream. The red sauce for the 
pudding was made with strawberries picked in summer and frozen. After this came 
Christmas cookies and blotkake.  
</P>
<P>
 In Norway, the main Christmas celebration is Dec. 24. The night of the 23rd, 
rice porridge is set out for Santa's helpers, who show their appreciation by 
leaving stockings filled with small gifts for the children. Nilsen remembers 
getting treats like chocolate, tangerines and apples, a small doll or coloring 
book. "This was a little something to keep us quiet in the morning," she says. 
Parents were then free to work on the main festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is Nilsen's recipe for blotkake. Although the cake sounds fragile with 
its billows of whipped cream, it can be stored overnight in the refrigerator, 
emerging mellow and moist the next day. In this recipe, be sure to use potato 
flour, which is available in health food stores, and not potato starch. LIV 
NILSEN'S BLOTKAKE 
</P>
<P>
 5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 3/4 cups cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon potato flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 Margarine 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 (16-ounce) can apricots 
</P>
<P>
 Sliced kiwi 
</P>
<P>
 Raspberries or other berries 
</P>
<P>
 In electric mixer, beat eggs with 1 scant cup sugar 20 to 25 minutes, until 
very light. Meanwhile, sift cake flour, potato flour and baking powder together 
in mixing bowl 5 times. Then sift 1 more time into beaten egg mixture. Fold in 
gently with spatula, cutting to bottom of bowl to mix thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Grease 10-inch deep round cake pan with non-stick cooking spray or melted 
margarine. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes, 
until tester comes out clean. Do not open oven door before 35 minutes. Turn off 
heat and leave cake in oven with door open 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven 
and invert in pan onto cooling rack. Let stand until completely cooled, then 
remove from pan. 
</P>
<P>
 With sharp knife, cut cake horizontally into 3 layers. Sprinkle 2 layers with 
fluid cream until moist. Whip remaining cream with 1/4 cup sugar, or more to 
taste, until stiff. Drain apricots thoroughly. Puree in food processor or 
blender. Place 1 moistened cake layer on platter. Spread with apricot puree and 
cover with whipped cream. Place second moistened layer on top. Spread with 
apricot puree and cover with whipped cream. Place remaining layer on top. Cover 
cake with most of remaining whipped cream, leaving some for decoration. Pipe 
reserved cream on in puffs or other design. Decorate with kiwi slices and 
raspberries. Makes 12 servings.

YOU BUTTERNUT POUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To save time when making this soup, use peeled, uncooked butternut squash 
halves (many supermarkets package squash this way). To reduce calories, use 
sausage made partly with turkey. COLD-WEATHER BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND SAUSAGE SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 8 cups peeled, diced butternut squash 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf, broken in half 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 to 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound light kielbasa, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh thyme sprigs, optional 
</P>
<P>
 In large, heavy pan heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat. When hot, 
add onions. Stir and cook about 4 minutes. Add diced squash and stir and cook 3 
to 4 minutes more. Add thyme, salt, bay leaf and stock. Bring mixture to boil. 
Lower heat and simmer, uncovered, until squash is very tender, 35 to 40 
minutes. Remove bay leaf pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove soup from heat and puree in food processor, blender or food mill. Stir 
in 3/4 cup milk. Adjust seasonings to taste. Soup can be made 1 to 2 days 
ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated. Reheat when needed. If soup seems too 
thick, add remaining milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving, heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy, medium-size 
skillet over medium heat. Add kielbasa slices and cook, stirring constantly, 
until kielbasa slices are lightly browned and somewhat crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Remove and drain on paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladle soup into 6 soup bowls. Garnish each serving with several slices of 
kielbasa and thyme sprig. Makes 6 servings.

THE SQUASH IN WINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In summer, orange is the refreshing color of juice -- translucent and 
quenching. In autumn, it's the color of corn, falling leaves and a fat harvest 
moon slung low in the sky, glossy and glimmering. In winter, the color orange 
is deep and thick, like a stroke of artist's oil slathered on with a palette 
knife, warm and comforting. It's the color of long-roasted winter squashes 
intensified by slow cooking that softens the tough skin with its splattering of 
winter green, gray, white and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking winter squashes is a patient task, for ideally they want to be cooked 
in a dry-heat atmosphere. When you boil them, flavor, texture and color dilute. 
Even puree of squash soups have more flavor if you bake a whole squash until 
tender and then give it a briefer second cooking with onions and stock. 
Although it's possible to add interest to the vegetable with butter and spices, 
the subtle (bland?) flavor of winter squashes is better coaxed by a slow 
cooking that breaks down the fibers, releases the water and concentrates the 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Something indescribably creamy happens to squash when you keep it away from 
liquid until it softens. Boiled or steamed squash becomes soggy and 
thin-textured, a color orange that you can almost see through, more suited to a 
summer fruit than to a winter vegetable. The opaque orange color of a baked 
winter squash hints at the creamy mouth-feel of the vegetable and predicts the 
soothing flavor that is to come. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Similar magic is attained by chunks of peeled squash sweating in butter or oil 
in a heavy skillet. Cook, covered, either in the oven or on top of the stove. 
Remove the cover during the last 10 to 15 minutes to allow the vegetable's 
moisture to escape. Grilling is one of the best methods, especially for slabs 
of banana squash. Improvise a cover and grill over coals that are not too hot. 
The squash takes on a smoky, caramelized flavor. BANANA SQUASH IN CREAM WITH 
APPLES AND BACON 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds banana squash 
</P>
<P>
 5 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and cut into 8 sections 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Dash nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Use small knife or vegetable peeler to peel rind off squash. Cut squash into 
1-inch cubes. Place squash, bacon, oil, onion and garlic in casserole or lidded 
baking dish. Bake, covered, at 375 degrees 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, heat butter in skillet over medium heat. Add apples and saute until 
golden, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 When squash is tender, transfer mixture to skillet with apples. Place over 
medium-high heat. Add cream, nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until 
cream thickens. Spoon into serving bowl and serve immediately. Makes 4 to 6 
servings. RAGOUT OF WINTER VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
 2 acorn squash 
</P>
<P>
 1 small celeriac, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium carrot, cut into 1-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, cut into 8 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 4 Brussels sprouts, trimmed, outer leaves discarded and sprouts cut into 
squares 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dried sage 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon walnut oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sour cream 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce acorn squash with fork and place in baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees 
until tender when pierced with fork, about 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, combine celeriac, carrot, onion, Brussels sprouts, sage, salt, 
pepper and walnut oil in oven-proof skillet. Bake, covered, at 375 degrees 30 
minutes. Stir in flour. Bake, uncovered, until vegetables are tender, about 10 
minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer skillet to stove top. Add broth and cook over medium heat, stirring, 
until mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter. Remove from heat. Stir 
in sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove squash from oven. Halve lengthwise and scoop out seeds. To serve, 
arrange squash on plates, cut side up, and spoon vegetable ragout into squash 
halves. Makes 4 servings.

 Succotash, from the Narragansett word for "ear of corn," is a 
catch-as-catch-can recipe comprised of seasonal ingredients on hand. In summer, 
succotash was made with summer squashes, fresh beans and fresh young summer 
corn, much like the familiar succotash of corn and lima beans that we buy 
frozen or canned and that kids generally dislike. Winter versions were probably 
restricted to dried beans, dried peppers, winter squashes and gourds and dried 
corn. Serve warm tortillas instead of bread with this dinner soup.

 1 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup canned hominy corn (posole) 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium butternut squash 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 Place lima beans in pan with water to cover and soak overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 When ready to cook, heat oil in pan. Add onion and cook, stirring 
occasionally, 5 minutes. Add stock, drained lima beans, thyme, rosemary, salt 
and white pepper. Cook, covered, over low heat 1 hour. Add hominy corn and cook 
until limas are tender, about 5 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 While lima beans are cooking, pierce butternut squash in several places with 
fork and place on baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees until tender when pierced 
with fork, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut squash in half lengthwise. Discard seeds. Scoop out flesh and coarsely cut 
into medium chunks. Stir lima bean mixture into squash. Stir in butter. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Makes 4 servings.

THE GINGER WOMAN

 Perhaps only a serious ginger lover like me would want to serve all the 
following dishes at one meal -- the salmon is the only course in the menu that 
doesn't contain ginger. But I confess that when I've made this meal, I have 
been known to sneak some grated ginger into the salmon marinade too. Obviously, 
I am a ginger addict. SOY-MARINATED SALMON STEAKS 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dark sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
 Dash crushed red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 salmon steaks, 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 Combine soy sauce, garlic, sesame oil and red pepper on plate and stir with 
fork to blend. Add salmon steaks and rub gently on both sides with soy mixture. 
Marinate 15 to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Broil salmon steaks, or grill until lightly browned on both sides, about 5 
minutes per side, depending on heat of grill. To oven-bake, place salmon on 
baking sheet and bake at 450 degrees 10 to 12 minutes. To test for doneness, 
make slit in center of 1 steak. Salmon is cooked when flesh turns from 
translucent to opaque at center. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For minced or thin-sliced ginger root, peel off the light tan outside layer 
with a paring knife. When a recipe calls for grated ginger, peeling usually 
isn't necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 BROCCOLI AND CARROTS WITH GINGER 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch broccoli, trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 carrots, cut into 1/2-inch diagonals 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon thin strips fresh peeled ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion tops 
</P>
<P>
 Place steaming basket in large deep skillet over 1 inch water. Bring water to 
boil. Add broccoli and carrots. Cook, covered, until tender-crisp, about 5 
minutes. Remove steaming basket from skillet. Discard water and wipe skillet 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Reheat skillet over medium heat until hot enough to evaporate 1 drop of water 
upon contact. Add oil, ginger root and garlic. Cook and stir until ginger 
sizzles, about 20 seconds. Add broccoli and carrots and stir-fry over high heat 
until coated and heated through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt. 
Sprinkle with green onion tops before serving. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: To make thin strips of ginger root, cut into paper-thin slices, then 
stack 2 to 3 slices together and cut through into thin strips. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For this simple dessert (it only takes a few seconds to chop fresh ginger in 
the food processor), you have to make the ginger syrup one day in advance. But 
if you didn't think ahead that far, you can still make a ginger dessert by 
topping vanilla ice cream with chopped crystallized ginger or stem ginger in 
syrup.  
</P>
<P>
 GINGER AND LEMON ICE 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup finely chopped fresh ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Combine water and sugar in saucepan. Heat, stirring, until water boils and 
sugar is dissolved. Stir in ginger root and bring to boil. Remove from heat. 
Let stand, covered, about 1 hour. Strain mixture, pressing down on ginger to 
extract as much flavor as possible. Cover and chill overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir lemon juice into syrup. Pour syrup into shallow pan and place in freezer. 
Stir every 30 minutes or until mixture is almost frozen solid. Transfer to food 
processor and puree until smooth. Transfer to plastic freezer container and 
keep mixture frozen until ready to serve. Spoon into dessert dishes. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: This ice is delicious served with sliced fresh strawberries.

COMFORT FOOD AND LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CARROLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baked pasta dishes have always been a comfort food for me; my favorite dish 
when I was growing up was baked macaroni and cheese. It would probably occur to 
very few people that such food can also be simple, luscious and -- with the 
right ingredients -- essentially lean. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned to make baked pasta dishes at the hands of Nona, the Italian 
grandmother-in-law I inherited by marriage. Nona's signature dish was lasagna, 
a common pasta in America's culinary melting pot. Everything was made from 
scratch: homemade noodles, two different sauces, vegetables, even cheeses. It 
was a wonderful dish, but one that took hours of kitchen time and came out 
hefty -- probably due to the liberal splashes of olive oil and the creamy 
whole-milk cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 I have since pared down Nona's recipes to meet my busy schedule and preference 
for low-fat food. I've slimmed down the hearty sauces by using broth or wines 
instead of oil; and all my baked pasta dishes now use low-fat cheeses. The only 
thing that hasn't changed is the rave reviews from my family as they tuck in to 
a hearty dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nona would have been aghast at the thought, but baked pastas are perfect to 
make in quantity and freeze for later use. Simply assemble the pasta dish and 
cover tightly with three layers of plastic wrap pressed down onto the top. 
Freeze as is, before baking. Let the pasta thaw overnight in the refrigerator 
before following the baking instructions in the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This macaroni and cheese is a lighter version of my childhood favorite, but 
still rich and creamy .  
</P>
<P>
 LIGHTER MACARONI AND CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup defatted broth or white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup unbleached white flour 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups low-fat milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Dash cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound elbow macaroni, cooked al dente and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup shredded low-fat or fat-free Cheddar cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup reduced-fat ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup fresh bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil and broth to bubbling in saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to 
medium. Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly, 2 minutes without 
browning. Add milk in slow, steady stream, whisking to incorporate. Increase 
heat and bring sauce to boil, whisking. Add mustard, cayenne and salt and 
pepper to taste. Cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss together cooked macaroni, cheeses and sauce in large bowl. Transfer 
mixture to lightly oiled shallow baking dish. Top with bread crumbs. Bake at 
350 degrees until bread crumbs are light-brown and sauce is bubbling, 30 
minutes. Let cool slightly before serving. Makes 8 servings.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; THIS FILIPINA EDUCATOR 
SAYS, 'SPEAK UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The word in the Filipino language of Tagalog is hiya, and it describes an 
innate shyness of the Filipino people. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmencita Davino readily uses the word to describe her fellow Filipinos. But 
it does not describe Davino, the director of the Asian-Pacific American 
Education Commission for the Los Angeles Unified School District, the first 
Filipino American to head the 20-year-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm different," said Davino, who came to Los Angeles in 1981 to finish her 
postdoctoral work as a linguist. "I'm bicultural, and that's something very 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Davino is an outgoing person who this holiday season has been giving visitors 
to her Downtown office red roses made of wood, chocolate-covered espresso beans 
and paper scrolls bearing little tips for living -- everything from "Take 
Grandma to lunch" to "Give an unexpected kiss" to "Say something nice to 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 A pianist who also is finishing her first novel, Davino came to the United 
States in 1981. To make it in America, she understood, she had to drop her 
cultural shyness -- her hiya. Now, as head of the commission, she is trying to 
help Filipino students and their parents do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Davino, an Encino resident for 10 years, was a bilingual instructor at Valerio 
Street Elementary School in Van Nuys three years ago when she heard that the 
commission job was open. She applied quietly without telling her principal 
about it, not allowing herself to believe she might get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Her principal, a bit surprised, gave her the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy," Davino said. "I was ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the job as director fulfilled not only her personal ambitions, but 
gave Davino a bigger role in promoting multiculturalism and a positive image 
for the Philippines. She had already been doing that as a teacher, bringing 
music and the culture of her homeland into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the commission, Davino has taught other teachers about the 
Philippines, a country "born in the East and reared in the West." It had been 
occupied by Spain for 300 years before being captured by the United States, 
then by the Japanese, then recaptured and eventually given its independence. It 
is a country in which men and women have more equality than in many other 
cultures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Filipinos who come here are generally well-educated and speak English, 
they are mainstreamed into American culture easily, she said, although they 
sometimes lose their cultural identity in the process. For example, there is no 
identifiable Filipino neighborhood in Los Angeles, like that of the other Asian 
communities of Chinatown, Little Tokyo or Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 She would like to see more Filipinos in decision-making positions within the 
school district. She can count other Filipinos in positions of importance on 
one hand, but there may be a cultural reason for that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Filipinos are very family-oriented," said Davino, explaining that 
some may not try for the better jobs because of their shyness. She does not let 
that hold her back "because I know this is how the culture works." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Filipinos must learn how to function equally well in both cultures, she 
said. It's a message she carries to Filipino groups, speaking English but also 
making sure to speak Tagalog "so they know you are with them." Using that 
bilingual example as a starting point, she can guide them and explain how they 
can be more successful in America. 
</P>
<P>
 She calls it "sociolinguistic fluency," an ability not only to speak a 
language but to work with the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of a quiet Asian elementary school student. Perhaps the 
youth doesn't understand the classwork but won't ask the teacher questions 
because silence is a way of showing respect in Filipino culture. The teacher 
might never know, Davino said, that the student simply doesn't understand the 
lesson. The student, meanwhile, may never know that it's OK to speak up. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the commission, Davino also works to overcome what she calls myths 
of minorities, such as all Asians are smart, hard-working and well off. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurts the Asian minorities," Davino said. "A lot of Asians are poor. Not 
all Asians are good in math."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library will stay open late through February to 
accommodate an overwhelming number of visitors coming to see its World War II 
exhibit, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library near Simi Valley will be open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week 
until Feb. 28, when "World War II: Personal Accounts" closes, said Richard 
Norton Smith, library director. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said attendance has tripled since Dec. 3, when the exhibit opened with 
artifacts ranging from Douglas MacArthur's corncob pipe and Hitler's will to 
soldiers' wartime diaries and letters home from the front.

AROUND THE VALLEY: CHRISTIAN SCIENCE ROOM VISITORS STOP TO SIT, PERHAPS SNOOZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are often squeezed between small shops on a busy boulevard, a storefront 
nook with a window displaying a daily Bible lesson, pages of the Christian 
Science Monitor newspaper and a sign welcoming visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the frenzy of holiday shopping, it might seem a good spot to rest for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 But how many people actually go into a Christian Science Reading Room? And 
what do they find? 
</P>
<P>
 If figures on usage are available, the Church of Christ, Scientist -- the 
Boston-based denomination's formal name -- isn't revealing them. Christian 
Science, which teaches healing through prayer rather than by medical means, 
also declines to release membership figures, following the wishes of its 
19th-Century founder, Mary Baker Eddy. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent unguided tour of a half-dozen reading rooms in the San Fernando 
Valley found volunteer attendants either unwilling or unable to discuss the 
volume of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In all six rooms visited, however, at least one person dropped by on the 20 to 
30 occasions I visited. Some were church members buying church magazines; 
others simply walked in to read the Monitor or church literature without 
talking to the attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ask people if they are Christian Scientists," said Leorma Lester, an 
attendant at the Northridge reading room on Reseda Boulevard across from 
Chili's restaurant. "If they want to ask questions, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "One man comes in regularly and reads while eating his lunch. I don't know who 
he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, food and drink is verboten with most reading room attendants, including 
Sylvia Alderman, the librarian for the Van Nuys reading room just off Van Nuys 
Boulevard on Sylvan Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a library -- you wouldn't walk in with food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Van Nuys reading room might benefit from loosening up a 
little. Open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Saturday, it seems perfect 
for a lunchtime break for people with business at the nearby Valley Civic 
Center. But few barristers or bureaucrats come by. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there ever days when no one at all drops by? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every congregation is required by the denomination to operate a reading room. 
As the May, 1992, issue of the Christian Science Journal notes, "reading rooms 
were popular in Mrs. Eddy's day" in hotels, on ocean liners and in train 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Church leadership, while faithful to the founder's century-old dictates, has 
encouraged local librarians to update reading rooms with computers and VCRs as 
well as children's literature and tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical reading room has a front section where one can purchase church 
literature, including a new edition of Eddy's "Science and Health With Key to 
the Scriptures," the church's basic text first published in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
 The back section has chairs of varying comfort, writing desks, shelves of 
biblical reference works, church journals and copies of the Christian Science 
Monitor, the church-owned national newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The better-endowed reading rooms sport a personal computer to research Bible 
verses and a television to watch videotaped Bible lessons. But the poor 
location, and lack of electronic aids, of some rooms reflect a decline in 
Christian Science membership since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Science has also been hurt financially by ambitious but unsuccessful 
cable TV ventures in the 1980s. In recent decades, churches in Tujunga, San 
Fernando, Pacoima-Panorama City and the 2nd Church in Glendale have folded as 
the demographics of the East Valley changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent closing was the North Hollywood congregation on Morrison 
Street west of Lankershim Boulevard. The sign on the building today, written 
mostly in Korean, identifies it as a Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone directories list a reading room in the Magnolia Park section of 
Burbank, but a "For Rent" sign hangs on the door there. A church spokesman said 
the sponsoring congregation has relocated the room to its church property in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading room visibility to traffic and pedestrians is deemed important, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino reading room, a half-block north of Ventura Boulevard, has 
experienced a dropoff of visitors since the Northridge earthquake closed the U. 
S. Post Office next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills church leadership is currently debating whether to rent 
space in a mall or build a room in front of its church on a residential street. 
Its reading room is now behind the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest Valley reading room is at 12360 Ventura Blvd. in Studio City. "We 
own this building and have been here since 1962," said Susan Carr of North 
Hollywood, spraying the front section with an orange-scented air freshener. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has the longest hours -- 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. most days -- and a plush carpet 
rather than the utilitarian carpeting found in most reading rooms. The yellow 
carpet looked so inviting to one jobless young woman once that she stretched 
out on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'My back hurts,' " said Carr, sympathetically. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading rooms occasionally attract visitors who simply want to use the 
restroom, get change for a parking meter or to snooze -- showing little 
interest in Christian Science or Bible study. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping a balance between tolerance and firmness is a task for attendants at 
the Studio City reading room and at another red-brick-faced facility on North 
Brand Boulevard in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them are homeless, but they can stay as long as they want," said 
volunteer Sylvia Hollenbeck at the Glendale reading room.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are cold. They get comfortable and warm, so I have to wake up 
some of them."

JUST HOW POOR CAN SPORT BE?; PLAYERS: SIGNING OF JEFFERIES BY PHILLIES, 
ACQUISITION OF MCDOWELL BY YANKEES GO AGAINST LAWS OF ECONOMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They keep telling us the game of baseball is in financial trouble, and after 
the labor talks collapsed Wednesday, we're supposed to be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on the day the players and owners finally came to an agreement -- that a 
resolution is hopeless -- the game of baseball fired a fastball that landed 
between the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Phillies, after crying they must slash their payroll, signed 
free agent Gregg Jefferies of the St. Louis Cardinals to a four-year, 
$20-million contract. They even gave him a comprehensive no-trade clause, 
meaning he will remain with the team until the fall of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies also signed pitcher Tommy Greene for $2 million and Curt 
Schilling for $2.3 million. The two pitchers combined for four victories last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Yankee principal owner George Steinbrenner, who has been strangely 
silent throughout the strike, once again showed little concern for any budget 
constraints by trading for Jack McDowell of the Chicago White Sox. The Yankees 
must tender McDowell a contract of at least $5.83 million, while sending minor 
league pitcher Keith Heberling and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 And, then, of course, in the last few days the Cardinals signed free-agent 
pitcher Danny Jackson to a three-year, $10.8-million contract; the Texas 
Rangers paid $6 million over two seasons to free-agent pitcher Kevin Gross, and 
the Angels gave free-agent closer Lee Smith a two-year, $4-million contract 
when everyone else refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners are absolutely insulting the fans' intelligence," player-agent 
Tony Attanasio said. "How any fan in the world can stand behind these people 
and believe these people is beyond comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, how more hypocritical can they get. It's a joke. It's a farce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the owners really think they can say they're losing money and continue to 
sign players like they have been? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think these owners aren't dumb, but I really think they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of signings the last few days, agents say, is prompted by the fear 
that owners will implement a salary cap today and a new set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-agent market will not only become flooded, driving down prices, but 
the owners could also eliminate guaranteed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But while that might explain the agents' inducement to sign contracts, it 
hardly is justifiable for a group of owners who canceled the World Series in 
the name of cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure doesn't look like there's much of a change, does there?" said Fred 
Claire, Dodger executive vice president. "I'm not sure our words match our 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having to make extremely tough decisions because of our tremendous loss 
of revenue. Regardless of the system there is, or will be there, the fact is 
there's a certain budget I have to operate under. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you look around, and fundamentally I don't think there has been a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I'm not saying teams are wrong for 
what they're doing, it just has people confused. I know I can't figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, no one prospered more this week than Jefferies, who appeared to 
have made a mistake this summer by rejecting a four-year, $20-million contract 
from the Cardinals. The season ended, the Cardinals pulled their offer, and 
Jefferies was running out of options. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jefferies was kicking himself, wondering if he had become the Jody Reed 
of '95, along came the Phillies to the rescue. Reed had rejected a three-year, 
$7.8-million offer from the Dodgers, only to end up signing a one-year contract 
with the Milwaukee Brewers for $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies lost Jackson to the Cardinals two days earlier, so to get even, 
they signedJefferies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people are saying the market for him would have gone down (today)," 
Phillie General Manager Lee Thomas said. "Maybe it would have. But I'm not that 
good to make that prediction." 
</P>
<P>
 Just think, perhaps by the end of today, those kind of decisions will be 
eliminated. There will be a salary cap imposed, ending the wild, wild days of 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe the game has come to this," said Buzzie Bavasi, former 
Dodger and Angel general manager. "I've never seen a player grab an owner by 
the throat and demand a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our days, we had a budget. Nowadays, they keep spending money until they 
force themselves to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, if all businesses ran their business like baseball, we'd all be 
buying Russian warbonds."

MCNALL PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD; JURISPRUDENCE: FORMER KING OWNER ADMITS TO FOUR 
CRIMINAL COUNTS IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Bruce McNall, who as owner of the Kings lured Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles and 
hockey fans to the Forum, pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to four 
criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing stoically before U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Paez, McNall 
repeated the word "guilty" four times, his first public admission that he broke 
federal banking laws by defrauding financial institutions out of more than $236 
million largely by convincing them he was worth much more than he really was. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning on a lectern with his hands folded, McNall stood quietly alongside his 
lawyer, Tom Pollack, for about 30 minutes as Asst. U.S. Atty. Peter S. Spivack 
outlined a 10-year history of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges included creating phony financial statements for lenders as early as 
1984, supplying fake coin inventories to secure loans, diverting millions from 
a Merrill Lynch coin fund and King ticket proceeds and even listing dead horses 
as collateral. Allegations also include improperly pledging a horse he owned 
with Gretzky to a bank without telling the King superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's plea, the result of a 10-month investigation, was to two counts of 
bank fraud, and one count each of wire fraud and conspiracy. Paez tentatively 
set July 6 as McNall's sentencing date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McNall, 44, faces a maximum sentence of 45 years, he won't do 
anywhere near that amount of time. Sources close to the case say his sentence 
will probably range from three to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall made small talk in the courtroom with reporters before the hearing 
began. He spoke about hockey's lockout. Looking at one of the three courtroom 
artists who were there to sketch him, McNall said: "I hope he gets a good 
sketch of me. Maybe just full front would be best." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall is free on $100,000 bail, which was put up Dec. 9 by King executive and 
goalie legend Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, McNall officially gave up his title of president of the Kings 
after his plea, although he will continue to work for the team as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of his contract, his $650,000 annual salary will be trimmed to 
$487,500, with payments scheduled to be made until 2001. He technically remains 
a minority owner in the club, although his 28% stake is now under the control 
of the trustee in his U.S. Bankruptcy Court case and is expected eventually to 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's plea further accentuates the dramatic fall of a man who earlier this 
year was arguably the most powerful owner in professional hockey and an 
autograph-signing celebrity in his own right, mingling regularly with movie 
stars and politicians. Since May, McNall has sold a majority interest in the 
team, sought shelter from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court and pleaded guilty 
to the four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall declined to discuss his plea with reporters, but released a statement 
in which he said that he is taking full responsibility for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that my actions were wrong," he said, "but I proceeded anyway, in a 
misguided effort to try to resolve the increasingly severe financial problems 
resulting from businesses in which I participated." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he intended to repay his debts: "In my own naive thinking, I was 
hoping to buy enough time to pay back the loans, but it was a race that I 
ultimately lost." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall said he remains proud of many things he has done, including making 
hockey popular in parts of the United States, "but that cannot make up for the 
remorse I feel for the misguided actions that brought me to this point today." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall is said to face about nine years currently, although the amount can be 
reduced. Sources close to McNall say his lawyers are hoping they can trim his 
sentence to three to five years. Getting the sentence under five years would be 
critical to efforts to get McNall into a minimum security prison. 
</P>
<P>
 One key to reducing the sentence will be showing that McNall is responsible 
for less than $80 million in losses suffered by the six banks listed in the 
criminal charges. In addition, he can reduce that loss figure through 
prospective business deals that would help pay creditors. He also is expected 
to argue that the bankers share blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise amount of losses McNall can be blamed for is difficult to figure 
at this point, sources say. Creditors -- mainly banks -- have filed well over 
$200 million in claims, but McNall disputes some of those. The largest claim is 
$123 million filed by the Dutch unit of the French bank Credit Lyonnais, an 
amount McNall has disputed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, McNall has agreed to fully cooperate with prosecutors, who are 
expected to ask him about matters including his business dealings with some of 
his bankers; the operations of companies he invested in, such as film producer 
Gladden Entertainment, and the activities of the executives who worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's stunning fall is unprecedented in hockey circles, as well as in 
sports. In 1953, Fred Saigh Jr. was forced to sell the St. Louis Cardinals 
baseball team after he pleaded no contest to two counts of federal tax evasion. 
The Yankees' George Steinbrenner was suspended by baseball commissioner Bowie 
Kuhn in 1974 for two years after Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to a charge of 
making an illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon, but was later 
pardoned by President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey's image has been tarnished, not only by McNall's problems but also by a 
32-count federal indictment against former union leader R. Alan Eagleson. 
Previously, the late Toronto Maple Leaf owner Harold Ballard was convicted and 
served time in prison in Ontario in October, 1972, on charges of income tax 
evasion, fraud and theft of Maple Leaf Garden funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, lawyer and businessman Thomas K. Scallen, who controlled 70% of the 
Vancouver Canucks through the Medical Investment Corporation in Minneapolis, 
served prison time after being convicted of submitting a false prospectus and 
the theft of $3 million from Northwest Sports Enterprises, Ltd., the corporate 
title of the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hourlong hearing, McNall was driven away in Pollack's car. Before 
leaving, the normally talkative McNall, who once never passed up an opportunity 
to be quoted, said: "It's hard for me not to be able to respond. I'll have to 
go along with what my attorney said."

JIM MURRAY: AGAJANIAN KICKED FOOTBALL INTO AGE OF SPECIALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1974, when pro football moved the goal posts from the goal line to the end 
line and ruled that missed field-goal attempts returned to the original line of 
scrimmage, they should have called it the "Agajanian Rule." 
</P>
<P>
 You see, in the early days of the game, the placekick was not really an 
option. The college game was largely given over to the drop kick as a scoring 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros had placekickers, but largely for extra points. And the placekickers 
were not specialists. They had to play a position. The Bears' Jack Manders and 
the Giants' Ward Cuff were all-league running backs. Bob Waterfield and George 
Blanda were Hall of Fame quarterbacks. Don Hutson, the Green Bay immortal, used 
to lead the league in placekicking and pass-receiving annually. Even Lou (the 
Toe) Groza, who kicked through more than 1,300 points, had to play offensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Agajanian was the first specialist. Early in his career, which began in 
the late '30s, he, too, had to play in the regular lineup. A few broken arms 
and legs convinced him it was a waste of manpower. He managed to convince 
coaching staffs that it was as big a mistake as making the quarterback play 
cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. Coaches are traditionalists, often anchored to the past. 
"Coaches like Jim Phelan told me, 'You're excess baggage. We can't afford to 
pay a guy to just sit around and kick a field goal now and then.' I was making 
$200 a game at the time," Agajanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 His retort: "Some day, you will." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tell those guys, 'Some day the kicking game will become the most 
important part of it. You won't be able to believe you were ever dumb enough to 
have your kicker making tackles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian roamed the rosters as a kicker. He played for 13 teams, ranging from 
the old L.A. Dons of the All-America Conference to the Steelers, Giants, Lions, 
Packers, Cowboys, Dallas Texans, Rams, Chargers and Raiders. He often played 
for an AFL team one week and an NFL team the next. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't any role model that made him a kicker. It was a freight elevator. It 
made him a star when he was riding down it one day at the University of New 
Mexico in 1939. His right foot was hanging over the edge and, when it 
encountered a jutting piece of floor, his toes were sliced off. When the 
surgeon was sewing up what was left after the amputation, Agajanian asked, 
"Will I be able to kick again?" and the doctor's response was, "What will you 
do with the cane?" The answer meant he would be lucky to walk with that foot, 
never mind kick footballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian didn't believe it. He had a special shoe made, square at the toes, 
and he became the best kicker in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 He chafed at the coaches' insistence he be an all-purpose player. He found the 
owners more enlightened and, finally, Wellington Mara of the Giants not only 
agreed he didn't have to play, but let him fly in for the game from his 
California business on weekends and fly out again after the game. The kicker as 
specialist really began with Agajanian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won a lot of games for them," he said. "In those days, the 50-yard kick was 
kind of a mental barrier. I used to compute the maximum range by the 
atmospheric conditions. The coach, Jim Lee Howell, used to ask me 
sarcastically, 'What's your range today?' Then, I kicked a 50-yarder to beat 
Washington. I came in and told Jim Lee, 'It's 50 today, Jim.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Agajanian: "About this time, Lou Groza comes up to me and says, 'How much 
money you getting for just kicking?' and I told him '$4,000.' So Lou says, 
'That's what I'm getting for getting nosebleeds.' He went to management and 
became a pure kicker." 
</P>
<P>
 When the coaches finally wised up that kicking was critical, they began 
importing soccer-style European sidewinders. The Americans largely resented 
this. They wanted an immediate tightening of the immigration laws, but 
Agajanian welcomed the new technicians. "Anybody could see that was the way to 
kick," he said. "They got more velocity in the ball and therefore more 
distance. They were almost punting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had come full circle. In the early days when they changed the 
configuration of the ball to make passing easier, the dropkick was phased out. 
But when I used to scream and holler that everybody one day was going to have a 
kicker, they laughed at me." 
</P>
<P>
 No one's laughing anymore. The kicking game, like the 10-pound gorilla who 
grew up, took over the establishment. Something like seven of 10 games were 
decided by kicks. Games and championships were being won by guys who didn't 
even need to wear shoulder pads. It got so unwieldy they had to move the goal 
posts and modify the rules to keep it from devaluing the touchdown altogether. 
Agajanian's prediction became all too true. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Energizer bunny, Agajanian kept on kicking till he was 45. He piled 
up 655 points, not counting All-America Conference points. "And, remember, that 
wasn't kicking off carpets or in domed stadiums!" he said. "That was out of 
mud, slush, snow, places where they didn't cut the grass, where there wasn't 
any grass to cut and on fields where the hash marks weren't cut in 23 yards, 1 
foot from the sidelines. Sometimes, we had to kick from almost the sideline 
marker. You had to make the ball go at right angles." 
</P>
<P>
 He was rewarded with a nickname: "Bootin' Ben" Agajanian. Of all the 
field-goal specialists who came after, he and Groza are among the few with 
nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 Groza's in the Hall of Fame. Agajanian, who is the nearest thing to a patron 
saint the kicking game boasts, isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 His shoes are there. Maybe, the rest of him should be too.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; AMONG MCNALL'S CRIMES WAS BETRAYING OUR TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We got taken in. Played for suckers. Hoodwinked. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL executives, fans and reporters too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall fooled us, but we were willing accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
 With his open checkbook and his glamorous Hollywood connections, McNall 
charmed us into believing that he would popularize hockey and lift it above the 
tired "I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out" jokes. He would 
legitimize the sport and, by extension, legitimize those who write about it or 
follow it. Hockey wouldn't be a cult sport anymore. We'd all benefit. Why 
wouldn't we believe him? 
</P>
<P>
 We marveled at his Horatio Alger-like success story, laughed at his jokes, 
praised his openness and declared him an example of the young, hip owner the 
NHL needed. As it had seduced us, his lavish spending seduced the NHL's Board 
of Governors, who elected him their chairman and made him one of the league's 
most powerful figures.  
</P>
<P>
 The governors believed in him because they believed in his money. We believed 
in him because he amused us and because we wanted to think the American dream 
could still come true. It sounded so terrific, the story of a kid who parlayed 
a passion for ancient coins into a multimillion-dollar empire. Why look to see 
if there were strings attached when he seemed to be flying so high? 
</P>
<P>
 None of us looked closely enough. Not the folks who ran the NHL then -- and 
who have since gone on to their own just punishments -- and not us. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall did what many of us fantasize about if we win the lottery or come into 
an inheritance: He bought his favorite sports team. He was us, or what we 
envision ourselves becoming if we're lucky. He made his fortune. He didn't 
inherit a team and hire caretakers to run it while he sunned himself on his 
yacht. He was out there, talking to fans and players and having a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 We marveled at his business sense when he sweet-talked NHL executives into 
giving him an incredible deal when the Mighty Ducks joined the league last 
season. Of the Ducks' $50-million expansion fee, he pocketed half -- reportedly 
including $12.5 million payable immediately. He also got a fat consultant's fee 
for bringing Disney's dollars into the NHL's treasure chest. No one ever got 
such favorable indemnification terms when an expansion team entered his 
territory -- or was paid so quickly. We thought it was shrewd negotiating. 
We've since realized it was a desperate move to keep himself afloat 
financially. All it did was postpone the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't polished. He spoke too loud and too much, but he was brash and 
funny, and we thought he was the best thing to happen to hockey since frozen 
pucks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we all felt betrayed when McNall pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiracy, one count of wire fraud and two counts of bank fraud, for which he 
probably will spend three to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 How did it come to this? He had so much. Why did he need to lie and cheat to 
get more? 
</P>
<P>
 He was juggling so many balls -- a movie company, a coin company, a football 
team, a hockey team -- some had to crash, just as his lies came home. What 
began as embellishments of his educational background became fabrications, and 
those grew up to be lies. Those became attempts to defraud, as he admitted in 
the plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 We probably should have seen this coming. We didn't want to look. And the NHL, 
before the Gary Bettman regime, was too busy to look because it was counting 
the money King merchandising brought in. At least Bettman, barely a year after 
taking the job, realized the extent of McNall's entanglements and took steps to 
ensure the future of the franchise was not compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 The men who saved McNall's stake in the Kings, Joe Cohen and Jeffrey Sudikoff, 
are also trying to save what's left of his reputation. That qualifies as a true 
act of loyalty, considering McNall did everything he could to alienate them 
before the sale was completed, including bad-mouthing them and concealing from 
them the depth of his financial abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen tells anyone who will listen that McNall has done much for hockey in Los 
Angeles and for the NHL. McNall brought Wayne Gretzky here, which in turn 
brought hockey enough popularity to ensure the success of the Ducks. Don't 
forget that, Cohen says. The media, he says, only talked about negatives. 
Remember the good deeds McNall has done. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, that won't wash. In no way can the media -- the messengers -- take the 
blame. McNall lied. He defrauded banks. This was not a man stealing food to 
feed his starving family. This was a man feeding his voracious ego and his need 
to feel important.  
</P>
<P>
 And this is a man who, given ample chance to show remorse, has yet to say the 
word sorry . Oh, it wasn't his fault, he says, it was his associates who led 
him astray. Hog the glory and shift the blame, that's McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have even the slightest inclination to pity him, realize that you're 
going to pay for his sins. Banks that lost money on bad loans to McNall will 
try to make it up on higher fees to their customers and higher mortgage and 
loan rates. They will pay you a lower interest rate on your savings account or 
less of a dividend if you happen to own their stock. Remember that when you 
judge McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 One count of conspiracy, one count of wire fraud and two counts of bank fraud. 
What the court documents don't say is that Bruce McNall is also guilty of 
betraying our trust. And there's no penance grave enough to atone for that.

 Baseball's doomsday scenario is about to become reality. The final attempt to 
reach a negotiated settlement in the four-month-old bargaining dispute before 
the owners declare an impasse ended in failure Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are scheduled to meet in Chicago today and implement a new economic 
system that includes a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation is about to replace negotiation. The National Labor Relations Board 
has already been heard from. General counsel Fred Feinstein notified the two 
sides Wednesday that the NLRB will issue two complaints against the owners -- 
involving failure to negotiate in good faith and discrimination against union 
members -- for failing to make an Aug. 1 payment of $7.8 million to the union's 
pension fund from All-Star game receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Union lawyer Doyle Pryor, referring to the likelihood that the players will 
return to the NLRB to charge that the owners also failed to bargain in good 
faith during the sporadic talks of the last four months, called the pension 
complaint significant.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we have to file another charge, it will already have been determined that 
they have not bargained in good faith," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the theory is that they never wanted to reach an agreement, then this 
(withholding of the pension payment) was part of the attempt to provoke a 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, who say they withheld payment because the pension agreement had 
expired last December, will have a chance to respond to the complaint before it 
goes to a hearing. Management attorney Chuck O'Connor said the NLRB action 
would have no impact on a decision to implement the salary cap or the 
possibility of future litigation by the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any pension settlement would be part of a new collective bargaining 
agreement," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new agreement? Union leader Donald Fehr said he hoped he was wrong but that 
the demeanor of the owners' negotiating committee left the impression that this 
would prove to be more than only a "temporary interruption" in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expected the owners to implement the salary cap, "but if I was 
their lawyer I'd suggest they think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 John Harrington, the owners' chief negotiator and chief executive officer of 
the Boston Red Sox, said he would recommend implementation of the new economic 
system. Twenty-one votes are needed. Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos said 
Wednesday he will vote against implementation, but sources said only the 
Toronto Blue Jays and Cincinnati Reds might join him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we implement, it will definitely be a setback to the bargaining process, 
but the calendar is where it is," said Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten, a 
member of the negotiating committee. "We have to get on with our business and 
prepare for 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners faced two key dates. Saturday is the deadline for a club to offer 
its free agents arbitration, which will be eliminated under the owners' plan. 
The deadline for tendering 1995 contracts is Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to seeking an injunction through the NLRB and possible filings in 
federal court, the union is considering an immediate signing freeze. Without a 
settlement, the strike that began on Aug. 12 as economic leverage against 
implementation of the salary cap will resume next spring, when owners attempt 
to open the camps with replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery, whose tenacity might have been the only 
reason the sides were still talking Wednesday, said absence of an agreement did 
not represent a failure on anyone's part. Usery had recently said 
implementation of a salary cap would be an impediment to the bargaining 
process, but on Wednesday he called it a "bump in the road" and said he was 
hopeful the sides would consider resuming talks next week, probably wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a dispute to mediate," he said. "We just ran out of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr complimented Usery and said: "It's apparent, at least for now, that 
there's not an agreement to be found, and that's because everything the players 
were willing to do did not add up to a cap or functional equivalent of a cap. 
Unless one defines good-faith bargaining by giving the owners everything they 
wanted, the players made substantial moves. Anyone who thinks implementation 
will change what the players will or will not accept is simply wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrington, acknowledging that the industry will be damaged by the 
failure to attain a settlement: "We're disappointed, but at peace with 
ourselves. We felt we made every effort to reach an agreement, but we remained 
deadlocked over the central issue of cost control and the relationship between 
compensation and revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 About 58% of 1994 revenue went to player compensation. The owners hope to 
reduce it to 50% through a system the union insists will wipe out 25 years of 
the bargaining progress, destroy free agency and transfer millions of dollars 
from players to owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary cap proposal has been on the table since June 14 and modified only 
to the extent that a $1 billion compensation guarantee for the players has been 
removed because of the estimated $600 million that the clubs have lost during 
the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The payroll cap will be set at about $34.8 million and linked to revenue 
sharing, which will transfer about $58 million to 11 smaller-revenue teams when 
fully implemented in four years. Arbitration will be replaced by salary 
minimums in each of a player's first four years and right-of-first-refusal free 
agency after a player's fourth and fifth years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 players in those categories will become free agents if the system is 
implemented today, but union officials believe overall movement will come to a 
halt because few clubs will make multiyear commitments under the cap. The 
flooded market will also contribute to the drag on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent, partnership-based union proposal would have transferred $58 
million to the smaller revenue teams next year, rather than in four years. The 
union went back to the owners with different ways of doing it Wednesday, but 
Fehr said: "We had always been led to believe that the one thing the owners 
wanted to accomplish was to help the small-market teams, but everything we 
suggested was rejected. They countered with plans that would have helped the 
larger -revenue teams. This was all about the cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides had come out of a session at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday with a degree of 
optimism, but it led nowhere after the talks resumed in early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brave pitcher Tom Glavine said the scars would be hard to heal "but as a 
player, what price do you put on your freedom? People say we're greedy, but if 
we're greedy we would have taken their best deal and gone back to collecting 
pay checks."

SWIMMING OFFICIAL GETS SUSPENDED

<P>
 Alan Richardson, chairman of the international swimming federation's medical 
commission, was suspended Wednesday for leaking information to reporters about 
drug test results of Chinese swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, warned at last summer's World Championships in Rome not to address 
the controversy surrounding the Chinese swimmers, was accused of discussing 
information about the seven, including world champions Lu Bin and Yang Aihua, 
who recently tested positive for banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, a Honolulu orthopedist, is expected to meet FINA President 
Mustapha Larfaoui today in Atlanta to discuss his situation. FINA officials 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunnar Werner, FINA's secretary general, rebuked Richardson last month for 
discussing Yang's case when the controversy over Chinese swimmers erupted. At 
the time, Richardson confirmed reports of Yang's positive test for the male 
hormone testosterone. ELLIOTT ALMOND

SIMMONS REPLACES JONES AS OKLAHOMA STATE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Simmons, passed over for the head coaching job at Colorado, is the choice 
of Oklahoma State officials to lead the Cowboys' struggling football program. 
</P>
<P>
 University President James Halligan said Wednesday that Simmons, 46, will be 
appointed to replace Pat Jones on Friday.Jones resigned after 11 seasons, with 
losing records the final six. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the university's regents, as expected, Simmons would become the 
first black head football coach in Big Eight history and only the fifth black 
coach at an NCAA Division I-A school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the only man to whom the job was offered and he took it," Halligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was one of six men interviewed by a search committee, which concluded 
its work Tuesday. He was not in the football office at Colorado on Wednesday 
and could not be reached for comment at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons has been an assistant at Colorado the last seven seasons and was 
assistant head coach the past two. He was a candidate to replace Colorado Coach 
Bill McCartney and was one of two people McCartney recommended as his 
successor. But the school chose assistant Rick Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons faces a difficult chore at Oklahoma State. Jones led the Cowboys to 
three 10-victory seasons in his first five years on the job. But since NCAA 
sanctions were handed down after the 1988 season, the Cowboys have an 18-45-3 
record and are in the midst of an 18-game Big Eight winless streak dating to 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four black head coaches at the Division I-A level are Ron Cooper of 
Eastern Michigan, Tyrone Willingham of Stanford, Jim Caldwell of Wake Forest 
and Ron Dickerson of Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State also hired the first black head coach in basketball in the Big 
Eight when it hired Leonard Hamilton in 1986.

JUST WHO ARE THOSE HEROES?; PRO FOOTBALL: NOBODIES EVERYWHERE ELSE, THEY BECOME 
SOMEBODIES BY SIGNING WITH THE EXPANSION JAGUARS AND PANTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Cuthbert has run the football once in his two-year professional career. 
He has caught one pass. He has returned one kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeting him today in downtown Charlotte, N.C., will be the dreams of 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Baker is the NFL equivalent of invisible: two years in Indianapolis. 
An average of two games and one catch per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Jacksonville, Fla., he and several others will become the most 
popular men in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be wild," Baker said. "We're going to be all over that city. 
Everybody there is going to be wanting to see us." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is someone to see. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year after being accepted as the NFL's 29th and 30th teams, the 
Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars will sign their first players today. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, so maybe none of these guys will ever actually play. They will be 
breathing. For now, that will be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we actually have a team," gushed Sara Nichols, president of the 
Jacksonville Jaguar Booster Club. "I'm just afraid these poor players will be 
mobbed. Everybody is going to follow their every move, because everybody here 
wants to know just what NFL players do ." 
</P>
<P>
 More important is what team officials are doing to build their rosters in 
preparation for their first game, when they play each other in the Hall of Fame 
exhibition in Canton, Ohio, next July. 
</P>
<P>
 From today until the end of the regular season, each team can sign 10 players. 
They will add 30-42 more at the Feb. 15 reallocation draft, when each of the 28 
teams must expose six veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The roster will be filled out with draft picks -- each team will receive two 
in each of the seven rounds in April -- and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's established owners, wanting the newcomers' money but not their 
competition, have worked hard to ensure these stocking methods will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Injured veterans will be allowed in the reallocation draft, even if an 
independent doctor rules that the injury will mean they miss training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two new teams will have only about $20 million to spend on free 
agency, no more than an average team has available under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be able to build any faster than expansion teams like Tampa Bay and 
Seattle," Bill Polian, Carolina's general manager, said. "What you will see is 
an absence of the core coming through the expansion draft. If each of us get 14 
healthy players out of that draft, we will be doing good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to build through the college draft. And that will take 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this has dimmed interest in the two cities, where there are 
parties planned for today to greet the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this fall, Cuthbert was stunned while taking part in a six-player 
midweek tryout on a baseball diamond at the club's temporary practice facility 
at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually at these workouts you have a couple of coaches and a stopwatch," said 
Cuthbert, 24, who played at nearby Duke. "We drove up and I thought there was a 
baseball game going on." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the field was surrounded with more than 200 fans and media 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the prospective employee who wanted to gain the attention of 
Jaguar management. 
</P>
<P>
 During one tryout, held at a high school on Jacksonville's St. John's River, 
the man was spotted on the rocky river bank, water lapping at his shoes, 
holding his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been there for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling I get is that the people in Jacksonville are hysterical," said 
Baker, 23, one of several Florida State players expected to migrate there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly immune to the hysteria is the Jaguars' coach, Tom Coughlin, who worked 
wonders as a Boston College head coach and New York Giant assistant through his 
concentration and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a team this fall, he has practiced those traits, putting his 
assistants through a 90-hour workweek that culminates in scouting trips to 
colleges on Saturdays and NFL games on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 In surely the oddest occurrence in any NFL film room this year, the Jaguars 
actually used their playbook to stage three mock games against opponents whose 
plays were extracted from videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it they went 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep the pressure on us to be the best-prepared team we can be," 
Coughlin said. "I have tried to create that pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nichols: "Coach is a wonderful man who has really opened up to the 
community. I just hope he doesn't have a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
 That will not happen to the Carolina head coach. At least not until they have 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Preferring to build from the bottom up, the Panthers have hired everybody from 
scouts to a trainer to an equipment manager . . . everybody but coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have everything in place so we could say, 'Coach, here's the key 
to your office, here's your scouting reports, here's the computer technology 
and printer for your playbook. . . . Go to work," Polian said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also wanted to make sure Joe Gibbs did not want the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Washington Redskin coach convinced them he wants to spend time with 
his family and his automobile racing teams. This leaves them to pursue 
University of Miami Coach Dennis Erickson, who fits their needs as an offensive 
whiz and program-builder. 
</P>
<P>
 What the program will be, either in Carolina and Jacksonville, seems secondary 
to the fact that, beginning today, their fans will have somebody to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players today will be treated as conquering heroes," Polian said. "And 
the first unrestricted free agent we get this spring will be Mr. Carolina."

ATTORNEYS MEET AS NHL GOES NOWHERE

<P>
 With only about a week left to save the season, attorneys for the NHL and its 
players' union met informally Wednesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was designed to clear up issues that bogged down previous sessions 
and to set guidelines for future talks involving full delegations. A meeting is 
scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman and union chief Bob Goodenow spoke by telephone but 
aren't expected to meet before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A league source cautioned against reading anything into the lack of full-scale 
talks. However, a management source said Wednesday's meeting didn't accomplish 
enough to warrant summoning all the negotiators today. HELENE ELLIOTT

MARYLAND APPROVES THE TESTING OF CABLE TV HOME-BETTING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Maryland Racing Commission approved Wednesday the testing of a system that 
will allow people to place bets from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group we're responding to is the under-30 crowd," said Mark Brenner, 
president of On Demand Services, a Tulsa, Okla.-based communications company 
developing the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is similar to pay-per-view television and will work by hooking a 
cable box to a television set. 
</P>
<P>
 When a person wants to make a bet, he can slide a credit card in the box and 
then punch in a PIN number. 
</P>
<P>
 The person uses the remote to choose a race, horse and wager. Money is 
deducted from an account that is established when the system is hooked up. Once 
the bet has been placed, the person can flip a channel and watch the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up costs for the system in Maryland will be between $250,000 and 
$500,000, Brenner said. ODS will pay for most of the expenses. During the 
program's initial phase, the 25 testers will use play money and will only be 
able to bet, not watch video feed of the races.

 WATCH THE SUNSET: Unless you know the turf well, chances are you've passed 
through Sunset Beach -- a coastal strand just north of Pacific Coast Highway -- 
and didn't even know it. But no more. . . . New Caltrans signs are now posted 
telling you when you're in Sunset Beach -- population 1,200. Longtime Sunset

 NO LYNCH MOB: Investment firm Merrill Lynch may be getting a black eye over 
some of its dealings leading to Orange County's bond crisis, but it still has 
lots of fans. . . . In a new national survey of bank executives, they predicted 
Merrill Lynch would be their biggest competitor in three years. Says survey

established a national franchise based on customer needs-focused retailing." .

 G-RATED SANTA: People upset because adult cable channels unexpectedly pop up

Council Tuesday -- Santa Claus and small children (B3). Santa didn't speak, but 
the children did. . . . Among them, Jonathan Davis, 10, who said he hasn't seen 
any of the adult movies himself, but "my little 4-year-old sister was not so 
lucky. She now has pornography in her vocabulary. She will never forget this, 
the rest of her life, thanks to Cablevision of Orange.". . . It helped: The 
council fined Cablevision.

 TOP HONOR: CSUN had another lousy football season, but you can't blame Joseph

 SHARK EXPERT: What does an insurance salesman from Canoga Park do with his 
spare time? Study sharks, of course. He's Ralph S. Collier, founder of the 
Shark Research Committee. So when a diver was killed last week by a shark, 
Collier was on the horn to Santa Barbara County investigators (B1). . . . "I'm 
just trying to understand why they do what they do," Collier says.

 RELEASED: Barry Minkow says he found God in prison. But what will he find in 
freedom? He'll soon find out. Wednesday, the convicted Reseda swindler got out 
of prison, going to a halfway house (B1). . . . He hopes to start a small 
company but won't run it himself. "He's trying to insulate himself from being 
in charge of his money for a while," says Randy Long, Minkow's attorney.

 BYE-BYE DEE DEE: The long-rumored departure of presidential Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers is now "a virtual certainty," according to a senior White House 
official. Myers was expected to lose the post in a White House shake-up after 
Labor Day, but made a last-minute personal plea to President Clinton and was 
allowed to keep the post. Myers is now expected to leave by the end of the year 
and be replaced by Michael McCurry, the State Department's chief mouthpiece. If 
McCurry should turn down the White House podium, former Gary Hart press 
secretary Kevin Sweeney is a candidate for the post. Myers is weighing a number 
of lucrative career moves, including television, the entertainment industry and 
public relations.

 TRADE TURNOVER: The small office of the U.S. trade representative has enjoyed 
perhaps its most successful two years ever. But in the midst of the Clinton 
Administration's effort to open more foreign markets to U.S. products, the team 
that has been at the center of the effort, led by U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor, is undergoing a major turnover. Kantor's deputy, Rufus Yerxa, 
who played a crucial role in the completion of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and in the end game of the seven-year negotiation of the redrawn 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is about to head off to the private 
sector. So too is Thomas Nides, Kantor's chief of staff. And there is much 
speculation about Kantor's future. The Los Angeles lawyer who was chairman of 
Clinton's presidential campaign is a likely candidate to play a major part in 
the President's reelection drive.

 MARION COME LATELY: As Wall Street weighs whether to loan the District of 
Columbia $250 million so that the financially strapped city can pay its bills, 
municipal officials are hoping punctuality isn't among the criteria. It seems 
Mayor-elect Marion Barry didn't make it to the airport in time for the 6:45 
a.m. shuttle to New York for the meeting on Tuesday, according to the 
Washington Post. District Council Chairman David Clarke, whom Barry was to 
accompany to the meeting, was on board the flight and went ahead without him. 
Barry caught a 7 a.m. shuttle, but it landed at a different La Guardia Airport 
terminal. So Clarke hopped a cab to that terminal in an attempt to meet up with 
the incoming mayor, but Barry had the same idea. Their cabs passed in the 
frosty morning air. The meeting began 20 minutes late.

 TRAITOR SALE: Spy-lovers, ghouls and just plain bargain-hunters are expected 
for an auction today of clothing and other personal belongings once owned by 
convicted turncoats Aldrich H. Ames and his wife, Rosario. Perhaps the General 
Services Administration will find more buyers for the couple's clothing and 
stereo equipment than it has had for their half-million-dollar home, which is 
still on the market. Aldrich Ames, perhaps the most damaging traitor in CIA 
history, was convicted earlier this year of selling secrets that obliterated 
the U.S. spy network in the former Soviet Union and led to the deaths of at 
least 10 agents. He is serving a life sentence in prison, and Rosario Ames, who 
played a minor role in the affair, was given a term of about five years. At an 
auction of the Ameses' jewelry collection earlier this month, the government 
took in $30,000 as bidders snapped up items that included Tiffany boxes, a 
Lalique glass fish, a Cartier watch -- and a chain adorned with a pendant 
featuring a red-eyed Russian bear.

 At least 350 children whose parents are in prison will celebrate Christmas a 
little early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends Outside will have its 10th annual holiday party for the children from 
1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Saturday at the Orange Senior Center.But organizers lack 
about 100 gift-filled stockings, said program director Sandi Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the children are from Orange County but their parents are in prisons 
across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times, especially through the holidays, the separation is very sad," 
Burns said. "The kids love the party. They look forward to it every year. . . . 
For most of them, their lives are filled with a lot of despair."  
</P>
<P>
 The group likes to give each child a stocking filled with small gifts such as 
crayons, candy or books, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to donate a stocking should call the group at (714) 836-8100.

 Some observers say downtown Huntington Beach was destined to look like Miami 
Beach under the old development plan for the tourist mecca. But the City 
Council recently approved a revised downtown plan, dubbed the "village 
concept." 
</P>
<P>
 This less-intense development proposal calls for three- to four-story 
buildings and more pedestrian-oriented attractions. The plan area is from Beach 
Boulevard to Golden West Street along Pacific Coast Highway and on Main Street 
from PCH to Palm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent structures built so far include Pierside Pavilion, which houses a 
movie theater and restaurants, a parking structure and Oceanview Promenade -- 
home of Jack's Surfboards. Today 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity to get into the Christmas spirit will be available at the 
Fountain Valley Branch Library, where carolers will perform holiday favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Tyme Carolers, a group of singers dressed in costumes, will perform at 
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free, and refreshments will be

BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; IT ISN'T PRETTY, BUT SANTA MARGARITA DUMPS FOUNTAIN 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Santa Margarita didn't exactly wear out Fountain Valley goalkeeper Scott 
Hainlen, but it did enough damage to squeak out an "ugly" 2-1 victory Wednesday 
at Fountain Valley in a nonleague game between the county's top two ranked 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Eagles had only five shots on goal to 12 by top-ranked 
Fountain Valley, but two of their shots found the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no skill to this game at all," Santa Margarita Coach Curt Bauer 
said. "One team would kick the ball and then the other team would kick it. 
There was no continuity. It was ugly. But it's nice to know we can win ugly as 
well as win pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Ugly or not, Santa Margarita improved to 8-0-1. Fountain Valley dropped to 5-1 
and allowed its first two goals of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita's Seth George, who led the county in goals last season with 
24, scored six minutes into the game on an assist from Brian Piesner. 
Midfielder Miguel Godoy scored 20 minutes later when his shot caromed off a 
Fountain Valley player, who was trying to clear the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Fountain Valley got most of the scoring opportunities and 
controlled the action. But the Barons found the goal only once and that came on 
Joey Bove's penalty kick with 10 minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons got off seven shots on goal in the second half, but Eagle keeper 
Ben Froehlich handled all of them easily. Meanwhile, Santa Margarita was able 
to get off only two shots on goal in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said he was not pleased with his team's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "All year long we've gone up on teams, 2-0, and then just quit," Bauer said. 
"Fortunately, all we did was give up a penalty kick and that came off a 
questionable call." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Coach Kevin Smith said difference was Santa Margarita's 
"big-game experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first real team we've played in six games," Smith said. "They've 
been playing in all these tournaments and they were a little more prepared than 
we were for the big-game atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smith said he was pleased that his team was able to frustrate George 
and contain Piesner, a junior transfer from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got weapons all over the place," Smith said. "I coach these kids in 
the summer so I knew what to expect." DAVE McKIBBEN

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; HUGE FIRST HALF KEY TO VICTORY FOR OCEAN VIEW

 Faced with the possibility of meeting highly touted Mater Dei in the 
semifinals, an inspired Ocean View scored 51 points in the first half of a 
78-44 drubbing of Newport Harbor in a quarterfinal game in the Tournament of 
Champions Wednesday at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went our way," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said."A game like this 
was out of (Newport Harbor Coach) Richard Smith's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks (6-3) forced 31 turnovers with their pressure defense, then 
carved up the Sailors by making 28 layups. Ocean View shot 72% from the field 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan McDonald, a 6-foot-1 senior forward, scored most of his 23 points inside. 
Mike Seguin added 18 points and Alejandro Enriquez 14. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ocean View will get the toughest of tests in Friday's semifinal against 
Mater Dei, a 58-50 winner over Los Angeles Fairfax.  
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the winner getting to play Mater Dei in the next round and 
the kids responded," Harris said. "Man-for-man, Mater Dei is awesome. I don't 
know if anyone matches up with them on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we go out and play good team basketball, anything can happen on the 
court. Hey, if we had a chance to play Dream Team 2, we'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rankin scored 17 points for Newport Harbor (4-4). MICHAEL ITAGAKI

 In another Tournament of Champions quarterfinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 58, Los Angeles Fairfax 50 -- The Monarchs (4-0) trailed early, but 
outscored Fairfax (3-1) 15-8 in the third quarter to take control. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Jackson had 26 points and 12 rebounds, making nine of 12 shots from the 
field, and Clay McKnight added 15 points, including four three-pointers for 
Mater Dei. Teammate Schea Cotton had 12 points and 10 rebounds but made only 
three of nine shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jair Fray scored 12 points for Fairfax, which kept it close despite shooting 
35% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Irvine World News Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan 71, Woodbridge 54 -- Of the many lessons the Woodbridge 
Warriors will learn this season, an important one was taught to them by Long 
Beach Jordan: A one-man team rarely beats a five-man team. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge center Chris Burgess led all scorers with 23 points, but the other 
Warriors only added 21, and that was not enough to stop the Panthers in their 
quarterfinal victory in the Irvine World News Tournament at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan (4-3) allowed Burgess to dominate only one quarter -- the third, in 
which he scored 14 of his team's 16 points. But Burgess was scoreless in the 
second quarter, and had only five of Woodbridge's nine points in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, Jordan's full-court trap zone defense on Woodbridge (5-2) 
in the second half quickly turned a 31-29 halftime lead into a 48-37 advantage. 
The Warriors never got closer than four the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't use the trap (in an opening victory against Huntington Beach), so I 
figured they hadn't seen it," Panthers Coach Ron Massey said. "We had to be 
quicker than them because their big guy was just eating us up." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan next faces Estancia, a 68-39 winner over Palos Verde Chadwick, in 
Friday's semifinals. MIKE TERRY

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; EL DORADO POINTS OUT PROBLEM FOR CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You take a look at the record and it doesn't seem right. Canyon, which returns 
five starters from last year's 15-10 team, is sitting below .500 after five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Comanche Coach Nelson Herrera isn't bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could've easily scheduled cream puffs," Herrera said. "We could've padded 
our record. We want to play tough competition to see what we have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado, ranked seventh in The Times' preseason top 10, scored a 55-42 
victory on Wednesday over Canyon in the El Dorado Coed Classic. The Golden 
Hawks (4-0), who definitely don't fit into the cream puff category, joined No. 
9 Esperanza and Cerritos as teams that have shown Canyon (2-3) what it needs to 
work on. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches made only 16 of 56 shots from the field (28.6%), even with 
Robynn Kuhlmann hitting eight of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuhlmann and Herrera credited the El Dorado defense, especially in the 
second half. Kuhlmann had 14 points at halftime and finished with 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really hard to get open," Kuhlmann said. "Their defense was really 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 That was mostly the doing of Kim Korsmeier and Lisa Darling. They hounded 
Kuhlmann in the second half, when Kuhlmann made only two of eight shots. Canyon 
made only six of 30 shots in the final 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting's been a problem, and that's the key," Herrera said. "Just having 
games with tough teams is important. And I've got to give El Dorado all the 
credit for playing tough defense." 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado stepped up its intensity with a man-to-man defense in the second 
half, and a 30-26 halftime lead became a 40-28 advantage with 1 minute 56 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's something we can do; if we play hard, we can shut (individual) 
players down," El Dorado Coach Gary Raya said of the Golden Hawks' second-half 
effort against Kuhlmann. "We won our first three games by more than 30 points. 
To this point, the best team we've played has been ourselves in practice. We've 
only played four games, and we'll get better the more games we play." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanna Renken scored 22 points and also had six rebounds and three steals. The 
5-foot-11 senior made 11 of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle de Bruijn had 12 points, including 10 in the second half, eight 
rebounds and three steals for the Golden Hawks. El Dorado shot 39.3% from the 
floor (22 of 56). MARTIN HENDERSON

FAMILY; IN THE MUSICAL 'KING LEAR,' THEY ALL GET A SECOND CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Purists read no further. "King Lear," Shakespeare's most passionate tragedy of 
familial betrayal, deceit, violence and deathbed redemption, has been turned 
into a children's musical. Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sad Tale of King Leerio," at the Stella Adler Theatre, bears a distant 
resemblance to the original, but the subtitle, "Everyone Deserves a Second 
Chance," clues you into playwright/lyricist/director Jordan Charney's 
remarkably upbeat take on the classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Charney's version -- which uses only a few lines here and there from the 
original -- King Leerio's intent to divide his kingdom according to which of 
his three daughters can prove she loves him the most, is simply a joke that 
backfires when his youngest, Princess Gumdrop (Mariah Shaw), won't play along. 
</P>
<P>
 The king (Don McGovern) goes into a whiny snit and banishes Gumdrop, whereupon 
one of her suitors, Duke Grabbitt (Jeff Markey), deserts her and the other, 
Duke Steferado, (Chris Cox) professes his love. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealth in hand, greedy Princess Sellyfish (Holly Rockwell) and Princess 
Mee-anie (Maeve Odum) want nothing more to do with their father, while Lord 
Robba (William Campbell) and Lord Lyre (Josh Schrieber), plot with Grabbitt to 
steal their intendeds' inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chickenfeed, the King's fool (played by guitar-strumming Bill Robens, wearing 
a life-size rubber chicken carcass on his head), is the show's musical narrator 
(Richard Demone wrote the music). 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, and after McGovern's anemic, truncated version of the king's 
"blow, winds and crack your cheeks" mad scene, peace and harmony prevail as the 
characters give each other a "second chance" to behave themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical's small scope has a workshop feel to it that is underscored by 
less-than-inspired lyrics -- "Father don't weep; I know you tried, but you were 
asleep" -- but the polished adult professional cast, save for McGovern who 
seems uneasy in the lead role, carries the mild comedy off better than might be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Sad Tale of King Leerio" at Stella Adler Academy's Studio Theatre in 
Hollywood, Saturdays at 2:30 p.m., indefinitely. $7-$10; (213) 782-0596. Runs 1 
hour.

CLUB REVIEW; CLUB MAY HAVE NO NAME BUT IT'S GETTING A REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND * Club With No Name on Sundays at Dragonfly, 6510 Santa 
Monica Blvd. 21 and over. $5 cover. (213) 466-6111. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After just a few weeks, the resuscitated Club With No Name is making, well, a 
name for itself. Promoter Dayle Gloria's Sunday night series at the Gaslight 
(the original and still popular name for the Cosmos club) was a staple of the 
alternative set, but her decision to move the scene to the nearby Dragonfly 
came just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any scene in L.A., the momentum begins to fade sooner or later, and 
the change of venue has given Sunday nights a necessary boost of adrenaline. 
Although Gloria's selection of young, energetic bands has something to do with 
the success, Dragonfly's sound system is a step above the Gaslight's, and the 
Santa Monica Boulevard club -- as well as its stage -- is considerably roomier. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria, who was part of the promotion team behind the popular Scream club at 
the Park Plaza Hotel, hadn't used the Club With No Name moniker since she 
abandoned it three years ago at the Probe. 
</P>
<P>
 No Name's current incarnation at Dragonfly includes deejay Mike Vague spinning 
an alternative music mix in the dance area, while about five bands a night 
perform in the front room. So far, such big names as Henry Rollins, Stone 
Temple Pilots and Soul Asylum have been among the patrons checking out such 
up-and-coming bands as 1,000 Mona Lisas and Gwen Mars. HEIDI SIEGMUND * Club

ORVAL FAUBUS; GOVERNOR BLOCKED SCHOOL DESEGREGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Arkansas Gov. Orval E. Faubus, a onetime Ozark populist who became a 
national symbol of opposition to school desegregation, died Wednesday at his 
home in Conway, Ark. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus, who had a pacemaker installed in 1977, had suffered for years from 
heart and stomach problems. He also developed prostate cancer in 1991 and had 
radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus became a national figure on Sept. 2, 1957, when he called out the 
Arkansas National Guard to keep nine black students from entering Little Rock's 
all-white Central High School. That was three years after the Supreme Court had 
ruled that racially segregated public schools were unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The blacks were unable to enroll until President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 
1,000 paratroopers to Little Rock to enforce court integration orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now an occupied territory," Faubus said in an angry television speech. 
He charged that "Yankee soldiers" had held "naked, unsheathed bayonets in the 
backs of schoolgirls." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhower kept the troops of the 101st Airborne Division at Central High 
until the end of the year. In the fall of 1958, Faubus retaliated and closed 
all of Little Rock's high schools, permitting them to reopen the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Faubus insisted that his only motive was to prevent violence, not to 
block integration, the moment he dispatched the National Guard to Central High 
he became a hero to segregationists and easily the most popular politician in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling out the Guard was later credited with making Faubus governor longer 
than anyone in Arkansas history, including President Clinton. Faubus was 
elected to an unprecedented six two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Alabama Gov. George Wallace, Faubus never apologized for his actions in 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said that I regret it ever happened," Faubus told The Times in 
1992. "But I would not change a thing because I was trying to stop property 
damage, injury or death. And in that, we succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus attempted to make a political comeback, running three times to try to 
regain the governor's mansion. But when he lost to Clinton in the 1986 
Democratic primary, he threw in the towel and declared himself "a has-been." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he frequently criticized Clinton's work as Arkansas governor, he 
refused to discuss Clinton's presidency, saying only, "We've always had people 
in Arkansas who were capable of being President." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding integration in Little Rock, Faubus found himself playing an ironic 
role. The son of an old-time socialist, he had called himself a mountain 
populist when he first went into politics. Until the Little Rock incident, he 
had been regarded as a racial moderate who had presided over the integration of 
the state's public colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been the most liberal governor in the South, but they can't come in and 
cram (integration) down our throats," Faubus said at a news conference during 
the height of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a victim of circumstance," he said in 1992. "I offended the great 
federal government, and I've paid for it ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1958, when he was running for a third term, Faubus had polished an 
oratorical technique that soon was picked up by other Dixie politicians. His 
colorful speaking style proved adept at arousing crowds with charges that 
Northerners were pouring money into the state in an effort to defeat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they oppose me?" he would ask. His listeners would shake their heads 
angrily to show that they did not know either. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus would then denounce the federal government, integrationists and 
"leftists" who, he said, were threatening the peace of the state. He was 
reelected with a majority vote in all 75 of the state's counties. By the time 
Faubus had won his sixth term, he had defeated 25 opponents since he was first 
elected in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Orval Eugene Faubus was born in a log house in Combs, Ark., on Greasy Creek, 
on Jan. 7, 1910, and grew up in the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, J. S. (Sam) Faubus, was a socialist who was arrested by federal 
agents during World War I for opposing the draft and distributing "seditious 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Faubus raised his seven children to be liberals on the race issue. "He was 
opposed to bigotry," Orval Faubus said of his father. "He was a supporter of 
women's suffrage when it was unpopular." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reared as a radical, Faubus never joined the Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked the political situation over and I knew that as a socialist in those 
days you would be barred from any opportunity to hold office, state or 
otherwise," Faubus said in an interview with The Times in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 After a checkered career as a rural schoolteacher, county court clerk, country 
postmaster and publisher of a small weekly newspaper, Faubus entered the 
Democratic primary in 1954 against Gov. Francis A. Cherry, a former judge 
seeking a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus, then practically unknown, was given little chance of winning. But he 
was good looking and had an effective speaking style. And he got a big boost 
when the governor made a strategic mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry discovered that Faubus had once attended Commonwealth College at Mena, 
Ark., a labor school that had been started by socialists and was taken over by 
communists in the 1930s. Cherry made an issue of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus said he had stayed at Commonwealth only a few weeks, departing when he 
concluded that it was too radical. Because it had happened 19 years earlier, 
many voters believed that Cherry had engaged in a cheap shot and rallied to 
Faubus' support. He won. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus compiled a progressive record during his first three years in office 
but remained comparatively unknown outside the South until the Little Rock 
school issue erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said later that the crisis would never have developed if prominent Little 
Rock citizens had not portrayed the integration plan for Central High as a 
model for the entire South. He said that mobilized the segregationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus said he would rather be remembered for contributions to mental health 
and education. Under him, the state made big strides caring for the mentally 
ill, expanding its system of colleges and universities, raising teachers' 
salaries, building roads and creating jobs through an industrialization 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I would like to be remembered for and I will when objective 
historians review the record," he said. "It is not the fate of a controversial 
figure to be treated too kindly when he's still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Retiring from the governorship after his sixth term, Faubus and his wife, 
Alta, returned to their hometown of Huntsville in the Ozarks of northwestern 
Arkansas. Misfortune then began to dog him. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife of 37 years divorced him in 1969. He then married a 30-year-old 
woman, Elizabeth Westmoreland, who had once worked as his secretary. She was 
murdered in Houston where they lived briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his third wife, Jan Wittenburg, a Conway teacher 33 years 
his junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a comeback, Faubus ran for governor in 1970 and 1974. But he lost in 
the Democratic primaries, first to Dale Bumpers and then to David Pryor. Both 
became governors and later U.S. senators. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Faubus' only child, Farrell, committed suicide at age 37. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of money, Faubus wrote five books ranging from an account of his World 
War II experiences as an infantry officer in Europe to a eulogy to his dogs and 
a two-volume autobiography titled "Down From the Hills." He peddled his books 
around the state, charging $10 a book, and an additional 10 cents if he 
autographed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus also offered tours of his home in the Ozarks at $1.25 a head and worked 
briefly as a $5,000-a-year bank teller. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Faubus went back on the public payroll when Republican Gov. Frank 
White made him director of the state Veterans Affairs Department. "I needed the 
job," Faubus said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the state of Arkansas quietly accepted a bust of Faubus for display 
in the state Capitol, despite the fact that black legislators had protested 
such an honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Faubus' body will lie in state in the Capitol's rotunda in Little Rock today. 
A funeral is being planned for Saturday.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; WRIGHT REPLACES NEWMAN AS STARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety Anthony Newman, who has started the last 46 games, will take a seat 
Sunday so the Rams can watch rookie Toby Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been struggling the past three or four games," Newman said. "If I'm 
going to hurt the team I shouldn't be out there. I've been pressing, and I 
haven't been taking care of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good wake-up call, and to be honest, it takes some pressure off my 
back. . . . It's a demotion, but I can rest my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Monday the team would play its best players in an 
attempt to win the last two games rather than experiment and play young players 
like Wright, quarterback Tommy Maddox and defensive end Brad Ottis. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Newman, the team's defensive captain, reported for work Wednesday he 
learned he was out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock," he said. "But write this down: I will be back. If not here, 
somewhere, and if not now, then later. But I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will use Wright at strong safety and move Marquez Pope to free safety 
on early downs. They will bring in rookie safety Keith Lyle on passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Israel worked at the corner for Darryl Henley, who is listed as probable 
because of a groin injury. Ottis, the team's rookie defensive end, also earned 
significant practice time because of injuries to Gerald Robinson (neck) and 
Jimmie Jones (ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater, who is wrapping up season No. 19, is close to deciding 
his future. Slater, sidelined with an elbow injury, indicated before the season 
that he would like to play 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't said this is his last year," Knox said. "I think he probably could 
play another year; he played well when he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pro Bowl selections will be announced today, and while linebacker Shane Conlan 
is probably the most deserving Ram, he doesn't expect to hear his name called. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a nice honor, but I don't anticipate it happening," Conlan said. 
"It's tough when you have a team struggling like we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan leads the team in tackles despite coming out of the game in certain 
passing situations, and by his own assessment, he considers this one of his 
most productive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year I was hurt and played in only seven games and I went; I was kind of 
embarrassed almost," said Conlan, who was voted into three consecutive Pro 
Bowls while playing with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis earned an invite to the Pro Bowl last year as a 
rookie, but at best he figures to finish third in the voting this year behind 
Emmitt Smith and Barry Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done a whole lot as far as stats go," said Bettis, who ranks fourth 
in the NFC in rushing with 970 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams added linebacker Brett Collins, who was with the team earlier this 
season, to their 53-man roster because of injuries to linebackers Tom Homco 
(foot) and Chris Martin (calf). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams made room for Collins by placing rookie tackle Ronald Edwards on 
injured reserve with bone spurs in his ankle. Knox said Edwards suffered the 
injury in training camp. T.J. SIMERS

KEEPING TRACK: SIMON MAKES THE TRANSITION IN HIS MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miles Simon was ready for college basketball-style reprogramming. However, he 
hasn't had to change a thing so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are he never will. 
</P>
<P>
 A freshman guard at Arizona, Simon figured he'd spend his first year in Tucson 
learning a lot about the game he thought he knew so well. Simon, all-everything 
at Mater Dei, heard stories about other freshmen who discovered big-time 
college basketball isn't as simple as it looks on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Simon, though, he's quite familiar with the Wildcats' lesson 
plans. As it turns out, he has been studying them for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I did at Mater Dei, I'm doing the same things here," Simon said. 
"Our practices are just like Mater Dei practices. Our defensive principles, our 
offensive sets, they're almost identical." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not too surprising that one of the nation's most successful prep 
basketball programs would have more than a few things in common with one of 
college's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon noticed some of the similarities when he visited the desert on a 
recruiting trip. However, Simon never dreamed so much would be so familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew our programs were similar but not this similar," Simon said. 
"Everything is really structured, there's no 'free play' out here, and that's 
what I came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, (freshmen) expect to learn something new in practice each day. 
Everything has been repetition for me, and that's given me a foot up on some 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 And Simon is using this advantage well. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, 6 feet 4, is averaging 9.7 points and 3.0 rebounds for Arizona (6-1), 
ranked No. 7 in the nation. He's fourth in scoring for the Wildcats' and first 
off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 A skilled long-range shooter, he's making 52% of his three-point attempts. 
Overall, he's shooting 51% from the field and 70% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon set career highs with 17 points, seven rebounds and six assists in the 
Wildcats' 92-75 rout of La Salle on Monday night at Arizona's McKale Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really say that I'm surprised," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff is. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Evans, the Wildcats' recruiting coordinator, said Simon's play has 
exceeded his expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expected Miles to be really good right away," Evans said, "but to be quite 
honest about it, he's a little better than we expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a matter of fact, I was just talking with (Coach) Lute (Olson) about how 
well Miles rebounds. We didn't think he'd be able to get these type of numbers 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
 While at Mater Dei, Simon established himself as one of the top players in the 
tradition-rich school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs won Southern Section Division I-A championships in each of 
Simon's three years on the varsity. The Times Orange County selected Simon the 
boys' player of the year after his junior and senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm averaging about 24 minutes a game, which is about what I played in high 
school last year," Simon said, "but I usually didn't play in the fourth quarter 
at Mater Dei because we were always blowing teams out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simon hasn't had to adjust to a new system, he needs help from time 
to time like anyone. Junior guard Reggie Geary, one of Simon's teammates at 
Mater Dei, provides support. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon credits Geary, a starter and defensive stopper, with making him a better 
player during their days at Mater Dei. Geary guarded Simon so well in practice 
it forced him to work hard just to get open. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been helping me out a lot here," Simon said. "I was a little worried 
about not playing in the beginning and Reggie would always tell me, 'Miles, 
you're going to get your time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Evans is confident Simon is destined for even bigger things. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just like (Miami Heat rookie guard) Khalid (Reeves) and (Wildcat 
All-American senior guard) Damon (Stoudamire) were as freshmen," Evans said. 
"And you see how they turned out." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Identical 6-5 twins Brad and Brian Finneran, who excelled in basketball and 
football at Santa Margarita, recently completed their freshman seasons on the 
Villanova football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receivers, the Finnerans made key contributions for the Division I-AA 
Wildcats. Brian set Villanova freshman records with 56 receptions for 805 
yards. He also scored seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad caught five passes for 50 yards and was one of Villanova's best players 
on special teams. The Wildcats finished 5-6, 2-6 in the Yankee Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased and surprised," Brian said. "I didn't expect for this to 
happen. I wish the team would have done better, but we have a real young team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brad: "I'm glad they allowed me to play as a freshman. I gained a lot of 
experience that will help me in the next three years."

 Former El Toro basketball player Jason Senik is one of the leaders for 
Wheaton, a Division III school in Wheaton, Ill.

 Senik, a 6-7 junior forward, averages 11.9 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.1 
assists. The Crusaders are 7-1.

<P>
 Freshman forward Sarah Beckley is making an immediate impact at Missouri 
Southern State, a Division II school in Joplin, Mo.

 Beckley (5-11), who helped Brea-Olinda win four consecutive State titles, has 
averages of 9.9 points and 6.7 rebounds. The Lions are 6-4.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT; MILLER PUTS ON FINISHING TOUCH, 69-68 
</P>

<P>
 Chatsworth High center Eddie Miller wasn't able to start Wednesday night 
against Grant, but he was able to finish off the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made a six-foot bank shot after an offensive rebound with 19 seconds 
remaining to give the Chancellors a 69-68 victory in the first round of the 
North Hollywood tournament. The Chancellors will play Banning, a 77-55 winner 
over El Camino Real, in the second round tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was not in the starting lineup because he missed two days of practice 
because of a minor thigh injury. But he dominated once he entered midway though 
the first quarter, finishing with 19 points and 21 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good while I was stretching beforehand and I knew I was ready to go," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant had a chance to win the game on an inbounds play with four seconds left, 
but Donald Patterson missed an 18-foot shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Patterson, Donald's brother, scored 30 points for Grant. He hit three 
times from three-point range in the fourth quarter to lead the Lancers back 
from a 13-point deficit entering the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Patterson's three-pointer with slightly more than two minutes remaining 
made the score 65-65. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's Tariq Hill made two free throws and Ronald Patterson one free 
throw before a driving layup by Freddy Ramirez with 43 seconds left gave Grant 
(4-3) a 68-67 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our concentration and guys were getting into foul trouble," Miller 
said. "We lost one to Carson that was just like this and we didn't want that 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (3-1) had 19 turnovers, 18 in the last three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far this season, we've been a peak-and-valley team," Chatsworth Coach Bill 
Whiting said. "That part was one of the valleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill finished with 24 points and made three of five three-point shots. Guard 
Jerome Joseph added 11 points and seven rebounds for the Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj Rollins scored 14 points for Grant, 12 in the second half. Donald 
Patterson finished with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
 Banning 77, El Camino Real 55 -- The Pilots (7-1) used full court pressure and 
21 points from Harold McCrimmon to dominate the Conquistadores (1-6), who got 
25 points from Jermel Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe 84, Garfield 64 -- The Vikings (4-3) used an 18-3 run in the second 
half to break open an game that was tied, 45-45. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 77, Granada Hills 67 -- Mike Delano scored nine of his 24 
points in the fourth quarter to lead the Huskies (4-2), who got 24 more from 
Shannon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Quinley had 28 points for Granada Hills (3-4) and William Ruffin added 
19.

THOUSAND OAKS WORKS TRIPLE TIME; PREP BASKETBALL: LANCERS NEED THREE EXTRA 
PERIODS TO DISPOSE OF SIMI VALLEY, 92-89. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sooner or later, someone had to make a key free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Either that or Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks highs would be playing basketball 
all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' Scott Sheridan made one with 1 minute 39 seconds to play in the 
third overtime, breaking a tie, and Jeff Nowak made two more with 29 seconds to 
play to give the Lancers a 92-89 victory Wednesday night in a Marmonte League 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's final attempt at a tying basket was foiled when Mike Martin got 
his hand on a Pioneer pass and knocked it into the backcourt as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The game took numerous weird twists from the final 20 seconds of regulation to 
the end of three overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' Jeremiah Nesbitt, who finished with 29 points, was at the free 
throw line attempting to tie the score with 19 seconds to play in regulation, 
when players from both teams went into the lane early. A jump ball was called, 
giving Thousand Oaks (5-4) possession under its basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers missed and were called for a foul on the ensuing scramble, but 
Simi Valley's Anthony Tauriello was called for a technical for taunting 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauriello missed the front end of a one-and-one for the personal foul, but 
Thousand Oaks' Martin made one of the free throws for the technical, tying the 
game and sending it to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final nine seconds of the first overtime, Tauriello, Nesbitt and Simi 
Valley's Scott Schnetzler all missed the first of one-and-ones that could have 
won the game, forcing the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had the ball out of bounds with the score tied, 30-30, with 30 
seconds to play in the second overtime, but Nowak was called for a five-second 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (4-1) could not take advantage of the turnover and the game went 
to a third overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan's free throw with 1:39 to play in the third overtime gave Thousand 
Oaks a 90-89 lead. Simi Valley was called for traveling and Thousand Oaks held 
the ball until Simi Valley was forced to foul, setting up Nowak's free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Van Etten scored 21 points for the Pioneers and Tauriello added 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin added 16 points, and Mike Lauer and Greg Winslow each had 14 for the 
Pioneers.

THE COLLEGES / FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ; VENTURA EXPOSED FOR POWER IT IS

 Lesson No. 1: Be cautious when Philip Mathews, the extraordinarily successful 
Ventura College men's basketball coach and master of the understatement, tries 
to downgrade his teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that with a sizable chunk of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 2: Believe Mathews when he outright anoints his team with praise. 
Especially early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That one you can take to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he backpedals later with one of his patented "we didn't play very well 
tonight" discourses, sad face and all, after another victory that wasn't smooth 
enough, convincing enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ever fall for that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, in essence, that's nothing more than a motivational ploy Mathews uses 
to remind his players never to let down their guard, never to be pleased with 
their effort no matter how splendid. 
</P>
<P>
 It has worked before and it is working now. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at this season's Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 They are off to a resounding start, with 13 victories in as many games and 
have systematically destroyed most of their opponents. It's wham, bam, here 
comes another slam. 
</P>
<P>
 They have scored 100 or more points eight times, including their first five 
games, and are averaging 99.8 points. They have won three tournaments. They 
came within three points of tying the school's single-game scoring record in a 
132-58 victory against Compton on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening the season with a modest No. 6 ranking in the state, the Pirates 
are now at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the big deal? 
</P>
<P>
 This bunch was supposed to be greener than Stanley Roberts after one pizza too 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the 12 men on the roster had never played at this level. They are 
freshmen. Not the redshirt types that Mathews occasionally keeps around so they 
can learn the program and get their academics in order before dressing for a 
real game, but the true thing straight from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two sophomores are virtually new too. One, 6-foot-3 guard Willie West, 
played sporadically last season. The other, 6-2 guard Lance Fay, redshirted 
after transferring from Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Pirates are playing like they've been together for years. Their fast 
break is like a flash, their game-long full-court press debilitates and 
eventually breaks opponents, and their work under the boards is relentless.  
</P>
<P>
 They operate in two five-man units that Mathews calls the "Orange and Black" 
teams and that he rotates in and out of games. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the glory so far belongs to former Santa Clara High standout Damien 
Cantrell and several out-of-state imports, including forward Hakeen Ward (13.8 
points and 7.6 rebounds per game) from New Jersey, center Curtis Ganes (12.8 
and 7.3) from Chicago and forward Gerald Zimmerman (11.2 points) from Lakeland, 
Fla. All are 6-6, and Ward and Ganes are powerfully built. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell, a forward, is averaging 11.0 points and 9.8 rebounds. Fay (10.5 
points) and point guards Rafer Alston (7.0 assists) and Jamal Cobbs (6.7 
assists) take good care of the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group, they have immense ability, perhaps more than the two Ventura teams 
that were 73-5 the past two seasons and reached the State title game both times 
but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were more methodical clubs that played within more rigidly defined 
parameters, and often rode the coattails of forward Brandon Jessie, the State 
co-player of the year last season who is now making his mark at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a team with all the components to go far, maybe even win it all. The 
Pirates have speed, shooting, depth. About the only thing lacking is experience 
and may the basketball gods have mercy on Ventura's opponents when this group 
matures. Think about it. These guys will be together for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jessie and the others departed, some wondered how long the rebuilding 
would take. But Mathews doesn't think in those terms. His approach is to 
reload. Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt the Ventura holster is packed. Mathews knew before the season 
he had another powerhouse and gleefully outlined his team's strengths. He said 
it was well-rounded and he was right. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also cagily predicted the Pirates would finish no better than third 
place in the Western State Conference North Division, a division they have won 
eight consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Right, Phil. Like we haven't been paying attention in class.

DIGEST: NEW HEARING DATE SET FOR BEAUREGARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new preliminary hearing date was set on Wednesday for Cal State Northridge 
football player Jonathan Beauregard, who is charged with two counts of 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In early November, Beauregard's preliminary hearing was scheduled for Friday. 
But on Wednesday in San Bernardino Municipal Court, his attorney, Grover L. 
Porter, requested that it be postponed until Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Porter is engaged in a trial and is unavailable because of the trial 
demands," said Wade Abbott, San Bernardino deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, 22, was arrested in August and accused of shooting his former 
girlfriend and her male companion outside a San Bernardino bar. He is free on 
$100,000 bail.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CONCORDIA SCORES ONE FOR LITTLE GUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might have been less than 15 seconds of fame, but the Concordia men's 
basketball team relished its brief moment in the spotlight last Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the evening, Concordia had beaten Northern Arizona, a Division I 
school. After settling down in front of televisions in their Flagstaff hotel 
rooms, the players started seeing the score flashed on the screens: 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (Calif.) 73, Northern Arizona 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time ESPN or CNN put up the score, Concordia Coach Greg Marshall heard 
another round of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every 15 minutes you would hear them yelling out from their rooms," Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure anybody slept that night. We had to get up at 6:30 to catch the 
flight home. I know I didn't get to sleep until 4, but it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Concordia, which plays in the NAIA, has beaten an NCAA 
Division I team; the Eagles are 1-1 against those schools. Cal State Fullerton 
beat Concordia, 80-66, last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona, in the Big Sky Conference, is struggling, but Marshall said 
they appeared formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just immense," Marshall said. "We looked like skinny step-children 
next to them. We were physically outmatched, but I think we're quicker than we 
have been in the past and we used that to our advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely felt like we sneaked up on them. Hopefully, it's going to give 
us a lot of confidence that we can play with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall was especially pleased with the way his team reacted when point guard 
Danny Barajas fouled out with 8 minutes 35 seconds left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas received his fourth foul for reaching in and his fifth on a technical 
for arguing the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona made both free throws and then a three-point shot to lead, 
56-52, but the Eagles responded with a 7-0 run and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia benefited from balanced scoring. Sam Sabbara, who took over at point 
for Barajas and played the last seven minutes with four fouls, had 14 points, 
five rebounds and five assists; Pharoah Jones had 16 points and eight rebounds; 
Jeff Putnam had 14 points; Craig Martin had 13 points, eight rebounds and five 
assists, and Tarik James had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (6-1) is off to its best start in Marshall's five seasons at the 
school, but the Eagles' early-season schedule hasn't been too tough. Excluding 
the Northern Arizona game, their average margin of victory is 41 points, 
including a 116-26 pounding of La Sierra. Claremont-Mudd beat the Eagles, 
75-72, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California College men's team received a boost when Kevin Carlson 
got significant playing time last weekend for the first time since early in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, a junior transfer from Fullerton College who had a sprained ankle, 
scored 21 points in a 73-68 loss to San Francisco State on Friday and 12 in a 
77-60 victory over American Indian College Saturday. The Vanguards (5-4) have 
been struggling on offense and Carlson provides the spark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at how Kevin's able to come out without practice and still shoot 
the ball well," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson's brother, Brian, a freshman who played at Katella in 1992-93, played 
and is also working his way into the lineup. Surgery to remove bone chips in 
his foot has kept him out most of the season, but Reynolds is impressed with 
his aggressive play. He had five points and 10 rebounds in 20 minutes against 
American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman center Stefan Mumaw had an embarrassing gaffe during the Panthers' 
73-57 loss to Pomona-Pitzer last week. Mumaw was fouled and sent to the 
free-throw line for two shots, but Mumaw -- and the Pomona-Pitzer announcer -- 
thought it was a one-and-one situation. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Mumaw missed the first free throw, he rushed to the ball, picked it up 
and threw down a thunderous dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 No other player moved and the referee told Mumaw it was a two-shot foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear the guy said one and one," Mumaw said later. "But it was a really 
good dunk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (4-3) will try to end a two-game losing streak at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday when they play host to Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman women's basketball team will try to extend a two-game winning 
streak when the Panthers play host to La Verne at 5:30 p.m. Saturday. Chapman 
(3-3) beat Occidental, 69-67, last week when Melissa Starr put in a rebound 
with two seconds left and defeated Redlands, 70-62. . . . Concordia women's 
volleyball player Amy Bonacorsi, a junior outside hitter from Spring Valley, 
has been named first-team GTE All-District VIII for the second consecutive 
season. Bonacorsi, a biology/liberal arts major, has a 3.857 grade-point 
average.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ARMED WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE, COP GIVES RAP A GOOD REP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 HIP-HOP COP: Roosevelt Matthews, a.k.a. Rosie the Rapping Cop, a.k.a. One 
Time, has as many aliases as some of the hoodlums he puts behind bars. But the 
Hawthorne police officer says he will use any name -- or music style -- to get 
through to high school students these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, a former gang member who made headlines two years ago by taking on 
rapper Ice-T over the controversial song "Cop Killer," has put together his own 
rap act with a different message: Fade the color lines. That includes stopping 
the crime, violence and racial tension that has plagued many youths in local 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap is the music and the lyrics that these kids listen to and understand, 
Matthews said Tuesday before a show at Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to learn that they've got other options than 'jackin' people' and 
gangbangin', " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, with its multimedia display, dancers, hip-hop dance music and 
free-style rap artists, has all the trappings of a full-scale concert tour. But 
the positive message in songs such as "Who's Jackin' Who?" and "Undercover," 
Matthews says, is a rebuttal to the so-called gangsta rap that glorifies sex, 
violence and lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking the law into your own hands is just not the way to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Matthews wants to take his act on the road. To that end, he hopes to 
enlist the help of local officials, including Hawthorne Mayor Larry Guidi, to 
spread the word about his show. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi, who says that he and Matthews have been friends since the officer 
pulled him over for a traffic violation several years ago, has already found a 
backer for Matthews' next show and hopes to get other school districts 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews says he just wants to get his message out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can work together. I'm the proof. I'm the example."

 SOUTH BAY FIFEDOM: If Mayberry's Barney Fife were alive and hangin' out in the 
South Bay, chances are he'd stick out in upscale, surfed-out Manhattan Beach 
like grits at a sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not how Los Angeles Magazine sees it. The magazine's latest cover 
story compared Manhattan Beach to Mayberry in naming it the fourth-best place 
to live among 20 surveyed in the Los Angeles basin.  
</P>
<P>
 The survey ranked neighborhoods in 10 categories by quantifying such criteria 
as medical facilities, climate and living conditions. Beverly Hills surprised 
no one by topping the list, which included neighborhoods across the Los Angeles 
spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach ranked among the best for its low crime rate and schools but 
suffered in its cultural and culinary rankings -- as, you might expect, would a 
town sporting Andy Griffith at the helm. You could find more serious art in a 
traveling carnival, the article sneered. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach Councilman Jack Cunningham approved of the rating, but 
confessed that he didn't quite get the Mayberry thing. "Manhattan Beach is sort 
of our own little world here, kind of out of the swing of L. A.," he said. "It 
doesn't really have a small-town atmosphere, though. But I guess they have to 
say something in L.A. Magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey might be more credible if it didn't give its second-place ranking 
to, of all places, Culver City -- putting it ahead of third-place Santa Monica 
and far beyond Brentwood (ranked 11th) and Malibu (17th). "I used to live near 
there, and that (ranking) was kind of a surprise," Cunningham said. "But it's 
kind of like the preseason basketball rankings; teams are ranked No.1 and then 
they get clobbered."  
</P>

 MARINA MARAUDERS: The masked prowlers have always been a problem at San 
Pedro's Cabrillo Marina. They slink past security with ease, stealing food and 
vandalizing property. Boat owners have even opened their boats and startled 
groups of them relaxing in nautical splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing they're only raccoons. But the furry little terrorists have been 
making life miserable for marina denizens, as well as residents of the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. And they seem to be laughing at the efforts of marina Manager 
Bob Hyde to corral them. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time a member of our security patrol looked out the window, and they were 
camped out on the back porch of the office," Hyde said. "It was kind of like, 
'Yeah, here we are, and what's for dinner?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Hyde has thrown up his hands and called in a professional trapping service 
to escort the unwanted guests from the premises. State-licensed Animal Trapping 
and Removal Service in the past month has relocated more than a dozen raccoons 
from the marina to more sparsely populated wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think after you haul 15 or 16 of them away, you wouldn't have many 
left," a bemused Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Piercy, owner of the trapping service, said the peninsula is probably the 
area most populated by raccoons, possums and skunks from Malibu to San 
Clemente. But the East Coast has it much worse, he said -- the animals are more 
numerous, and rabies is increasingly common among them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Piercy said animals clean up after people. "The more people and more trash, 
the more there will be some part of nature behind them cleaning up." QUOTE OF 
THE WEEK

ANDERSON: THE MAN WHO GOT THINGS DONE; OBITUARY: THE LATE CONGRESSMAN'S TALENT 
FOR SECURING FUNDS FOR LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS MAY BE HIS LEGACY. PORTS, FREEWAYS 
AND SUBWAYS BEAR HIS MARK.

<P>
 Through 12 terms, former Democratic Rep. Glenn M. Anderson rarely took the 
forefront of partisan turf wars, social controversies or foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to lining up federal support for freeway tunnels or rail 
lines, he was a master. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson died Tuesday at 81 from complication of Alzheimer's disease, almost 
two years after he retired from a lengthy career that took him to City Hall, 
Sacramento and Washington. Although he gained the limelight as lieutenant 
governor in the 1960s, his ability to shepherd an endless list of public works 
projects through Congress could be his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always talk about making their mark and leaving something behind," 
said former Long Beach Councilman Ray Grabinski, a longtime family friend. "You 
cannot walk around L.A. County without seeing the mark of Glenn Anderson." 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, which he headed 
from 1988 to 1990, he made possible the Port of Los Angeles' main shipping 
channel (called the Glenn M. Anderson Deep Ship Channel), the Century (105) 
Freeway (officially named for him) and Metro Rail (which has a plaque in his 
honor at a Downtown Los Angeles station). His moniker is also on a park in 
Redondo Beach and a federal building in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went back to Washington, I always went to Glenn Anderson's office," 
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana. "He was the key congressman to 
get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics today may call the projects pork, but friends and supporters say he 
was coming through for the district and was critical in getting projects for 
other parts of the country through his powerful committee. Quiet and 
unassuming, he worked behind the scenes to persuade colleagues that the 
projects would have a national payoff.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a swashbuckler," said Grabinski, former chairman of the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission. "If you met him, you would not even 
know he was a congressperson. You felt that you were around someone who was a 
doer, but you never felt like you were standing in his shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Grabinski, shortly after Anderson was elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1968, he got wind that a New York congressman somehow was 
close to securing money for a state highway project. But the House had a policy 
that coast-to-coast interstate projects would take priority. Rather than raise 
a stink, Anderson let the legislator know that he supported the New York 
project -- and wanted the same thing on the West Coast. He got funding to 
complete the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an early glimpse in his ability to understand how things worked," 
Grabinski said. "You kept things rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, he secured the controversial Metro Rail project by making it 
part of a omnibus bill that included money for transit programs throughout the 
country. By the time it reached the House floor, Anderson had made so many 
deals with other representatives that its victory was assured. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he was able to do was translate the importance of his projects to his 
colleagues, how it would benefit this country and the economy," said Ezunial 
(E. Z.) Burts, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Anderson's efforts were directed at the Port of Los Angeles, which he 
used to call "the sleepy little port."  
</P>
<P>
 His plan to double the cargo-handling capacity of the Ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach helped make the region a world leader in international trade, Burts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was initially uninterested in politics. Raised in Hawthorne, he spent 
the 1930s putting his UCLA education to use as a real estate developer and 
investor. He had to be nudged by the local Masonic Lodge into running for City 
Council in the late 1930s. (A friend filled out his nomination papers.) He lost 
but ran again in 1940, and the council elected him mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a spot in 1942 on the state Assembly, where he persuaded lawmakers that 
the suburban city, with its growing defense industry, was in dire need of more 
schools and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the kind of man you knew was honest and sincere," said Dorothy 
Andersen, 85, of Hawthorne, a longtime family friend. "The other (legislators) 
knew that if they gave him support, he'd give them support. They respected 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson left the Assembly in 1951 and went on to be elected lieutenant 
governor in 1958. He was filling in for Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who was out 
of the country, when the 1965 Watts riots broke out. Anderson came under 
criticism for being slow to mobilize the National Guard to quell the 
disturbance, and both Anderson and Brown lost reelection bids a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Hawthorne residents felt Anderson was unfairly criticized for the riots, 
Dorothy Andersen said, and with their support, he scored a political rebirth in 
1968, when he was elected to Congress. He won a narrow reelection victory after 
his first term but thereafter was reelected easily. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1980s, Anderson showed signs of slipping. In 1990, fellow 
Democrats stripped him of the chairmanship of the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, saying his age had left him too reliant on his staff 
and unable to hold his own in policy discussions. With state Democrats poised 
to carve up his district once again, he decided not to run in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson insisted at the time that the political challenge wasn't what 
made him retire. Early in his career, he said, he was frustrated with elderly 
politicians who wouldn't give up their office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt, 'Now why don't they retire?' " Anderson said. In recent years, he 
added, "I tried to tell myself I was not as far behind as those people I 
thought about years ago. But maybe I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is survived by his wife, Lee; daughter Melinda Anderson Keenan; sons 
Evan Anderson Braude and Glenn Michael Anderson, and six grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday at Mary Star of the Sea Church, 
7th and Meyler streets in San Pedro. Burial will be private at Green Hills 
Cemetery.

COLLEGE STATION SIGNALS CHANGES IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving near El Camino College, you may find your radio blasting the "Star 
Trek" themes, hip-hop music or even the home football games now that the 
school's first radio station is on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and faculty from the electronics department knitted together about 
$250 worth of used equipment to create the 15-watt station, which broadcasts at 
1620 on the AM dial. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal communications law prohibits college radio stations from broadcasting 
more than a few hundred feet from the school, so don't expect to hear Radio El 
Camino throughout the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the station has enough power to be heard on radio headsets and boom boxes 
across the campus. And students from many departments on campus are getting 
involved in the programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Diaz, 22, takes courses in broadcast journalism. For the radio 
station, he has developed a sports talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen a (control) board before," Diaz said. He plans to expand the 
show to interview athletes on campus and celebrity sports figures as well. He 
also helps out with the station's news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronics students provide the technical support for the 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
programming. Administrators recruited disc jockeys through flyers and posters, 
and more than 50 potential radio personalities turned up for the orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as their programming doesn't violate federal laws, students are free 
to play whatever they want. The disc jockeys air everything from big band jazz 
to rap, rhythm and blues, and punk, with television themes popping up from time 
to time. The station also has the capacity to take calls from listeners, but so 
far, no talk shows are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking for any budding Howard Sterns," said Doug Marston, the 
electronics instructor who created the station. Marston said he wanted his 
students to have a chance to get hands-on experience with an AM system, so he 
kept his eyes open and bought equipment at swap meets and electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The system uses electrical lines inside campus buildings as an antenna. The 
radio signals and electrical current can travel on the same lines because they 
use different frequencies, Marston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Lois, 20, is the host of a one-hour show twice a week. His playlist is 
mainly hip-hop, which he dubs from friends' tapes or gets from people with 
garage studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly, I play stuff that doesn't usually get on the air," Lois said. His 
favorite bands include a Tribe Called Quest, Freestyle Fellowship and Ras Kass. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Lois' first time on the air, but he's not worried it will go to his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is El Camino -- how big can your head get?" Lois said.

BEACH OWNERSHIP PLAN IS MAKING LOCAL WAVES; FINANCES: IF THE COUNTY TAKES OVER 
OCEANFRONT SITES FROM THE STATE, CITIES MAY FACE MORE PRESSURE FOR HELP IN 
FUNDING OF LIFEGUARD AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 South Bay beach-goers probably will not see a difference if the county takes 
ownership of state beaches in Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach, but city 
officials say the transfer could affect local coffers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of like a little sailboat out here," said Redondo Beach City 
Councilwoman Marilyn White. "They're gonna do what they're gonna do, and we'll 
see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the County Board of Supervisors agreed to consider the state's 
proposal for the county to take over eight Southland beaches, including those 
in Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. The beach in Hermosa Beach is city-owned. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For years, local, county and state government officials have squabbled over 
which government agency was responsible for funding beach maintenance and 
lifeguard services. The county, which has called on South Bay coastal cities to 
contribute more money for upkeep, now provides the services on 31 miles of 
beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors extended a service arrangement with the state through March 
while they consider the cost of owning the beaches. Either way, city officials 
will have to decide whether to contribute more money to the county to pay for 
lifeguard and beach maintenance services. 
</P>
<P>
 Service costs at all the state beaches, including Malibu, Topanga, Dan 
Blocker, Pointe Dume, Las Tunas and Royal Palms, amount to about $4.3 million 
annually -- a burden the county says it cannot shoulder alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Responding to county requests for more money earlier this year, the Redondo 
Beach City Council voted against boosting its contribution from $145,000 to 
$200,000 a year. Manhattan Beach, which contributes about $220,000 a year from 
funds collected from parking meters, also refused to contribute additional 
money. The cities are now negotiating with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the cities have declined to contribute more money, the county has 
continued to provide services. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it currently is, I think the system is great," said Manhattan Beach Mayor 
Tim Lilligren. "But it's short-lived, I suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 If the county takes ownership of the beaches, the state should contribute 
funds for maintenance and lifeguards, said Manhattan Beach City Councilman Jack 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's preposterous to expect the county and cities to fund the 
complete cost of maintaining their beaches," he said. "People from all over the 
state use these beaches."  
</P>
<P>
 A takeover of state beaches probably will cost the county more money, 
officials say. The county also could lose more money that has been provided 
from the state in past years for capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district covers much of the South Bay, argued 
that ownership of local beaches would give the county greater flexibility.

TORRANCE DEFENDS CHANGES IN SAFETY PACT WITH MOBIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bristling at claims that they secretly weakened a much-praised safety pact, 
Torrance officials are defending their decision to alter the rules under which 
the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery would have to stop using toxic hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done nothing in secret," Mayor Dee Hardison announced Tuesday after 
the Torrance City Council heard a lengthy report on the status of its 1990 
safety pact with Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance officials prepared that report in response to criticism that the city 
and Mobil privately modified that pact just months before the year-end deadline 
for a key report on the safety of hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to the Sept. 30 change behind closed doors because it 
was considered a matter of litigation, city officials have said. It was first 
reported by newspapers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists have charged that the change will make it easier for 
Mobil to continue using the acid, which has been ranked as one of the most 
dangerous chemicals used in the Los Angeles Basin. Tests have found that the 
acid can form a dense, ground-hugging fog potentially lethal for miles.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 pact was devised after the city brought a public-nuisance lawsuit 
against Mobil, and originally called for the oil giant to stop using the acid 
by the end of 1997 unless it could find a safer form by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city recently agreed to allow Mobil to continue using "HF" as long as 
a study of a newly modified form of the acid -- due by Dec. 31 -- shows it is 
safer than the chief alternative: sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure that whatever was done at the refinery was the safest 
alternative," said Michael Leslie, an attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was the city -- not Mobil -- that initially suggested reopening 
the language governing hydrofluoric acid, Leslie said. And Ernest Getto of the 
law firm Latham & Watkins, which represents Mobil, said cities commonly ask 
industry to do risk analyses such as the one called for by the new language. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Tuesday meeting, Torrance resident Craig Kessler criticized the 
decision to change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they've knocked the legs out from under the cornerstone of the 
agreement," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 A court-supervised safety adviser is to issue a report by Dec. 31 on whether 
Mobil can continue using the acid. The city and Mobil then have 30 days to make 
comments, officials said. But the safety adviser has been instructed by the 
retired judge overseeing the pact not to talk to the media.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PENINSULA; SHERIFF'S DEPT. OPENS LOW-KEY CENTER AT MALL 
</P>

<P>
 On the quiet Palos Verdes Peninsula, even getting information on building 
permits can be a pleasant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 With pop music and jazz wafting through the air, residents now can find 
information on everything from fire safety to Neighborhood Watch programs 
inside a former flower store and storage room at the Shops at Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Working from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department volunteers will answer questions and pass out flyers from 
the Community Resource Center inside the Rolling Hills Estates mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Danny Gomes, who is overseeing the airy, well-lit center, acknowledges 
that the name is a bit bland, but officials feared that calling it a sheriff's 
substation would indicate crime was a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you call it a community center, you don't have to worry about that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sheriff's Department stars are emblazoned on the center's doors, 
deputies will make only periodic visits for phone calls and supplies. 
Otherwise, unarmed civilian volunteers will staff the center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rolling Hills Estates Councilwoman Barbara Rauch said the center will give 
shoppers a sense of security and possibly deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also a place someone could run to as a safety spot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall manager Elena Butorac said she first discussed the need for a convenient 
community center several months ago with the local sheriff's captain and the 
Rolling Hills Estates city manager. But she noted that all peninsula cities 
that contract with the Sheriff's Department will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies contract with three of four peninsula cities -- Rolling Hills, 
Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes -- but the main substation is on 
Narbonne Avenue in Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall provided and furnished the 868-square-foot center. Butorac valued the 
donation at a couple thousand dollars, and said the center will remain as long 
as it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the mall, which provides unarmed security guards, has few 
security problems. But one shopper welcomed the possibility of more deputies 
passing through the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to see more guns here," he said, recalling the 1992 armed robbery 
of Finley's Jewelers, located next to the community center. JEFF KASS

PARK

<P>
 The City Council agreed to allow a Nativity scene to be displayed in a city 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city owns a portion of a Nativity scene that has been in a city storage 
facility for years.Resident Karen Johnson requested that Hermosa Beach 
residents be allowed to install the scene in Greenwood Park at Aviation 
Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to allow the installation. Mayor Robert (Burgie) Benz 
and Councilman John Bowler opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Nativity scenes are lovely," Bowler said, "but the question is 
whether the city should be in the position of sponsoring one particular 
religion. I just think it opens up an unnecessary debate." 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently killed a plan to begin each council meeting with a 
prayer. Councilwoman Julie A. Oakes, who opposed the prayer, said a Nativity 
scene is a separate issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the Nativity scene," she said. "Christianity is the majority 
religion in this country. If they want a menorah, that's great too." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Stephen Burrell said the reason the city has not displayed the 
scene in recent years has more to do with budget constraints than 
constitutional issues. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAWNDALE; PROBE OF POSSIBLE THEFT OF SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating the disappearance of 
$25,000 from a Leuzinger High School scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the money may have been stolen, said Detective Arlo Thykeson. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, the school was given $25,000 by a private donor to pay the 
college expenses of a deserving Leuzinger graduate, said Anne O'Brien, 
administrator of financial services for the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District. To keep the money separate from district funds, Principal Sonja Davis 
gave the check to a student store clerk, Jeffrey Kern. Kern was told to open an 
account similar to the store's account, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the scholarship winner tried to claim the money two weeks ago, it was 
found that an account had not been set up and the money could not be found. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1994, Kern was caught forging signatures and depositing store 
funds into his private bank account, O'Brien said. A district audit revealed 
that Kern had taken $14,000. In May, 1994, he was sentenced to probation and 
ordered to pay back $8,000. A $5,000 donation from the school's booster club 
made up the difference, O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said officials may have traced the missing $25,000 scholarship check 
to the booster club's bank account. The president of the booster club, Cheryl 
Robinson, is Kern's mother, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson declined to comment. Kern's attorney said his client has not been 
charged in this new investigation. JON GARCIA

the city's Chamber of Commerce director, and Armondo Herrera, 51, a supervisor 
in DeLong's office, plan to run for the $78,600-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 3, the south-central portion of the city, Councilman Stevan Colin 
is barred from seeking reelection because of term limits. Four candidates will 
compete for his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 William N. Gaillard, a 42-year-old salesman, and Steve Bopp, a 46-year-old 
sales representative, both filed papers, as did Mike Gin, a 31-year-old 
engineer and business owner, and Frank Bostrom, an architect. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 5, the northernmost section of Redondo, City Councilwoman Marilyn 
White seeks a second term. She will face Kim Marie Lewis, a 34-year-old 
engineer, and Barry J. Brennan, a 27-year-old businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 9 was the deadline for filing candidacy papers. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; DA TO SEEK DEATH FOR COUPLE'S ATTACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The district attorney's office says it will seek the death penalty against an 
Oregon man convicted Tuesday of seven charges, including murder with special 
circumstances, for the May, 1993, home-invasion slaying of a man and the 
assault and shooting of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Eugene Garcia -- a 24-year-old Portland resident who had a history of 
burglary arrests at the time of the Torrance shootings -- was convicted after a 
trial during which his court-appointed attorney called no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found guilty of killing Joseph Finzel and assaulting Lynn Finzel, and 
was also convicted on burglary, robbery and related charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence was pretty overwhelming," Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said 
after the jury returned with the list of guilty verdicts. Thomas said the 
district attorney's office would seek the death penalty in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was wearing Joseph Finzel's wedding ring when he was arrested. Lynn 
Finzel identified him as her attacker and her husband's killer. And several of 
Garcia's Oregon friends told police he'd confessed to the late-night rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the trial, Lynn Finzel took the stand to describe how 
Garcia entered their 180th Place home on May 8, 1993, through an unlocked door, 
beginning a terrifying ordeal that lasted more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 With her baby sleeping nearby, Finzel said, Garcia woke her up at about 11:15 
p.m., tied her up and assaulted her. When Joseph Finzel arrived home, Garcia 
shot and killed him with one of the family's guns, then shot Lynn Finzel twice. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two hours, Finzel said, she played dead on the bullet-punctured 
water bed as Garcia ransacked the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been married less than a year, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of murder with special circumstances -- in this case, the special 
circumstance being commission of other crimes -- Garcia will face either the 
death penalty or life in prison without possibility of parole. The sentencing 
phase of the trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 3.

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; MEN GET 30-YEAR TERMS IN MISTAKEN-IDENTITY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Calling their crime a "cowardly, unbelievable act of violence," a Torrance 
Superior Court judge sentenced two gang members to the maximum 30 years to life 
in prison for the doorstep slaying of a Gardena chemist they mistook for a 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah Angel DeGuzman, 20, of Carson and John Paul Madrona, 19, of Redondo 
Beach sat silent as an angry Judge John P. Shook flayed them for the November, 
1993, shooting of Tracy Takahashi. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be punished and punished severely," Shook told them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the prison sentence, Shook also fined each man $10,000, saying 
they could earn the money by making license plates in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Madrona's attorney, Edward Robinson of Redondo Beach, said that although most 
California prisoners serve a little more than half of their sentences, his 
client will be imprisoned more than 20 years because of the public's outrage 
over the mistaken-identity murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory D. Jennings said: "All (Takahashi) did was answer 
his own door." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently looking for revenge on a rival who had recently testified against 
another member of their gang, DeGuzman and Madrona rang the bell at a South 
Dalton Avenue apartment shortly after midnight Nov. 16, 1993. But the man 
prosecutors believe they planned to kill lived next door, in a virtually 
identical apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi -- a boyish 30-year-old environmental chemist who had spent the 
evening playing volleyball and having dinner with friends -- opened his door, 
and the two shot him at least seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of DeGuzman and Madrona's gang testified against them in exchange for 
immunity. A jury deliberated four hours before convicting both men last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Before handing down the sentences last Thursday, Judge Shook read a letter 
from Takahashi's younger brother, Dean, a former business writer for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of sentencing, I think it's important for everyone involved in 
this case to be reminded that Tracy was a real person," Dean Takahashi wrote. 
"His home was a gathering place. Friends often came over . . . and stayed late 
into the night. That's why he answered the door so freely. He thought he was 
greeting a friend." ERIC SLATER

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; SCHOOL BOND ELECTION CANCELED; COSTS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne school officials have canceled a special election on a $15-million 
bond issue for school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The election, scheduled for March, would have been the third attempt by school 
officials to pass the bond measure, which lost by 18 votes in the June 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 3-2 vote, some board members said the cost -- an estimated $70,000 
-- led them to reverse their decision to hold the election. Board members 
Eleanor Escalante, James Baker and Shirley Duff voted to cancel the election. 
Officials said, however, that the issue may be put to the voters in June, when 
including the measure on the ballot would cost $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The expense would be lower because other cities and districts holding 
elections in June would split the cost, Duff said. The Hawthorne district would 
have been the only one on the ballot in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning for the maintenance and repair bond -- dubbed Measure B -- began 
last year, spurred by the need for new plumbing, locks and windows at many of 
the district's nine schools, said Pamela Fees, director of business services 
for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would cost Hawthorne property owners an average of $20 a year for 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure failed to gain the required two-thirds vote, proponents of 
the measure paid for a recount. The recount, however, upheld the election 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the board, unaware of the cost, voted unanimously to hold a 
special election to try to pass the measure again. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; HOSPITAL DEDICATES PRIMARY CARE CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new health center that emphasizes outpatient care has been dedicated at Los 
Angeles County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The $16.6-million center is expected to ease the demand on the county 
hospital's busy emergency room.It houses the primary care and internal medicine 
clinics, the urgent ambulatory care clinic, outpatient diagnostics and 
procedures, and an outpatient surgery area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus is on outpatient and primary care because that is what's happening 
in health care right now," said hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Moore-Oliver. The 
three-story center is expected to handle more than 63,000 patients per year, 
many of whom will be walk-in patients with urgent care problems. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the center's funding came from California's Construction 
Renovation and Improvement Program. The remaining portion was funded through 
the hospital's operating budget. KIM STEWART

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; SUPERINTENDENT QUITS, CITES BOARD CONFLICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne Schools Supt. Christa Metzger has announced that she will resign 
after 3 1/2 years as the district's top administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger cited changes in the management style of the school board as her 
reason for leaving. She did not want to leave the district in the middle of the 
school year, she said, but the school board refused to let her stay through 
June. Metzger declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate that I am leaving," Metzger said. "This isn't at all 
in the best interest of the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members declined to comment on Metzger's impending resignation but said 
they have not been searching for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Her original three-year contract was renewed by the board last February for 
one year.  
</P>
<P>
 Metzger joined the district in 1991 after serving for six years as 
superintendent for an elementary school district in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure in Hawthorne, Metzger said, she has tackled the district's 
budget problems while dealing with an increasing student population. The 
district's enrollment has swelled by more than 2,000 over the past five years, 
according to district statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger's latest project, pushing for a $15-million bond issue for school 
repairs, lost by 18 votes during the June elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Assistant Supt. Don Carrington will probably fill Metzger's 
position until a permanent replacement is found.

THEATER REVIEW; DRESSED-UP 'ANNIE' IS A HOLIDAY CHARMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a family show gift-wrapped for Christmas, it's hard to top the musical 
charmer "Annie," eye-poppingly staged by the Civic Light Opera of South Bay 
Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the classic Harold Gray comic strip "Little Orphan Annie," the 
enduring favorite is not a comic-strip musical but a musical that happens to be 
inspired by a comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie (the perfectly cast, 12-year-old "Annie" veteran Candice Oden) is the 
plucky spirit in all of us, wearing down cynicism and pessimism with unbridled 
hope in the Depression year of 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of the production's appeal is in the lavishly designed sets, 
notably the ragged Hooverville inhabited by that era's homeless and an 
orphanage straight out of Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar characters include the bald, blustery capitalist Daddy Warbucks 
(the on-target Jack Ritschel) and a grinning Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 
spinning around in his wheelchair (the amazing FDR-look-alike Tom Hatten, whom 
TV viewers may remember as the longtime host of the afternoon "Popeye" cartoon 
show on KTLA Channel 5). 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight is Oden's Annie singing the soaring "Tomorrow," one of the show's 
most memorable songs from lyricist Martin Charnin and composer Charles Strouse. 
The hefty pit orchestra is led by Dennis Castellano. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is vibrantly animated, with the exception of one mellow member: 
Sandy, Annie's loyal dog. Sandy (Tootsie, in real life) was last seen snuffling 
around the stage in last season's "Annie" in the Downey Civic Light Opera 
production. Talk about a working dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other pleasures is the agile Timothy Smith's conniving Rooster, who 
tries to pass himself off as Annie's long-lost father. Smith is a tall, wiry 
actor, and his body-contorting rooster impression is a hoot, straight out of 
slip n' slide old-time vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Freeman's hellish orphanage matron is a blowzy, gin-sipping monster 
who wakes her little charges to mop the floors at 4 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancing ensemble of those little ragamuffins is rousingly choreographed by 
the show's astute director, Craig Schaefer, and Patti Mariano. 
</P>
<P>
 A matinee performance last weekend filled the 1,424-seat Redondo Beach 
Performing Arts Center with an audience that appeared to be half children. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparatively young Civic Light Opera company, concluding its third year 
at the center, is doing something professionally right. Just a few hundred 
patrons short of a healthy 10,000 subscribers, the organization has brought new 
luster to the South Bay theater scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Next June, the company will attempt what few civic light operas seldom dare to 
do: gamble on the world premiere of an untested musical ("Western Star," 
written by Dale Wasserman of "Man of La Mancha" fame and set in the American 
West). 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman is using South Bay as a way-out-of-town Broadway tryout venue, but 
it's a refreshing wrinkle in the South Bay Civic Light Opera's programming. The 
three remaining South Bay shows scheduled for next year are standard fare: 
"42nd Street," "Phantom" and "The Sound of Music." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Annie," Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities, Redondo Beach Performing 
Arts Center, Manhattan Beach and Aviation boulevards, Redondo Beach; 8 tonight 
through Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, 7 p.m. Sunday; tickets $20 to 
$35. Ends Sunday. (310) 372-4477. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.

 AWARD WINNERS 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa tailback Michael Fikes, Peninsula center-linebacker Jeremy Sparling 
and Mary Star Coach Dino Andrie were the South Bay award winners Sunday at The 
Times' All-Star prep football brunch at the Guest Quarters Hotel in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Fikes, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior who led the area in all-purpose yards, was 
named back of the year. Sparling, a 6-3, 215-pound senior whose two-way 
excellence was a key to Peninsula's best season, was selected lineman of the 
year. Andrie, who guided Mary Star to its best season in 17 years, was awarded 
coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino College Coach John Featherstone, a Mira Costa graduate, was guest 
speaker and handed out certificates and plaques to the players selected to the 
South Bay and Westside All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Fikes helped Mira Costa (12-2) reach the Southern Section Division VII final 
for the second consecutive season with his all-around play. He rushed for 1,952 
yards and 20 touchdowns in 294 carries, and also contributed as a receiver and 
return specialist, finishing with 2,610 all-purpose yards and 22 TDs. He 
sometimes was used at quarterback when the Mustangs ran the option and played 
defensive back in several games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fikes was held to a season-low 47 yards rushing in 14 carries Saturday in Mira 
Costa's 16-0 loss to Arroyo Grande in the Division VII final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparling was the leader of a Peninsula offensive line regarded as one of the 
best in the area. His blocking -- he called the assignments at the line of 
scrimmage -- helped the Panthers (11-2) rush for an area-leading 3,845 yards on 
their way to the Bay League title and the Division II semifinals. On defense, 
he ranked among team leaders in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrie helped revive Mary Star's football fortunes in his first season as 
coach. The Stars, who were 3-26 in three previous seasons, finished 11-2 after 
tying for the Santa Fe League title and reaching the playoff semifinals for the 
first time since 1977, when Andrie was a junior at the school. Mary Star lost 
in the Division X semifinals to top-seeded Orange Lutheran, 7-6, when it failed 
on a two-point conversion try in an overtime tiebreaker. KNIGHT MOVES 
</P>
<P>
 How can a prep basketball team that starts three juniors and a sophomore still 
be considered experienced? 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell knows the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had nine returning guys before," Mitchell said of his team, which 
won the championship of the El Segundo tournament last week. "This is 
definitely my deepest and most experienced group despite its youth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights had only two seniors on last season's 15-11 team, which meant 
extensive playing time for underclassmen. Three sophomores started regularly 
and the team returned five players with experience as starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All nine (varsity returners) got good playing time (last season)," said 
Mitchell, in his sixth season at Bishop Montgomery. "I have 10 players who I 
feel good about." 
</P>
<P>
 The top newcomer is sophomore point guard Delano D'Oyen, a standout on the 
junior varsity team last season. D'Oyen was named all-tournament at El Segundo 
along with teammates Brandon McLemore, a senior forward, and Brandon Price, a 
6-5 junior wingman who was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, already getting attention from four-year colleges, averaged 16.7 points 
in Bishop Montgomery's four tournament victories. The Knights (4-0) beat 
Crespi, 54-50, in overtime in Saturday's final after defeating North Torrance, 
Whitney and Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery's depth was needed because the team played most of the 
tournament without starting forwards Eric Bingham, out because of a bad back, 
and Alvin Dunn, out because of a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're my two best inside guys," Mitchell said of Bingham, a senior, and 
Dunn, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key players include junior guard Mateo Camargo and senior forward Geno 
Malauulu, brother of former Carson High and Arizona quarterback George 
Malauulu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights play Schurr today in the first round of the 16-team La Canada 
tournament as they prepare for what promises to be a rigorous Del Rey League 
season against Serra, Bishop Amat, St. John Bosco, St. Paul and St. Bernard. 
LOSING IN AWE 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula High basketball Coach Cliff Warren called it "a nice little 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know how nice it was, but the Panthers definitely experienced an 
assault of talent Monday in their 78-54 loss to Mater Dei in the first round of 
the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 2-ranked team pulled away after Peninsula had closed to 
within six points, 50-44, early in the fourth quarter. Shaun Jackson, a 6-8 
senior forward, led Mater Dei with 26 points and 6-5 sophomore Schea Cotton 
added 19. Junior guard Phil Belin led Peninsula with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were great," Warren said of Mater Dei. "It will be interesting to see 
them play Westchester." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei and Westchester, ranked 15th in the nation, could meet in the final. 
NO JINX HERE 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore point guard Jim Williamson is off to a strong start for Loyola 
Marymount (4-1), which is enjoying its best start since the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The former South Torrance High standout ranks second among West Coast 
Conference players in assists per game (5.8) and is 10th in scoring with an 
average of 15 points. He also ranks in the top 10 in field-goal shooting 
(48.2%), free-throw shooting (80%) and three-point shooting (45%). 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, the WCC freshman of the year last season, is one of only two 
Loyola players who have scored in double figures in every game. In addition, he 
leads the team in minutes played, is tied for the lead with 10 steals and has 
three blocked shots, one more than all-conference forward Wyking Jones, who is 
6-7. Williamson is 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson's best game, at least from a scoring standpoint, came last week 
when he had 22 points in a 76-73 loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola resumes play Saturday night after a 10-day layoff because of finals 
when it plays host to Loyola of Chicago. J.C. NOTEBOOK

 Van Girard of Cal State Dominguez Hills became the school's all-time 
winningest women's basketball coach last week as the Toros won nonconference 
games against Point Loma Nazarene College, 108-76, and Cal State Stanislaus, 
79-60. Junior forward Faye Hagan led the Toros in both games with 30 and 22 
points, respectively. Girard, Dominguez Hills' third coach since the inception 
of the program in 1976-77, has a seven-season record of 85-68. The Toros (6-1) 
play at Southern California College at 5:30 p.m. Friday. ROB FERNAS

BOMB SCARE FORCES EVACUATION AT MALL; CRIME: MORE THAN 50,000 PEOPLE HAD TO 
LEAVE GLENDALE GALLERIA AFTER AN ANONYMOUS TELEPHONE THREAT. THREE FLOUR-FILLED 
PACKAGES WERE FOUND. 
</P>

 More than 50,000 shoppers and employees were driven out of the Glendale 
Galleria Wednesday as police, responding to an anonymous telephone threat, 
searched out and destroyed three packages that turned out to be heavily wrapped 
five-pound bags of flour, labeled "bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rotten thing for somebody to do during Christmas time," said Gil 
Juarez, the mall's Santa, who -- still in his red suit -- comforted frightened 
children in a nearby parking lot as the streets around the mall filled with 
dismayed shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers said there was widespread fear, but many others reported a 
fundamentally orderly evacuation of the 1.3-million square-foot mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was screaming," said April Regino, 14, who had caught a bus from 
Hollywood. A security guard "was running around for everybody to get out and 
everybody just started running," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation was ordered shortly after 2:45 p.m. when a male customer 
spotted a package marked "bomb 1" in a trash can in a second-floor bathroom, 
across from a police substation in the mall. About the same time, an anonymous 
caller told the 911 emergency switchboard in the Glendale police headquarters 
that there was a bomb in the mall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The call was traced -- as all 911 calls are automatically -- to a pay phone at 
Broadway and Pacific Avenue, about a block from the mall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering the evacuation, police sent for the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's bomb squad and searched the mall. Two more packages, labeled "bomb 3" 
and "bomb 4," were found by Glendale police officers in two other restrooms, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of the bomb squad's camera-equipped robot, guided by remote control, 
were unable to determine if the packages in the bathrooms were bombs, so bomb 
squad officers in protective clothing entered the building and blew up the 
packages with small charges of explosives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was somebody's idea of a practical joke," said Sheriff's Deputy Angie 
McLaughlin, who described the packages as five-pound bags of flour wrapped in 
brown paper and plastic and bound in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said deputies will analyze the fake bombs to determine whether they 
were the work of the same person who pulled a similar stunt at a Carson mall. 
The South Bay Pavilion was evacuated for several hours after a device, believed 
to be a pipe bomb, was found in a restroom Dec. 1. It was detonated by a 
Sheriff's Department bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Galleria spokeswoman Judy Smith said it was too soon to determine how much the 
bomb scare cost the mall -- which houses five major department stores and 264 
specialty stores and restaurants -- in lost Christmas business.

FIREFIGHTERS TESTIFY ON DEPARTMENT RACIAL STRIFE; GOVERNMENT: MANY AT COMMITTEE 
HEARING CRITICIZE CHIEF MANNING FOR HIS ROLE IN ALLOWING ALLEGED 
DISCRIMINATION. OTHERS SAY THEY HAVE NEVER WITNESSED BIAS. 
</P>

 Painting a picture of a department bitterly divided along racial lines, Los 
Angeles city firefighters on both sides of an emotional affirmative action 
debate testified Wednesday at a City Council committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of white and Latino firefighters at the Personnel Committee hearing 
rallied in support of the department and its chief, Donald O. Manning. But the 
vast majority of the speakers -- all African Americans -- detailed personal 
accounts of alleged racial and gender discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a woman, and I deserve that respect," said firefighter D'Lisa Davies, 
fighting back tears as she recounted allegedly being called a "black bitch" at 
a fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people packed the council chambers for the latest in a series of 
highly charged public hearings -- sparked by the release last month of a 
blistering city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 During four hours of testimony, several black firefighters attacked their 
chief for dismissing the audit as a "hatchet job" based on the grumblings of a 
few disgruntled firefighters. Others, such as Battalion Chief Rick Garcia, said 
they had never experienced discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you," Garcia flatly said, "I have never, never experienced the 
glass ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who sat expressionless through much of the hearing, acknowledged that 
problems exist on the 3,100-member force. But, the chief told council members, 
he is moving quickly to address the concerns and begin "the healing process" in 
a department torn by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to move forward with quality in what we do," Manning said. "We've got 
to get this issue behind us. It festers and gets worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Department morale is at an all-time low, firefighters say, and the force is 
badly split among those who contend that the chief has not pushed hard enough 
for affirmative action and others who believe that he has gone too far -- 
allowing hiring standards to be lowered to the point that recruits are washing 
out at high rates and unqualified firefighters are working in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The department -- long regarded as one of the nation's finest -- has come 
under increasing scrutiny for its hiring and promotion practices since the 
release of the harshly critical audit. The Personnel Department study concluded 
that white males dominate top posts and that women and minorities have been 
harassed and given unfair evaluations by supervisors in an effort to force them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who chaired Wednesday's meeting, has vowed to 
fully investigate the department and has scheduled another hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoned before Goldberg's committee last month, Manning was surrounded by a 
roomful of firefighters who closed ranks with their chief -- in stark contrast 
to Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing began with a report by Manning's human relations committee, which 
was created to address affirmative action issues. The committee, the chief 
said, has begun to implement many of the recommendations outlined in the 
Personnel Department audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, in groups of four, the speakers were called to present their 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Alicia Mathis, a representative of the 30-member Los Angeles Women 
in the Fire Service, said her group supported the audit's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about differential treatment of women on the Fire 
Department," Mathis said, adding that women have a more difficult time being 
promoted and sometimes face harsher treatment than male colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 William Parker, a fire inspector and 14-year veteran, told council members 
that racism exists throughout the department and that he had heard the epithet 
"nigger" used in a firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker then said he was one of the anonymous firefighters who was quoted in 
the Personnel Department audit, adding that he took exception with the chief's 
statement that he and the others were disgruntled employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak to you from a position of information and not because I am 
disgruntled," Parker said. "Describing them as disgruntled employees is 
ignorant. How can any intelligent person make such a blanket statement?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the most emotional testimony of the day, former firefighter La Tonya 
Marshall broke down in tears, sobbing for about five minutes as she charged 
that she was constantly called "hey girl" instead of her name at her fire 
station and subjected to unfair evaluations. She said she was fired in 1993 
while on leave with an ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope things change," she said. "We need people to help us. Not hinder 
or degrade us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Capt. Steve Norris, a 20-year veteran and board member of the 3,000-member 
firefighters union, said: "I have seen tremendous strides in affirmative 
action. I have never seen blatant discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the hearing, Manning was called back to the council dais, where 
he was criticized by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas for allowing his 
firefighters to jeer the Fire Commission on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was most unprofessional and unacceptable and it only gives credence to the 
very things we are concerned about that you consistently say do not happen," 
Ridley-Thomas said. "I want to say that to you as clearly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get the emotions moving in the right direction," Manning 
responded. "I don't have any qualms with oversight."

MAN IN THE NEWS; WHEN THE SHARK BITES, AN UNUSUAL EXPERT SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an inevitable aftermath to an encounter with a shark off the 
California coast: an encounter with insurance salesman Ralph S. Collier. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he's not out looking for business, but rather collecting data on the 
attacks. For more than 30 years, Collier has been a weekend warrior of the 
shark expert set, rushing out to record firsthand accounts, interview 
witnesses, examine bite marks and read autopsy results. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier, of Canoga Park, does not have a biology degree. He is not a 
scientist. He is not on staff at a university. He just likes sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County coroner's investigators said they never got around to 
calling Collier after a shark attack last week off San Miguel Island killed 
veteran diver James Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier called them first.  
</P>
<P>
 But coroner's investigator Larry Gillespie said he was planning to call 
Collier anyway. Gillespie plans to review his findings with Collier next week, 
when he will ask Collier's opinion on the species and size of the shark that 
killed Robinson, as well as possible reasons for the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on his expertise, even if it's just from amateur research over the 
years, we're going to rely upon what Ralph says," Gillespie said. "If he says 
the shark is so many feet long and so big around, we're definitely going to use 
his findings." 
</P>
<P>
 Collier says his credentials come not from academic training but from doing 
such research "longer than anyone else on this planet." 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who reject that claim, but none dispute his passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to understand why (sharks) do what they do," Collier said. "I 
did it the same way everyone else did it back then. We started gathering 
information and learned as we went." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ichthyologists, the scientists who study fish, say Collier is the shark 
attack version of an ambulance-chaser. A "shark groupie," one called him. 
</P>
<P>
 But others maintain that he has something to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isaac Newton never held a professorship," said Richard Rosenblatt, a 
professor of marine biology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who, 
like many in the academic world of fish, is familiar with Collier. "He has made 
sharks his hobby and there is nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Peter Klimley, a UC Davis marine behaviorist, have sought 
Collier's assistance. Klimley asked Collier to write what he called a modest 
piece on the variety of objects great white sharks have attacked for a book 
Klimley is editing called "Great White Sharks: Ecology and Behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "He does know something," Klimley said, "but there are more so-called experts 
who deal with white sharks than there are soccer players in L.A."  
</P>
<P>
 And by interviewing witnesses and victims, Klimley said, Collier might 
sidetrack victims from talking with trained experts whose full-time jobs 
include collecting such data. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no single dramatic event that piqued Collier's interest in the big 
killers; he has just wondered about them for as long as he can remember.  
</P>
<P>
 He tries to make contact with either the victim or a witness within 24 hours 
of the attack, he said. Most important, he wants to know what the victims were 
doing just before the attack and how long they were doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he adds Coast Guard and police reports to answer a battery of questions: 
What was the weather? Was the sky clear or cloudy? What was the water 
temperature? Air temperature? Clarity of water? Topography of the ocean floor? 
High or low tide? 
</P>
<P>
 Collier takes all the information, reports and pictures and tries to piece 
together what happened and in what order. He has learned to determine species 
and size by examining the size and shape of bite marks left in anything from 
surfboards to human flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always astounded us that more people have not been killed by white 
sharks off this coast," Collier said. "Which again leads me to believe that a 
motivation for a high percentage of shark attacks on humans isn't because they 
think we're food -- it's because they don't know what we are, so they swim up 
to take a bite out of us to figure it out."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: SIMPSON DISTRAUGHT IN JAIL VISIT, DEPUTY SAYS; THE 
EVOLUTION OF NEWS ETHICS IN REPORTING TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the defense pressing to speed up opening statements in the O.J. Simpson 
trial, the media battle may move soon from the streets to the courtroom where 
it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team has filed a motion calling for cancellation of a hearing 
scheduled for Jan. 4 on whether Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito should admit 
DNA evidence that the prosecution needs to back up its charge that Simpson 
murdered his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, this case has been a watershed in the relationship between the media 
and the law. Never before have there been so many outlets for information, 
ranging from solid news to the grossest of gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Bits of information speed along a news distribution system that includes 
newspapers, supermarket tabloids, magazines, computer networks, radio and TV 
talk shows, television news broadcasts and tabloid TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this news has come from outside the courtroom. Wednesday, for example, 
one of the news developments was a story that photographs of Nicole Simpson 
with a bruised forehead and injured left eye were taken from her Brentwood bank 
safe deposit box. The story originated not from a courtroom, but from a leak 
that spread from print to talk show television. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, I discussed the case and its coverage with a friend who has watched 
the growth of the news superhighway. She's Theo Wilson, who, as a reporter for 
the New York Daily News, covered some of the biggest trials of our time, 
including those of Dr. Sam Sheppard, the Manson family, Klaus von Bulow, Jack 
Ruby, Patty Hearst and Sirhan Sirhan. Now retired from the newspaper business, 
she's writing a book on the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started with TV cameras and radio people being excluded from the 
courtroom," Wilson recalled. "They needed a picture and sound. The lawyers 
learned to come down (to the courthouse steps) and give them a little rundown 
on what happened. They had a little press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the newspaper reporters) didn't go to them. But occasionally (the 
lawyers) would say something so wonderful and colorful that my buddies (in the 
electronic media) would tell me about it." 
</P>
<P>
 From this small beginning, the process grew. Eventually the lawyers expanded 
their reports on the day's proceedings into an interpretation of events that 
favored their clients -- the legal spin. "There were always lawyers who would 
do a spin," Wilson said. "If they were really good, they would whisper into a 
reporter's ear and hope they would use it. Nine times out of 10, I would say, 
'This is a wonderful bit of information. When it comes off the witness box I 
will use it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the news ethic of that day said you covered what happened 
inside the courtroom, not what was said outside. That's how trials were covered 
in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular day in the Simpson trial during jury selection in October 
showed how the dynamics of trial coverage have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a slow day. During the proceedings, an African American man was 
questioned by prosecutors. Pool reporters briefing their colleagues gave a 
factual summary of what was basically a non-newsworthy event. 
</P>
<P>
 It became news when defense attorneys Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Robert L. 
Shapiro accused the pool reporters of failing to report that prosecutors were 
demeaning prospective black jurors by the style of their questioning. The pool 
reporters, Shapiro said, should report "not only the wording but the body 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Their words were quickly carried around the country by television and radio 
and became the story of the day. "They were writing your lead," she said. But 
if Cochran and Shapiro had made their accusation in the courtroom, Wilson said, 
its news value would have been diminished. "The prosecution would have denied 
it," she said. "Judge Ito would have said 'cool it' " -- elements that would 
have diluted the impact of the defense charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once the opening statements are made, and witnesses begin testifying, the 
dynamics of the legal proceedings will change. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start getting real witnesses on the witness stand, in front of the 
jury, nothing can rival it," Wilson said. "I don't think anyone will care what 
Bob Shapiro or Denise Brown (Nicole Brown Simpson's sister) say outside. People 
will be listening, but it won't be as interesting. Once you get in that 
courtroom and stay in that courtroom, it's a whole different ballgame and 
there's nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Captivated by the drama, she said, a lot of people will watch a trial for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial phase, with its evidence and examination of witnesses, will be an 
education. And if there's any social value to this tragic event, it's that the 
trial is teaching us about a criminal justice system that is a powerful force 
in shaping our society. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And now a word from the readers: Several of them phoned Wednesday morning to 
object to the way I zinged Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman for calling the 
Rev. Rosey Grier "Mr. Grier" when he is an ordained minister. I said Hodgman 
wasn't treating Grier with the deference due a minister and should have called 
him Reverend Grier. The readers said I was showing my ignorance of grammar. 
Reverend, they said, is an adjective, like kindly, and should not be used as a 
title. Thus Hodgman was correct in referring to him as Mr. Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 Harpers Dictionary of Contemporary Usage agreed with the readers: "It is wrong 
to refer to or address a minister as 'Reverend Crawford." But the editors also 
published a long dissent from a writer who said, "My experience has been that 
the usage of careful and educated speakers in most congregations of Methodists, 
Baptists and most smaller denominations is to call the minister a reverend." 
The dissent, said the editors, "seems to us worthy of careful consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Grammar, like the law, provides no clear answers.

SIMPSON DISTRAUGHT IN JAIL VISIT, DEPUTY SAYS; TRIAL: HEARING DEALS WITH 
ADMISSIBILITY OF DEFENDANT'S CONVERSATION WITH ROSIE GRIER THAT OFFICER SAYS HE 
OVERHEARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A crying and distraught O.J. Simpson blurted out two sentences to friend and 
minister Rosey Grier during an emotional jailhouse visit Nov. 13, according to 
testimony Wednesday by a sheriff's deputy who says he overheard a snippet of 
their conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Deputy Jeff Stuart did not repeat what he said he overheard, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William Hodgman questioned him at length during a cryptic hearing 
in which prosecutors and defense attorneys were forced to argue about a 
statement that neither has read. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman was hoping to show that the conversation was so loud that Simpson and 
Grier waived the privilege that normally protects the privacy of discussions 
between an inmate and a clergyman. Simpson -- who has pleaded not guilty to the 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman -- seemed relaxed and 
cheerful as Wednesday's hearing unfolded, chatting quietly with his lawyers as 
the deputy testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether the jailhouse talk should remain confidential was 
unresolved at the end of the day, but Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito is 
expected to take it up again when Simpson's trial resumes this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sources close to the case said prosecutors drilled into Nicole Brown 
Simpson's safety deposit box last month and secured four photos depicting her 
with bruises and cuts. Although the photos purport to show injuries inflicted 
by O.J. Simpson, members of Simpson's camp downplayed the significance of the 
discovery, saying that the photos were taken in the wake of a 1989 incident in 
which Simpson pleaded guilty to spousal battery and noting that most if not all 
of the photos already were in the hands of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense attorneys angrily announced that they received more than 1,000 pages 
of prosecution material just hours before they are scheduled to begin a hearing 
this afternoon on the admissibility of evidence relating to "domestic discord" 
between O.J. and Nicole Simpson. Among the documents, they said, is a 64-page 
statement from Faye Resnick, whose salacious book about Nicole Simpson briefly 
flared as an issue in the case during jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors submitted their formal opposition to a defense proposal for 
hearing DNA evidence in the case. Simpson's lawyers want that hearing to take 
place after opening statements and in front of the jury. Prosecutors called 
that suggestion "as beguiling and simple on one level as it is misleading and 
without legal merit on the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was not resolved Wednesday, the issue of Simpson's conversation 
with Grier continued to overshadow the proceedings, this time as part of a 
mysterious hearing in which lawyers and witnesses talked at length about a 
short conversation but never revealed what was said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart said he had been doing paperwork in a control booth about 10 feet from 
Simpson when he heard a loud bang -- the sound of Simpson slamming down a phone 
in the visitors' area. Simpson then slammed his fist on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simpson appeared to be crying," Stuart testified. "He appeared to be very 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe Simpson's tone of voice during a brief exchange with Grier, 
Stuart replied: "He was yelling. . . . It was very loud, in a raised voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of two lead attorneys on Simpson's defense team, 
cross-examined Stuart for nearly an hour, eliciting the deputy's acknowledgment 
that the Sheriff's Department trains its staff not to eavesdrop on 
conversations between inmates and their ministers. Moreover, the deputy said he 
was stationed inside a glass booth whose windows are tinted -- which could have 
led Simpson to believe that no one was listening while he spoke with Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart added, however, that Simpson's girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, often peered 
through the tinted windows and waved at the deputies. She sometimes did that 
when Simpson was present, Stuart added, which Hodgman said demonstrated that 
Simpson should have known deputies routinely staffed the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Ito allows the statement to be shared with prosecutors, it is not 
clear that it would hurt Simpson's case. Although sources familiar with the 
statement say that it could be interpreted as incriminating to Simpson, they 
add that it is ambiguous. Cochran stressed Wednesday that the deputy did not 
hear the comments immediately before or after the exchange, so he does not know 
the context in which the remarks were made. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the exchange, Stuart wrote a document describing what he said he 
had heard. That document has been given to Ito, but it has not been turned over 
to the attorneys on either side of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A second set of comments allegedly overheard by three deputies two weeks later 
also were forwarded to Ito, but those do not deal with the Nov. 13 conversation 
between Grier and Simpson. After reviewing a copy of their statements, Cochran 
called them "much ado about nothing." Ito allowed prosecutors to have a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing underscored what has been a months-long legal tug of war 
between the Sheriff's Department and the defense team lawyers over where they 
can meet with Simpson outside of normal visitation hours at the Men's Central 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 From Monday through Thursday, lawyers and clients are able to confer in a 
first-floor room off the jail's main entrance where they can talk and -- with a 
deputy's permission -- pass documents between them across from tables with only 
a teller-like window between them. 
</P>
<P>
 But on weekends, they use a third-floor infirmary visiting room, where Simpson 
and his attorneys confer in private but are separated by glass and must speak 
to each other by phone. The Sheriff's Department favors the arrangement because 
a guard already is on duty and no overtime pay is required. Simpson's attorneys 
say they don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk about special privileges," Cochran said outside court. "Special 
privileges is we were put in a room where bailiffs could sit and stand right 
behind and listen. . . . We objected to being put in this room all along." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that visiting area, sitting behind tinted glass, that Stuart 
allegedly overheard a snippet of conversation Nov. 13 between Simpson and 
Grier. The incident was reported to Ito 15 days later. The next day, Nov. 29, 
Ito and the attorneys toured the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he would not return to the visitation area until there are better 
accommodations to ensure the confidentiality of conversations between him and 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assured we had it," he said. "The sheriff told us we had it. The 
judge told us we had it. And it turns out we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Owens, principal deputy county counsel, said the Sheriff's Department 
is making plans to modify the third-floor room to take care of privacy 
concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's our deal," Owens said. "When we have our modifications completed, 
Judge Ito is welcome to come back and look at it . . . and give it a yea or a 
nay. But Judge Ito has been pretty supportive of our position." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the judge and lawyers in the Simpson case proceeded with their spirited 
series of debates over the evidence that will be presented to the jury, 
prosecutors lodged their formal objection to a novel defense proposal for 
dealing with DNA test results. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion filed Tuesday, Simpson's lawyers suggested that Ito delay the 
vitally important DNA hearing and instead allow them to argue the merits of 
scientific evidence in front of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the defense proposal, the jury, which normally is excluded from such 
sessions, would be allowed to sit in on the DNA debate, one that could involve 
weeks of highly technical information. As expected, prosecutors objected 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A jury confronted with several weeks of unnecessary scientific testimony will 
be both unduly burdened with irrelevant evidence and forced to forget important 
facts," prosecutors said in their motion. "Neither (the defense) nor the 
prosecution should be compelled to abandon the orderly presentation of 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Before tackling the question of whether DNA test results should be allowed 
into court, the two sides are readying for another hotly contested debate over 
evidence. This afternoon they are expected to begin a hearing on the 
admissibility of evidence relating to domestic abuse during the time that O.J. 
and Nicole Simpson were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the information that prosecutors may ask Ito to accept are a 1985 
incident in which Simpson allegedly smashed the window of a car, a 1989 case 
where Simpson pleaded no contest to charges of spousal battery, and a 1993 
incident during which Nicole Simpson called for police assistance as a man she 
identified as her ex-husband tried to break into her house. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear how the four photographs of a cut and bruised Nicole Simpson 
seized from her safe deposit box last month might be used in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had most, if not all, of the photos from the 1989 incident; a 
court order from last fall refers to photographs from that incident and notes 
that they were then in possession of the Police Department. Nicole Simpson 
apparently kept copies, which were among the items seized when authorities 
drilled into her safe deposit box, sources said.

BUILDER SCRAPS CONTROVERSIAL HIGH-RISE PLANS

 Bowing to bitter opposition from homeowners and Native American groups 
Wednesday, a developer abruptly canceled one of the biggest development 
projects being considered by the city of Los Angeles -- a 30-story, 335-unit 
complex at Wilshire Boulevard and Barrington Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before the City Council, attorneys for developer Robert Friedman said 
he will withdraw his request for the zoning variances and general plan 
amendments he needed to expand the Barrington Plaza Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too difficult to develop in this city," said Friedman, who 
estimated that he has spent $4 million on legal fees and other costs associated 
with the project. "We decided to take our investment and develop elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council debate on the development began Tuesday, when more than 300 
construction workers joined Friedman and a phalanx of lobbyists and attorneys 
in council chambers to support the expansion. Wearing lime-green stickers 
saying, "Yes Plaza," they were met by opponents who said the project would 
create overcrowding in the area and threaten a nearby freshwater spring, once 
the site of a Native American settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few hours of heated discussion, the council decided to continue debate 
for one more day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Friedman said that although he had the council votes necessary 
to approve the project, he had decided not to go forward because he was 
concerned about the high cost of fighting potential lawsuits over the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city's Planning Land Use and Management Committee approved the 
expansion, which according to supporters would have created 1,100 construction 
jobs and an annual construction payroll of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the expansion expressed surprise at Friedman's decision. But they 
said that given the vociferous opposition from homeowners groups and Councilman 
Marvin Braude, whose district includes the project site, council rejection was 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the developer got the message . . . that not only did nine of 10 
people in the community oppose this project, but that 10 of the . . . people on 
the City Council opposed it as well," said Jon Shaughnessy, a coordinator with 
the West Los Angeles Community Organization, a community group that has fought 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude said: "I have never seen a matter before the council where there were 
so many lobbyists and so much pressure exerted. I'm very proud that this 
council acted with such independence."  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the development contended that it would have further packed the 
densely residential area and increased traffic, overloading the congested 
Wilshire Boulevard corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was already the most densely populated parcel in the area and they 
wanted to go beyond that," said Larry Watts, president of the Brentwood 
Community Federation, a residents group.  
</P>
<P>
 Opposition also came from the Gabrielino/Tongva Indian tribe, which voiced 
concern that the project would have irreparably damaged the nearby springs. The 
springs, which are federally protected, flow onto the grounds of University 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The springs are safe for now," said Dee Garcia, a member of the tribe. "But 
we never know what developers are trying to do to destroy our sites with no 
regard to their sanctity."

CAMARILLO WARNED OF STADIUM'S PITFALLS; GOVERNMENT: COUNCIL HEARS FROM A 
COMMUNITY WHOSE FUNDS WERE STRAINED WHEN IT BUILT SPORTS FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A city councilman whose community recently built a minor league stadium warned 
the Camarillo City Council on Wednesday that it should avoid spending any 
significant amounts of city money on a proposed $15.6-million baseball stadium 
in western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 George Alongi, a first-term councilman from Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, 
told the council that within one year he watched a reported $8.5-million 
stadium project in his city balloon into a $24-million project that depleted 
his city's redevelopment agency budget and forced officials to dip into the 
city's general reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think minor league baseball is a great type of recreation. But I'm here 
tonight to warn you about the pitfalls -- it's not all glory," Alongi said. "My 
recommendation is that you let the private sector build this stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 After Alongi's presentation, Camarillo Mayor Michael Morgan stressed that the 
council went on record last month with its opposition to spending any public 
funds for the proposed Tri-Cities Baseball Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council also asked for a status report in January from the 
Ventura County project's consultants, whose principal adviser also worked on 
the Lake Elsinore stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongi said that a great portion of the cost overruns were attributed to the 
city wanting to open the facility, known as the Lake Elsinore Diamond Stadium, 
by April in time for the start of the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet that date, construction crews sometimes worked around the clock. 
Officials estimate that more than $10 million in cost overruns added to the 
project's growing expense.  
</P>
<P>
 Alongi agreed to speak to Camarillo council members Wednesday at the request 
of Citizens Opposed to Public Spending, a Camarillo group fighting any city 
financing for the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of the Lake Elsinore project by community activists sparked a 
Riverside County grand jury investigation into the way the city financed the 
project, which opened for its first season in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In their Dec. 5 interim report, grand jurors issued Lake Elsinore officials a 
scathing rebuke and called for an independent audit of the stadium's financing 
plan. They also called for the creation of an independent citizens' finance 
review committee to advise the city's Redevelopment Agency on any future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura earlier this year decided to 
examine the possibility of bringing minor league baseball to the county by 
building a state-of-the-art stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the councils have agreed to pay jointly for an $85,000 preliminary 
study of the proposed 5,500-seat stadium and have settled on a site: an 
undeveloped parcel behind the Ventura Auto Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum Group, which manages the Lake Elsinore site, has recommended the 
Ventura location as the best of several alternative sites for a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Camarillo City Councilman Ken Gose -- who sits on a tri-city 
committee studying the project -- said he has never attempted to hide the Lake 
Elsinore cost overruns from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have proposed that we look at this project and give it a fair hearing," 
Gose said. "But I will guarantee you that I won't bring it back (to the 
council) for consideration unless we have generated a lot of private investment 
in the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Gose, who attended the April opening day of the single-A Lake Elsinore Storm, 
said he too opposed the breakneck speed and resulting cost overruns that marked 
the Lake Elsinore stadium's construction.

COMMITTED TO FLYING; COMMUTERS: DESPITE AMERICAN EAGLE CRASHES, MANY AT OXNARD 
AIRPORT ARE UNDETERRED, CITING OVERALL SAFETY OF THE CRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 American Eagle passengers flying out of Oxnard Airport on Wednesday said that 
two recent crashes by the airline have not raised enough concern for them to 
consider changing their travel habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said they were troubled by news of Tuesday's fatal crash near Raleigh, 
N.C. -- the second wreck in as many months. But the convenience and overall 
safety record of the 19-seat craft flown out of Oxnard make driving to Los 
Angeles International Airport an unacceptable alternative, many said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go to Washington, D.C., or to LAX, I fly out of here," said 
James Jones, a U.S. Navy engineer from Camarillo. "It's safer than driving." 
</P>
<P>
 The day after 15 people died in the American Eagle crash in North Carolina, it 
was business as usual at Oxnard Airport, where commuter jet service is 
available from both American Eagle and United Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Both firms offer seven weekday flights to Los Angeles on 19-seat jets that 
airline officials say are routinely filled. Transfers to anywhere in the world 
are available from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident Tuesday followed an American Eagle commuter plane crash Oct. 31 
outside Chicago that killed all 68 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes operated by American Eagle in Oxnard are British Aerospace 
Jetstreams similar to the one that crashed and split open in a steady drizzle 
Tuesday night near Raleigh-Durham International Airport, a company official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 United Express flies Beechcraft 1900 turboprop planes that are "as safe as any 
plane flying," a company employee said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for American Airlines, American Eagle's parent company, said the 
airline has no plans to cancel any more of its commuter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 One Wednesday night flight out of Oxnard was canceled for an unspecified 
maintenance problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the firm grounded its 41 ATR commuter planes after the FAA banned 
the turboprops from flying in icy weather. Ice forming on wings is suspected of 
having contributed to the October crash. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines acknowledged that some passengers had canceled their flying 
plans, but could not provide numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Ralph Logan and Julie Blackmon of Camarillo were bound for 
Montgomery, Ala., via Los Angeles and then Nashville, Tenn. Both said they were 
not worried about the safety of the small aircraft, despite the recent 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't concern me that much because I've taken these flights so many 
times," said Logan, another engineer from Camarillo. "If something's going to 
happen, it's going to happen. You can't change your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmon said she had confidence in American Eagle's commuter service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel safer flying than I do driving on the roads every day," said Blackmon, 
a registered nurse. "If there's a problem, they won't fly the planes." 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger Ron Chegwidden of Ojai agreed with Blackmon. He said he flies 
regularly and that American Airlines and its subsidiaries are known for 
treating customers well. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't overlook the crashes," said Chegwidden, on his way to Fort Walton 
Beach, Fla., a journey that required him to take two more planes. "But I have 
more confidence in American than I do in a lot of airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers I'd take a larger plane," he said. "But I don't have 
that option." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff North, a Dallas restaurant worker who arrived Wednesday to train 
employees at a new franchise in Oxnard, said he was not altogether comfortable 
with the small commuter airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't like the crop-dusters, but that's just my opinion," the 
25-year-old said. "I wish they had regular planes that flew here." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Deneau, a computer analyst from Ventura on his way Wednesday to Norfolk, 
Va., said he is a frequent traveler on commuter jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 "What difference does safety make?" he asked. "I have a job to do. When I get 
there, I thank the Lord."

PROSECUTION VILIFIES THORNTON AS COLDBLOODED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Piecing together six weeks of testimony, prosecutors Wednesday portrayed Mark 
Scott Thornton as a coldblooded killer and consummate liar who executed 
Westlake nurse Kellie O' Sullivan, even as he led her to believe he would spare 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley urged a 
Ventura County Superior Court jury to convict the Thousand Oaks man of 
first-degree murder and a special circumstance that could put him in the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also criticized the defense for characterizing the killing as a 
tragedy, a word that he said does not apply to the Thornton case. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this was, was a murder," Frawley said. "It was more than that. It was an 
execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, scheduled to give their closing arguments today, sat 
quietly as Frawley blasted their case and their client. Thornton, 20, also sat 
impassively at the defense table, keeping his eyes focused mostly on the 
prosecutor who was vilifying him. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is expected to begin deliberating Monday. Prosecutors, who have the 
burden of proof in the case, get a final chance to rebut defense arguments 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying his first death-penalty case, the 35-year-old Frawley wove a lengthy 
tale of how the nurse came to her death. Throughout the argument, several 
jurors nodded in apparent agreement with the prosecution's version of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying together testimony from more than 100 witnesses, Frawley said Thornton 
had lost control of his life almost a year before the nurse was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan was killed just because her attacker wanted to steal her Ford 
Explorer truck and did not want the theft reported right away, Frawley argued, 
adding that it is hard to believe that someone would be killed over a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the murder premeditated, Frawley conceded that Thornton probably did 
not decide to kill his victim until after abducting her. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan, he said, just happened to be "in the wrong place at the wrong 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove premeditation, however, he concentrated his argument on Thornton's 
actions in the weeks prior to the shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley noted that Thornton had been telling friends for a least a month 
beforehand that he needed to leave town because the police were after him. 
According to court testimony, the defendant had violated his juvenile probation 
and cashed more than $3,000 in forged and bounced checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the nurse's murder, Thornton and a friend went to Camarillo, 
where they bought the fatal bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan encountered the gun-toting defendant outside a Thousand Oaks pet 
store at about 2 p.m. the day she died, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove the woman into the Santa Monica Mountains, punching and backhanding 
her along the way as she tried to get the gun from him, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He reminded the jury of a witness who testified to seeing a couple fitting the 
descriptions of Thornton and O'Sullivan in a small black truck on Hampshire 
Road, heading in the general direction of the mountains. The witness testified 
that the male driver was beating his female passenger, who appeared to be 
reaching for something in his lap or on the console. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said Thornton took O'Sullivan to an area of the mountains he was 
familiar with, near a spot where he had partied with friends on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said O'Sullivan had decided to remain calm, rather than infuriate her much 
younger assailant, in hopes that he would steal her vehicle and leave her be. 
</P>
<P>
 But after pulling off Mulholland Highway near a mountainside grotto, Thornton 
forced O'Sullivan to crawl into the alcove. Her purse was still strapped around 
her shoulder, her sunglasses still on her face -- all signs that she did not 
struggle, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence suggests she still had some hope of living," he said. "He 
probably told her something like, 'Get in there and you're going to stay in 
there for an hour while I make my getaway.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She went in there," Frawley continued, "and boom, boom, boom. He killed her." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Frawley said: "He had her literally crawling to her death." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Thornton drove to a tattoo shop in Simi Valley, where he 
had his former girlfriend's name emblazoned on his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would expect him to be shaking, trembling if it was an accident or some 
kind of tragedy," Frawley said. "But to go to a tattoo artist and exchange 
chitchat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, Thornton used O'Sullivan's truck to kidnap the 
ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Campbell. The two were on the road for the next five 
days, mostly camping in Northern California, before Thornton was arrested in 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, he was in possession of O'Sullivan's truck and the 
weapon used to murder her, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are talking about assigning responsibility," Frawley said. "We are 
not going to call this a tragedy anymore. We are fixing blame." 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the jury not to be fooled by Thornton's denial of murder to his 
grandmother and police shortly after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy lies as easily as he breathes, ladies and gentlemen," Frawley said. 
"It just rolls off his lips."

COUNTY LEADERS LOBBY PENTAGON TO SAVE BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pushing their case face-to-face with top military brass, a local delegation 
spent Wednesday shuttling through the Pentagon in an effort to protect Ventura 
County's military bases from closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivering the same message half a dozen times throughout the day, 
participants said military leaders appeared receptive to their argument that 
the Point Mugu and Port Hueneme bases are unique military assets that cannot be 
duplicated elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practically every instance, they viewed our information as useful and said 
they would pass it along," said County Supervisor Maggie Kildee. "We were able 
to point out things I don't think they thought of." 
</P>
<P>
 Stressing the one-of-a-kind geography that prompted the Defense Department to 
locate the bases in Ventura County in the first place, the group reminded 
military leaders of the islands just off the Ventura coastline used by Point 
Mugu, the deep-water launching spot at Port Hueneme and the critical tracking 
instruments based on Laguna Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants said the word synergy came up again and again at the sessions as 
they stressed that the Navy bases work together for the good of the country's 
defense. Just as they had rehearsed in weeks of preparatory sessions, they did 
not stress the severe economic impact that closure would have on the community, 
sticking instead to the military rationale for keeping the bases alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as officials geared up for meetings today and Friday, they said the 
threat to the county's bases, which contribute substantially to the area's 
economic health, is real. During this fourth round of cutbacks, Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry has instructed the various military branches to 
recommend closing about 15% of the nation's bases, setting communities across 
the country on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the middle of the process," said Richard Wittenberg, the 
county's chief administrative officer. "I feel better now because we're passing 
important information along, but I don't feel relieved yet. At least we're 
doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 As they strode through Pentagon hallways, the local officials wore small 
American flags and red, white and blue ribbons on their lapels. They call 
themselves the BRAC '95 Task Force, referring to the Base Realignment and 
Closure law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their stops were the offices of Vice Adm. William C. Bowes, commander of 
the Naval Air Systems Command, which oversees the weapons-testing programs at 
Point Mugu; Rear Adm. J.E. Buffington, chief of civil engineers and responsible 
for the Seabees at Port Hueneme; Rear Adm. Edward S. McGinty, vice commander of 
the Naval Sea Systems Command, which encompasses the Naval Surface Warfare 
Center at Port Hueneme; and Robert Bayer, deputy assistant defense secretary 
responsible for base realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many other communities have made similar lobbying trips, those 
supporting Ventura County's cause saw the visit as essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it says a lot about Ventura County and the importance of our bases 
that this group has taken the time and effort to travel across the country," 
said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). "This kind of face-to-face contact . 
. . can only help make our case that Point Mugu and Port Hueneme are vital 
military facilities that should continue to operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking exhausted at day's end, the officials said there is little glamour to 
their visit, which was funded by local governments and businesses. They stayed 
at a cut-rate hotel, grabbed a 25-minute lunch at the Pentagon cafeteria and 
shuttled across the city packed into a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressing the importance of the mission to the county's future, former Rep. 
Robert J. Lagomarsino said he gave up a day of duck hunting, while county 
Supervisor John Flynn said he left his daughter, who had just given birth, back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a grueling day," said Kildee, slumping in her chair. "We got up very 
early and we haven't stopped. . . . We walked, and we walked, and we walked, 
and I'm tired." 
</P>
<P>
 The group continues its lobbying blitz today in meetings with congressional 
staffers and Friday with the chairman of the Defense Base Closure and 
Realignment Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 That final session will be critical because the commission is charged with 
submitting the final list of cutbacks to President Clinton next summer. The 
county's bases emerged largely unscathed in previous reductions but each round 
increases the risk that they will be put on the chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
 Others participating in the three-day effort are Ted Rains, retired technical 
director of the Naval Surface Warfare Center; businesswoman Carolyn Leavens; 
Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez, and Penny Bohannon, the county's Sacramento 
lobbyist. Helping them pry open doors in Washington was Lynn Jacquez, whose 
lobbying firm was hired for its expertise in saving military bases.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 NAMED TO COUNTY TRANSIT COMMISSION

<TEXT>
<P>
 City leaders have appointed two new members to the county's transportation 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason and Ventura resident Roma Armbrust were selected 
by the mayors of the county's 10 cities to serve four-year terms on the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member panel of elected officials and citizen representatives meets 
monthly to set transportation policy and dole out about $64 million a year in 
government funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust replaces Thousand Oaks resident Nancy Grasmehr, whose term expires 
this month. Lawrason replaces Frank Schillo, who served on the panel as a 
Thousand Oaks councilman before he was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 
November. Both Armbrust and Lawrason had served as commission alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next year the Board of Supervisors will select a replacement for 
Supervisor Vicky Howard, who is retiring. Howard was chairwoman of the 
commission. The terms of the other four commissioners expire in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 According to custom, Supervisor John K. Flynn, who is an alternate on the 
commission, will get first dibs at replacing Howard. The rest of the 
commissioners are Supervisor Susan Lacey, Simi Valley City Councilman Bill 
Davis, Camarillo Councilman David Smith and Michael Wooten, a citizen 
representative from Camarillo appointed by the Board of Supervisors. SARA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BOLAND, 
HAYDEN PROPOSE TO SPLIT UP SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking advantage of the new political landscape in Sacramento, two legislators 
from opposite sides of the aisle have joined forces to propose a legislative 
plan to dismantle the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Los 
Angeles) will both sponsor legislation early next year to dissolve the 
636,400-student district and replace it with several smaller school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Hayden probably is as liberal as I am conservative," said Boland, a 
longtime breakup proponent. "Yet, from both of our perspectives, LAUSD must be 
broken up." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference at Northridge Middle School, the legislators 
said that although previous efforts to break up the district have failed, the 
political climate has changed with the election of 28 new Assembly members. "I 
think most legislators now would favor it," Hayden said. "This bill is in 
somewhat better condition . . . than last year," when it was rejected by an 
Assembly committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the sheer size of the district -- the nation's second-largest -- 
presents too many bureaucratic obstacles for parents and teachers. "It's this 
philosophical concern that has brought me to conclude over the years that the 
Los Angeles school district is way too large for any district or organization 
for parents or children or teachers to have an effective say in it," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DWP CREDITS NIGHT SHIFT 
WITH SAVING L.A. FROM BLACKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As most Los Angeles residents slept early Wednesday, a mystery "event" caused 
the grid that supplies electricity to the Western states to fail, darkening all 
or parts of eight states and cutting electricity to as many as 2 million 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But quick action by four technicians at a generating station in Long Beach 
probably saved the Los Angeles area from a blackout, Department of Water and 
Power officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers on the lobster shift at the Haynes Plant were able to keep the station 
working by manipulating fuel and steam flows by hand as alarms went off, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a circus there for a while," said plant superintendent Ken Bosworth. 
"The reactions of our people were as good as I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The glitch in the system, which is still under investigation, occurred 
somewhere in Northern California in the Pacific Gas & Electric system at 12:26 
a.m., plunging parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, 
parts of Arizona and Northern California into darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison customers were protected when generating units in 
Oxnard and Laughlin, Nev., tripped as a protective measure, a company 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Haynes Plant, technicians in Control Room A saw wild swings on the 
plant's megawatt recorder, which measures the power load in each generating 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was kind of startled," said supervisor Terry Campbell. "We knew 
right away we had an event." 
</P>
<P>
 The disruption in the system caused one unit to shut down briefly. Another 
almost died, but operator Robert Pesqueira, using hand dials, was able to 
stabilize flows of fuel and steam. Meanwhile, operator John Loetterle refired 
the downed unit as Campbell and operator Mike McInnis monitored the control 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so fast, we were hardly out of our chairs and approaching the 
board before it was played out," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the workers not acted as they did, Bosworth said, "there would have been 
hundreds of megawatts with no place to go." The power buildup would have caused 
steam and fuel valves to close and turbines to stop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and the others were on duty Jan. 17 when the Northridge earthquake 
tripped off the power flow at the Haynes Plant. "We're beginning to feel sort 
of snake bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was restored to almost all of the affected customers within 1 3/4 hours, 
said Dennis Eyre, executive director of the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council, representing the interconnected power companies. Late Wednesday, 
inspectors from Pacific Gas & Electric were investigating the cause of the 
event, he said. EDMUND NEWTON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: QUEZADA WON'T SEEK 
ANOTHER TERM ON L.A. SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, who became the first Latina on the Los Angeles Unified School 
Board in 1987, announced Wednesday that she will not seek a third term in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada, whose district includes heavily Latino neighborhoods on the Eastside 
and in the northeast San Fernando Valley, said it was time to move on after a 
decade of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed in term limits and I've been on the school board for 
eight years," Quezada said. "It's not an easy decision . . . but I know it's 
the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Before her election to the school board, Quezada served two years on the Los 
Angeles Community College board of trustees. In 1992, she ran unsuccessfully 
for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On the school board she was a strong proponent of bilingual education and was 
viewed by many parents -- particularly Latinos -- as an advocate for poor and 
disadvantaged children. But she was often at odds with Supt. Sid Thompson and 
had a strained relationship with leaders of the powerful teachers union.  
</P>
<P>
 She has been both lauded and criticized for her blunt, businesslike approach, 
honed by years of corporate work experience. She continued working full time as 
manager of Latino marketing and community relations with Nestle USA until she 
became school board president 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As president, she guided the board through some of its most difficult times, 
from the battle against a statewide voucher initiative and efforts to break up 
Los Angeles Unified to a threatened teachers strike and an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latino education activists, the timing of Quezada's departure is 
particularly disturbing because of the recent passage of Proposition 187, which 
would force public schools to bar undocumented children.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is very good about Leticia is that she not only is a visionary and . . . 
knows politics, but she's also very much in touch with the needs of real people 
-- especially Latinos and immigrants," said Rosalinda Lugo, associate director 
of Hope in Youth and a member of the LEARN school reform board. "Her leadership 
will be sorely missed, especially after 187." 
</P>
<P>
 But Quezada said she believes her successor will also be Latino and the school 
board will continue its legal battle against 187 and its leadership in other 
pro-immigrant-student causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said she has made no career plans beyond June, when her term expires.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUIT AGAINST D.A. MOVED TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time, a libel suit against Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury was 
moved Wednesday to a new jurisdiction: Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 And attorneys hinted that the suit may be moved yet again before it goes to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Gary Spencer sued Bradbury and four of his 
staff members in Los Angeles County Superior Court last March. The suit accuses 
the Ventura County prosecutor of defamation, libel, slander, infliction of 
emotional distress against Spencer, and civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer was the deputy who shot and killed millionaire Donald P. Scott during 
a fruitless drug raid on Scott's Malibu-area ranch Oct. 2, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury issued a widely publicized, 64-page report exonerating Spencer in the 
shooting because Scott was waving a gun at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bradbury's report also said that Spencer may have lied to get a search 
warrant for the 200-acre Trail's End Ranch, and it made other negative comments 
about his character. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Bradbury and Spencer agreed to move the case to Kern County 
Superior Court to avoid claims of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing early arguments and even making some rulings, Kern County 
Superior Court Judge Stephen P. Gildner kicked the case back to Los Angeles 
County last month, saying he lacked the time and resources to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen M. Reiser, Bradbury's attorney, argued the case should be heard where the 
shooting took place and the report was issued: Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Thomas Schneider ordered 
the case sent there. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Spencer's attorneys have argued that the case belongs in Los Angeles 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Carol Janssen said Wednesday she will discuss with Spencer the 
possibility of asking Ventura County to refer the case to the California 
Judicial Council for assignment to a neutral court. She declined further 
comment. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 5TH MEDFLY SPRAYING CALLED A SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday that they have 
successfully completed the fifth aerial application of malathion over eastern 
Camarillo in the battle to stop the crop-destroying Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The now familiar trio of helicopters lifted off from Camarillo Airport at 10 
p.m. Tuesday and completed the spraying mission in about four hours, said Larry 
Hawkins, a spokesman for the Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather held and we encountered no problems," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the flight, agriculture officials said they were worried that winds 
would stay above 10 m.p.h. and that the potential for rain was in the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulations prevent the spraying of pesticides in winds exceeding 10 
m.p.h. or when there is a 50% or greater chance of rain in the spray zone less 
than 24 hours after an application. 
</P>
<P>
 The next spraying of the 16-square-mile Medfly eradication zone is scheduled 
for 10 p.m. Dec. 27, Hawkins said. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CITY EXPANDS JOB OF ECONOMIC CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the time spent recruiting businesses to the city, the Camarillo City 
Council voted unanimously Wednesday to double the hours of its economic 
development consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 James Jevens, who was named the city's chief business recruiter Aug. 1, 
currently works 25 hours per month at $75 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But because his campaign to draw new firms has grown wider and has consumed 
more time than originally expected, city officials recommended his contract be 
expanded to 50 hours per month. Jevens' hourly fee will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with what Jim has done so far," said City Manager Bill 
Little. "We think it is only fair to increase the number of hours in the 
contract so that it is on a par with his workload." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that since Jevens' appointment, he has sent out more than 
100 letters to various Southern California-based companies and has made more 
than 60 presentations to various organizations touting the benefits of doing 
business in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the city has paid Jevens $5,625, excluding the cost of promotional 
materials for the recruiting campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council's decision to enlarge the agreement, Jevens will earn 
approximately $26,000 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30. J.E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PLANS FOR SHOPPING CENTER CAN PROCEED

<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has allowed a developer to move forward with plans to 
build a shopping center on 16 acres across from the Shopping at the Rose 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothbart Development, which built the original complex, is seeking to 
construct another retail center in the area called Shopping at the Rose Too, 
which would include three large stores and several smaller shops at the 
northwest corner of Rose Avenue and Lockwood Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe development of this project will enhance the entire corridor," 
said developer Stanley Rothbart. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed Tuesday that Rothbart could proceed with his plans, but 
said they were concerned about the impact the development would have on traffic 
in the already congested area. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
TELLS CALTRANS TO CLEAN UP HAZARDOUS WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Wednesday ordered Caltrans to remove hazardous waste from 
thousands of roadside drainage basins in Los Angeles County and come up with a 
comprehensive strategy for reducing contamination of Santa Monica Bay within 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the order, Caltrans has until mid-April to clean up 10,000 catch basins 
that are known or suspected to contain hazardous wastes.Another 20,000 basins 
must be cleaned within 10 months. Caltrans, which estimates that the task will 
cost $7 million for the first year, failed to persuade U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie to grant it more time. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled that Caltrans must use the best available methods to 
protect the bay from runoff, regardless of the cost, if the environmental 
benefits are major. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Ruderman Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
which filed the lawsuit against Caltrans, said the details of the judge's order 
closely echo what his group had requested.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; COUNCIL 
BREAKS DEADLOCK AFTER A WEEK, NAMES MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fractious Santa Monica City Council has broken a weeklong deadlock and 
named Councilman Paul Rosenstein as the city's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein became mayor after a compromise agreement before Tuesday's council 
meeting that assured Councilwoman Asha Greenberg of becoming mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council made more than a dozen attempts to choose a mayor, but 
no council member could garner the necessary four votes of among the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosenstein and Greenberg accord was unusual in that it gives leadership 
positions to both of the council's two opposing political camps, the Santa 
Monicans for Renters Rights and the Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rosenstein captured six council votes, with only Genser 
abstaining. Greenberg won four votes to capture the No. 2 job.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SHERIFF WELCOMES REPORT OF DROP IN OFFICER SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block says he welcomes a report that 
officer-involved shootings have declined in his department, saying deputies are 
"approaching suspects a little more cautiously than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 "We arrest a lot of people with guns, we confiscate a lot of guns, and a lot 
of these could have resulted in shootings," Block said."But because of training 
and skills, our deputies are able to resolve them with less violence than 
otherwise would have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a three-year reform effort, Block said: "We are proceeding, I 
think, very aggressively and very objectively in instituting whatever 
appropriate changes are merited in our operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The report commending the Sheriff's Department was written by attorney Merrick 
J. Bobb at the request of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; AIRPORT WINS 
BIG ROUND IN FIGHT FOR NEW TERMINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has given Burbank Airport a major victory in its 
11-year fight with the city of Los Angeles over plans to build a larger airport 
terminal, moving the project closer to the construction phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert H. O'Brien sided with the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority in the third of four lawsuits brought against the authority by Los 
Angeles, representing residents opposed to airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, saying he had no choice, ruled that airport officials had complied 
with state law in the manner in which they carried out an environmental impact 
report for the project, a key controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city of Los Angeles had sued airport officials last year to 
halt the project on behalf of residents of the southeastern San Fernando 
Valley, who have long complained about noise created by planes taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said he was unsure whether the city will 
appeal O'Brien's decision and said he will put the question before the Los 
Angeles City Council.

SILENCE FINALLY BROKEN IN '84 SLAYING OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been nearly 11 years since he died in the cross-fire of a gang war, and 
the dogeared clippings seem almost mundane: Earnest Pickett Jr., honor student 
and athlete, had been shot in full view of 300 classmates. And although 
everyone knew his killer, none dared tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, two homeboys were arrested. But after a while, they were let go. 
Insufficient evidence, the judge said. No witnesses would talk. And as time 
passed, the case went the way of so many Los Angeles gang murders -- to the 
unsolved homicide desk at the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, police announced a new twist in the old case. After more 
than a decade of silence -- a decade in which Pickett's classmates had grown up 
to have children of their own, in which his memory and promise had haunted them 
-- people had decided to it was time to speak. And a suspect, after all this 
time, was being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference at the LAPD's South Bureau, homicide Lt. Sergio Robleto 
said police are seeking Edwin (Ed Dog) Smith, 28, of Los Angeles, who was one 
of the two teen-age gang members originally arrested in the Jan. 20, 1984, 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, described by police as "armed and dangerous," was freed after the 1984 
arrest, continued to run afoul of police, detectives said, racking up a number 
of arrests in the years that followed. In fact, said Robleto, police believe 
that Smith killed another man as recently as Oct. 6, 1993, and a warrant has 
been circulating for his arrest in that matter for the past year. The victim in 
that case was Ronald Dean Miller, an ex-convict who had been counseling 
children in Smith's neighborhood to stay away from gangs and drugs, Robleto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Carolyn Flamenco, whose legwork implicated Smith in the 1984 case, 
said police are hoping that, with the holidays coming up, residents will help 
locate Smith, who has been a fugitive for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pickett's mother, Lee Bertha Pickett-Allen, said the developments 
in her son's murder case have galvanized her hope "that Ernie won't end up 
being just another black kid killed by another black kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire that erupted at 2:12 p.m. on a busy street corner across from 
Dorsey High School claimed two lives -- that of Ronald Gregorie, a 25-year-old 
suspected gang member, and that of 17-year-old Pickett, who played second base 
on the Dorsey baseball team and was on his way home to retrieve his gear when 
he was shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident stunned the student body at Dorsey, where Pickett was a beloved 
and popular classmate. But despite the presence of hundreds of witnesses, 
police could get nobody to testify. Many said later that they were threatened 
with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 So the case languished until two years ago when Pickett's mother came to 
Flamenco, who started over from scratch. With the aid of computers and the 
school yearbook, she said, she tracked down the witnesses, "who told me, 'This 
has bothered me for the past 10 years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There were tears, quivering -- they were scared to death," Flamenco said. 
"But it was like a relief for some of them. I don't know how I convinced them, 
but they wanted to do the right thing. I think this closes a chapter in their 
lives."

FRAUD FIGURE MINKOW SWITCHED TO HALFWAY HOUSE; PRISONS: CONVICTED IN 
$26-MILLION ZZZZ BEST SWINDLE, FORMER TEEN-AGE ENTREPRENEUR HAS PLEDGED TO 
BEGIN REPAYING VICTIMS. SOME REMAIN SKEPTICAL, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Minkow, the former ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning whiz convicted of swindling 
investors out of more than $26 million, ended seven years in custody Wednesday 
with a bus ride from the federal prison in Lompoc to a halfway house in Echo 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow was released after serving less than one-third of his 25-year term 
because of good behavior. He will remain at the halfway house until April 12, 
when he is due to be set free on parole, said Monica Wetzel, a spokeswoman for 
the Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next four months, Minkow, 28, will work at a Los Angeles law firm 
and begin the court-ordered difficult task of restitution, paying back the 
millions owed investors in his failed Reseda-based company, said his attorney, 
Randy Long.  
</P>
<P>
 Minkow, who said he found God in prison, has written an autobiography -- his 
second -- to be published early next year by a Christian publishing house. He 
has pledged to pay back the defrauded money with a portion of any profits from 
the book and also plans to go on a speaking tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody else from a business perspective would have filed (personal 
bankruptcy) and flushed the debts," Long said of Minkow's desire to make 
amends. 
</P>
<P>
 But James Asperger, a former federal prosecutor who helped convict Minkow, 
said he is withholding judgment on Minkow's rehabilitation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not only am I skeptical, but I think the world will be skeptical until he 
proves he can change his ways," Asperger said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another skeptic is Ann Randall, who says she was cheated out of $150,000 in 
cash plus stock in Minkow's company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way justice can be served is for him to pay back everyone their 
money," she said from her home in Chico. "He stole such a large sum of money 
and I have no way to replenish it. He changed my whole lifestyle. . . . Maybe 
he has developed a conscience and will pay us back." 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow started his carpet cleaning company while in high school in his 
parents' garage and later wrote his first autobiography, telling how he became 
a teen-age millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two years, his talkative charm convinced accountants, lawyers 
and investment bankers that his company was flourishing not only by cleaning 
homes, but through big jobs restoring office buildings damaged by fire and 
flood -- a sideline supposedly earning up to $43 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years, Minkow, with the help of some colleagues later described 
by authorities as having organized crime ties -- transformed the private 
company into a public one. Its stock soared in value , helped by Minkow's knack 
for publicity and ZZZZ Best's impressive balance sheets. In the early summer of 
1987, Minkow was poised to take over carpet cleaning services offered by Sears, 
the nation's largest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it all collapsed. It turned out that the majority of the lucrative 
restoration jobs never existed -- and neither did the revenues. Within days of 
Minkow's resignation in July, 1987, ZZZZ Best was defunct.

FLEISS LAWYERS BLAME JURORS, SEEK RETRIAL; COURTS: FIVE FROM THE PANEL HAVE 
SAID THEY HAD IMPROPER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE CASE. THE JUDGE MUST DECIDE IF 
THEIR CONDUCT AFFECTED THE VERDICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attorneys for convicted Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss on Wednesday asked for a 
new trial for her, contending that jury misconduct occurred because jurors had 
wrongly discussed the case outside court before reaching a verdict and had 
improperly talked about sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with sworn statements from five jurors briefly detailing accounts of 
out-of-court discussions, lawyers Anthony Brooklier and Donald Marks filed a 
motion asking that Superior Court Judge Judith L. Champagne overturn the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those affidavits was from jury forewoman Sheila Mitrowski, who said, "I 
do not feel justice was served with the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits jurors from deliberating outside of court. They also are 
forbidden to consider possible penalties outside a jury deliberation room. But 
according to the affidavits, five jurors said they had participated in 
"informal gatherings" outside the downtown Los Angeles Criminal Courts 
Building, in a cafeteria or walking to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Four jurors said they "briefly discussed" the penalties for pandering during 
those meetings. They said they "presumed" that Fleiss' sentence would be 
lighter if she wsa convicted of pandering rather than of the one 
cocaine-related charge levied against her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were juror irregularities that occurred during the course of the trial 
which deprived our client of a fair trial and a true verdict," Brooklier said. 
"Though inadvertent, a real injustice has unfolded." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, arrested after an elaborate 1993 police sting operation, was convicted 
of three counts of pandering earlier this month. The jury deadlocked on two 
other pandering counts and acquitted her of a cocaine-related charge. Unbeknown 
to the jury, however, pandering carries a mandatory term. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she been convicted of the drug-related charge, Fleiss would have been 
eligible for probation, Marks said. Because the jury is supposed to focus on 
determining an individual's guilt or innocence, details of punishment are not 
mentioned during the course of trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne will now decide whether misconduct occurred and whether it adversely 
affected the judicial proceedings, according to legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be a meritorious claim that some form of misconduct 
occurred, but the critical question is whether the misconduct prejudiced Heidi 
Fleiss' trial," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 If Champagne finds that there was prejudice against Fleiss, she also must 
decide whether to hold a new trial on all five counts of pandering, or solely 
on three counts. Brooklier requested a new trial on the three pandering counts, 
for which Fleiss faces a mandatory prison sentence of three years to eight 
years, eight months. But Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has said that if a new trial 
is granted, he will ask that all counts be reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts not involved with the case but familiar with the affidavits 
said the jurors' statements lacked detail that might bolster the defense 
attorneys' case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense has to show what the jurors did exactly. It has to show what they 
did had a substantial effect on the verdict, on their subsequent deliberations 
in the jury room," said Victor Gold, a professor at Loyola Law School. "So far, 
that hasn't been shown in these affidavits." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 20. Champagne can summon the jurors to 
query them about their conduct, or decide using only the affidavits.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; EDITOR OF NEWSPAPER SAYS HE'LL RESIGN

<P>
 In the second major management shake-up at Ventura County Newspapers in a 
week, Terry Greenberg, editor of the Thousand Oaks Star and News Chronicle, on 
Wednesday announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, who has directed the Thousand Oaks paper for nearly four years, 
will step down Dec. 23.He will take a job the following week as managing editor 
of the San Mateo Times, a mid-size daily newspaper with about 45 editorial 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outta here," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's surprise announcement came just one week after John R. Irby 
abruptly resigned from his position as editor of the Ventura County newspaper 
group, which is owned by the Ohio-based Scripps Howard chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said his decision to leave the Thousand Oaks Star had "absolutely 
nothing" to do with Irby's departure. He added that he has been negotiating 
with the San Mateo Times for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just interested in doing what was best for my family," Greenberg said. 
"This was too good to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's resignation is the latest in several changes to hit the Thousand 
Oaks Star and News Chronicle. The paper recently added the name "Star" to its 
masthead and has merged resources with other papers in the Ventura County 
newspaper group. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Audit Bureau of Circulation has reported a steady loss of 
readers for the newspaper. The bureau's September report showed daily 
circulation at 20,753, a drop of about 370 from the previous year.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Thousand Oaks paper, Ventura County Newspapers publishes the 
Ventura County Star and two zoned editions called the Oxnard Star and the 
Camarillo Star. It also publishes the Simi Valley Star and Enterprise, and the 
weekly Moorpark News-Mirror. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COFFEE SHOPS TO GIVE COMPOST A FREE 
PERK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back-yard compost piles can get a major jolt for free this winter, as Thousand 
Oaks coffeehouses donate their used java grounds to local gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee grounds are guaranteed to perk up the garbage-gnawing bacteria that 
chomp through compost heaps to break waste products into organic 
fertilizer.With the addition of grounds -- either instant or gourmet -- a 
compost heap's temperature can soar to 150 degrees, boosted by the energy 
generated by super-charged bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful ingredient," said Carolyn Greene, the city's environmental 
services coordinator. "It really makes the compost go." 
</P>
<P>
 Compost-less gardeners can also take advantage of used coffee grounds to 
nourish certain acid-loving plants, including gardenias, azaleas and camellias, 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to reuse their refuse, half a dozen local coffeehouse owners have agreed 
to set aside their java grounds for gardeners. Just call ahead to reserve a 
pile of high-voltage, richly scented fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating coffeehouses include Bent on Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean, 
Java City, Marianne's Coffee Mill, Mocha Mania and Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Bent Hartvig, who gives away up to 50 pounds of 
coffee grounds a week and dumps the leftovers in flower beds behind his Bent on 
Coffee store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of young people working here, and they got me really pumped up 
about this," Hartvig said. "They make sure I do it every week." STEPHANIE SIMON

 The Moorpark School Board agreed Tuesday to include teachers in a new 
discipline process for violent students, hoping to quell the teacher union's 
demands for a harsh policy that would expel any student caught with a weapon on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also supported a plan to separate the hearing process for violent 
students into two phases -- one in which they will make a judgment based on the 
facts of the case and a second phase in which they decide the appropriate 
disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have said a "zero tolerance" policy toward weapons, recommended 
by the teachers union, would be unnecessarily rigid. They say that it would 
force them to expel students who, for example, might have inadvertently brought 
a pocket knife on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zero tolerance makes no sense," said board member Clint Harper. "It prevents 
individuals from thinking and making reasoned judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark Educators Assn. recommended the strict policy after a series of 
incidents at Moorpark campuses, including one in which a 13-year-old middle 
school student was caught with a knife in his backpack.  
</P>
<P>
 The school board disciplined the student but decided against expelling him. 
The decision angered teachers, who felt the board made the decision without 
asking for the opinions of teachers who knew the student and witnessed the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that teachers were indeed left out of the process, Harper 
recommended that their opinions be included in the hearing process. SCOTT HADLY

 With words of praise for his work over the past nine years, the Moorpark 
school board bid farewell to outgoing high school Principal Cary Dritz. 
</P>
<P>
 At a board meeting Tuesday night, district Supt.Tom Duffy also complimented 
Dritz for helping to improve academics at Moorpark High. "Now we're not just 
good in football," Duffy said, pointing to trophies won by the school's 
Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
<P>
 During Dritz's tenure, the school more than doubled in size and moved from its 
aging campus off Casey Road to a new site on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz leaves for a job as director of human resources with the Ventura County 
superintendent of schools office. Charles Smith, a retired assistant 
superintendent for the Moorpark Unified School District, will serve as interim 
principal until a new appointment is made. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; EX-LAPD OFFICER TO BE TRIED IN ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles police detective, who already faced robbery and sexual 
assault charges in Ventura County, had been held for trial in a series of Los 
Angeles County robberies that began even before his official retirement last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing at which a number of robbery victims identified 
Michael D. Brambles as their assailant, Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Mary 
E. Waters found sufficient evidence this week to proceed to trial on 23 counts 
against the onetime organized crime detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles, 45, remains in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail, pending arraignment 
Dec. 27 in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the robberies, which stretched from January to May, were at closing 
time at restaurants and shops around the Westside and San Fernando Valley. 
Store clerks described a lone gunman clad in a blue jeans jacket and baseball 
cap, and women at two of the locations said they were sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles' attorney, Anthony Brooklier, argued that the identifications were 
flawed because the victims originally had given police widely divergent 
descriptions of the robber. Waters noted, however, that witnesses often give 
varying accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Brambles faces four counts filed last month that stem from 
an April 19 robbery in the Oak Park area, where a victim was allegedly sexually 
assaulted. PAUL LIEBERMAN

CANDIDATES LINE UP TO FILL OPENING ON CITY COUNCIL; THOUSAND OAKS: SEVERAL 
UNSUCCESSFUL CONTENDERS IN NOVEMBER'S BALLOTING EXPRESS INTEREST IN RUNNING IF 
A SPECIAL ELECTION IS HELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even as some residents said the last thing they want on Thousand Oaks street 
corners is a fresh crop of campaign signs, likely contenders for a City Council 
vacancy emerged Wednesday, including fall council candidates Lee Laxdal and 
Mike Markey and supervisorial candidate Trudi Loh. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will apparently hold a special election in June, since the City 
Council deadlocked Tuesday night on how to fill a council seat vacated by Frank 
Schillo, who resigned after being elected to the County Board of Supervisors in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The election cannot be formally called until Jan. 6, but the campaign season 
of 1995 began almost instantly. Within minutes of the deadlock, Markey -- the 
fourth-place finisher last month -- had made his way into the hall, declared 
his intention to run and received his first $50 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey said he was disappointed that he was not appointed to the vacant seat 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the decision was made in the city's best interests," he said. 
"But I'm not bitter. I'm a survivor. I'll pick up and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible candidates emerged just as quickly, with Loh -- who staged a 
well-financed campaign against Schillo and lost by a narrow margin -- saying 
she is considering a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey, a pro-business candidate who said he is neutral on development issues, 
said he was not worried about going up against Loh, who ran on a strong 
pro-environment platform for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to beat me; I don't have to beat her," he said. "She's got to come 
after me." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said Wednesday that she would wait until after the holidays to make a 
final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should allow everybody to go home and have their holiday," she 
said. "I want to make a very considered choice and not rush into anything." 
</P>
<P>
 She has already received widespread support, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the person who fills that seat would hopefully be someone who can 
bring a consensus to the council," Loh said, "not someone who has been 
handpicked by one side or another." 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old attorney spent about $100,000 on her supervisorial campaign, 
as did Schillo, who won with 51.4% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council race would be far less expensive, Loh said. "This would be much 
more of a grass-roots campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Winslow, who placed ninth out of 16 council candidates in November, said 
he will run again. The 29-year-old owner of the Car Wash Guys said he plans to 
solicit contributions from the 14,600 customers in his business database. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to ask everybody for 20 bucks this time," he said. "I'm going to 
knock on every door in this community this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow was the first candidate to officially declare. While pleading with the 
council to appoint Markey on Tuesday, he said he would run in a special 
election if one is held. 
</P>
<P>
 Former candidate Ekbal Quidwai, who received 1.3% of November's vote, said he 
is also running. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other fall candidates said they were considering running, including 
Laxdal, a former councilman who placed only 519 votes behind Markey, and 
eighth-place finisher Greg Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be talking with people about it," Laxdal said. "This is going to 
be a wild election. . . . Money will probably figure pretty largely in this 
one. We have things coming before the council that I'm sure the developers want 
to see get through. And they want to see someone elected who is going to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 David Hare and M. Ali Issari said they believed that it was too early to make 
a decision and both have doubts about running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last election was really ugly," Hare said. "It left a bad taste in my 
mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Irv Wasserman said he did not want to undertake another 
campaign, as did fall candidates Michael Friedman, Marshall Dixon, Chuck Morsa 
and Bill Williams. Jeanette Scovill did not return calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he plans to focus instead on a recall effort aimed at 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah and Mayor Jaime Zukowski. He accused them of 
financial irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get the petitions drawn up, we can have the recall at the same time 
as the special election," he said. "And I want to put a statement in there that 
says that if the recall is successful, the vacancies would be filled by 
appointment only." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she is not concerned about the talk of a recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to do that, they certainly have the money to hire people to get 
signatures," she said. "I frankly think the public is not going to fall for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 County election officials estimate the cost of a special election at $98,000, 
or $1.53 per registered voter. But city officials said additional costs 
incurred by the city could bring the tally to $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If a countywide election was planned for June -- or if a countywide or 
statewide initiative qualifies for the June ballot -- the cost to the city 
would be one-tenth that amount, according to county elections chief Bruce 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still a possibility that the council could break its deadlock before 
Jan. 6. But after lengthy discussion Tuesday night, a compromise seemed 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion by Zeanah for each council member to nominate candidates was quickly 
shot down by council members Andy Fox and Judy Lazar. Zeanah withdrew the 
motion, and no others were made. 
</P>
<P>
 "With no motion, it goes to special election," Zukowski said.

CUTBACKS IN SIMI SCHOOL BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON and SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the threat of insolvency, Simi Valley school trustees have approved 
a plan to cut $5.4 million during the next three years, while Moorpark school 
leaders are debating how to pare a projected $1-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both school districts have been warned by Ventura County school officials to 
curb spending or risk losing local control of their finances. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, county school officials sent letters to six school districts -- 
including Simi Valley Unified and Moorpark Unified -- asking administrators to 
show how they plan to reduce deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is establish an early warning system," said Robert 
Smith, county assistant superintendent of business services. "If you continue a 
high level of deficit spending, there could be potential insolvency." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified was the only school district asked to submit a 
spending-reduction plan by Dec. 31, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to that request, the Simi Valley school board approved a plan 
Tuesday night that will cut about $5.4 million by the 1996-97 school year, 
taking a large chunk out of a projected $5.9-million deficit for the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not financially solvent for 1996-97 right now," said Wayne Templeton, 
the district's chief financial analyst. "What the county is telling us is, 
'Show how you will be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the district will reduce payments to its self-funded 
employee health plan by $500,000 each year, for a projected savings of $1.5 
million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will also cut contributions to its workers' compensation fund by 
half a percent each year for an overall savings of $870,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of surplus real estate will provide $240,000 this year, and recently 
imposed bus fees will generate about $200,000 each school year, adding more 
than $600,000 to the cash-strapped general fund during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole exercise is for the district to show the county superintendent how 
it will resolve its problem," Templeton said. "All we have to do to make sure 
we don't have a deficit in two years is follow (the plan)." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified is the largest district in the county, with more than 
18,000 students, and trustees have struggled in recent years to balance its 
$75-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The board already trimmed $2.5-million to balance the budget for this school 
year, in part by eliminating 24 teaching positions and imposing a $200-a-year 
student busing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Moorpark Unified School District, saddled with paying the 
remainder of a bill for an elementary school and for partial construction of a 
stadium, is facing a potential $1-million deficit this year and similar 
deficits for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district still has three more $700,000 payments for the $3.5-million 
Mountain Meadows Elementary School, which was built seven years ago. The 
district also owes about $120,000 for bleachers built at the new high school 
stadium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mountain Meadows Elementary School was built, the district was reaping 
the benefits of rapid growth in the city, collecting fees from each city 
building permit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last four years, Moorpark has had very few new developments, and 
school board members predict that they will not get any money from new 
construction this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previous boards planned on getting developers' fees every year," said board 
member Tom Baldwin. "But I don't think new development is going to save our 
bacon this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The district already has taken some cost-cutting measures and frozen spending 
of its $500,000 lottery fund. But school board members said that much more will 
need to be done to eliminate the projected deficit in their $23-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Tom Duffy is drafting a list of cost-cutting measures, such as 
increasing class size, charging for school busing and cutting some staff 
positions. But those measures will only be considered as a last resort, trustee 
Clint Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, district officials hope to sell property, including 10 acres near 
City Hall that once housed the old high school and a two-acre site near Peach 
Hill School. Together the sale of that property could generate more than $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Harper said, the budget woes are not likely to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more endemic problem is that as the cost of running a district continues 
to increase, the state doesn't increase our funding," he said. "And since Prop. 
13, it's the state and not local property taxes that we have to depend on."

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; A PERSONABLE ROGERS GIVES THIS 'FOLLIES' ITS JOLLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Once you get past the fact that "The Will Rogers Follies" doesn't have much to 
say about the man himself, or much to do with the real Ziegfeld Follies, it's 
pretty easy just to sit back, relax, and go with the current of another 
Broadway musical aimed at the tired businessman and the expense-account 
traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 All the show aspires to be is a lively, coloring-book valentine to Rogers' 
memory, and in that frame of reference it works. It's especially effective in 
the reduced scale of this national touring company at Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking anachronistically from today's viewpoint, Rogers has been brought 
back by an equally sepulchral Ziegfeld to tell his life story. The brief 
glimpses he gives -- snippets from his youth in Oklahoma, his Wild West show 
jaunt to South Africa, his years of growing fame in vaudeville, his stardom in 
the Follies and films -- pale beside the show's production numbers, Ziegfeldian 
strolls by scantily clad showgirls, a few athletic turns by Will's "Wranglers" 
and some nifty lighting by Marcia Madeira. 
</P>
<P>
 But what ultimately makes the production watchable and listenable is Bill 
O'Brien's personable Rogers. More than some earlier Rogerses, O'Brien has a shy 
reticence and a natural humor that's not too far from that winning quality in 
the real Cherokee Kid. His warm tenor, forceful when it needs to be, is just 
right for the show's musical style, but his personality sells the material. 
He's the reason to see the show. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ziegfeld's Favorite, Renee Cox Senecal's flashing, slightly askew smile, 
and her individualistic musical-comedy vocal delivery, give a lot of classy 
pizazz to her winning burlesque-styled crossovers and comedy bits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rima Sara Szalay makes more of the bland Betty Blake, Rogers' long-suffering 
wife, than the script does. Though she handles her tame ballads expertly, her 
shining, vibrant moment is Blake's torch-song, "No Man Left for Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again the show is almost stolen by two surviving members of the Broadway 
company. Tom Brackney's Madcap Mutts in the Wild West Show, funny and savvy 
show-biz pooches who know where their laughs are, and Tomas Garcilazo's 
astounding rope-twirling act are still highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 The score fades from memory as soon as you leave the theater. It isn't high on 
the list of achievements for either composer Cy Coleman or lyricists Betty 
Comden and Adolph Green. And Peter Stone's book obviously took less time. They 
might have written this show on napkins during cocktail hour. Steven Minning's 
direction and choreography give it all the right bounce, the necessary and 
funny camp moments and pleasant visuals. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; EVOLVING DOOR MAKES ITS NAME WITH "MUD" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Revolving Door Productions has been spinning unevenly at the Tribune Theatre. 
A lame attempt at Shakespeare a few months ago was followed by an interesting 
but spotty evening of one-acts. But it's such a young and ambitious company 
that something was bound to get through the door on one spin or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud," a tragedy by Maria Irene Fornes, is an unusual piece for the troupe to 
be interested in. But it happens to be exactly Revolving Door's piece of meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The group attacks "Mud" with bravado. The three cast members directed 
themselves from their interpretations of the playwright's script notations. It 
was a dangerous move, but they've pulled it off with intelligence, 
theatricality and, above all, total honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fornes' back-country plot involves illiterate Mae (Jennifer Bishton), who is 
going to school but not picking up much. She lives with Lloyd (Steve Spehar), 
who was brought home by her late father to keep her company. They have "mated," 
but Mae doesn't want to live like a dog, and Lloyd is little more than an 
animal. Enter Henry (Bradley A. Whitfield) in a shirt and tie that don't fool 
anybody. He's a step above Mae and Lloyd, but not a big step. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is a powerful statement about a young woman's doomed attempt to make 
a better life for herself, to forge something out of nothing. Fornes has drawn 
her parable in the darkest tones with the most ironic humor. It is difficult 
writing, difficult to bring to life with any sense of reality, but this cast 
does it with insight and an inner illuminating glow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishton is deep-hued, feisty and sometimes monumental; her performance is 
many-layered and intricate. Spehar has found a valid and surprising poetry in 
Lloyd's abysmal bestiality. His is a virtuoso performance, as affecting in its 
physicality as in its darkness. Whitfield is expertly restrained, with a facade 
of slight pomposity overlaying the older Henry's trudging exactness and an 
ignorance that can't be hidden by his attempts at social normality. 
</P>
<P>
 Spehar's scenic and lighting designs capture the desperate poverty of spirit 
that weaves through the tragedy, and completely improvised music by Nick 
Boicourt Sr., Chris Dalu, Erica Dewey and Michael Mollo helps to place Fornes' 
world within our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud," Tribune Theatre, 116 1/2 Wilshire, Fullerton. Thursday through Sunday, 
8:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $5. (714) 525-3403. Running time: 1 hours, 20 minutes. 
Steve Spehar: Lloyd Jennifer Bishton: Mae Bradley A. Whitfield: Henry

POP BEAT: PUNKS INSURE US AGAINST MUSICAL BANKRUPTCY

 We live in wondrous times. Who would have guessed that braying, irreverent 
punk rockers would give a substantial boost to Orange County's civic image (at 
least in rock 'n' roll circles), as the triple platinum-selling Offspring have 
done? And that respectably conservative politicians would manage to turn O.C. 
into a laughingstock, its public pride and confidence splotched with gushing 
graffiti sprays of red ink? 
</P>
<P>
 While the pols scramble to clean up their mess, the punks keep coming, looking 
to do their bit for community pride by committing sonic mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of ADZ are three players who were part of the county's first punk 
blast 15 years ago; Guttermouth and the Grabbers are newcomers with albums 
steeped in local punk traditions. All recognize that brevity is the soul of 
punk, turning in 11- or 13-track albums that clock in at 22 (Guttermouth), 29 
(ADZ) and 32 (the Grabbers) minutes. Ratings range from * (Chapter 9) to **** 
(Cloud 9). Three stars denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 ADZ: "Where Were You?"; Lethal Rikk Agnew, Tony Brandenburg and Casey Royer 
have something approaching 50 years' collective experience in punk rock, but 
their most glorious moment came early on, when they were three-fifths of the 
lineup on the Adolescents' 1981 debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adolescents" is the one O.C. punk album to hear if you're hearing just one, 
although that proposition might be taken as fighting words by certain partisans 
of Agent Orange, T.S.O.L. and Social Distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the lineup was short-lived, the original Adolescents' continuing impact 
has led to periodic reunions that still can generate a crowd. "Where Were You?" 
is the first album to feature as many as three of the five original members 
since the excellent but overlooked "Balboa Fun Zone" (1988). 
</P>
<P>
 The ADZ reunion brings inconsistent results ranging from flat throwaways to a 
few highlights that could be mistaken for lost outtakes from the classic 
Adolescents debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rikk-Tony-Casey realliance was brief: Only singer Brandenburg, whose new 
nom de stage is Tony Reflex following previous incarnations as Tony Cadena, 
Tony Montana and Tony Adolescent, remains in the band. Guitarist Agnew 
evidently fell from the others' good graces before "Where Were You?" was even 
finished: He is the target of scorn on a song called "Rikki Headcheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Royer, the drummer on the ADZ album, carries on as front man in D.I., a post 
he's held since 1983. Rounding out the recording lineup, and remaining in a 
revamped stage lineup led by Reflex, are guitarist Rodger Ramjet and bassist 
Mike Rouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening theme song, "A-D-Z," suggests that the band isn't infected by any 
sense of its own historical importance: "It's the same three chords . . . 
playing songs 'cause we're bored/A-D-Z." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with those three chords come Tony's always-convincing (if 
one-dimensional) snarls, screams and growls and a persuasive band attack 
bolstered by massed, anthem harmonies from a younger band of punk contenders, 
Face to Face. 
</P>
<P>
 But boredom sometimes afflicts the songwriting. "Where Were You?" is a dull 
account of a men's-room altercation at a punk show. "Car Crash" looks toward an 
oddly pointless target for its routine venting of punk obnoxiousness -- the 
scornful lyrics sketch the circumstances of the auto wrecks that claimed 
'50s/'60s pop icons James Dean, Ernie Kovacs and Jayne Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solitaire" is flat, and "Adnauseum Dub" (sic -- you expect punks to get Latin 
spellings right?) is an aptly titled musical joke invoking the spacey, echoing 
atmosphere of a reggae "dub" mix. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, when ADZ manages to write a good, catchy, shout-along 
cadence into a song, the band knows how to ride it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flyswatter" echoes a Wire nugget, "1-2-X-U," but it's a worthy theft, while 
the anti-cop "Riot on Sunset" and the anti-drug "Some Kind of Fun" give Mr. 
Reflex a chance to impress by vomiting sardonic antagonism all over his 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The aforementioned "Rikki Headcheese" may be unkind in its taunting of an 
erstwhile band mate, but it at least does Agnew the honor of hoisting him on 
his own musical petard -- the song surges with the dense swarm of harmonized 
guitars that he and his brother Frank turned into a much-copied signature of 
the early Adolescents' sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay away from this if you think it's tawdry to milk the punk past; those who 
feed on old punk should be pleased at just how hard ADZ can milk it.

 Guttermouth: "Friendly People"; Nitro  
</P>
<P>
 Pals and sometime touring partners of the Offspring, Guttermouth is now the 
first band on the new record label that the Offspring's Bryan Holland and Greg 
Kriesel are financing with part of their haul from "Smash." 
</P>
<P>
 Guttermouth covets the Vandals' old handle as snotty, irreverent, all-purpose 
punk satirists who hold nothing sacred. If you don't laugh, they've failed. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Chaps My Hide," a mercifully brief ditty about the adult equivalent of 
diaper rash, they're so puerile that you can only wonder whether they're still 
in diapers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But numbers like "Jamie's Petting Zoo," a gruesome little song designed to win 
the revulsion of animal-lovers everywhere, and "Can't We All Just Get Along (at 
the Dinner Table)," score satiric points while reveling in willful breaches of 
politically correct good citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is the album's best joke: Guttermouth slips into a General 
Assembly's worth of silly foreign accents while suggesting flippantly that 
keeping a multicultural table might be the recipe for international harmony. 
The band has fun by mockingly espousing just the sort of banal idea that 
extreme proponents of multiculturalism might put forth in all seriousness -- 
peace 'n' harmony advancing, like the army, on its stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek" picks a fight with an opposing punk faction, the "straight edge" 
brigade that shuns all intoxicants, including alcohol. "Disneyland" finds 
Guttermouth claiming common ground with Sting in decrying the bulldozing of 
tropical rain forests. While the tirade may be sincere, its juice comes from 
Mark Adkins' snide attitude rather than from the substance of the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 For the album's profanely titled closing track, Guttermouth adopts a comically 
nihilistic, we-hate-everything stance that looks back to the Adolescents' 
"Creatures" and "I Hate Children." There's a hollowness in all-purpose mockery 
when it doesn't reveal a firm moral foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Guttermouth, if only glancingly, does stand on that old punk standby, 
individualism, as a core value that's being advanced in slaps at the herd 
mentality. More often, Guttermouth just delights in being silly and rude for 
the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's musical foundation is strong, if familiar, as received punk styles 
(including some of that Adolescents massed-guitar sound) are executed crisply 
and with lots of punch -- especially on a galloping instrumental, "Summers 
Over."

<P>
 The Grabbers: "The Way I Am"; Doctor Dream  
</P>
<P>
 All the Grabbers ever do is complain; what makes them tolerable, and even 
enjoyable, is the unfettered garage-punk that carries singer-lyricist Tommy 
Macke's sour observations about messed-up relationships and life as a stacked 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of looking to the speeding, hard-core sound, the Grabbers gain extra 
heft by slowing the tempos a bit and letting the guitars slice and careen in 
homage to the Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their label-mates, Cadillac Tramps, the Grabbers get lots of mileage out 
of a high-voltage double-guitar attack and shout-along refrains. Those massed 
vocals help compensate for Macke's somewhat thin lead voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyrically, the Grabbers' alienation is most affecting when expressed obliquely 
so that it takes on a mood of creeping anxiety, as on "Kodac Moment" and a 
cover of Dream Syndicate's "Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 When the only point is to vent spleen, things get pretty ugly. "Lost all 
control, now turn and run / I'll cut out your tongue and I'll call it fun," 
Macke advises one of the insufficiently faithful or understanding women who are 
his frequent targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the character making these threats and moaning about betrayals is a 
sodden drunk or drug addict who clearly hasn't earned anybody's faith or 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The album title suggests that we take the songs as a composite character 
sketch. In the end, with "So It Seems," a glimmer of self-awareness dawns on 
our antihero after the woman in whom he had placed his hopes has finally 
abandoned him: 
</P>
<P>
 I believed in nothing, so it seems  
</P>
<P>
 Sit alone and watch TV  
</P>
<P>
 Wonder what will happen to me if I don't straighten out my life  
</P>
<P>
 I'm living in a daze, looking at life through a haze Stronger melodies and a 
countervailing humor or poignancy would have helped the Grabbers give this grim 
study more dimension. But the cumulative weight of the album's consistently 
driving, trenchant music makes it worth hearing them out.

WESTSIDE WATCH: OLDER IRONMAN TO FLEX HIS MARKETING MUSCLE LOCALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 48-year-old man may soon be moving in near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Be nice: He's a 48-year-old man with 20-inch biceps, a 52-inch chest, a 
28-inch waist, 29-inch thighs and 19-inch calves. 
</P>
<P>
 Robby Robinson, winner of the first-ever Master's (40 and over) Mr. Olympia 
bodybuilding competition in Atlanta in September, says he is moving to the 
Westside from Norway, his home for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 48, plans to endorse health and fitness products, film how-to 
videos, and conduct exhibitions and seminars across the country. He comes to 
town in the wake of a Master's win over such rivals as Lou Ferrigno of 
"Incredible Hulk" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrigno, eight years Robinson's junior, had to settle for second place. Says 
Robinson: "You're never too old to build muscle."

 SAFE CARNAVAL: There's an awful lot of coffee in Brazil, but what about 
condoms? There aren't very many, and many Brazilians can't afford to buy them 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 So Venice resident Lori Miller has taken it upon herself to preach the gospel 
of safe sex during that most unsafe of times -- the Carnaval season in 
Salvador, a steamy city in the state of Bahia on Brazil's poor but scenic 
northeast coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Her teaching tool is a colorful bracelet made of ribbons, paper and condoms, 
together with illustrations and instructions in Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 Made by volunteers in the Los Angeles area, 10,000 of the bracelets were 
distributed by public health organizations and music and dance groups in Bahia 
during Carnaval earlier this year. Plans are under way to double that number in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "People let go of their inhibitions then (the weeklong celebration comes 
before the beginning of Lent), and there are not a lot of messages for safe 
sex," said Miller, 27, who lived in Bahia when she was teaching English in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her return to Los Angeles, where she works for the Los Angeles Regional 
Family Planning Council, she, together with friend Rhonda Brown, came up with 
the idea of the condom bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the relative cost of condoms is high -- one-third of the average 
Bahia household's income if used as a regular form of birth control -- Miller 
said she hopes to get the word out in hopes of seeing the price reduced in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody there was incredibly receptive," Miller said. "Everybody from very 
old people to very young people. They want us to bring more. They put it on 
prime time TV. We hear this year they're having a Carnaval song to use a 
condom." 
</P>

<P>
 AHOY: It was a mighty flotilla that drifted down the Venice waterways Sunday 
night, competing for prizes in the Venice Canals Assn.'s 13th annual boat 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve slightly off-key carolers attempted to keep their balance on one raft. 
A Snoopy Red Baron was towed in a multicolored biplane. A fire-breathing dragon 
with a butane flame and torches rocked unsteadily on barrels, flipped over, but 
was eventually righted. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Claus barge wasn't so fortunate: It sank in the Howland Canal and 
couldn't complete the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The award for funniest float went to an eight-foot, hinged snowman that 
performed a back-bending limbo to pass beneath each canal bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best one we've ever had," said Henry Coleman, a member of the 
sponsoring association. "The boats are more elaborate, there are more of them, 
and we've got hundreds of spectators."

SHAKY SITUATION; SUIT FILED BY OWNERS OF HISTORIC HILLVIEW APARTMENTS CLAIMS 
THAT METRO RAIL TUNNELING DAMAGED HOLLYWOOD LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a historic apartment building in Hollywood have filed the first 
lawsuit for property damages in connection with subway construction under 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's Metro Rail project last August caused waterline 
breaks, sewage backups and other damage to the Hillview Apartments, a 64-unit 
residence built in 1917 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners claim the building is a total loss and must be demolished. The suit 
seeks unspecified damages and joins four lawsuits previously filed by property 
owners in the Wilshire corridor against MTA and its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "(MTA contractors) have very little regard for the businesses they're 
affecting" during construction, said Arnold K. Graham, attorney for the 
Hillview owners. "Their attitude is, 'If we damage them, we'll pay it back 
through litigation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA spokesman says that the agency was served with the suit earlier this 
week and has not had a chance to review it. But he noted that the Hillview was 
already seriously damaged in the January earthquake, and that MTA 
administrators last month denied the owners' claim for alleged damages related 
to subway tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists and city officials, meanwhile, say that the building can be 
saved and is needed to provide housing for low-income seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building is by no means in need of total demolition," said William F. 
Delvac, principal of Historic Resources Group, a consulting firm that has in 
the past advised city and MTA officials on the preservation of old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Hillview's historic status, a proposed demolition would be 
subject to a lengthy environmental review unless city officials deemed the 
structure an imminent threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit caps a miserable year for the Hillview, a pink stucco landmark at 
Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Avenue built by movie mogul Jesse Lasky to house 
silent stars including "Laurel and Hardy" actress Mae Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles red-tagged several units on the building's southern 
side after the Northridge temblor. In August, the city red-tagged additional 
units and about 12 tenants were evacuated to a nearby hotel following a gas 
service interruption. The remaining two-thirds of the building is considered 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owners blamed the new red tags and utility problems on Metro 
Rail construction, which made national headlines in August after causing 
portions of Hollywood Boulevard to sink by as much as 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA, while not admitting responsibility for any damage to the Hillview, 
nevertheless agreed to pay the displaced tenants' hotel and meal bills, which 
MTA spokesman Steve Chesser estimated to be $100,000. The agency also picked up 
relocation costs when tenants found permanent housing elsewhere, Chesser said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, the building currently houses 17 tenants. The 
tenants -- most of them in their 70s and 80s -- have stayed despite the 
building's persistent troubles. In October, one of the owners told tenants to 
move within 20 days, ostensibly to prepare the way for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 That move drew sharp opposition from Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who said that the city's rent-control ordinance requires a 30-day 
notice and $5,000 relocation subsidies to elderly tenants in the event of 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, a city building inspector reported to Goldberg's office that 
recent aftershocks may have further weakened the building and made demolition 
necessary. But other inspectors, upon closer examination, concluded that most 
of the building was still safe and required only additional bracing, according 
to Goldberg aide Mirta Ocana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the January temblor, preservationists have lost battles to save 
several historic buildings in Hollywood, including the Brown Derby on Vine 
Street and the Hastings Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Hillview) is one building we really want to save," Ocana said. 
"Hollywood has already lost enough buildings to the earthquake."

DEAL PUTS ROSENSTEIN IN AS SANTA MONICA MAYOR; POLITICS: STALEMATE IS BROKEN 
THANKS TO AN UNLIKELY ACCORD THAT GIVES RIVAL FACTIONS LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ON 
THE CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a last-minute deal, the Santa Monica City Council has broken its weeklong 
deadlock, electing Councilman Paul Rosenstein as the city's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein's election was the result of a compromise hammered out prior to 
Tuesday's council meeting. The deal assured the election of Councilwoman Asha 
Greenberg, who is in an opposing political organization, as mayor pro tem. The 
accord was unusual in that it gives rival political camps -- Santa Monicans for 
Renters Rights (SMRR) and the Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica -- leadership 
positions on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein, who is backed by SMRR, captured six council votes. Mayoral 
competitor Councilman Ken Genser abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's mayoral election came a week after the council, with its three newly 
seated members, had repeatedly failed to elect a leader. The council made more 
than a dozen attempts to choose a mayor, even proposing to split the two-year 
mayoral post between candidates, but found itself at an impasse when no council 
member could garner the necessary four votes. Although the renters' rights 
group controls four seats on the seven-member council, the SMRR votes were 
divided between mayoral hopefuls Rosenstein and Genser. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office determined that the seated mayor, Judy Abdo, would 
stay on until a new mayor was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Rosenstein said he had made the "difficult" decision to support 
Greenberg for the second highest council position, saying he believed it was 
important to show the community that the council could work together and was 
not stymied by gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the election, Rosenstein pointed out that the two camps had come 
together two years ago when Coalition members Greenberg and Councilman Robert 
Holbrook agreed to cross party lines and elect Abdo as mayor, despite her 
alliance with the renters' rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's time to make a similar type of move and nominate Asha for mayor pro 
tempore," Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg won election as mayor pro tem on a 4-3 vote, but Abdo and 
Councilwoman Pam O'Connor, who initially opposed Greenberg's election, later 
changed their votes in an attempt to show council unity. The unity movement 
fell short by one, however, when Genser declined to amend his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Right up to Tuesday's meeting, Genser continued to refuse to back Rosenstein 
for a full two-year term as mayor, but said he was willing to split the term 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, Greenberg said she would have preferred to see Holbrook 
split a two-year mayoral term with Rosenstein, but when it did not appear that 
was politically feasible, she had agreed to take the mayor pro tem's position 
to break the deadlock. Holbrook, she said, did not want to be mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was detrimental to have the stalemate," Greenberg said. "It gives 
the community a poor view of government, that we can't resolve a simple issue. 
This was in the best interest of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 After Rosenstein was elected, Genser said, he could not endorse the deal 
between the two camps. Genser said before the meeting that he was concerned 
that if Rosenstein and Greenberg were elected, quality-of-life issues such as 
neighborhood protection and protection of renters' rights would not be 
adequately addressed. He also said that some SMRR members were unhappy with the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenstein said he knew the compromise with the coalition angered some SMRR 
leaders but vowed that he had neither changed his politics nor philosophy, 
pledging to continue his support of rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had come to conclude there was a great deal of anxiety in the city," said 
Rosenstein, adding that in an era in which government's ability to function is 
called into question, it was important to show that the city has leaders who 
can work together. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's role is primarily ceremonial. The mayor chairs council meetings 
and helps the city manager set the council's agenda; the mayor pro tem takes 
over when the mayor cannot fulfill his or her duties. In the past, the mayor 
pro tem has also sat in on some agenda-setting meetings.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; MORE CITIES JOIN POWER CONSORTIUM TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like coup plotters, officials from area cities have gathered every two weeks 
or so in the back room of a Culver City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, tentatively called the South Bay Joint Powers Consortium, is 
studying whether to join forces and demand lower electric rates from Southern 
California Edison. And if the electric industry becomes deregulated -- 
something that now is being considered by the California Public Utilities 
Commission -- the group would buy power in bulk from the least expensive 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is still in the early stages of discussion, and cities taking part in 
those talks have by no means committed to the project. But at the latest 
meeting, last week at Geo Petrelli's Steak House, there were signs that the 
effort is stirring broad interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign-in list included the names of officials from several cities -- such 
as Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Redondo Beach, Burbank and Rolling Hills -- 
that had not previously taken part in the talks. Officials from nine cities 
have been involved in the discussions since the idea first surfaced early in 
the fall -- Culver City, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lawndale, Gardena, Carson, 
Torrance, El Segundo and Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample joint powers agreement, which would formalize the cities' 
participation in the consortium, was distributed. But getting city officials to 
sign such an agreement could be a challenge. So far, only Culver City, Carson, 
Hawthorne and Lomita have formally expressed support for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And prospective new members are clearly keeping their options open. "It may 
work for other cities, but I'm not sure it would work in Beverly Hills," said 
Dan Webster, city director of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 No such reservations, however, were evident among the energy consultants, 
investment bankers and representatives of the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power who also attended the meeting. Edison officials have been meeting 
with officials from some of the cities discussing the consortium idea, 
reminding them of Edison's positive points. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one city official seemed receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Edison) does a lot in our city," said Lomita Councilman Dave Albert. 
"They're charging us a little too much money, but they're bringing us an olive 
branch. I think we should try and negotiate, not go in there fighting." MARY 
MOORE

TOPICS / THE HOLIDAYS; AN EDIBLE GIFT THAT'LL BRING THE HOUSE DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The houses designed by Jeanne Benedict are unique, elegant and structurally 
sound. They also taste good. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, as a struggling young actress in Hollywood, she began creating 
gingerbread houses as inexpensive, artsy holiday gifts for her friends. Now it 
has become a lucrative sideline: Benedict just released a how-to video, 
"Gingerbread House Party," which provides a step-by-step guide to creating 
one's own winter wonderlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the fun is people doing it themselves," she proclaims. "Kids have fun 
watching it, but it's really geared for adults." The houses are edible, she 
says, "but if you spray them with clear acrylic and treat them well, they'll 
keep forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-minute, comedy-laced video -- which offers instructor Benedict as "The 
Gingerbread Queen," actor Frank Schultz as "Grammy Schultz" and an original 
score by guitarist Zachary Throne -- features three gingerbread houses: a 
traditional Tudor home, a licorice barn and a Southwestern hacienda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give you the recipes the dimensions, and a lot of decorating suggestions," 
Benedict says. "Like, for logs you can use bread sticks or pretzels. And for 
shingles, Andes mints. I encourage people to stand in front of a candy store 
and let their imaginations go wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the actress admits that thrift was one of her original motivations, 
she was also quick to realize she'd tapped into a relatively undiscovered 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at Los Angeles -- Christmastime without snow," she said, "and 
gingerbread houses were not the trendy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She has capitalized on the novelty. With an average construction time of 1 1/2 
days, Benedict's homemade houses range in price from $100 to $500 (when she 
followed the design of a real house a man was buying for his wife). 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, the actress tried to drum up interest by going through 
San Marino and "putting a flyer on every house." These days, her baking season 
usually begins in September, as gingerbread fans put in their orders for 
private decorations and corporate centerpieces.  
</P>
<P>
 Promoting "Gingerbread House Party," the actress recently appeared on "The 
Suzanne Somers Show" and will bring her baking wares to the ABC morning 
talk-show "Mike and Maty" on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the tape, Benedict says, is for families to be able to have fun 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have tradition," she said, "and still be zany and creative. Kids can 
pick their own themes: sports, astronauts, whatever. And it's important to know 
you can do this without spending very much money. There are a lot of things you 
have around the house -- toy ornaments, old bells for Christmas trees, edible 
and non-edible materials. You can use animal crackers, cookie cutters. . . . I 
want this to be an Everyman project, to say to people, 'You can do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For those who still feel hesitant about their culinary skills, listen to 
Benedict. "I cannot bake to save my life," she said, giggling. "I can only make 
and decorate gingerbread houses."

BRIEFLY: PETS: HOLIDAY DECORATIONS MAY POSE HEALTH HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals/Southern 
California Humane Society is asking pet owners to take special care to guard 
against injuries to their pets during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The SPCA/SCHS reports that every year cats, dogs and other pets suffer from 
poisoning, electrical burns or digestive problems as a result of nibbling on 
poinsettias, tripping over light bulbs and eating tinsel.  
</P>
<P>
 Such hazards can be easily avoided by cleaning up stray holiday decorations 
and keeping items out of reach of pets, according to the SPCA/SCHS.

BRIEFLY: CHARITY: UNICEF UPDATE ON CHILDREN'S ISSUES PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles branch of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will 
unveil its 1995 report on the state of the world's children today in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, an update of last year's findings, addresses global hunger and 
poverty issues, AIDS among children and educational progress. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF's Los Angeles branch is also scheduled today to introduce a local 
program, the Public Health Advisory Council, formed by doctors and health care 
experts to examine immunization and AIDS education and to identify 
"baby-friendly" hospitals for Los Angeles-area children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of the advisory council is to work with the L.A. office of UNICEF 
and communicate to the local community issues of health that impact our 
children and children in other parts of the world," said Marilyn Solomon, 
executive director of UNICEF/LA.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LEIMERT PARK; YOUTHS BRIDGE NATIONS VIA VIDEOPHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boys asked one another about school, teachers, what's in fashion and one 
another's favorite music -- a typical conversation between high school students 
who have just met. 
</P>
<P>
 This one, though, was unfolding over thousands of miles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaos Network, a coffeehouse-style arts center in Leimert Park, seven 
African American teen-agers spent a morning querying their South African 
counterparts about everything from hairstyles to South Africa's shifting 
political landscape via videophone. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone and video hookup, set up between Los Angeles and Grahamstown, 
South Africa, allowed the students to exchange words and images. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like one of the guys in (the rap group) Kris Kross!" exclaimed 
Bongani Noyikwa after seeing the black-and-white image of Chris Bailey, a 
Westchester High School senior sporting an oversize jacket and close-cropped 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the laughter that broke out around the room, Bailey replied, "Well, if I 
was, I would have a lot more money and live someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Griffith, a student at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, a 
Westside high school, took the microphone to ask Mfuzo Nano what he thought of 
newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, great!" Nano said enthusiastically. "Mandela, he is the king of kings." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural exchange was staged by the Southern Africa Education Campaign, a 
Washington-based organization begun last year that sponsors educational and 
cultural events for Americans and Africans here and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign seeks to promote stronger American ties with South Africa and 
neighboring countries such as Angola, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaos founder and filmmaker Ben Caldwell provided the videophone communication 
for last week's session, something he has done in other African countries and 
locally for events such as the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign coordinator Lisa Cannon said she wants to ensure that the attention 
centered on South Africa's recent historic elections does not fade in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose impetus in the interest in Africa," she said. "A 
two-way learning process like this encourages the kind of dialogue that will 
keep things going. Too many images of Africa kids see on TV here are negative 
-- war, poverty, abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The students chosen to connect with the South African group are in the Los 
Angeles Community Outreach Program, an independent college preparatory and 
motivational program that serves students citywide.  
</P>
<P>
 Program founder and director Clifford Brazil said there is much that his 
students -- the majority of whom are from central Los Angeles -- can learn from 
their South African peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are parallels they can make to our own society," he said. "We are 
beyond certain struggles that they haven't gotten through yet. Talking to 
people in another part of the world puts things in a different context." 
</P>
<P>
 Zosukuma Kunene, 18, startled the South African group when he sat down at the 
microphone and started speaking in a rapid mix of English and Zulu. "My parents 
are South African, but I was born in London after my father was exiled," said 
Kunene, who grew up in View Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students easily discovered that they listened to the same reggae 
bands and shared a disdain for school uniforms, more complex issues sometimes 
left both groups at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nano asked Charity Bailey what she considered herself -- black, African 
American or simply American -- the 17-year-old hesitated and answered black. 
Bailey asked Nano if he considered black Americans to be true African brethren? 
</P>
<P>
 Nano hesitated, then his reply came crackling over the mike. "I consider you 
all to be Americans, equal to all other Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 That, said Bailey instantly, would be nice, "but it's not true. . . . We are 
not equal as you say." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; 'MULCH MADNESS' TO BEGIN BEAUTIFICATION OF EXPOSITION 
BLVD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps is joining forces with several community 
groups and businesses to spread holiday cheer through the promise of trees -- 
though not the traditional Scotch pines that grace countless corner lots this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps is encouraging the public to come out Saturday for "Mulch Madness" 
to help workers begin beautification of a stretch of Exposition Boulevard by 
laying down mulch as a precursor to tree plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulch consists of environmentally friendly wood chips that eventually 
decompose into the soil, providing a foundation for later plantings. The chips 
will be laid along Exposition from Crenshaw Boulevard to La Brea Avenue, 
sprucing up an eyesore of weeds, gravel and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The mulching will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., beginning at Crenshaw 
and winding up at Farmdale Avenue near Dorsey High. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will also provide corps members, many of them young men from local 
neighborhoods, the opportunity to come together for a large-scale project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring our corps members from both sites together," said Martin 
Ludlow, who directs the Main Street conservation corps site. "The Exposition 
Boulevard project gives the (Conservation Corps) the chance to work together on 
a larger scale and impact the Los Angeles community." 
</P>
<P>
 Corps members from the Main Street and Hammel Avenue sites will work with 
volunteers from a variety of agencies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; MOBILE HOME OPERATOR SETTLES LAWSUIT WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing costly legal challenges to defend its mobile home rent control 
law in state and federal courts, the city of Malibu has agreed to a settlement 
with the owners of one of the community's two mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the Adamson Cos., the owner of Point Dume Club mobile home 
park, was reached six days before a scheduled federal court hearing in which 
the park owner was seeking $1.5 million in damages against the city. The City 
Council approved a $400,000 settlement in a 4-1 vote at a council meeting two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Christi Hogin has been in negotiations with the Adamson Cos. and 
the Kissel Company, the owner of Paradise Cove mobile home park, since June in 
hopes of averting a damages trial. "We're satisfied that the settlement is good 
for Malibu and we have worked very hard with the Adamson Cos.," Hogin said. 
</P>
<P>
 No settlement has been reached with the Kissel Company. Attorneys representing 
the company filed suit last week against Malibu seeking $2.5 million to $5.5 
million in damages for loss of back rent, attorney's fees and other losses 
incurred by the rent control law. The trial ended Thursday, and a decision from 
U.S. District Court Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzeris pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer in June struck down as unconstitutional several key provisions of the 
city's mobile home rent control ordinance, including a rent rollback to 1984 
base levels and a two-year rent freeze. Pfaelzer upheld the city's right to 
regulate future rents and told the city to reimburse the park owners for 
attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 With a damages suit looming and having already spent more than $500,000 in 
attorney's fees, the city began settlement negotiations with the Kissel 
Company.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's agreement with the Adamson Cos. calls for Malibu to pay $400,000 to 
the company over two fiscal years. Under the agreement, the city amended the 
rent control ordinance to allow rents to be raised at the full rate of Consumer 
Price Index, but no less than 2% and no more than 5% annually. Under the 
previous version of the law, space rents could be raised 75% of the Consumer 
Price Index, but no more than 5% a year. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to increase city revenues and make Malibu more film-friendly, the 
City Council has voted unanimously to create an in-house film permit office and 
reduce fees for permits by $115 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, permits to film in Malibu were processed through the Department of 
Regional Planning's Los Angeles County Film Office, where a standard permit 
brought the county $315 and $400 to the city of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malibu cut the county out of the deal Monday night when the City Council 
approved amendments to the film permit fee resolution so that the city will 
collect $600 for a standard permit. 
</P>
<P>
 All the processing work will now be done within Malibu City Hall, with a city 
ombudsman assigned to handle requests 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The city 
will also allow commercial film interests to fax their permit applications and 
will use the same method to return approved permits. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

REGIONAL REPORT: TORRANCE; NEW OWNERS TO EXPAND BRISTOL FARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bristol Farms Gourmet Specialty Food Markets will be acquired by an investment 
group as part of a plan to expand the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, Kamm & Co. Inc., a Beverly Hills investment company, is buying the 
Torrance-based gourmet food market, according to Irv Gronsky, owner and 
president.Company officials declined to reveal any financial arrangements but 
did say the sale is in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, when Gronsky founded the first Bristol Farms in Rolling Hills 
Estates, it has become one of the Southland's most successful upscale food 
retailers, generating just over $50 million in sales annually. Its South 
Pasadena store, which opened in 1985, is now one of that city's largest 
generators of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in ownership is part of a plan to finance new Bristol Farms markets 
across the Southland, said Louis A. Kwiker, who will take over as chief 
executive officer and chairman.

REGIONAL REPORT: ECHO PARK; RESIDENTS PLAGUED BY RUNAWAY VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Armando Sanchez began to prepare dinner for his family one Tuesday 
last month, an uninvited visitor arrived without so much as ringing the 
doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-foot moving van crashed through the living room wall, narrowly missing 
Sanchez, his wife and their 5-year-old daughter. The family suffered only a few 
scrapes and bruises, but their home was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it -- there was a truck in my living room," 
Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hills and valleys of Echo Park, where the Sanchez's Avon Street home 
is nestled at the bottom of a 25-degree incline, such an accident is not 
uncommon. Runaway vehicles careen down the area's steep streets at least once a 
month, destroying thousands of dollars' worth of property, said John Wilson, a 
Central Traffic Division auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Wilson recalled, a cement truck bulldozed several homes as it 
barreled through the intersection of Earl Street and Glendale Boulevard before 
landing in a swimming pool. One resident was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little the city can do about such accidents, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many runaway vehicle incidents would be avoided if drivers maintained the 
brakes on their cars, remembered to apply emergency brakes, and were careful to 
cramp their wheels to the curb when they park, or parked in driveways, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the brakes on the moving van, loaded with furniture, may have 
failed. No charges have been filed, but the incident remains under 
investigation. The driver, Daniel Cortez, 31, was not seriously injured, 
according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, on the other hand, was knocked from its foundation. The right side, 
where the living room was, has collapsed. The attic ceiling rests atop the 
living room couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo and Maria Canepa, Armando Sanchez's in-laws, own the house. Contractors 
have informed them that the building must be demolished and will cost at least 
$120,000 to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canepas, who live next door to the Sanchez family, said they are 
frustrated that the city does not provide better protection for their houses, 
which face Avon Park Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 At least twice before, cars coming down the hill have just missed their 
houses. Last year, a car rolled into the Canepas' driveway, coming to a halt 
just before plowing through their gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see a retaining wall built in front of the house," said Maria 
Canepa, who rushed up the hill a few days after the latest accident and berated 
a driver she saw parking without turning the wheels into the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Central Traffic Division officers, the city might take some type 
of preventive measure, such as creating a no-parking zone, if enough complaints 
are filed. But one official said it would take "an act of God" to get the city 
to pay for a retaining wall, which could cost up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like in an earthquake; the city is not going to pay for the damage 
done to houses built on stilts," said Arvin Turner, an officer in the LAPD'S 
traffic control division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canepas don't know if they can afford to rebuild. Although they have 
insurance, they are unsure whether it will cover the cost of replacing the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 When she talks about the accident, Maria Canepa begins to get misty-eyed. The 
house was left to the couple in 1983 in the will of the former owner, an 
elderly neighbor whom Canepa used to look after. The neighbor knew they would 
take good care of the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't open our shades," Leo Canepa said, "so we don't have to look at it."

REGIONAL REPORT: SOUTH BAY; THE MANY PUBLIC WORKS OF A PUBLIC MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through 12 terms, former Democratic Rep. Glenn M. Anderson rarely took the 
forefront of partisan turf wars, social controversies or foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to lining up federal support for freeway tunnels or rail 
lines, he was a master. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson died Tuesday at 81 from complication of Alzheimer's disease, almost 
two years after he retired from a lengthy career that took him to City Hall, 
Sacramento and Washington. Although he gained the limelight as lieutenant 
governor in the 1960s, his ability to shepherd an endless list of public works 
projects through Congress could be his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, which he headed 
from 1988 to 1990, he made possible the Port of Los Angeles' main shipping 
channel (called the Glenn M. Anderson Deep Ship Channel), the Century (105) 
Freeway (officially named for him) and Metro Rail (which has a plaque in his 
honor at a Downtown Los Angeles station). His moniker is also on a park in 
Redondo Beach and a federal building in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went back to Washington, I always went to Glenn Anderson's office," 
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana. "He was the key congressman to 
get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics today may call the projects pork, but friends and supporters say he 
was coming through for the district and was critical in getting projects for 
other parts of the country through his powerful committee. Quiet and 
unassuming, he worked behind the scenes to persuade colleagues that the 
projects would have a national payoff.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, he secured the controversial Metro Rail project by making it 
part of a omnibus bill that included money for transit programs throughout the 
country. By the time it reached the House floor, Anderson had made so many 
deals with other representatives that its victory was assured. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he was able to do was translate the importance of his projects to his 
colleagues, how it would benefit this country and the economy," said Ezunial 
(E. Z.) Burts, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Anderson's efforts were directed at the Port of Los Angeles, which he 
used to call "the sleepy little port."  
</P>
<P>
 His plan to double the cargo-handling capacity of the Ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach helped make the region a world leader in world trade, Burts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Hawthorne, Anderson spent the 1930s putting his UCLA education to 
use as a real estate developer and investor. He had to be nudged by the local 
Masonic Lodge into running for City Council in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a spot in 1942 on the state Assembly, where he persuaded lawmakers that 
the suburban city, with its growing defense industry, was in dire need of more 
schools and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson left the Assembly in 1951 and went on to be elected lieutenant 
governor in 1958.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1968 he was elected to Congress. He won a narrow reelection victory after 
his first term but thereafter was reelected easily. He decided not to run in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is survived by his wife, Lee; daughter Melinda Anderson Keenan; sons 
Evan Anderson Braude and Glenn Michael Anderson, and six grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday at Mary Star of the Sea Church, 
7th and Meyler streets in San Pedro. Burial will be private at Green Hills 
Cemetery.

OUT AND ABOUT / THE CLAYHOUSE; INVITATION TO THE POTTER'S WHEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some, it's a hobby. For others it's a livelihood. Yet both groups come 
together at the Clayhouse, a small ceramics studio nestled among the shops and 
restaurants of Santa Monica Boulevard in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s when it had wide appeal, pottery's popularity has had more 
than a few downturns. In recent years, however, the art form has had a 
resurgence of sorts -- thanks, in part, to studios such as the Clayhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clayhouse combines technical knowledge and convenience. Besides selling 
supplies, owners Natalie Neith and Ken Catbagan have dedicated themselves to 
providing a home for ceramic artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you an opportunity to develop your artwork," said Lorri Herlihy of 
Thousand Oaks, who has used the studio for more than a decade. "I like the 
camaraderie and inspiration (that comes) from the other artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Neith and Catbagan, who both share artistic backgrounds and have taught 
extensively, set out more than a decade ago to open a store where they could 
sell clay. That goal had seemed nearly unattainable until a woman who owned and 
operated the Westside's only clay store decided to sell her business to the 
pair. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple then set to work on renovating the nearly 5,000-square-foot space, 
which would later function not only as a place to buy tools, supplies and 
equipment, but also as a studio where artists could rent space to work.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clayhouse also offers beginning and advanced wheelwork classes in which 
students learn how to use the potter's wheel to make items such as cups, bowls, 
pitchers and plates. Additionally, they sponsor a "handbuilding" course that 
lets students create functional and sculptural shapes in clay without use of 
the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes cost $210 for wheelwork and $198 for handbuilding; both consist of six 
sessions and are offered on an ongoing basis. The fee includes initial supplies 
and firing as well as unlimited access to the studio during the course, plus an 
additional week to complete projects. Enrollment is limited to 10 students per 
class to ensure individual instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with clay "shows you your faults and strong points (as a person)," 
said instructor Kweli Walker, who received a bachelor's degree in fine arts 
from Loyola Marymount University. "It forces you to be brave and to be the 
boss." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clayhouse, 2909 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica. Hours are 10 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.

 Culver City High quarterback Damon Williams, Westchester tight end Tony 
Griffin and St. Monica Coach Norm Lacy were award winners Sunday at The Times' 
Westside All-Star prep football brunch at the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who led the Centaurs to their fourth consecutive Ocean League 
championship, was named the back of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who caught 27 passes for 721 yards and 14 touchdowns, was selected 
the lineman of the year. Lacy, who has led the Mariners to three consecutive 
winning records after a 1-8-1 record in his first season as coach, was selected 
coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Griffin were among 23 players honored during the brunch, which is 
given annually by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino College Coach John Featherstone was the guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a three-sport standout, set single-season school records for most 
passing yards (2,168) and most touchdown passes (19). His two-year total of 
4,154 yards was also a school record. He completed 110 of 202 passes and also 
rushed 50 times for 236 yards and seven touchdowns. Defensively, he had two 
interceptions as a free safety. As a punter, he averaged 39.5 yards a kick. 
Among the schools recruiting Williams are Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Nebraska, Stanford, UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who played only his third season of organized football, was an 
outstanding blocker on offense and one of the City Section's best coverage men 
as a free safety. He recently returned from a recruiting trip to Arizona State 
and is also being recruited by Colorado, Cal and USC, but staying close to home 
would appear to be his choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a lifelong Trojan fan," Griffin said. "It's always been a dream of 
mine to play in front of my family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is one of the top sprinters in the City. He finished fourth in the 100 
meters at the City championships last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy, who began his coaching career as an assistant at Santa Monica High in 
1977, guided the Mariners to a 6-5 record and a share of the Camino League 
championship in 1992, an 8-3 record and a share of the Camino League title in 
1993, and a 7-3 record and second-place league finish this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy's senior class included quarterback Steven Pulley, receivers Jason Jones 
and Dwight Carter, linebacker Mike Bailey, tight end Carlos Casillas and 
two-way lineman Adrian Klemm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had high expectations for those players when they started with me as 
freshmen," Lacy said. "My biggest job was to get the kids to commit to 
long-range goals and try to attain them. It was tough in the beginning because 
we lost so many games." BIG GAME 
</P>
<P>
 It was billed as a game matching the talents of Westchester guards Danny 
Walker and Ben Sanders against Inglewood standout Paul Pierce. Three of the 
area's best basketball players showing off their talents in a battle for 
neighborhood bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Pierce, Walker and Sanders were impressive, the game was decided 
by a Westchester reserve guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamar Talton made a jump shot as time expired in the second overtime to give 
Westchester a 76-75 victory Friday night at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Talton took the ball with six seconds left, dribbled up the court and made a 
twisting shot from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Talton's shot overshadowed Pierce's 33-point, 11-rebound effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker had 20 points, Jason Hart added 16 and Sanders 14 for the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really good game, especially since we won," Westchester Coach Ed 
Azzam said. "It was a rivalry of sorts since most of the kids live next door to 
each other or know each other well." 
</P>
<P>
 Azzam was impressed with Pierce, who moved from small forward to point guard 
in the Sentinels' season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Pierce is an outstanding player who handles the ball well for a big 
man," Azzam said. "He distributes the ball well and doesn't turn it over very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets continue a difficult nonleague schedule this week in the Tournament 
of Champions at Ocean View High. They beat Servite of Anaheim, 58-47, Monday 
and Manual Arts, 95-49, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets will try to defend their title in the Las Vegas Holiday Prep 
Classic beginning Sunday. Last season, the Comets beat East Anchorage and its 
standout player, Trajan Langdon, who is attending Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester plays Sparks of Reed, Nev., to open the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be a recruiting trip of sorts for Sanders, who is leaning toward 
signing with Nevada Las Vegas. NOTABLES 
</P>
<P>
 * The Palisades girls' basketball team has been bolstered by the addition of 
former Hamilton starting guards Kelly Peden and Miata Rice. The two transfers 
and returning standout Nicole Codd have helped the Dolphins to a 6-1 start. "I 
did not recruit them," Palisades Coach Joi Tanita said. "They were admitted 
through open enrollment." The Dolphins have moved to the 4-A Western League 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Venice girls' basketball team suffered a big loss when junior guard Erin 
Shishido tore a ligament in her right leg. Shishido was the team's 
second-leading scorer, averaging 15.5 points a game. Yuriko Jung, a returning 
Times' Westside All-Star, has picked up the offensive load and is averaging 30 
points a game the past three games. "We're going to miss Erin the most on 
defense," Coach Debbie Dreier said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fairfax point guard Duane Davis had seven assists and no turnovers in the 
Lions' 74-39 win over Carson. Lion Coach Harvey Kitani said it was the first 
time one his guards went a game without a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another date to mark on the calendar is Jan. 21, when Westchester meets 
Compton Dominguez in a game matching two of the state's top five teams. The 
game, scheduled for Cal Sate Long Beach's Pyramid, will be moved. Azzam is 
hopeful the new site will be Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets, meanwhile, received their home uniforms, which were ordered in the 
preseason, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palisades forward Lamar Tillman, who tore ligaments in his left knee during 
the summer, is averaging 11 rebounds a game for the Dolphins. He had 17 
rebounds in a second-round win over Fremont in the Beverly Hills tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Olympic volleyball gold medalist Chris Marlowe and former Duke standout Chip 
Engelland are scheduled to compete for a Palisades alumni team that will play 
the varsity at 7 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former USC and Iowa standout Gerry Wright, in his first season as girls' 
coach at Santa Monica, explaining his team's 3-4 record: "I can teach them all 
the plays. I can teach them how to play, but I can't teach them how to show up 
and be ready to play. They seem to make up their minds before the start of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they think they will have trouble winning, they play unbelievably well. 
But if they're not scared by the other team, they just show up and those teams 
tend to beat us." SEAN WATERS

JURY STUDY TO LOOK AT RACIAL BIASES, TRIAL RESULTS; JUSTICE: CAL STATE 
FULLERTON RESEARCHERS WILL EXAMINE PANELISTS' EXPERIENCES AND THEIR POSSIBLE 
PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT DEFENDANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Do criminal juries regard Asian defendants differently than white defendants, 
black defendants differently than Latinos? Three Cal State Fullerton social 
scientists intend to find out.  
</P>
<P>
 The three will conduct a groundbreaking study to determine whether racial 
preconceptions affect parts of the judicial system.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pioneering attempt to gain an empirical look at whether racial or 
ethnic bias impinges on the jury-trial process," said Gregory Robinson, 
associate director of the university's Social Science Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, psychology professor Ronald E. Riggio and criminal justice assistant 
professor George M. Dery III have contracted with the Judicial Council of 
California for about $73,500 to examine jurors' experiences and trial outcomes, 
university officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all these high-profile trials going on now, it's likely that people will 
be interested in the results," Riggio said. The Judicial Council, which 
oversees the state's courts, is expected to release the study findings this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers said they are arranging to access computerized records of tens 
of thousands of cases involving charges of murder, robbery and other felonies. 
They plan to examine jury decisions in felony cases in Orange and Alameda 
counties, as well as misdemeanor cases in Los Angeles County that involve 
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggio said prior studies did not ask jurors specifically about racial or 
ethnic bias, and no existing studies use as much data as the researchers plan 
to examine. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers' first step: going through case dispositions as far back as 
1990. That can mean as many as 40,000 cases in each county per year, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They will examine verdicts involving defendants of different races, 
ethnicities and gender, which can be difficult to compare at first, researchers 
said. But by using statistical methods, they will eliminate some of the factors 
beside racial or ethnic bias that could account for disparities in juries' 
verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said those factors include whether defendants use interpreters, 
whether they have private lawyers or public defenders, their ability to post 
bail and previous convictions.  
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also will look for trends in cases in which defendants plead 
guilty without going to a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to analyzing convictions, acquittals and mistrials, the scientists 
will talk to jurors.  
</P>
<P>
 They plan to survey 750 former jurors in Orange and Alameda counties by 
telephone to ask whether they think race and ethnic prejudices played a role in 
the jury's decisions. Afterward, they hope to conduct personal interviews with 
members of six to eight juries who deliberated recent cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggio said the three researchers work well together because he has prior 
experience in interviewing jurors, Robinson is an expert in analyzing data and 
research methods and Dery is a former prosecutor for the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pretty fortunate we fell in together," Riggio said. "We're a perfect 
team."

A TRADITION IS WELL-RECEIVED; CAROLERS STAGE LAS POSADAS IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holding candles and singing in Spanish, about 350 Christmas carolers on 
Wednesday staged the city's third annual Las Posadas, a traditional depiction 
of Mary and Joseph's search for shelter on the eve of Jesus' birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Child actors portraying Mary and Joseph and the carolers knocked on the doors 
of four homes seeking shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "En el nombre del cielo, yo os pido posada (In the name of heaven, I ask for 
shelter)," the group sang at one home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aqui no es meson. Sigan adelante (This is not an inn. Be on your way)," 
responded Susie Moreno, one of the homeowners. Four times, the carolers were 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour's journey down Valencia, Pomona and Rosslynn avenues, the 
procession was welcomed into the Maple Senior Multi-Service Center, which had 
been turned into a manger for the festivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entren santos. . . . Reciban esta mansion, que aunque es pobre, os la doy de 
corazon (Come in saints. . . . Enter this mansion, that even though it is 
humble, I offer it with my heart)," sang Eloisa Espinoza, a city spokeswoman 
and event organizer, at the entrance of the Maple center. 
</P>
<P>
 There the carolers were treated to special Mexican sweet bread and hot 
chocolate and began the celebration of the birth of Christ. They also sang 
Christmas carols and watched Aztec dancers and the Chicano Poet Society 
perform. The children, about 60 of whom live in the neighborhood, wore colorful 
Mexican outfits and carried staffs.  
</P>
<P>
 Las Posadas is a series of processions traditionally staged in Mexico and 
other Latin American countries Dec. 16 through 24, marking the nine days Mary 
and Joseph traveled to Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reminds us of our culture and traditions in Mexico," Espinoza said.  
</P>
<P>
 Maria de la Luz (Lucy Ruiz) Milan, a community volunteer who persuaded the 
city to stage Las Posadas for the first time in 1992, said it is "an important 
tradition that we must carry on so our children will pass it on to their 
children. It teaches the true meaning of Christmas. The children must realize 
that Christmas is about the birth of Christ, not Santa Claus. We should never 
forget that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mireya Savinon, 13, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Las Posadas because it comes from Mexico, the land where I was born, 
and it makes me proud. It's a beautiful tradition that should (take place) 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Las Posadas will be staged in various neighborhoods, some beginning with 
special Christmas Masses at Catholic churches throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Dates, times and locations include: St. Boniface Church, 120 N. Janss St. in 
Anaheim, at 5 p.m. Saturday; Iglesia Catolica de San Joaquin, 1964 Orange Ave. 
in Costa Mesa, at 7 p.m. Friday through Dec. 23; Bowers Museum, 2002 N. Main 
St. in Santa Ana, at 5:30 p.m. Sunday; Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, 541 E. 
Central Ave. in Santa Ana, at 6:45 p.m. Friday through Dec. 24; Nuestra Senora 
de Guadalupe, 322 E. 3rd St. in Santa Ana, at 7 p.m. Friday through Dec. 23; 
Nuestra Senora del Pilar, 1622 W. 6th St. in Santa Ana, at 7 p.m. Friday 
through Dec. 23; and Serra Chapel, at El Camino Real and Ortega Highway in San 
Juan Capistrano, at 6 p.m. Friday.

PROP. 187 ADVISER TO HELP FLORIDA GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political consultant Robert Kiley, who helped direct the successful 
Proposition 187 campaign, will head to Florida next month to advise groups who 
want to enact similar legislation in that state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee that it will be as lively a debate in Florida as it was in 
California," Kiley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley, 46, is being brought to the state by Floridians for Immigration 
Control, which held its first meeting in July and has about 200 members. He 
will also be meeting with other groups that want to draft legislation similar 
to Proposition 187, which denies public services, such as education, social 
services and non-emergency medical care, to illegal immigrants.

 "We were contacted by these people in the middle of our campaign in California 
and they were watching with great interest what's been happening," Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda resident expects to have his hands full, since Florida Gov. 
Lawton Chiles has said he is against legislation like Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor has always believed that you don't punish the refugees or the 
communities by denying people health care and turning children out of 
classrooms," said Jo Miglino, a Chiles spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Floridians for Immigration Control will need 429,428 signatures by August, 
1996, to get the measure on the ballot. That's 8% of the Florida electorate in 
the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Jacobs, co-founder of Floridians for Immigration Control, declined to 
comment on the hiring of Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said he will meet with leaders from Floridians for Immigration Control 
and other groups to advise them on a number of issues, including: identifying 
funding sources, setting up volunteers, setting up telephone and fax networks 
and setting up direct mail programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley had never managed a major statewide campaign until this year. He had 
previously focused on local measures and the City Council election of his wife, 
Yorba Linda Councilwoman Barbara Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said he will be in Florida for at least four days in January, but does 
not know how much he will be paid for his services.

SPECIAL HOLIDAY CARDS CHEER CREATORS TOO; CHILDREN WITH CANCER USE ARTWORK TO 
RAISE SELF-ESTEEM, CONSCIOUSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 For most of her life, Andi Drayer, 17, has been drawing and doing artwork of 
other kinds. But when she was found to have cancer in 1989, the watercolors, 
paints, pens and crayons she used for pleasure suddenly became tools in her 
fight against illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only 12 when I found out I had cancer," Andi said. "I ran down the hall 
crying and throwing up. I didn't think it would happen to me. Art was like the 
thing that got me through it, not really the radiation and chemotherapy. The 
art was a big part of my life. I was able to show my feelings through the art." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Andi is one of more than a dozen children with cancer to have her art 
featured on Christmas cards through Kids Cancer Connection Inc., an 
Irvine-based nonprofit organization founded in 1989 by a group of parents 
dedicated to helping children with cancer and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Now into its fifth year, the Glad Tidings holiday card program is a 
therapeutic and educational effort that helps children with cancer gain a 
greater sense of self-worth, heightens public awareness and raises funds, said 
Shirley Thiel, executive director of Kids Cancer Connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside each card is a short biography of the artist, the type of illness the 
child has and some background about the organization. Most of the cards also 
have a holiday greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Self-esteem, for anyone, is so important," Thiel said. "Here, you have a 
little boy or girl who has lost all their hair because of chemotherapy. You can 
imagine how much self-esteem they get by seeing their cards bought by 
corporations and individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 To the kids, it's just fun. When staff members went to 4-year-old Daniel 
Harberts' home in San Clemente with an armload of art supplies, he was so 
excited and having so much fun scribbling that they couldn't get any artwork 
out of him, Thiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have seen the cards usually comment on how professional they look. 
Getting children as young as Daniel to create a workable design can be a 
challenge, said Nicole Whitman, special projects director. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the art itself is not the main purpose, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want people to realize is that Kids Cancer Connection is not about 
being talented," Whitman said. "If they can draw, they draw. The self-esteem 
they get from it is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 To help guide the children, Joan Corman Bloch, a Laguna Beach artist, 
volunteers her time. When Daniel had difficulty getting started, she came up 
with the idea of letting him paint the background, sprinkle salt on it to 
create white stars, then glue a few cut-out yellow stars on top of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a little art lesson," Bloch said. "To watch them develop and do 
something that they're proud of is what keeps people teaching. They realize at 
a very young age that their life could be very short and this is a lasting gift 
for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when Jill Hickey, 37, of Trabuco Canyon thought her daughter, 
Megan, wasn't going to make it. When Megan was 18 months old, doctors 
discovered a tumor in her bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Megan has been in remission for more than six years and proudly totes 
her card around with her, showing it to teachers and friends at school. Megan 
likes having her art on the cards so much that she's already starting her 
design for Christmas, 1995, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing joy ," said Megan, who is also considering a career teaching art. 
"The J is a candy cane, the O is an ornament and the Y is holly. It's fun. I 
like meeting new people and making the picture look real." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Hickey said she hopes other parents take comfort in knowing there are 
success stories of children recovering. She also urges other parents to become 
one of the 75 to 80 families on the Kids Cancer Connection mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in the hospital with Megan, I wanted desperately to see success 
stories," Jill said. "I wish we had this program at the time she was going 
through treatment in San Diego. It's such a positive in a negative life." 
</P>
<P>
 Andi is another success story. Her cancer is in remission, but a barrage of 
radiation treatments have impaired her vision and growth. She hopes to attend 
UC Irvine next fall for a possible career in art therapy. Andi works part time 
after school and on the weekends in the activity center at Fundazzle in the 
Tustin Marketplace. She also teaches art classes to third- through 
sixth-graders at Vista Verde School. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing her daughter overcome her visual disability and be strong in the face 
of a deadly illness has also been inspirational for Barbara Drayer, 46. 
</P>
<P>
 "She draws so well," the mother said. "She loves to draw for them and she also 
comes into contact with kids with similar experiences. She's able to talk to 
them and relate to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Elam, 41, of Irvine, mother of three healthy children, has bought 
packs of the cards for the past four years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so fortunate my kids don't have cancer," said Elam, who first saw the 
cards in a store where she worked. "I think it's a good cause and a good 
donation." 
</P>
<P>
 A pack of 24 cards goes for $15. Also available is wrapping paper ($8 for six 
20-inch-by-30-inch sheets) and note cards (12 cards for $7). 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to sell $200,000 worth of cards and paper this year. Proceeds 
support various programs for children with cancer, such as the annual UC Irvine 
Medical Center weekend family retreat for the young patients, their parents and 
siblings; the Hooked On Hopes gift-giving program for financially troubled 
families, and the annual childhood cancer information fair at Jonathan Jaques 
Children's Cancer Center in Long Beach Memorial Hospital. Last year the group 
made $140,000 in sales, with about $70,000 forwarded to the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cards can be purchased at the Kids Cancer Connection office at 17925 Sky Park 
Circle, Suite C, Irvine, at Pet Metro stores (one of the Kids Cancer Connection 
board members is chairman of the pet store chain) and at various local shops. 
The organization also has a sales cart in the Fashion Island shopping center in 
Newport Beach. To request a brochure from which cards can be ordered by 
telephone, or to find the nearest distribution center, call 1-800-949-0209 or 
(714) 851-7774.

 Orange County postal officials are warning their employees and the public to 
watch for suspicious-looking parcels or letters, as authorities seek a serial 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's death of New Jersey advertising executive Thomas J. Mosser was the 
15th in a series of attacks believed to be the work of one person.Two people 
have been killed and 23 have been injured by bombs mailed in six states, 
including seven in Northern California. . 
</P>
<P>
 Postal workers are minimally at risk because package or letter bombs usually 
go off only when opened, said Frank Ducar, inspector for the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Inspection Service recommends that the public check for the 
following warning signs: 
</P>
<P>
 * An excessive amount of postage. People who send bombs tend to avoid post 
offices and, to ensure arrival, overestimate the number of stamps needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Personal," "Private," "Fragile -- Handle With Care" or "Do Not Delay" 
written or stamped on the package. 
</P>
<P>
 * The address in distorted handwriting, or prepared with homemade labels or 
cut-and-paste lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stains, protruding wires, aluminum foil or a peculiar odor. 
</P>
<P>
 * An uneven or lopsided appearance or rigid feeling to letters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Irregular shape, soft spots or bulges on parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buzzing, ticking or sloshing sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amateurish packaging with several combinations of tape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fictitious or no return address, or a postmark that does not match the 
return address. YVETTE CABRERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTHWEST; HUNTINGTON BEACH; SERGEANT HOPES TO SEE MORE 
WOMEN ON FORCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Perez -- the Police Department's only female sergeant and one of just 
five women officers on the 230-member force -- believes more women are needed 
in law enforcement because they bring a different perspective to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to see more women here, and in police work in general," said 
Perez, one of 30 sergeants in the department. "Right now, there's so few of us 
that it's difficult to get that mixed perspective," 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said he hopes to hire 16 to 20 new police 
officers, some of them women, in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law enforcement traditionally has been a white-male-dominated work force. So 
we have a responsibility to change that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new hiring, however, depends on the fallout from the county's fiscal 
crisis and decisions the City Council must make in January about the city's 
$912,000 budget deficit, Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of new hires will fill vacancies created by retirements and 
attrition. Spots for six new police officers and a sergeant were created when 
the council recently decided to spend about $600,000 to put more police on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of qualified women have applied, Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, 41, switched to police work after being laid off from her job as a 
fourth-grade teacher. In 1983, she landed a job with the King County Sheriff's 
Department in Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
 Perez, whose husband is an Inglewood police lieutenant, joined the Huntington 
Beach Police Department in 1989 and was promoted to sergeant two years later. 
She teaches courses on sexual harassment and cultural diversity issues at the 
Golden West College Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the rewards of the job include helping people and being a supervisor. 
"I like being able to make the decisions in the field," she said. "You're kind 
of your own boss."DEBRA CANO

PROTEST AT RADIOACTIVE WASTE PANEL MEETING

 Anti-nuclear activists plan to demonstrate outside today's meeting of the 
federal Board on Radioactive Waste Management at the Beckman Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators said the meeting will have a decidedly pro-nuclear tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are scheduled to listen to reports on low-level radioactive 
waste dumps in Pennsylvania and Texas during the two-day meeting. One agenda 
item is entitled, "Dealing with the Public on LLW" (low-level radioactive 
waste). 
</P>
<P>
 A request for equal time by opponents of the waste dumps was rejected by the 
board, but representatives of the Sierra Club and the Committee to Bridge the 
Gap were granted time to speak at the end of Friday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to let board members know that this will be a very one-sided 
presentation," said Marion Pack, executive director of Alliance for Survival, a 
Santa Ana-based environmental organization planning to take part in today's 
demonstration. "The data they are gathering is from the pro-nuclear side." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal waste management board is meeting at the Beckman Center, a 
conference center for the National Academy of Sciences near the UC Irvine 
campus. The board is a division of the academy charged with advising the 
federal government on radioactive waste issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Board spokesman Craig Hicks said time has been allowed for public comments at 
the two-day meetings, which he said are part of a review of radioactive waste 
management throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically designed to provide the best independent scientific and 
technical advice to the government," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups are fighting a proposal to locate a low-level radioactive 
waste dump in Ward Valley, near Needles. But Hicks said the Ward Valley 
proposal is not on the agenda.RUSS LOAR

 The City Council agreed Tuesday night to meet once a week in reaction to the 
county's fiscal crisis and will issue twice-weekly news releases to keep 
residents informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they want to take a high-profile approach to Irvine's 
$209-million investment in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decision mirrors actions of the Irvine Unified School District 
board, which on Monday agreed to meet each week and issue news releases three 
times a week. The school district has $102 million in the county investment 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and the school district are the top investors among all cities and 
school districts in the county pool. And both have imposed a freeze on hiring 
and "non-essential" spending. But school and city leaders continue to say they 
anticipate no cutbacks in services for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to see a reduction of service levels in the community at 
this time," said City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. at Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 With $300 million invested in the county pool by the Irvine Ranch Water 
District, recent estimates of a 27% decline in the portfolio's value amount to 
a total loss of $165 million for the three Irvine agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, water district board president, says the district has $130 million 
in other accounts which will fund three years of operations and debt service. 
Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said the city has $80 million on deposit in the state 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board President Tom Burnham said the school district needs access 
to investment fund money to make a $54.5-million debt payment due in June. RUSS

 The county's bond crisis helped City Council members quickly make one decision 
intended to boost the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to allow a Santa Fe Springs company to build two 70- to 
90-foot-high signs to carry advertising for auto dealers, entertainment areas 
and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Exact locations for the signs have yet to be determined. But Rick Warsinski, 
assistant director of development services, said one of them, emphasizing auto 
dealers, will be beside the Santa Ana Freeway while the other, with 
entertainment advertising, will be beside the Artesia Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 The city had an option of building similar signs itself and then charging for 
the advertising. But the cost to the city would have been up to $200,000 for 
each sign. 
</P>
<P>
 After some discussion, the council decided against the city's building the 
signs and voted to hire the Santa Fe Springs company.LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 A report showing that the district was in good financial shape as of Oct. 31 
brought little cheer to the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board 
of Trustees this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unknown impact Orange County's recent bankruptcy filing will have 
on $82 million the district has in the county's investment pool, the board 
voted Tuesday night to forward the report to the county superintendent of 
schools and certified that it will have enough money to operate the district 
through June 30 and for the next two school years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's first interim report shows the district will end the year with 
$3.3 million in reserves, which is more than the state mandates. However, some 
of the reserve is tied up in the Orange County pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report was accurate as of Oct. 31, prior to notification of any problems 
with the Orange County Treasury," said assistant superintendent for business 
Kim Stallings. "The reserves are now not all there, but we are still compelled 
to keep track of the money put in there that we believe the county still owes 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings acknowledged that declaring the district financially solvent without 
calculating county's financial problems is a meaningless exercise. But 
Stallings said it is required by law. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 Trustees of the Tustin Unified School District will meet Friday ( to develop a 
"crisis budget" while the school district's $12.8-million investment in the 
troubled Orange County investment pool remains frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Bauer, who was elected school board president this week, said Tuesday 
that trustees also will consider meeting ways to cut costs, including 
identifying projects that may be put on hold.The meeting will begin at 3:45 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll decide on a game plan," said Bauer. "There's a lot of variables, but we 
have to develop an operating budget to get us by." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, who is returning to her third term on the five-member board, said there 
is no immediate threat to the school district's ability to pay teachers 
salaries and other bills. But she said that the staff has been busy looking 
into the financial mess, "taking time away from the business of education." 
</P>
<P>
 Sworn in with Bauer this week were Jonathan W. Abelove, who was chosen vice 
president and clerk, and Gail Michelsen. Bauer and Abelove will serve for four 
years while Michelsen will serve for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, a tax attorney, was first elected in 1985. She was president in 1989 
and 1991. Abelove is a business owner and Michelsen is a computer products 
manager. They will join Merlin L. Henry Jr. and Todd Ferguson on the school 
board.BERT ELJERA

 City police have joined a statewide effort urging motorists to drive with 
their headlights on all day Friday to draw attention to the dangers of drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Traffic Safety and the California Coalition Against DUI 
are sponsoring the Lights On for Life campaign as part of the observance of 
December as National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that 108 people throughout the state were killed in 
alcohol-related accidents during the holiday season last year. They estimate 
that such accidents this year will cost the state more than $6.6 billion in 
medical, insurance and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the campaign is part of the Fullerton Police Department's effort to 
heighten drunk-driving awareness. A surprise assembly at which Sunny Hills High 
School students simulated a fatal drunk-driving accident was organized last 
week by emergency workers, including police and firefighters, to further 
awareness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an officer has been assigned during the holidays to concentrate 
on apprehending drunk drivers, city officials said. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; FOUNTAIN VALLEY; GUY CARROZZO IS SWORN IN AS 
MAYOR

<P>
 Councilman Guy Carrozzo was elected to the ceremonial post of mayor last week, 
succeeding Councilman John Collins after his one-year stint as the city's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo, 62, a retired school principal who was reelected to serve a second, 
four-year term on the council last month, said he welcomes the task of heading 
the five-member panel. Voters also reelected City Councilwoman Laurann Cook and 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George B. Scott was elected mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo's family, friends and supporters attended the swearing-in ceremony, 
where his son, Guy, and daughter, Kimberly Porrazzo, administered the oath of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo said he looks forward to working with his colleagues for another four 
years. "I don't want to brag," he said, "but I think we are a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the standing-room-only crowd that "Your interests and well-being will 
always be at the heart of my decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo said he will uphold his vow not to raise taxes, will continue to 
combat crime and will work toward improving traffic problems the city faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can in my term, maintain, without raising taxes, city services, make 
sure the trash is picked up on time, keep the streets clean and keep the 
small-town atmosphere, then that is a good accomplishment," he said. "We're 
just going to do our best to keep Fountain Valley as nice as it's been in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 51, in his outgoing address, said being mayor was exhausting at 
times. He averaged more than 40 public appearances or meetings each month, 
responsibilities that impinged on his family life and business. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the rewards were great, too," he said. "The memory of receiving a 
standing ovation from over 400 mayors at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 
Portland, Ore., and accepting an award that only three other cities in the 
country received was incredible." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; ORANGE; CABLE FIRM GETS HEAT FOR AIRING ADULT 
FILMS 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council took a hard line against Cablevision of Orange this week for 
airing unscrambled adult movies into unsuspecting homes -- three months after 
first learning of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to fine the local company and its parent corporation, 
Time Warner, $500 for allowing minors to be exposed to "harmful matter." They 
also passed an ordinance that will allow them to fine the company up to $4,800 
for repeated violations, beginning Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a week, we will work with the community to gather evidence and submit 
formal complaints against Cablevision and its management to the county district 
attorney, the state attorney general and the Federal Communications 
Commission," Mayor Joanne Coontz told parents among the audience at Tuesday's 
council meeting. "These agencies, and not the city, have the authority to 
prosecute the state and federal laws possibly being violated." 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision officials also can expect a letter within the week acknowledging 
that their failure to control the airing of the movies was a "material breach" 
of their franchise agreement with the city, Coontz said. The company could lose 
a renewal contract in April, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Miller, an attorney for Cablevision, repeated the company's position that 
so-called "traps," which cut channels off, are the only effective remedy until 
new technology can be brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz and other council members told him that was no longer enough. "The 
defensive position you've presented here tonight doesn't do much good," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Spurgeon said he was particularly disappointed that 
Cablevision, "a good corporate citizen," had not resolved the problem by now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the highest esteem for you, but we've got to hold your feet to the 
fire," he told company representatives. "I'm afraid you've used up an ample 
amount of goodwill. . . . Until this thing is fixed, you should probably just 
take the (adult movies) off the air." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH; SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; TRUSTEES 
BLAST PLANNED RELEASE OF CLAS SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified School District trustees have passed a resolution 
criticizing the state for its planned release of test scores from the 1994 
California Learning Assessment System. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, approved Monday, contends that the 1994 CLAS test was riddled 
with problems and mismanaged by the state Department of Education, skewing the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test scores are expected to be released in late January or early 
February. The district performed well on the 1993 version of the state-mandated 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Sheila J. Benecke said the resolution is necessary to show how "this 
horrible test" is being imposed on the district by the state and how publishing 
score results would be a waste of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we all learned how not to throw good money after bad, we would all be in a 
better world," Benecke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Tempes, director of curriculum, instruction and assessment for the state 
Department of Education, said there are no plans to withhold results of the 
1994 CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 Over three years, the state has spent $55 million on the testing system, 
Tempes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified School District officials plan to pursue their own testing 
system to measure students' academic growth in basic skills over time, said 
district spokeswoman Jacqueline Price. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, newly elected Trustee Dorsey Brause was sworn in, along with 
reelected Trustee Crystal Kochendorfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Marlene Draper was elected board president by her colleagues, while 
Benecke was elected board vice president. JEFF BEANCALIFORNIA LEARN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH; SOUTH COUNTY; GROUP SERVES AS 
HUB FOR HOLIDAY SHARING

<P>
 Before the holiday season, Saddleback Community Outreach is a single volunteer 
organization working to feed, clothe and house South County's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But come Thanksgiving and Christmas, the nonprofit group is a magnet for more 
than a dozen organizations that hold food drives to help almost 500 families 
served by Outreach during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations come from all segments of South County society via truckloads of 
food and toys for families that otherwise would have no Christmas or 
Thanksgiving dinner and nothing under the tree for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Outreach spokeswoman Nancy Snyder several moments to reply when asked 
what these contributions mean to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to say this without getting emotional," she said. "It is nothing 
but phenomenal, all the people who come together to make sure people have a 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this would be possible if it wasn't for the businesses, service 
organizations and churches that come together," Snyder said, "not only during 
the holidays, but all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, local real estate agents brought in more than 30,000 cans of food. 
To help, contact the Saddleback Valley Board of Realtors at (714) 586-6800. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Nicholas Church in Lake Forest brought in almost a dozen 20-gallon drums 
filled with food and 500 toys last year. To assist that program, call (714) 
837-7676. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Christ in Mission Viejo adopted 100 families last year, feeding 
them for a week at Christmastime. Food donations to the church can be made by 
calling (714) 459-8318. 
</P>
<P>
 National Bank in Lake Forest accepts non-perishable food items. Food 
contributions can be dropped off at 22831 Lake Forest Drive during the weekday 
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Aliso Viejo communities will take canned goods, including Eagle 
Pointe, The Hamptons, Key West, Laguna Vista, Pacific Grove, The Cape Series, 
Greystone Colony, Carmel, Coronado, The Vistas Above Wood Canyon, Provence 
d'Aliso, Windsong, The Windwards and Tivoli. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and toy donations can also be made at the Saddleback Community Outreach 
office, 23011 Moulton Parkway, Suite B-5, in Laguna Hills. For more information 
about Outreach programs, call (714) 380-8144. FRANK MESSINA

CANDLELIGHT VIGIL PLANNED TO PROTEST LAGUNA TOLLWAY; ACTIVISM: OPPONENTS OF THE 
SAN JOAQUIN HILLS CORRIDOR, WHICH WOULD SLICE THROUGH THE CANYON, HOPE THE 
COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY WILL HINDER THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Buoyed by hope that the county's financial woes could waylay plans for a toll 
road through Laguna Canyon, San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor opponents 
will continue protesting the project with a candlelight vigil here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tollway builders say the road is not threatened by the fiscal crisis, 
some foes believe that Orange County's bankruptcy will make it harder -- if not 
impossible -- to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Corridor Agencies, charged with building three Orange 
County toll roads, has roughly a third of its funding tied up in the county's 
wobbly investment portfolio, including $311.4 million for the San Joaquin Hills 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely feel the bankruptcy is going to play a major roll in all three 
of the toll roads," said activist Patrick Mitchell of Garden Grove. "It seems 
it would be ridiculous to not have textbooks in our schools and not be able to 
pay our teachers but to build a billion-dollar road that is unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But agency spokeswoman Lisa Telles said that the 17-mile San Joaquin Hills 
corridor, which would link Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano, is needed and 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no intention of stopping or slowing construction of the San Joaquin 
Hills corridor," Telles said. "We're committed to completing the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said the agency was still trying Wednesday to figure out exactly how 
its funds are invested with the county but that she is confident the agency's 
road projects will not be stopped or even delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway opponents see it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always contended (that the agency) will go bankrupt," said Jeanie 
Bernstein, a member of the Canyon Coalition, which is planning the 5 p.m. vigil 
Friday at Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The road is highly controversial because it would slice through Laguna Canyon 
and the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has been moving briskly at both ends of the corridor and is 40% 
complete, Telles said. But work has been stalled in the canyon area by court 
challenges brought by environmental groups, led by Laguna Greenbelt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, roadway opponents obtained a preliminary injunction to 
temporarily halt construction of the project between El Toro Road and Newport 
Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 14, when a judge lifted that injunction, bulldozers and protesters 
converged on the site. Grading was halted the following day by another court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Dec. 6, a panel of judges again hoisted a green flag for the toll road. 
Telles said she expects construction to begin again the first week of January. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, protesters have been undergoing civil disobedience training; 
some say they will risk arrest to block construction in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the bulldozers roll, we're going to be there," Bernstein said.

EX-OFFICER PLEADS GUILTY TO STEALING POLICE GROUP FUNDS; COURTS: FORMER MEMBER 
OF THE FOUNTAIN VALLEY FORCE IS GIVEN SIX-MONTH SENTENCE FOR $36,000 
EMBEZZLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Fountain Valley police officer, who once won the Medal of Valor, 
pleaded guilty Wednesday to embezzling more than $36,000 from a local police 
group he headed, prosecutors announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea arrangement, Kevin D. Arnold, 34, of Mission Viejo was given a 
six-month sentence and five years' probation by Municipal Judge Donna L. 
Crandall. He also must repay the Fountain Valley Police Officers Assn., said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold repaid the group $10,000 in October, before the embezzlement charges 
were filed, Anderson said. He now owes $26,229. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said investigators do not know how Arnold used the $36,229 he 
withdrew from association accounts between March, 1993, and May, 1994. At the 
time, Arnold was president of the group and the only person authorized to 
withdraw money, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold was fired from the Fountain Valley force Aug. 31 after an internal 
administrative investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be given a choice between serving the full six-month sentence in his 
home wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet or going to jail, where he would 
likely serve half that time, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an appropriate sentence. I'm satisfied," Anderson said after the 
court session. "This, in essence, ends his tour of duty as a police officer."  
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Arnold and his attorney, John D. Barnett, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, an 11-year veteran, received the Medal of Valor in 1990 for his 
actions in a controversial shootout in 1983 while he was a reserve officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In that incident, Arnold shot a burglary suspect six times after a brief foot 
chase. Arnold was shot once in the ear with his own gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspect Michael Wayde Mohon, charged with burglary and the attempted murder of 
Arnold, twice escaped from jail and was featured on "America's Most Wanted" and 
"Unsolved Mysteries." Mohon was captured in Alabama in 1989 and returned to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted murder charge was later dropped for lack of evidence. Mohon 
unsuccessfully sued Arnold for using excessive force, citing other shootings 
the officer had been involved in since 1983.

NOTED DOCTOR NAMED TO HEAD UCI NEUROSURGERY UNIT; MEDICINE: THE GROWING 
DEPARTMENT WILL BE LED BY DR. MICHAEL DOGALI, ONE OF THE NATION'S FOREMOST 
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A noted New York doctor has been named the new chairman of the UCI Medical 
Center's burgeoning neurological surgery department, hospital officials said 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Dogali served for six years as director of the functional and 
stereotactic neurosurgery division at New York University, hospital spokeswoman 
Fran Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogali is one of the nation's foremost experts in functional neurosurgery, 
which focuses on surgery for movement disorders, pain alleviation and epilepsy, 
Tardiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could consider it a real coup for UCI to draw this caliber of 
individual," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five doctors currently work full-time in neurosurgery at the medical center, 
Tardiff said, and they see about 2,500 patients each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCI is sort of a sleeping giant," said Dogali, who now lives in Newport 
Beach. "It is potentially the strongest neurosciences campus in the UC system." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogali said the department will hire more doctors and provide new services in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three new neurosurgeons and five or six more neurologists will be 
recruited to the staff, he said. It's all part of an expansion in the 
neurosciences.  
</P>
<P>
 "Major universities are certainly investing heavily in this area," Dogali 
said. "So little has been done with the brain -- it's one of the last bastions 
of the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and UC San Francisco have the top neurosciences programs in the 
University of California system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogali said UCI neurology experts will introduce unique programs at the 
hospital to manage pain, eliminate epileptic seizures, treat brain tumors and 
alleviate symptoms of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.  
</P>
<P>
 New virtual reality-style computer systems to be installed at the hospital 
will allow doctors to see problems in patients' brains and map surgical 
procedures before operations, he said. Doctors will also introduce radiation as 
a precise surgery tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion branches to the UCI campus. Construction of the first building 
in the UCI Center for the Health Sciences -- a $22-million neuroscience 
research center -- is scheduled next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening called for the university's 
health scientists and other professors to step up efforts to attract research 
grants to campus. Dogali said he will continue his current research interests 
at the hospital and university. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Bridgeport, Conn., Dogali received a bachelor's degree in biology 
at Fairfield University. He received his doctorate at McGill University Medical 
School, where he was awarded the Robert Forsythe Prize in surgery. He completed 
further training in neurosurgery at the Montreal Neurological Institute and 
Duke University.

MOTORIST KILLED IN CRASH APPARENTLY HAD HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 54-year-old man died after apparently suffering a heart attack behind the 
steering wheel of his car before crashing into a tree, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three witnesses said Tony Villa Estrada of Garden Grove appeared unconscious 
and "slumped over" in his car about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, when the vehicle 
careened from the westbound lane of South Coast Drive over a center divider to 
the southbound lane of Fairview Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle then traveled up the curb and smashed into a tree, said Fidel 
Gamboa, Costa Mesa police's community service officer. No other vehicles were 
involved in the accident, Gamboa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, a security guard, died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. He was 
living alone at the Fire Station Motel, where neighbors remembered him as a 
"very happy person" who often talked about winning the Lotto someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all shocked," motel manager Debbie Wadlow said. "We're going to miss 
him. He was very well-liked."

LONG SENTENCE FOR GANG MEMBER WHO RAPED, BEAT WOMAN; CRIME: THE ATTACKER ALSO

 A gang member was sentenced Wednesday to 50 years to life in prison for a 
home-invasion rape and robbery in which a Tustin woman and her 3-year-old son 
were beaten, choked and left for dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael David Cowles, 21, of Riverside gained entrance to the victim's home 
last March 7 by claiming to be a friend of the woman's niece, according to 
court records. When the woman opened the door, Cowles and a teen-age accomplice 
burst in, court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was dragged upstairs and raped by Cowles and then by the teen-ager, 
while her son was downstairs, crying, according to court records. Both victims 
were then beaten and choked into unconsciousness. The home was ransacked and 
the assailants made off with jewelry, money and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 When she came to, the woman crawled downstairs and got help from a neighbor, 
who called police, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman identified Cowles as her assailant, but Cowles continues to maintain 
his innocence, according to a sentencing report. Cowles' defense attorney could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement read during Wednesday's sentencing hearing, the woman said she 
and her son now live in fear. Her son, she said, is terrified by the sound of a 
doorbell. She said she believes she died during the ordeal but has been given a 
"second chance" at life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always live in fear and worry," she wrote. "Indeed I did die." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowles was convicted of attempted murder, assault, robbery, burglary and 
belonging to a gang. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park said Cowles was also 
convicted of torture because the woman was stomped on so badly that her body 
and head were marked with the design on the soles of Cowles' shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was absolutely terrified and terrorized," according to Park, who said 
Cowles must serve at least 27 years before he becomes eligible for parole. "She 
was kicked, beaten and then choked for so long she literally believes she 
died." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old who joined in the attack was also convicted and sentenced to 
the California Youth Authority. He was not identified because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were particularly outraged by Cowles and have been following the case 
closely to find out his punishment, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowles has prior convictions as a juvenile for burglary and auto theft. A 
sentencing report that recommended a long prison term for Cowles said the 
brutal attack "reflected an incalculable degree of callousness."

PIG ON THE LAM FROM PEN CAUGHT ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 400-pound pig that escaped from a farm at Westminster High School on 
Wednesday waddled onto the San Diego Freeway, tying up traffic until police 
herded her off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just strolling down the road," Caltrans worker Rich Doss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The black and white Hampshire sow used for breeding is one of 16 pigs at the 
school's farm, which is next to the freeway. She apparently dug her way out of 
the chain-link pen she shares with three other sows, then trekked uphill 
through thick bushes to the freeway near Westminster Avenue about 2:30 p.m., 
said Jerry Gragson, who runs the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look like they just dug under," Gragson said. "They're awfully strong." 
The pen-mates did not escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The porcine pedestrian stayed on the shoulder of the freeway and was herded 
toward an off-ramp by two California Highway Patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Gragson and a couple of student helpers showed up, animal control 
officers were trying to hoist the pig onto a truck. She was too heavy. Gragson 
returned to the school for a trailer to get her home.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're very good little escape artists and can nudge their way right out of 
faulty spots in fences," said Lt. Marie Hulett, an animal-control spokeswoman. 
She urged pet owners to double-check pens, especially after recent rains and 
windy conditions that can loosen fences. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape was the biggest news to hit the little campus farm since thieves 
stole three piglets from their mother's side in March. Student members of the 
Future Farmers of America raise pigs, sheep and chickens and grow pumpkins, 
barley and strawberries, Gragson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragson said he hadn't a clue as to why the normally sedate sow -- who gave 
birth to a litter of 12 in August -- decided to make a break for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time she's just lying around out there," he said. "I'm just 
really happy she didn't get into any trouble."

O.C. DOCTOR INVESTIGATED IN ABORTION DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's medical board is investigating a doctor who lives in Orange 
County and has a history of criminal convictions because of the death of a 
Tijuana, Mexico, woman after an abortion at his clinic here. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalena Ortega-Rodriquez, 23, died Thursday at a San Diego area hospital 
after being rushed by paramedics from the south San Diego abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 After her death, state officials began their investigation of Dr. Suresh 
Gandotra, 45, who practices at El Norte Clinica Medica in south San Diego and 
lives in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandotra's attorney said the woman's uterus was cut accidentally during the 
abortion, causing bleeding that killed her. The clinic called paramedics saying 
the woman was in cardiac arrest and being given CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a standard risk of the procedure," said the attorney, Evan L. 
Ginsburg of Fullerton. "It is tragic. The doctor is devastated. We don't 
believe this was below the standard of care." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1990, Gandotra was convicted in Orange County Superior Court and 
served time in jail for grand theft, Medi-Cal fraud, giving drugs to patients 
without proper authorization and aiding the unlicensed practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, after a delay because of Gandotra's unsuccessful appeals 
motions, the Medical Board of California filed an action seeking to take away 
his license. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical board spokeswoman declined to comment on the case, but said it is 
being investigated by both the board and the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega-Rodriquez was 26 to 28 weeks pregnant. A San Diego deputy county 
medical examiner said officials could not determine if her fetus was viable at 
the time of the abortion.

ORANGE COUNTY HALL OF FAME; ANONYMOUS NO LONGER; FORMER ALL-PRO SAUL TOILED FOR 
RAMS, NEEDED GOLF CLUB TO MAKE HIS MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rich Saul lined up at center in six Pro Bowls and a Super Bowl, excelling at a 
position where anonymity was part of the job description. 
</P>
<P>
 But put a golf club in his hands, and all that changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after retiring from the Rams, Saul landed on national blooper 
shows when his wayward drive at the 1989 L.A. Open pro-am golf tournament 
struck none other than Hale Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin ended up with 16 stitches in his forehead; Saul went coast-to-coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "A day that will live in infamy," Saul said, laughing. "Twelve years in the 
NFL, and no one knew who I was. But I hit one little golf ball, and it's all 
over the nation: 'Hale Irwin hit in the head by former All-Pro center Rich Saul 
of the Rams . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Saul will be inducted into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame Sunday night, 
an honor not so much for his unpredictable golf swing -- check those hard hats 
at the door, please -- but rather a storied football career that spanned 12 
seasons in which he . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Saul will stop you right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he will tell you all about his playing career -- the injuries, the 
awards, the Super Bowl season -- but he makes one thing perfectly clear: What 
he did on the football field was important, but so is the charity work he does 
with children in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks at schools and clubs about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, clean 
living and doing the right thing. He's heavily involved in charity work with 
Children's Hospital of Orange County, the cancer society and centers for abused 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charities are so, so important," Saul said. "All those honors in football 
were nice, but so what? I want to be out there helping kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "God gave me size and talent, yeah I worked a little too. But the question you 
have to ask yourself is: 'What good am I going to do with it?' That's where I'm 
at." 
</P>
<P>
 How appropriate: A guy who once cleared the way for quarterbacks now worries 
about protecting something he considers just as fragile -- children's futures. 
Forget Charles Barkley's claim of "I'm no role model." Saul isn't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a responsibility to try and help kids," he said. "I'm not 
like Barkley. I think we have a responsibility to a higher being to go out and 
do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had (role models) when I was growing up. When I was a kid, everybody knew 
Deacon Jones was a Ram and Johnny Unitas was a Colt. You could go down to the 
park and they would sign autographs for you. You could count on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul was one of nine children of a Pennsylvania coal-miner, and grew up 
playing football with his twin brother, Ron. They followed their older brother, 
Bill, through college and into the pros, Bill with the Detroit Lions, Ron with 
the Houston Oilers and Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich nearly didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 After tearing up his knee in his junior year at Michigan State, doctors told 
him he might not play again. Saul underwent reconstructive surgery, 
rehabilitated and returned to his starting middle linebacker position for his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saul's bum knee, the Rams drafted him in the eighth round in 1970. 
Because of a lack of depth on the offensive line, Coach George Allen moved Saul 
to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea how to play there," Saul recalled. "I didn't even know who the 
center was on my Michigan State team, couldn't even name him. That tells you 
what I thought of the position." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul played special teams and backed up Ken Iman at center for six seasons. 
But when Iman was traded to St. Louis Cardinals in 1975 and later retired, the 
starting job was all Saul's. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, he played every offensive line position and sometimes 
changing jerseys at halftime -- No. 61 to 87 -- so he could switch from the 
offensive line to tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in six Pro Bowls and was a Ram co-captain in their 31-19 loss to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XIV. He was the Rams' offensive lineman of 
the year five times, and was named to the franchise's all-time team after he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul played in 176 consecutive regular-season games, the fourth-longest streak 
in Ram history behind Jack Youngblood's 201, Merlin Olsen's 198 and Tom Mack's 
184. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting exhibitions and playoffs, Saul played in 254 games, one of football's 
remarkable durability records, especially the amount of athletic tape it took 
to keep him on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He played injured and in terrible pain, earning the nicknames "General 
Hospital" and "Lazarus" from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 He once showed up for an interview wearing braces on both knees, a pad on a 
broken hand, a heavily taped separated shoulder, a heavily wrapped sprained 
ankle and a splint on the twisted thumb of his snapping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter to Saul. He played anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only hurt for a second," Saul said. "The way I figured it, if I wasn't in 
there, we would lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we were stupid, maybe just crazy. But we gave everything. As long as we 
had a breath of air in us, we played, no matter what. You had to put a bullet 
in one of us to keep us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul had his share of brushes with the Rams' front office, but who hasn't? 
</P>
<P>
 He once told the team to double his salary or he would play only half the 
season. Then he demanded to be traded to the Washington Redskins, so he could 
play with Ron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a team player," Saul said. "Remember, the 11th Commandment is: 'Don't 
kid yourself.' I knew I couldn't play forever, that I had to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul eventually did, retiring after the 1981 season. He was captain of the NFC 
Pro Bowl team, and played against Ron in his final regular-season game, a 30-7 
loss to the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 His transition to life after football went smoothly. He entered the real 
estate business full-time after working in the field for nearly 10 off-seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now vice president of major accounts with a title insurance company in 
Irvine and spends his spare time with his family and working with the 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Eileen, celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary this year. 
And their daughter, Jaime, a senior honors student at Villa Park, is drawing 
interest from Duke and several Ivy League schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul still keeps ties to football and the Rams. He attends as many home games 
as he can, keeping a close eye on 19-year veteran Jackie Slater, whom he 
remembers as a rookie back in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul helps coach the offensive line at Calvary Chapel High, where his son, 
Josh, played tackle football for the first time this season with the Eagle 
junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 His position? Defensive tackle and center, of course.

CSUN'S VAUGHN IS NAMED ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't the best of seasons for the Cal State Northridge football team. But 
for defensive back Joseph Vaughn, personal milestones continue to pile up. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who set or tied a slew of school and national records, on Wednesday 
was named to the NCAA Division I-AA All-American team by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a 6-foot 200-pound senior safety from Sylmar High, tied a school 
single-season record with nine interceptions and became the first Northridge 
player to make the AP's I-AA first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defensive lineman Oscar Wilson was selected to the third team. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing for a team that lost its last five games to finish 3-7, Vaughn 
was a persistent pain for quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn returned four interceptions for touchdowns to tie two I-AA marks and 
rolled up 265 yards in returns to set another division record. The previous 
record of 251 return yards was set by Zack Bronson of McNeese State last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn's four interception returns for touchdowns not only tied a I-AA 
single-season record -- Robert Turner of Jackson State set the record in 1990 
-- but tied a Division I-AA career record held by Jackson and two others.  
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn tied for third in points for Northridge this season with 24. Vaughn was 
selected the American West Conference defensive player of the year, even though 
the Matadors finished last at 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who played two seasons at Cal State Fullerton before transferring to 
Northridge after the Titans dropped football in 1992, led Northridge with 87 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was fourth on the team with 55 tackles.

LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT; ENGILMAN AGAIN CONTEMPLATES RESIGNING AS COACH AT SYLMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For at least the past three years, Sylmar High football Coach Jeff Engilman 
has been singing the same tune at the end of each season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has never been titled, a song by The Clash will suffice: "Should I 
Stay or Should I Go?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was to say right now, it's about 90% that I'm not gonna be back next 
year," said Engilman, who is 75-17-2 with two City Section 4-A Division titles 
since taking over at Sylmar in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of the 1991 season, Engilman has expressed doubts about 
remaining in the coaching business. Reasons range from half-hearted player 
commitment to his health. 
</P>
<P>
 The past couple of years have been particularly hard on Engilman, perhaps the 
most controversial coach in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors instructed Engilman to cool it about a year ago when he was diagnosed 
with high blood pressure. But he maintained his ranting and raving style on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Engilman is still reeling from recent investigations and sanctions 
against his team. Sylmar administrators were forced to defend the actions of 
the school's football players or coaches four times in a span of about 15 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar is on probation through Sept. 13 for participating in a passing-league 
game with Pierce College players. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent incident, Sylmar survived a day-long investigation into a 
player eligibility matter the day before a quarterfinal playoff game. City 
Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege determined that the evidence regarding the 
residency of Joe Gonzalez, a midseason transfer from Saugus, was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with all that surrounds one of the area's most successful football 
programs, will the 1994 City 4-A championship season be Engilman's swan song? 
</P>
<P>
 It's anyone's guess. He said he will decide early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it's the kids," he said. "The guys don't respect anything. (And) I 
think my style of coaching is starting to burn not only me, but I think it 
burns on a part of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 No other City team has been as successful in the '90s as Sylmar, the only team 
to have won 10 or more games for five consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a nice situation to take the City championship and say this is 
the nice way to go out," Engilman said. "But I got (four) City championships. I 
don't believe there is another active City coach that has three." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been talk that Engilman would have left after last season but didn't 
because of the talented group of returning players -- a rumor the coach denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would never stay for a 
ballplayer," he said. "When I deem it necessary to go, I'm gonna go." 
</P>
<P>
 Factoring into Engilman's decision is the loss of assistants Dan Moreno and 
Dan Kelley, who have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Engilman, 44, who began his coaching career as a B coach at Poly, said he hit 
bottom in the semifinal playoff game against Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long week. It's been a long year," he said. "Everybody says, 'Oh, 
Jeff, you're that way every year.' Well, I got a different feeling this time 
around."

NELFORD REALLY DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE; WRESTLING: RIO MESA SENIOR IS A TWO-TIME 
LEAGUE CHAMPION AND ALSO AN ASPIRING ARTIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If only the art of planting a headlock on an opponent came as easily as 
sketching a cartoon for Tom Nelford. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford spends countless hours in the Rio Mesa High wrestling room -- not 
counting the time he devotes to adorning the walls -- struggling to stay 
focused, honing his skills in preparation for his fourth varsity season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford, a 152-pound senior and two-time defending Channel League champion, is 
arguably the best wrestler in Ventura County and among the best in Southern 
California. Last season, he placed fifth in the Southern Section Division I 
finals, third in the section's Masters meet and ninth at the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spends so much time and he works extremely hard -- that's why he's good," 
Rio Mesa Coach Todd Stoke said. "But he is not a great athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford, 5-feet-8 and a tad chunky, readily admits he is not a natural 
athlete. He does not play football, as many wrestlers do, and wrestling is the 
only sport in which he competes. Success, he says, has come slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came out my freshman year, I didn't know what I was doing and I 
was getting my butt kicked by everyone in the room," Nelford said. "You see a 
lot of freshmen just give up and walk out the door. But I knew if I just hung 
in there and stuck with it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Progress as an artist has come more easily, almost naturally, for Nelford. A 
natural, he insists he is not. Then again, he might be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastels and paint brushes in hand, Nelford spends time away from the mat 
developing doodles into accomplished designs that have made their way onto 
school calendars, letterheads, T-shirts and, most impressively, the wrestling 
room walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford began taking art courses through Ventura College extension as early as 
seventh grade, and he is enrolled in Rio Mesa's advanced-placement art program. 
</P>
<P>
 An honors student with a 3.5 grade-point average, Nelford, who said he plans 
to apply to Brown and Colombia, probably could paint his own ticket as a 
commercial artist. At this point, he is considering a career in either 
communications or advertising, something in which he can utilize his creative 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started copying pictures in Mad magazine when I was in fourth or fifth 
grade," Nelford said. "I'd spend the whole day in the back of the classroom 
with this other guy drawing cartoons. My grades even started to go down." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, one illustration after another has gone up on the wrestling 
room wall. Most impressive is a six-foot-tall, red-and-black Spartan -- the 
school mascot -- standing poised to wrestle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford spent the better part of a Sunday atop a rickety ladder, drawing and 
painting the figure, which he conceived as a sketch at his desk at home. 
</P>
<P>
 On an opposite wall, he added a black-and-white sketch of two wrestlers, one 
with a leg hold on the other. Nelford's latest creation is a multihued, 
snow-topped-mountain scene, symbolizing the many stages along the ascent to the 
peak of prep wrestling -- league, sectional and state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford, who also serves as an English tutor, added a poignant quotation from 
Henry David Thoreau: "In the long run, men hit only what they aim at." 
</P>
<P>
 "Setting goals is a real important thing in wrestling," Nelford said. "And I 
think that sort of says how important it is. I spent a lot of time on it. But 
if some freshman looks up and gets inspired and tries a little harder the next 
day in practice, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Nelford has dual goals: covering the walls of the Spartan 
wrestling room with his artwork and winning a state title. But he'll have to 
shed his bohemian side when it's time to tangle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford admits that sometimes his creative mind wanders when he's on the mat 
-- just as it did in the back of the classroom in his grade-school days. When 
that happens, his wrestling suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets a little bit lost sometimes at wrestling practice and I have to keep 
after him," Stoke said. "But usually, the bigger the meet, the better he is and 
he does focus. He just phases everything else out and concentrates. Like when 
he's drawing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelford doesn't know why his mind wanders. Call it one of the quirks of 
creativity. "I just have to remember to keep my head this season," he said. 
"But I've always been kind of a tunnel-vision kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, as an artist. Ideas for drawings come from everywhere. He practices 
by drawing caricatures of friends and famous people. A lot of his drawings 
feature athletic figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just put in a lot of time," he said. "I just draw and draw and draw and 
that's all it takes to be good. You look back on some of my old drawings and 
they're just junk. But then you look at my later stuff and you can see the 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like wrestling."

THE TIMES 1994 FALL ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; CRITICISM ADDS SPARK FOR DEVERA; ATHLETE 
OF THE YEAR: COMMENTS FROM FAMILY, FRIENDS AND COACHES GAVE VILLA PARK 
SOPHOMORE TENNIS STAR A MUCH-NEEDED BOOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The high school season hadn't even begun and Villa Park tennis coach Sue 
Gardiner was worried that her star player, sophomore Faye DeVera, was already 
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about that time of year when she was getting really tired of tennis," 
Gardiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of burning out, DeVera began burning up when she read in The Times 
what her friends, family and coaches were saying about her lack of desire for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me realize how little I was doing compared to other people," DeVera 
said. "I couldn't really argue with (the story), because I knew they were 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner said the story was the shot of adrenaline DeVera needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good start," Gardiner said. "It made her mad, but it lit a fire 
under her. She got stronger. She stayed with her weight-lifting program and it 
made her a better player." 
</P>
<P>
 It also made DeVera The Times player of the year this season -- ending El 
Modena senior Brandi Freudenberg's two-year reign as the county's best girls' 
tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVera didn't have a bad season as a freshman -- going 46-2 and winning the 
Century League singles title. But she was a more consistent and confident 
player this season, going 44-1 and reaching the quarterfinals of the Southern 
Section individual singles tournament. She also led the Spartans to their first 
Century League title since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a consistent player the whole season, even against teams like Santa 
Ana Valley," Gardiner said. "She wanted to play against everyone and that was 
good to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner said she has coached talented players who didn't want anything to do 
with practice or playing against teams with losing records. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have somebody in the No. 1 position who sets a good example, that 
helps the rest of the team," Gardiner said. "She's one of the girls. She 
doesn't want to be set up on a pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for losses to Freudenberg and Palos Verdes Peninsula's Amanda Basica, 
DeVera spent much of the season on a pedestal, however. And she was never 
higher up than she was in the first two rounds of the section individual 
tournament, where she won two matches without losing a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, DeVera said there is more work to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need work on my second serve and my transition game," she said. "I'm still 
working on trying to step up to the next level."

COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER BREAKING SECTION INTO REGIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section has formed a committee to consider breaking the section 
into regions, former Brea-Olinda Superintendent Ed Seal said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal, a committee member, said such an alignment would create an Orange County 
region within the Southern Section.The committee, formed in November, has met 
three times to consider dividing the section into regions for playoff purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley was unavailable for comment. He has 
said he would be interested in such a plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is still at the discussion state at this point," Seal said. "We 
need to determine what a regionalization would look like." 
</P>
<P>
 A movement by county officials to secede from the Southern Section failed in 
October. The State Federated Council voted, 52-48, against forming the new 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat left Orange County section proponents grasping for options. They 
discussed bringing the issue to another vote before the council at its meeting 
in October, 1995. Another plan was to wait for the State Strategic Planning 
Committee to complete its report, which is due next winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're looking at what's best for the long haul," Anaheim Union 
District Superintendent Cynthia Grennen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of regionalizing the Southern Section appears to be the most 
viable option. Seal said the process could create an Orange County region, 
which has more local control, a key issue among county superintendents.

BOMB THREAT FORCES EVACUATION OF MALL; GLENDALE: MORE THAN 50,000 PEOPLE ARE 
DRIVEN FROM THE GALLERIA. THREE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES TURN OUT TO BE BAGS OF 
FLOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 50,000 shoppers and employees were driven out of the Glendale 
Galleria on Wednesday as police, responding to an anonymous telephone threat, 
searched out and destroyed three packages that turned out to be heavily wrapped 
five-pound bags of flour labeled "bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rotten thing for somebody to do during Christmas time," said Gil 
Juarez, the mall's Santa, who -- still dressed in his red suit -- comforted 
frightened children in a nearby parking lot as the streets around the mall 
filled with dismayed shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers said there was widespread fear, but many others reported a 
fundamentally orderly evacuation of the 1.3-million-square-foot mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was screaming," said April Regino, 14, a junior high school student 
who had caught a bus from Hollywood to shop at the mall. A security guard "was 
running around for everybody to get out and everybody just started running," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation was ordered shortly after 2:45 p.m. when a male customer 
spotted a package marked "bomb 1" in a trash can in a second-floor restroom, 
across from a police substation in the mall. About the same time, an anonymous 
caller told the 911 emergency switchboard in Glendale police headquarters that 
there was a bomb in the mall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The call was traced to a pay phone at Broadway and Pacific Avenue, about a 
block from the mall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering the evacuation, police sent for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's bomb squad and searched the mall. Two more packages, labeled "bomb 3" 
and "bomb 4," were found by Glendale police officers in two other restrooms, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether there is an undiscovered package labeled "bomb 2" was not known. 
Glendale police would not reveal details of the warning telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of the bomb squad's camera-equipped robot, guided by remote control, 
were unable to determine if the packages in the restrooms were actually bombs, 
so bomb-squad officers in protective clothing entered the building and blew up 
the packages with small charges of explosives, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This was somebody's idea of a practical joke," said Sheriff's Deputy Angie 
McLaughlin, who described the packages as five-pound bags of flour wrapped in 
brown paper and plastic and bound in red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 7 p.m., police began escorting groups of store workers back into 
the mall to help search for the possibly still-undiscovered "bomb" package and 
to close their shops. Meanwhile, other merchants who were still waiting to 
enter the mall gathered at a nearby fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police spokesman Chahe Kheuregholian said officers took the extra 
precaution of evacuating the mall because of the ominous phone call combined 
with the discovery of the packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually with a bomb threat in a bank or office building, we'll go in and 
nothing tangible is found," Kheuregholian said. "But in this case, where a 
customer walks into a bathroom and discovers a package with the word 'bomb,' 
that made the officers take this more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall was cleared by sounding an alarm and urging shoppers over a 
loudspeaker system to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisc Deenihan, whose architecture firm is located on the mezzanine level of 
the Galleria, said the alarm sounded like a foghorn, followed by a loudspeaker 
announcement that "there was a small gas leak and that people needed to 
evacuate." Deenihan said she and her husband left the building on the advice of 
a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like, 'Is this for real or is this a drill?' " she said. "There 
was nobody directing us." 
</P>
<P>
 Deenihan said she realized that something other than a gas leak had triggered 
the evacuation when she was told it was OK to start her car, which was parked 
in the mall garage, and she saw groups of people smoking cigarettes outside the 
mall -- which she presumed would be forbidden in the presence of a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of the mall, Glendale police officers reportedly began going 
from store to store, shouting for people to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brubaker, an assistant manager at Pet Love pet store, was reluctant to 
abandon his shop's 35 dogs, four cats and numerous birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more worried about their welfare than my own," said Brubaker. "I wanted 
to stay in there, but the Glendale Police Department said, 'Get out or we'll 
bodily remove you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said deputies will analyze the fake bombs to determine whether they 
are the work of the culprit who pulled a similar stunt at a Carson mall earlier 
this month. The South Bay Pavilion was evacuated for several hours after a 
device, believed to be a pipe bomb, was found in a restroom on Dec. 1. It was 
later detonated by a Sheriff's Department bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Galleria spokeswoman Judy Smith said it was too soon to determine how much the 
bomb scare cost the mall -- which houses five major department stores and 264 
specialty stores and restaurants -- in lost Christmas business. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb scare marred what has otherwise been a dazzling Christmas shopping 
season for the Galleria, which has apparently benefited richly from the 
Northridge Fashion Center's continuing troubles brought on by the January 
earthquake. Only two department stores have reopened in the Northridge mall. 
When the holiday shopping season began the day after Thanksgiving, the Galleria 
attracted twice as many shoppers as on the same day last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thank God it wasn't on a weekend," Smith said. "It wasn't as busy as it 
could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Angel Luna, general manager of Photo By Adam portrait studios, said he 
believed he had lost about $1,200 in business as a result of the bomb scare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just angry that someone could play such a practical joke and not have any 
consideration for others," Luna said. "It's one of the biggest times of the 
year for portraits. This day is helping me get back on my feet. One day's loss 
is just too much to bear."

FISHING AROUND; INSURANCE SALESMAN MAKES A HOBBY OF SHARK ATTACK DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an inevitable aftermath to an encounter with a shark off the 
California coast: an encounter with insurance salesman Ralph S. Collier. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he's not selling shark bite coverage, but rather collecting data on the 
attacks. For more than 30 years, Collier has been a weekend warrior of the 
shark expert set, rushing out to record firsthand accounts, interview 
beach-front witnesses, examine bite marks and read autopsy results. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier, of Canoga Park, does not have a biology degree. He is not a 
scientist. He is not on staff at a university. He just likes sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County coroner's investigators said they never got around to 
calling Collier after a shark attack last week off San Miguel Island killed 
veteran diver James Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier called them first.  
</P>
<P>
 But Coroner's Investigator Larry Gillespie said he was planning to call 
Collier anyway. Gillespie plans to review his findings with Collier next week, 
when he will ask Collier's opinion on the species and size of the shark that 
killed Robinson, as well as possible reasons for the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on his expertise, even if it's just from amateur research over the 
years, we're going to rely upon what Ralph says," Gillespie said. "If he says 
the shark is so many feet long and so big around, we're definitely going to use 
his findings." 
</P>
<P>
 Collier, founder of the Shark Research Committee in Van Nuys, says his 
credentials come not from academic training, but from doing such research 
"longer than anyone else on this planet." 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who reject that claim, but none disputes his passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to understand why (sharks) do what they do," said Collier, 
who added that he is one of five experts chosen to oversee the International 
Shark Attack File at the University of Florida. "I did it the same way everyone 
else did it back then. We started gathering information and learned as we 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no single dramatic event that piqued Collier's interest in the big 
killers; he's just wondered about them for as long as he can remember.  
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950s, when he was only 16, he said, the U.S. Navy began studying 
sharks and shark attacks and sought volunteer investigators. Collier, now 50, 
was all too happy to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1959 attack off San Francisco was his first case. A young man swimming with 
his girlfriend was attacked by a great white shark. The story was that the 
woman grabbed onto her boyfriend and wrestled with the shark for him. She won, 
Collier recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier jumped in his car as soon as he heard and drove from the Los Angeles 
area to San Francisco to investigate, beginning a process of data compilation 
that he has refined and used ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries to make contact with either the victim or a witness within 24 hours 
of the attack, he said. Most important, he wants to know what the victims were 
doing just before the attack and how long they were doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he adds Coast Guard and police reports to answer a battery of questions: 
What was the weather? Was the sky clear or cloudy? What was the water 
temperature? Air temperature? Clarity of water? Topography of the ocean floor? 
High or low tide? 
</P>
<P>
 Collier takes all the information, reports and pictures and tries to piece 
together what happened and in what order. He has learned to determine species 
and size by examining the size and shape of bite marks left in anything from 
human flesh to surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has always astounded us that more people have not been killed by white 
sharks off this coast," Collier said. "Which again leads me to believe that a 
motivation for a high percentage of shark attacks on humans isn't because they 
think we're food -- it's because they don't know what we are, so they swim up 
to take a bite out of us to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ichthyologists, the scientists who study fish, sniff that Collier is the 
shark attack version of an ambulance chaser. A "shark groupie," one called him. 
</P>
<P>
 But others maintain that he has something to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isaac Newton never held a professorship," said Richard Rosenblatt, a 
professor of marine biology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who 
like many in the academic world of fish is familiar with Collier. "He has made 
sharks his hobby and there is nothing wrong with that."  
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Peter Klimley, a UC-Davis marine behaviorist, have sought 
Collier's assistance. Klimley asked Collier to write what he called a "modest" 
piece on the variety of objects great whites have attacked for a book Klimley 
is editing called, "Great White Sharks; Ecology and Behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "He does know something," Klimley said, "but there are more so-called 
'experts' who deal with white sharks than there are soccer players in L.A."  
</P>
<P>
 And by interviewing witnesses and victims, Klimley said, Collier might 
sidetrack victims from talking with trained experts whose full-time jobs 
include collecting such data. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is no matter to Collier, who goes about his self-appointed tasks 
with the dedication of Jacques Cousteau.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate objective is the truth," Collier said. "I could write what we do 
know about sharks on a piece of paper and it would take up 10 lines; then I 
could write what we don't know and it would take up a whole tablet."

MINKOW RELEASED FROM CUSTODY AFTER 7 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Minkow, the former Reseda business whiz convicted of swindling investors 
out of more than $26 million, ended roughly seven years in custody Wednesday 
with a bus ride from the federal prison in Lompoc to a halfway house in Echo 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow was released after serving only about one-third of his 25-year term 
because of good behavior. He will remain at the halfway house until April 12, 
when he is due to be set free on parole, said Monica Wetzel, a spokeswoman for 
the Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next four months, Minkow, 28, will work at a Los Angeles law firm 
and begin the difficult task of restitution, paying back the $26 million owed 
investors in his failed Reseda-based ZZZZ Best Co., said his attorney, Randy 
Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not getting any special treatment, I can assure you," said Long, who is 
trying to get Minkow released from the house before April. He added that Minkow 
has served more time than other high-profile criminals convicted of similar 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow, who said he found God in prison, has written an autobiography -- his 
second -- to be published early next year by a Christian publishing house. He 
has pledged to pay back the stolen money with a portion of any profits from the 
book, Long said. The former San Fernando Valley entrepreneur also plans to go 
on a speaking tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody else from a business perspective would have filed Chapter 7 
(bankruptcy) and flushed the debts," Long said of Minkow's desire to make 
amends. 
</P>
<P>
 James Asperger, the former U. S. attorney who prosecuted Minkow, said he will 
withhold judgment on Minkow's rehabilitation.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot to prove," Asperger said. "Not only am I skeptical, but I 
think the world will be skeptical until he proves he can change his ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Another skeptic is Ann Randall, who says she was cheated out of $150,000 in 
cash plus stock in Minkow's company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way justice can be served is for him to pay back everyone their 
money," she said in a telephone interview from her home in Chico. "He stole 
such a large sum of money and I have no way to replenish it. He changed my 
whole lifestyle. . . . Maybe he has developed a conscience and will pay us 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners eligible for parole are frequently sent to halfway houses to 
reintroduce them to society, prison spokeswoman Wetzel said. But if Minkow 
violates any of the house's rules he will be returned to confinement, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow, described by prosecutors as one of the most significant white-collar 
criminals ever, started his carpet cleaning company in his parents' garage and 
later wrote his first autobiography, telling how he became a teen-age 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two years, his talkative charm had convinced accountants, 
lawyers and investment bankers that he had figured out a way to cheaply restore 
office buildings damaged by fire and flood -- a business supposedly earning 
ZZZZ Best up to $43 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years, Minkow, with the help of several more experienced business 
colleagues -- some later described by law enforcement officials as having ties 
to organized crime -- transformed the private company into a public one.  
</P>
<P>
 Its stock soared in value, helped by Minkow's knack for publicity and ZZZZ 
Best's impressive balance sheets. In the early summer of 1987, Minkow was 
poised to take over carpet cleaning services offered by Sears, the nation's 
largest retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it all collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that most of the lucrative restoration jobs never existed -- and 
neither did the revenues. Within days of Minkow's resignation in July, 1987, 
ZZZZ Best collapsed, leaving investors holding thousands of shares of worthless 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his three-month Los Angeles federal court trial in 1988, Minkow 
claimed that he had been manipulated by mobsters and stock swindlers who had 
taken advantage of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 But at his sentencing, Minkow declared: "Today is a great day for this 
country. The system works. . . . They got the right guy."  
</P>
<P>
 In prison he acquired two degrees from Liberty University in Virginia, a 
school founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Also, while he was in prison, Minkow 
filmed a videotape to help accountants uncover corporate fraud.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; STUDENT LEADERS TACKLE GRAFFITI AROUND SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with brushes, rollers and gallons of white, gray and beige paint, 
student leaders at Reseda High School went door to door Wednesday to clean 
graffiti off residents' walls, fences and earthquake storage bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in Reseda's leadership class had sent letters to neighbors weeks 
ago offering to clean for free the marks left by taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who responded were thrilled that we were doing this," leadership 
director Jay Shaffer said. "Some of the block walls we painted were marked so 
much that their original color was completely covered over." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the school's connection with "Operation Sparkle," a citywide graffiti 
cleanup program coordinated by police officers and district schools, student 
Sara Scalda acquired rollers, brushes and 25 gallons of paint from the Los 
Angeles Police Department's West Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to clean those areas because it really makes our school look bad 
when there's graffiti all over the place," said Sara, a senior. "I'm hoping 
this becomes a tradition at Reseda High." 
</P>
<P>
 The students concentrated their energies Wednesday on the neighborhood near 
the north side of campus, where the leadership classroom is located. But 
Shaffer said leftover supplies may allow them to expand their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another fellow responded who lives way over on the south side of the school," 
Shaffer said. "We didn't use all of our paint. So, if we get any more calls for 
business, we'll be ready to go." ANTONIO OLIVO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FEMA GRANT EXTENDS 'GHOST TOWN' PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted Los Angeles an additional 
$3.6 million to help prevent earthquake-ravaged "ghost towns" from becoming 
overrun by vandals, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant provides welcome financial relief for the city, which found itself 
footing the bill to keep security guards from walking off the job at 15 ghost 
towns after previous FEMA funds ran dry. Most of the ghost towns are in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have these funds, the vandals would be taking over these 
properties," said Robert Moncrief, major projects manager for the city's 
Housing Department, which oversees the security patrols. "This will . . . 
ensure that the ghost towns have a chance to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding extends a program begun last summer by city officials to board up, 
fence off, clean up and hire private security for about 150 damaged buildings 
that were abandoned after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA provided $2.8 million for the effort, which officials hoped would be 
enough to prepare the buildings for rehabilitation. Despite boarding up more 
than 100 of the damaged structures, however, the city began exhausting FEMA 
funds by Oct. 31, said Diedre Reyes of the city's Administrative Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took more time to get the construction going. You have to get the owners 
going. You have to motivate people to repair their property," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was forced to pay the private patrol bill, as well as for city work 
crews assigned to clean up the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 With support from U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), city officials 
asked FEMA for funding to extend the ghost town program to April 30, 1995, 
including $480,000 for the security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders praised FEMA's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that deters crime in these ghost towns is the security 
guards," said Harry Coleman, president of a citizens advisory group in North 
Hills, where one of the ghost towns is located. "It behooves us to repair or 
refinance to get those boarded-up buildings back in circulation fast enough to 
stop the bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two guards and one patrol car have been assigned to each ghost town 
24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional crime problems in North Hills prompted the city to add even more 
security there, including a mounted unit that occasionally patrols the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 To help speed the recovery, Berman said he may seek more quake-relief funds 
when Congress reconvenes early next year. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PLAN WOULD CUT VALLEY'S SEWER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel voted Wednesday to recommend a new sewer rate 
formula that would reduce fees for residents in the San Fernando Valley and the 
Westside at the expense of residents elsewhere in the city, who would have to 
pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rate formula that was backed by the council's Environmental 
Quality and Waste Management Committee was developed in response to complaints 
from Valley residents who contend that their sewer fees are disproportionately 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no way to gauge how much sewage each home puts into the 
city's sewer system, the sewer service fee is currently based on the amount of 
water used, assuming that about 60% of the water enters the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valley residents and some of their council representatives say the 
assumption is often wrong, particularly for residents who own large lots and 
put most of their water into gardens and lawns. In summer months, even more 
water is spent outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new formula proposed by the city's Bureau of Engineers is based on water 
consumption during the rainy winter months, when residents are less likely to 
irrigate lawns and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula calculates the sewer fee based on the two winter months that 
residents use the least amount of water. The formula assumes that 90% of the 
water ends up in the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city report, the average fee for Valley residents would drop 
about 8%, while fees for Westside residents would drop about 9%. But in central 
Los Angeles, the annual fee would increase by about 4% while residents in the 
San Pedro region would pay about 1% more. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees help pay for maintenance and operation of the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who heads the three-member committee, said the 
formula is a more equitable system of calculating the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she expects protests from council members whose districts will 
get higher fees. The council is scheduled to take a final vote on the issue in 
the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize there will be a great deal of debate," Chick said. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; AHMANSON LAND TO PLANT 2,000 OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co. has launched the latest phase of a long-term program to 
replace hundreds of oak trees cut down to make way for its planned mini-city in 
the hills southeast of Simi Valley, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations are under way to transplant 2,000 five-foot oaks from a nursery 
to various spots around Ahmanson Ranch, said Stan Roberts of Ag Land Services, 
the company selected to care for the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The planting was modeled after a pilot program conducted last year in which 
100 trees were planted around the ranch, said Gil Nielsen, senior vice 
president of Ahmanson Land. 
</P>
<P>
 The company last month planted hundreds of acorns in small containers, where 
they will be kept until they mature. According to Nielsen, in about a year, 
they will be transplanted into larger containers, where they will be kept for 
about two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000 trees were planted in 1989, in the first phase of the reforestation 
program, Ahmanson officials said. The company plans to plant a total of 4,000 
trees as part of a development agreement that requires it to plant five trees 
for every one destroyed in building the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near 
the border of Los Angeles County. Many area residents oppose the project and 
several lawsuits have been filed to block it. In an environmental review of the 
project, it was estimated that 1,300 oak trees would have to be cut down, 
Ahmanson officials said. The company has altered its plans and reduced the 
number to 700. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaks trees seem to be having a difficult time regenerating in many parts of 
Ventura and Los Angeles counties, said Rosi Dagit, conservation biologist for 
the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts aren't sure why, she said, but overgrazing could play a role. It could 
also be, she said, that the natural reseeding process -- through bird 
droppings, for example -- has been stymied. The recent drought, too, may have 
hampered acorn reproduction, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dagit said that while she is pleased that Ahmanson Land Co. is planting trees, 
it won't mitigate the negative impact that the Ahmanson Ranch project will have 
on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are planting trees . . . but they are taking down mature trees," which 
are essential to preserving the area's watershed, she said. "Ten to 20 years 
from now, (the planted trees) will be doing a good job, but in the meantime, 
they are tearing down some beautiful, old trees that have served a purpose for 
so many years." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; MANN THEATRES TO BE PART OF NEW PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of a proposed Agoura Hills commercial center has signed a 
30-year lease with Mann Theatres for the cinema chain to build and operate an 
eight-screen theater complex, according to the developer and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the city Planning Commission, the theater would be part of 
Creekside Terrace, a large commercial center with more than 150,000 square feet 
of shops, restaurants and offices at Agoura and Kanan roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term lease greatly enhances the chances of success for the entire 
project because acquisition of a reputable anchor tenant will encourage other 
businesses to locate there, say representatives of the developer, Whizin 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lease, Mann Theatres will pay to build and operate the theater and 
pay rent to the developer, which will maintain ownership of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills Community Development Director David Anderson said the city is 
conducting an environmental review of the project. The Planning Commission may 
vote on the project as early as the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann Theatres, which already operates an eight-screen cineplex on Agoura Road, 
believes that the area needs another theater because parking at the existing 
theater is a problem, Anderson said. A walkway will eventually be built between 
the two facilities as part of a plan to develop the entire area into an 
entertainment corridor next to the freeway, he said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; STUDENTS CLASH WITH PANELIST OVER PROP. 187

<P>
 An opportunity for high school students to learn more about Proposition 187 
turned into a heated debate Wednesday after youths from San Fernando High 
School clashed with a supporter of the controversial ballot measure at a forum 
to be aired over local cable television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Courtroom Television Network invited more than 100 students in the 
paralegal studies program at San Fernando High to its studio in Van Nuys to be 
the audience for a panel discussion involving community leaders, legal experts 
and political commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 But emotions flared among the mostly Latino students when they confronted 
David Horowitz, president of the conservative Center for the Study of Popular 
Culture, who spoke out in support of the voter-approved proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers contended that parts of the proposition, which denies 
non-emergency services to illegal immigrants, are racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz, in turn, accused the students of being un-American, adding that his 
own parents were immigrants to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy (Horowitz) was totally against us," said Galaxie Navarro, 17. "He 
knows that if this happened when his parents were young, they would fight 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Horowitz accused San Fernando High Principal Philip Saldivar of encouraging 
the students to be anti-187 during Saldivar's address at the end of the 
discussion, which emphasized the importance of voting and staying involved in 
the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have been fed a bill of goods," Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saldivar said he wished the event had not been so confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of emotion demonstrated. This (forum) should have been more 
about what are the effects of the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other panelists were Erwin Chemerinsky, professor of constitutional law at 
USC; Nancy Daly, head of the county Commission for Children and Families; Rudy 
Diaz, executive director of the Community Health Foundation; James Coleman, 
president of Americans for a United Strong America, and Julie Paik, staff 
attorney for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. MAKI BECKER

<P>
 Watch out, Wall Street: Park Cockerill knows stock. And so do the students in 
his economics classes at San Fernando High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last five years, his seniors have made more hypothetical profits in a 
Los Angeles Times-Merrill Lynch stock-picking contest than hundreds of other 
students in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Their secret? Meticulous mathematics, a penchant for perfection and a 
conservative buying approach that targets blue-chip stocks sold at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm teaching them," Cockerill said, "is investment. I do not teach 
speculation. I do not teach them to look for short-term gains. We go for the 
long-range winners." 
</P>
<P>
 In a good semester, Cockerill's students have earned returns as high as 40% on 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Cockerill and his economics class also earned a private visit 
with Arthur Levitt, chairman of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
one of the world's most powerful financial regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt, in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting, requested the meeting with the 
traders and buyers of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chairman had heard about the contest and wanted to meet with some 
successful participants," said Kathy Graham-Headly, southern regional manager 
of Times in Education and creator of the contest. "Mr. Cockerill's class has 
come in first, second or third place every semester the program's run." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the program, classes invest $10,000 in a hypothetical stock 
portfolio, then chart the progress of their investments using newspaper stock 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work in teams of four or five, with each team buying as close to 
$10,000 worth of stock as possible, including the cost of commission for a 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Cockerill attributes his students' success to the research they do, comparing 
stock prices to those in previous years. "We try to pick the stocks selling at 
the low end. Logically, that means they have the greatest potential to 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Valdivia, 17, said he didn't know a thing about the stock market before 
taking the class. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he finds himself scanning the business page, marker and ruler in hand, 
plotting graphs of the ups and downs of his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought into Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Chevron, among others. But his stock 
in a large tire company has outgained the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess everybody needs tires right now," Sam said when asked about his 
investment strategy. TIM MAY

<P>
 A North Hollywood man who carried several loaded guns and who allegedly 
threatened to kill his estranged wife's mother has pleaded not guilty to 
child-endangerment and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Akira John, 34, was arrested last Saturday after he allegedly 
brandished a pistol at three of his wife's friends when they came to the 
couple's home to move her belongings to a battered women's shelter, Los Angeles 
City Atty.Jim Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said John then telephoned his mother-in-law and threatened to kill 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested later that day while driving in his pickup truck with several 
loaded guns -- and with his 10-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he pleaded innocent to one charge of endangering a child, which 
carries a possible one-year jail term and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pleaded innocent to three counts each of brandishing a firearm and 
carrying a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle. Each of those charges is 
punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. JEANNETTE REGALADO

UP TO 220 TELEDYNE INC. EMPLOYEES TO LOSE JOBS; BUSINESS: NORTHRIDGE AND 
NEWBURY PARK FACILITIES ARE BEING AFFECTED BY PENDING SALE OF DIVISION TO 
LITTON INDUSTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time of year when many employees expect corporate Christmas cards or even 
bonuses, up to 220 workers at Teledyne Inc. in Northridge and Newbury Park 
received their termination notices Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronting the latest round of cutbacks in Southern California's shrinking 
aerospace industry, about 1,100 Teledyne employees learned whether they would 
keep their jobs after the pending sale of Teledyne's Electronic Systems 
division to Litton Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 80% of the Teledyne employees will be kept on after the Litton deal 
closes. "These are specific people that we need to carry on the business," said 
Robert Knapp, director of public relations for Litton in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teledyne employees said they had been waiting nervously since the sale was 
announced in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As Teledyne employees in Northridge filed into the parking lot Wednesday at 
the close of the workday, they were handed gray envelopes containing letters 
that told them whether they would still have a job at the start of the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who were offered positions found that the news was not altogether 
good. Fred Ford, a 61-year-old technician who said he has worked at Teledyne 
for 33 years, found out he would keep his $614-per-week position, but only for 
nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy cow," said Ford, whose hands trembled as he read the notice. "I 
sincerely thought they would welcome the people in our department. I feel 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 An electrician who asked that his name not be used said he will keep his job, 
but that he and many other employees were upset that they had to wait so long 
to learn their fates and that so many employees were getting bad news just 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were strung out for so long," the man said. "I planned for the worst and 
hoped for the best. I know a couple of guys that are getting (released) with 
more than 10 years of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees who will keep their jobs said they are still uncertain about 
their futures at the company, because Litton has reportedly leased the two 
Teledyne facilities for just two years. They said they fear further cuts could 
be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk who also asked not to be identified said she would lose her job in 
nine months, but was glad that months of tension at the Northridge plant were 
finally over. The atmosphere Wednesday at Teledyne "was very quiet," she said. 
"It's almost like you could hear a pin drop, even at lunchtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne's Electronic Systems division manufactures aircraft computers, radar 
and communication systems and other devices for the defense industry. Revenue 
from the division was expected to exceed $150 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the acquisition by Litton, which is expected to be completed by the 
end of this month, were not disclosed.

INVESTIGATOR PLEADS NO CONTEST TO POSSESSING POLICE DATA; COURTS: THOMAS 
WHITEAKER IS FINED $5,000 AND SENTENCED TO A YEAR OF SUMMARY PROBATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a plea agreement, a San Fernando Valley private investigator pleaded no 
contest Wednesday to unlawful possession of confidential criminal history 
information, and was fined $5,000 and sentenced to one year of summary 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Whiteaker had faced a maximum sentence of 66 months in jail and $11,000 
in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteaker had originally been charged with 10 counts of possession of the 
information, which prosecutors alleged was illegally accessed from Los Angeles 
Police Department computers by a police officer, and with one count of 
conspiracy to obtain the information -- all misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement approved by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Veronica 
Simmons McBeth, Whiteaker was convicted of five counts of possession of the 
information without admitting or denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached Wednesday at his Mission Hills private investigation firm, Whiteaker 
Investigative Services, Whiteaker said he had no comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Ray Bentley, a veteran Juvenile Division police officer who allegedly 
gave Whiteaker and another private investigation firm the information, has 
since retired from the Police Department and faces trial for illegally 
accessing police computers to get the material. A preliminary hearing in his 
case has been set for Monday. In a separate case, Bentley faces charges of 
possessing child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Bentley also gave or sold such illegally gained 
information to a private investigation firm co-owned by former Los Angeles 
Deputy Police Chief Daniel R. Sullivan, once a rising star in the department 
who at one time headed all San Fernando Valley operations and was once a top 
contender for the chief's job. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea agreement similar to Whiteaker's, Sullivan pleaded no contest in 
September to five misdemeanor counts of illegally possessing the information. 
</P>
<P>
 When the investigation was first disclosed, authorities said they had been 
investigating for more than a year, using hidden cameras. Authorities alleged 
at the time that police computers were used to illegally access information on 
more than 500 people, including actor Todd Bridges and a murder witness who had 
been relocated for his protection. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said he was pleased with 
Whiteaker's plea agreement to the five misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This conviction should serve as a deterrent to others in the same (private 
investigation) field who perhaps were unaware that possession of this type of 
material is a crime," he said. "We are very satisfied with the result."

CLASSES LEARN SPACE 'IS JUST STARTING'; SPECIAL HANDS-ON PROGRAM TEACHES 
STUDENTS ABOUT ROCKETS AND COMETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's not every day that middle school students get to make comets with their 
own hands or launch rockets under the direction of . . . a rocket scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 But there they were, 400 of them at the California Museum of Science and 
Industry, mixing dry ice, soil, water, balsamic acid and Worcestershire sauce 
into frozen balls of ice and dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cool because . . . it came out nasty," said Gabriel Chavez, 12, a 
seventh-grader at South Gate Middle School, who created one of the "comets" 
with his classmate and buddy, Matthew Jaramillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Directing the "nasty" space-age exercise was Randii Wessen, a science systems 
engineer with Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the Youth Science Symposium, subtitled "Your Place in 
Space," held Wednesday at the Exposition Park museum for seventh- and 
eighth-graders from eight Los Angeles County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessen did not seem to mind if the "lab work" was like playtime for the 
youngsters, who were drawn from science classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that space doesn't seem real to the kids because it is out there and 
we are here," he said. "Anything that we can do to make it tangible, to make it 
real, will help them to better understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The rocket-making was going on at another trailer classroom on the museum 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingrid Rodriguez, 11, a sixth-grader at Marina del Rey Junior High School, 
then got to launch her missile -- made out of a syringe, a cork and a bottle 
filled with water -- on the museum's grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was not all hands-on exercises -- while they worked, the students were 
taught the fundamentals of comets and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, sponsored by the Lockheed Corp., also featured the new IMAX film 
"Destiny in Space" and short lectures by Wessen, aerospace curator Kenneth E. 
Phillips and Brenda Forman, director of marketing policy at Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessen told the middle schoolers, "Space is not over, it is just starting." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips told them that they did not have to be the smartest students to be 
the best at a chosen endeavor -- a pep talk amid the science. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are at a particularly vulnerable age," he said later. "We want to 
bolster their confidence in their abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The message hit home with 12-year-old Marie Meza.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can be a scientist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if you are a girl or a boy, it just matters how you think."

QUEZADA WON'T SEEK REELECTION; SCHOOLS: THE BOARD'S FIRST LATINA MEMBER SAYS 
SHE'S MAKING THE 'RIGHT DECISION' TO STEP DOWN AFTER SERVING EIGHT YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, who became the first Latina on the Los Angeles Unified School 
board in 1987, announced Wednesday that she will not seek reelection to a third 
term in April. Quezada, whose district includes heavily Latino neighborhoods in 
East Los Angeles and the northeast San Fernando Valley, said she felt that it 
was time to move on after a decade of public service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed in term limits and I've been on the school board for 
eight years," Quezada said. "It's not an easy decision . . . but I know it's 
the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Before her election to the Los Angeles Unified board, Quezada served two years 
on the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. In 1992, she ran 
unsuccessfully for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On the school board, she was a strong proponent of bilingual education and was 
viewed by many parents -- particularly Latinos -- as an advocate for poor and 
disadvantaged children. But she was often at odds with Supt. Sid Thompson and 
had a strained relationship with the powerful teachers union's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been both lauded and criticized for her blunt, businesslike approach, 
honed by years of corporate experience. She continued working full-time as 
manager of Latino marketing and community relations with Nestle USA Inc. until 
she became school board president 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As president, she guided the board through some of its most difficult times, 
from the battle against a statewide voucher initiative and efforts to break up 
the district to a threatened teacher strike and an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was just catching its collective breath, Quezada said, when the 
Northridge earthquake damaged 250 campuses in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had said, 'Oh great, finally we get to do some positive stuff, some 
progressive planning stuff,' " she recalled Wednesday. "And then the whole 
world just fell apart. . . . When I sat to write it down last night, I said, 
'How could we have gotten through all of this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada's commitment to education -- and bilingual instruction -- began in a 
very personal way: When her family moved from Mexico to California when she was 
13 and she found herself unable to keep up with English-only classes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latino education activists, the timing of Quezada's departure is 
particularly disturbing because of the recent passage of Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigration initiative that would force public schools to bar 
undocumented children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is very good about Leticia is that she not only is a visionary and . . . 
knows politics, but she's also very much in touch with the needs of real people 
-- especially Latinos and immigrants," said Rosalinda Lugo, associate director 
of Hope In Youth and a member of the LEARN school reform board. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quezada said she believes that her successor will also be Latino and that 
the school board will continue its legal battle against 187 and its leadership 
in other pro-immigrant-student causes: "If I thought the board would take those 
kinds of things back once I left, I would stay."

A HOUSE WITHOUT A HOME; CITY WORKERS HAUL AWAY RESIDENCE-ON-WHEELS BUILT BY 
TRANSIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 As onlookers winced, the two-story house-on-wheels that transient David M. 
Russell had hewn out of scrap wood tilted crazily before thumping onto a 
trailer to be hauled to a Thousand Oaks storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing gets down to legislating and micro-managing others' lives," 
said the former UCLA dental student as his makeshift home was hauled away by 
city workers Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, now homeless for the second time in 18 months, previously had lived 
secretly in a three-room attic apartment of a nearby office building for three 
years before being evicted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wednesday, resilient to the end, the 41-year-old busied himself with 
weather-proofing the one-ton structure even as a city crew prepared to take it 
away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't stand it," said Diane Bennett, who watched as the iron forks of 
a five-ton front-loader gingerly angled Russell's handiwork toward the trailer. 
"I've watched him build it and have become very attached to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, the 15-foot-high patchwork of wood and ingenuity had been 
taking shape under a palm in a parking lot behind a technology firm on 
Townsgate Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers rolled it off company property and to a street curb after being 
told that the ramshackle shelter -- fitted with two small refrigerators, a 
television and two microwave ovens -- violated building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that it posed a traffic hazard on the street, city officials finally 
made good on their threats and hauled the ungainly structure to an impound lot, 
leaving Russell to face winter without a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a no-win situation for us," Public Works Supt. Mel Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell was alternately impassive and flustered by his sudden change of 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a damning system," he said. "You're damned if you do and you're damned 
if you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, which began in March as a one-man lean-to and grew as Russell 
wheeled it from business park to business park, is as much a testament to 
unfettered dreams as a casualty of nonconformity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't understand why he wants to live like that," said his mother, 
68-year-old Eleanor Russell of Seal Beach. "He doesn't want to take orders. He 
wants to be his own man, his own boss. . . . But you can't always do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Though born of need, Russell's jumble of trash-bin scraps soon became in his 
mind a prototype of a schooner cabin or a houseboat that could be produced on a 
mass scale. Then it was hauled off Wednesday morning, recoverable only if 
Russell can find $800 in impound fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get on," he said as he gathered four shopping carts full of possessions. 
"I'll just go back to where I was before, with nothing, except whatever skills 
I've picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Which are not inconsiderable, according to several observers. "He's obviously 
a talented carpenter," said Deputy City Atty. Jim Friedl. "I can't see why he's 
not doing this for somebody, holding down a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by an admiring critic why he did not ply his skills on the job market, 
Russell nodded toward his two-story creation. "This is my job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As word spread of Russell's impending loss Wednesday morning, employees 
drifted out of neighboring businesses to watch city workers figure out how to 
move a dwelling locals call the Winchester House or Pee Wee's Doll House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his baby. He birthed that thing," said Antoinette Yates, 30, an employee 
of a local firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Lay, 30, took to the airwaves on a local radio station to reach anyone 
who might have a vacant lot that Russell could use temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move began. Careful to minimize damage to the bulky structure, Henson 
coordinated the labors of front-loader driver John Tregaskis and forklift 
operator Ed Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to do something like this," Tregaskis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-kempt and well-mannered, Russell has long befriended people throughout 
the Westlake area, raking leaves, gathering shopping carts and pulling weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wednesday, as his home was trucked away, he turned to his well-wishers -- 
including members of the loading crew -- and said without irony, "Thanks, 
everybody, for your help, for the season's blessings that have come my way."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA TO OFFER INCENTIVES; BUSINESS: 
COUNCIL AUTHORIZES FEE WAIVERS TO ATTRACT COMPANIES, AND PAYS FIRM TO DEVELOP 
AN ECONOMIC STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feeling the heat from Palmdale, Lancaster and other cities offering lavish 
perks to lure large businesses, economic officials here will soon offer 
incentive packages as well. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Tuesday authorized waivers of up to $20,000 in 
development fees to attract and retain firms within Santa Clarita. They also 
authorized the payment of $63,000 to Economic Strategies Group of Phoenix, 
Ariz., to develop an economic development strategy for the city that will 
include suggestions for additional business incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have used fee waivers, tax breaks, loan programs, land donations 
and outright cash awards to persuade companies to locate within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal thing would be to design some incentives that other cities don't 
have," said Mike Haviland, city economic development director. "The product 
(Santa Clarita) isn't so week we have to surround it with incentives." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one Santa Clarita company, Rexhall Industries, has been 
successfully lured away due to the aggressive efforts by neighboring Lancaster. 
The motor-home builder received 10 acres of land worth $500,000 to relocate its 
170 jobs to the Antelope Valley community. And Palmdale is now trying to woo a 
150-job company from the Valencia Industrial Park in Santa Clarita by offering 
a $2,000 cash payment per employee and low-interest loans and housing 
assistance to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palmdale/Lancaster is really throwing a lot of money at (businesses)," 
Haviland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger of offering incentives, city officials admit, is that they can be 
costly without showing obvious results. How does a city know when it is giving 
away too much, or whether their incentives will work at all? 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale has by no means a perfect record. The city courted Packard Bell 
Electronics Inc., the nation's third-largest manufacturer of personal 
computers, for nearly a year when the firm announced it had outgrown its six 
Chatsworth facilities. The city offered $7.5 million in land, $4 million in 
housing assistance for employees, $10 million in tax-exempt bonds, 
low-financing and even discounts on products from local businesses, only to be 
outbid by a $26-million loan package from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita business advocates, however, heartily approved of the city's 
decision to get into the incentives game.

 "It is tremendously important for economic viability," said Gary Johnson, 
president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce. "This is the first 
of its type. It's long overdue because it's going to benefit the entire 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not suggesting in any way that we give these businesses any money," said 
Johnson, "but it is vital that we have some sort of economic incentive rather 
than just sand and sun and surf."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 'BOMB' FOUND ON CAMPUS IS A POT PIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 At the local high school Wednesday, a bomb scare was called off when a 
suspected pipe bomb turned out to be a pot pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9:30 a.m., a student found a metal object about five inches long and a 
half-inch wide on the athletic field, Littlerock High School Principal Jeff 
Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The object had a tripod base, a screw on top and a small hole in one side that 
appeared to be burned. "Its unusual shape and the fact that it had the burn 
mark made us wonder if it was an unexploded device," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents might be relieved to know that neither school officials nor the 
students who saw the object recognized it as a type of water pipe used in the 
smoking of drugs, usually marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was cleared and local sheriff's deputies called. Upon arriving, the 
deputies sealed off the area and made sure everyone kept a safe distance until 
the bomb squad could get to the high desert community, more than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 But once on the scene, the bomb deputies didn't need long to properly identify 
the object. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops were out here for five minutes and they left," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marijuana pipes are periodically confiscated from students on campus, Foster 
said. But he said the unusual shape and size of the pipe found on the field 
threw school officials off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to take the chance that it might cause injury or harm," Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the pipe has not been determined.

'VITALOGY' MAKES FOR A REAL PEARL JAM OF A SELLER; POP MUSIC: THE ALBUM SOLD 
877,000 COPIES IN ITS FIRST WEEK. KENNY G DROPS TO NO. 2 AND THE BEATLES 
TWO-DISC SET SELLS A SURPRISING 360,000.

<P>
 During its first seven days in record stores, Pearl Jam's new "Vitalogy" album 
made the second-biggest opening week splash since SoundScan began computerized 
sales monitoring in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The only band Pearl Jam couldn't beat? Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vitalogy" sold a massive 877,000 copies, second only to the first-week record 
of 950,000 set by the Seattle band's 1993 album, "Vs." The new album got off to 
a strong start, selling a whopping 250,000 copies on its first day. This 
despite the absence of an MTV video, considered an essential marketing tool in 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The showing by Pearl Jam -- which has sold more than 13 million albums in the 
past three years -- surpassed the competition in a lucrative week in which 
total sales exceeded an estimated $266 million -- up almost 9% over the 
comparable period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pearl Jam is a monster," said Russ Solomon, president of the 90-unit 
Sacramento-based Tower Records chain. "We've been waiting for something to come 
along to lead the holiday charge, and 'Vitalogy' gave the business a good swift 
kick. It broke out like a dam in a flood." 
</P>
<P>
 The runners-up for the week were Kenny G's "Miracle" holiday album, at 553,000 
copies, and the Beatles' "Live at the BBC," a two-disc set that sold a 
surprising 360,000 copies -- about a third of that number on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here pretty much expected Pearl Jam to go through the roof, but the 
overwhelming response to the Beatles album kind of shocked us," said Mike 
Greene, vice president and general merchandise manager of Blockbuster Music, 
the 530-outlet chain based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. "It's like the '60s all over 
again, the way these babies are flying out the door. We've had to reorder 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest record retailers are anticipating their most profitable 
holiday season ever. Record merchants have sold an estimated $6.7 billion in 
albums since January, and they expect holiday shoppers will boost that amount 
by $1 billion before Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the three leaders, retailers are expecting heavy sales for two other 
new packages: Garth Brooks' "The Hits," which includes 18 of the country 
sensation's best-selling singles; and "The Unplugged Collection, Vol. 1," a 
selection of acoustic MTV performances by artists such as Eric Clapton, Neil 
Young and Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of last week's Top 10: Mariah Carey's "Merry Christmas" (311,000 
copies), Boyz II Men's "II" (299,000), the Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over" 
(285,000), Green Day's "Dookie" (183,000), Nirvana's "Unplugged in New York," 
(178,000), "The Lion King" soundtrack (171,000) and Offspring's "Smash" 
(168,000). 
</P>
<P>
 Other albums expected to generate brisk holiday sales, according to retailers, 
are Tom Petty's "Wildflowers," Frank Sinatra's "Duets II," Madonna's "Bedtime 
Stories"; the greatest-hits packages from Sting, Sade and Doug Stone, and the 
soundtracks from "Pulp Fiction" and "Murder Was the Case." 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners estimate that the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's week 
accounts for about one-fourth of their annual $10 billion in music and video 
sales. With new works by Michael Jackson and Van Halen due in January, 
retailers are optimistic that the year-end sales spurt could continue into 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're going to ring in the New Year with a bang," said Lew 
Garrett, vice president of purchasing at Camelot Music, a 400-store chain based 
in North Canton, Ohio. "Stores are jammed, and consumers are in the mood to 
shop. I predict this holiday season will set a high mark in record retail, and 
we're very optimistic about 1995."

FINAL TOUCH-UPS AT THE AHMANSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Theatre opened in 1967 with a production of "More Stately 
Mansions." Tonight, the theater will be rededicated after a $17.1-million 
renovation that was designed to convert it into a somewhat less stately 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, and throughout the Center Theatre Group's star-studded 
seasons at the Ahmanson, there were complaints that the hall lacked intimacy 
and warmth. Actors and theatergoers alike griped about the distance between 
stage and seats. The acoustics for spoken drama were especially criticized. Yet 
the backstage wasn't considered big enough for such productions as "Miss 
Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation tackled all of these problems. The ceiling is lower and 
acoustically redesigned. New boxes on the sides narrow the hall in an attempt 
to improve the sound quality. Seating capacity can drop to 1,300 from the 
previous 2,071 by sealing off the back rows of the mezzanine and the balcony 
with new electronic dividers. With the relocation of a cafe and dressing rooms, 
the backstage is larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, an invitation-only audience will take a gander at the 
still-not-quite-finished hall from two directions: first from the stage, then 
from the seats. Artists from the Music Center's resident companies will 
perform, dignitaries will speak. The redesigned theater will undergo its first 
real test when previews of "Miss Saigon" begin on Jan. 17. DON SHIRLEY

'BOXING HELENA' JUDGE WON'T BE PRESIDING OVER RETRIAL; LAWSUIT: KIM BASINGER'S 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY FILES A PEREMPTORY MOTION AGAINST JUDGE JUDITH CHIRLIN. THE 
$8.1-MILLION RULING AGAINST THE ACTRESS WAS OVERTURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In late September, the 2nd District Court of Appeal overturned a March, 1993, 
Superior Court ruling that awarded $8.1 million to Main Line Pictures, which 
charged actress Kim Basinger with reneging on an agreement to appear in the 
film "Boxing Helena." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is headed for a retrial next year in Superior Court, but the judge 
who presided over the controversial case will not be on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's attorney, Howard Weitzman, filed a peremptory challenge Tuesday to 
disqualify Judge Judith Chirlin from presiding over the second trial, and the 
judge acknowledged Wednesday that she will not be on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was done to ensure there is no way she could hear this case again," said 
Weitzman, adding that his concern with Chirlin extends far beyond the 
technicality that caused the reversal by the appellate court. "We believe she 
has a bias." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman claims the judge's prejudice for Main Line and against Basinger "was 
evident throughout the course of the trial. When I got a call from (Chirlin's) 
clerk asking me to (be available for) a new court date, I was amazed. She 
should have recused herself from presiding over a new trial because of hers and 
her clerk's behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Chirlin said Wednesday that she saw no need to recuse herself from the 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 In January The Times reported that Chirlin not only attended the "Boxing 
Helena" premiere but hugged the plaintiffs after the verdict was announced. She 
also asked Basinger to attend a baby shower for her clerk, Syndy 
Scaife-Richard, during the trial, which the actress said she felt compelled to 
attend. And the clerk asked Basinger for a $125,000-loan to buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Line's attorney Patricia Glaser jumped to Chirlin's defense. "This judge 
is not prejudicial. She is an accomplished fair jurist. Let them criticize 
away. When you criticize a judge it's a sign you're a sore loser," Glaser said. 
"We will beat them again. And this time I have their sworn trial testimony to 
use, which should make (the victory) come much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile, arduous case threw the actress into bankruptcy last year. 
But, earlier this year, the three-judge appeals court panel ruled that verdict 
forms prepared by Chirlin allowed the jury to find that "Basinger and/or Mighty 
Wind" (Basinger's production company) had entered into a contract with Main 
Line Pictures, an independent movie company, and breached it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'and/or' (verdict forms) are prejudicially ambiguous and require 
reversal," the panel ruled. Once an appellate decision is rendered, the case is 
automatically returned to the Superior Court for a new trial. It is up to the 
losing party on the appeal, in this case the plaintiff, Main Line, to pursue a 
new trial.

A NEW LOOK, A NEW FEEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Generally, the Ahmanson Theatre is less boxy than it was before its 
$17.1-million renovation, which will be unveiled at a rededication ceremony 
tonight. A circular design now dominates the acoustic paneling on the ceiling, 
as well as the shape of the pushed-forward balcony (top) and mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
 Six boxes have been added to each of the sides (left) to reduce the width of 
the hall, improve acoustics and provide a greater sense of community among 
audiences. Twenty-year use of the boxes on opening nights (plus other 
privileges) is available for $500,000 for a lower box and $350,000 on the 
balcony level. So far, final negotiations are pending on two of the lower boxes 
and only one of the upper boxes is taken (so there is still time for 
last-minute Christmas shoppers). The purple and gold interior is more 
hospitable than the former black and red design. The theater's exterior has 
also received a face lift, as seen in before (far left) and almost-after (near 
left) photos. 
</P>
<P>
 The box office has been moved from the center of the facade to the west side. 
The forecourt won't be finished for tonight's rededication; the invitation-only 
audience will enter from the rear. A new bust of banker and philanthropist 
Howard Ahmanson, for whom the theater is named, will be displayed in the lobby 
(above, right). DON SHIRLEY

SEC SUBPOENAS SUPERVISORS' RECORDS ON ALL BROKER DEALINGS; INVESTIGATION: 
AGENCY SPECIFICALLY SEEKS DOCUMENTS NAMING THREE MERRILL LYNCH EMPLOYEES, 
SOURCES SAY. IT ALSO DEMANDS MEMBERS' TAX RETURNS, FINANCIAL HOLDINGS AND FULL 
CAMPAIGN REPORTS.

<P>
 The federal investigation into Orange County's bond disaster widened 
dramatically Wednesday when members of the Board of Supervisors were issued 
subpoenas seeking a broad range of records outlining their dealings with 
Merrill Lynch and other bond brokerages, sources close to the supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating Merrill Lynch 
and at least one other brokerage that conducted bond sales that put millions of 
dollars into the county's now-soured investment pool, faxed the subpoenas to 
county offices late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Four supervisors could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. Supervisor 
William G. Steiner said he was unaware of the subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 An SEC spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But several sources confirmed that all five board members had been sent 
subpoenas, seeking documents from January, 1993, to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas ask specifically about the supervisors' dealings with three 
Merrill Lynch brokers: Michael Stamenson, Debra Harris and Duane Canaga. 
</P>
<P>
 By Dec. 29, the supervisors must turn over all records of "compensation or 
other things of value received," as well as their federal and state income tax 
returns, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas also seek: 
</P>
<P>
 * "All documents relating to communications" with the Merrill Lynch brokers 
"or any other broker dealer or its employees." 
</P>
<P>
 * All personal and business diaries, calendars, telephone logs, books, memos 
and notes and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Checking and savings account statements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign accounts, including all campaign disclosure statements or reports 
including but not limited to campaign statements. 
</P>
<P>
 * All documents related to any securities accounts held by the supervisors or 
members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any gifts or loans made to them directly or indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Any tape recordings of any conversations related to Merrill Lynch or other 
brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, reached at her home in Lafayette, Calif., declined to comment beyond 
referring questions to Merrill Lynch's corporate headquarters. Stamenson and 
Canaga could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard T. Silverman, contacted at his home in New 
Jersey, defended the firm and the brokers: "We believe that Merrill Lynch acted 
professionally and properly in all its dealings with Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The development came on a day when anxious creditors jockeyed for a crack at 
Orange County's bankrupt investment fund, and the county's chief financial 
adviser announced that $1 billion of its safest remaining securities would be 
auctioned this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes said the auction would be the first 
step toward restructuring the county's investments, which have dropped $2.02 
billion -- or 27% -- in value this year. The sale would bring in badly needed 
cash for local agencies whose savings are tied up in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis triggered job cutbacks for the first time, as 47 custodians, clerks 
and classroom aides who had begun work over the past few weeks for the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District were told that Friday would be their 
last day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all casualties from this -- no doubt about it," said Supt. Peter A. 
Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, creditors packed a U.S. Trustees hearing in Los Angeles, 
with representatives from schools, cities and special districts clamoring for 
seats on committees that will suggest how the beleaguered fund's remaining 
holdings will be divided. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident that there would be a struggle for spots at the front of the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the schools feel we have a case for 100 cents on the dollar, and we 
intend to aggressively pursue that case," said Supt. James A. Fleming of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Health officials said that preventive services, such as well-child care, may 
have to be put on hold while other crucial public health programs -- such as 
tuberculosis and AIDS services, restaurant inspections and immunizations -- 
take priority in the strapped county's spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * County supervisors and community leaders called for local government to be 
pared down and restructured in the wake of the financial crisis. Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton created a task force to consider cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streamlining of government could be the silver lining in this cloud," 
said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sources at the SEC confirmed that investigators visited Orange County in 
April when the investment practices of Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron 
became a campaign issue. They reported back to the commission's enforcement 
branch that they found the practices risky but in violation of no law and not 
subject to the SEC's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan approved a plan that would allow the 
county to receive a $200-million line of credit from Bank of America for its 
day-to-day business transactions. The credit line will allow the county to 
continue its normal banking practices and make sure its checks do not bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business leaders announced the creation of a high-powered team to help 
burnish Orange County's image and restore its financial health. Taco Bell 
Chairman John Martin, Fluor Chairman Leslie G. McCraw and Rockwell Chairman 
Donald R. Beall are expected to take active roles in a task force being formed 
by the Orange County Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Industrial League 
of Orange County, which represent about 13,000 local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's a 'red team' or an 'orange team' or a crisis response 
team," said H. Fred Mickelson, chairman of the chamber. "But we're going to 
function as a single, clear voice for business in Orange County." School 
Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
 The day brought bad news for 47 temporary school workers who learned that they 
would be without work after Friday. Because of the financial crunch, Saddleback 
Valley Unified School District officials decided that they could not approve 
routine hiring, promotion or job extensions for those workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that before Friday something turns around and they say, 'Hey! 
You guys can continue,' " said Ronni Hughes, a district employee whose husband 
is a substitute janitor and was one of those laid off. "It's hard to take. It's 
hard to take if it's Christmas. It's hard to take if it's the Fourth of July. 
It's hard to take if it's Groundhog Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects to save about $50,000 a month in salaries and benefits 
because of the cuts, said Jennifer Huff, executive director of personnel. She 
said the employees will be hired back if the district can find money in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 47 employees have been working as substitutes and were told 
recently they would receive full-time jobs, school officials. Others had just 
finished their application and interview process and were awaiting rubber-stamp 
approval by the school board this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people would have had jobs, would have had paychecks, would have been 
out there spending money on Christmas presents and now they won't be," said 
George Anderson, president of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was turmoil at the U.S. Trustees office in Los Angeles as 200 
people -- mostly attorneys and financial advisers representing Orange County's 
creditors -- packed a hearing that lasted much of the day. Panel Appointments 
</P>
<P>
 As is typical of bankruptcy cases, many of the public agencies with the most 
money in the investment pool were eager for a place on the creditors 
committees. Membership provides access to the latest information and the best 
opportunity to represent a creditor's interests; 187 agencies have money in the 
pool -- now valued at $5.4 billion -- along with youngsters whose damages from 
private lawsuits were deposited in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Those appointed to the committees by Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany were 
representatives the Orange County Department of Education, the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the Orange 
County Sanitation Districts, the city of Irvine, representing all the cities in 
the county, and the city of Mountain View, representing municipalities outside 
Orange County. Tiffany said she may add further members later. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Tiffany proposed a package of cost containment 
measures intended to save taxpayers millions of dollars by limiting the amount 
of money collected by bankruptcy attorneys and financial advisers. Costs "could 
clearly be astronomical" without such controls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uncontrolled attorneys are probably worse than a toddler in a candy store," 
Tiffany added in an interview. "There's a public interest here. We have to 
control fees. Every dollar that is pulled out for administrative costs is one 
less dollar that can be used to cover the very serious shortfalls that exist in 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with her proposed controls, Tiffany estimated that legal and financial 
advisory fees would be as high as $30 million. Without controls those costs 
could skyrocket to $40 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial of Tiffany's cost containment proposals was to 
urge creditors not to retain their own investment advisers or accountants, 
relying instead on financial information provided by the county's consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 In contentious corporate bankruptcies, creditors and debtors typically retain 
their own financial advisers to dig up information to bolster their arguments 
before the bankruptcy judge. Normally, the debtors -- in this case Orange 
County and its investment fund -- are required to pay both sides' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany said that having teams of consultants on both sides of the Orange 
County case was unnecessary because the financial interests of the county and 
its creditors are the same. The county has "a natural desire to get as much 
money to the people as they can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel Harrow, a bankruptcy adviser who attended Wednesday's meeting, said 
creditors need to be confident that they are getting credible financial 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need assessments from people who are beholden to them only so they know 
they're getting good information," said Harrow, who was seeking business for 
his consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany also proposed that, effective immediately, legal fees be submitted to 
her for review on a monthly basis. She also asked creditors to form 
subcommittees to represent the interests of like-minded groups, such as school 
districts and cities, and suggested that those agencies pay half the 
subcommittee's legal bills, with the county itself picking up the other half. 
Board Takes Action 
</P>
<P>
 While the creditors were meeting in Los Angeles, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors tried to resume normal county business. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved Supervisor Roger Stanton's proposal to create a management 
council to handle the day-to-day operations during the crisis, establish a 
"strike team" to review potential budget cuts and form a committee to look at 
the issue of reinventing the way county government operates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county's financial problems surfaced, there has been a growing call 
for trimming local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe any rational leader should expect the taxpayers of Orange 
County to agree to refinance a clone of the former county bureaucracy," Stanton 
said. "I believe the restructuring of Orange County is inevitable." Bond Offer 
Rejected 
</P>
<P>
 In updating plans Wednesday for unwinding the county's shrunken portfolio of 
bond holdings, Hayes -- named the county's financial adviser last week at the 
urging of Gov. Pete Wilson -- disclosed that he had received the first serious 
offer to buy the securities, but had turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an offer," Hayes said. "I'm not at liberty to say from whom. 
We're working to get the best price for the bonds and other instruments in the 
portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will be selling $1 billion of fixed-rate, non-structured securities 
issued by federal government agencies -- among the less volatile of the mostly 
risky holdings remaining in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said that although he wants to sell the securities as soon as possible, 
he does not want to make any ill-considered transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working to get the best price for the bonds and other instruments in 
the portfolio," Hayes said. "I have 180 days to do it. I don't want to pass up 
any opportunities. We could have traded today, but we chose not to." 
</P>
<P>
 A sale will be made "when it's in the best interest of the people of Orange 
County," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But time is not on the county's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still highly volatile," Hayes said of the $5.4 billion in holdings. "It 
is still possible that the value erodes further, because we're in a very risky 
portfolio -- and that's why we shouldn't be in a risky portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was speculation in the financial markets that the Federal Reserve 
Board would delay any further increase in interest rates until January to ease 
the county's financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has been tightening credit to fight what it considers incipient 
inflation. But for Orange County, each percentage point increase in interest 
rates from here on will mean a $300-million hit to its portfolio, county 
financial advisers say.

SUPERVISORS OKD CITRON REQUESTS WITHOUT DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even after former Treasurer Robert L. Citron's risky investments had been 
publicly questioned in a bitter election campaign last spring, the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors rubber-stamped his requests for more than $1.3 
billion in borrowings from June to September. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Citron's requests were granted by the supervisors, without discussion 
or debate, on a single motion to approve everything appearing on the board's 
"consent calendar," which lumps together things such as grant applications and 
minor equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 A request on June 14 for authority to issue $600 million in taxable notes was 
approved, even though Citron did not provide any detailed explanation of how 
the money would be used, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 20, the five-member board also approved an unusual and risky 
agreement that allowed Citron to issue $320 million in pension obligation bonds 
backed solely by the county. A portion of the issue, $110 million worth, 
allowed bondholders to demand redemption of the bonds for cash on just one 
week's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 These bonds, known as "seven-day floaters," left the county vulnerable to 
rising interest rates, as well as to the whims of nervous bondholders. The 
county defaulted on the bonds Dec. 8 after investors, unnerved by the first 
signs of the county's financial troubles, demanded their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 On the advice of his attorney, Citron has declined to comment on the 
bankruptcy controversy after making a few statements early last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents are scrutinizing the bond deals, including the June 
$600-million issue, to see if the investment fund's risks were properly 
disclosed to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-ranking county official said Citron routinely received approval from 
county supervisors to sell huge sums of notes without providing any explanation 
of how they would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's typical of how business was done," said the official, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the $600 million was part of Citron's steadfast bet that 
interest rates would drop. It was a speculative "arbitrage deal," the official 
said, adding, "That money wasn't for anything. The purpose was for the money to 
be invested to earn interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, three of the five supervisors said that without referring to their 
records, they could not recall approving any of Citron's requests to issue the 
more than $1.3 billion in notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the consent calender sometimes contained 60 
or 70 items. But, he said, the bond issuances in question were approved "based 
on the recommendation of the treasurer. I think a lot of people relied on the 
recommendation of the treasurer -- to everyone's misfortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said that in 1992, after the supervisors 
unknowingly approved a $37.7-million contract, then-board Chairwoman Harriett 
M. Wieder directed that all items involving more than $500,000 be put on the 
agenda for discussion. Wieder could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If bond requests totaling $1.3 billion were put on the consent calender, 
Stanton said, "it would be a stimulus for rage." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he could not remember any discussion on the 
specific bond requests, but he said "as a matter of general process we review 
these things." He said he would look for a recommendation of the county 
administrative officer, Ernie Schnieder, indicating that it was in compliance 
with budgets and policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never picked up from the CAO's office that there was anything to be 
concerned with," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing number of critics, such as defeated treasurer candidate John M. 
W. Moorlach, say the campaign controversy over Citron's investments certainly 
should have caused the supervisors to question the flood of bond requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disingenuous of them to say they didn't know," said Moorlach, a Costa 
Mesa accountant. "If you are going to say 'We rely on staff,' then you better 
get better staff. . . . It was like moving furniture around on the Titanic 
(last summer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Argued Fullerton accountant Snow Hume, after poring over the 1994 agendas of 
the Board of Supervisors: "They may have been given reassurances that things 
were OK. They may have said they didn't understand the issues. But it seems to 
me if they had any questions at all, they should have yanked it off the consent 
calendar." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kiff, an executive assistant to Supervisor Thomas Riley, said that while 
staff members review consent calender items for each supervisor, the board 
relies heavily on the advice of the county administrator's office or the county 
department heads in approving agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
 When he pulled Riley's office copy, the staff member had simply written 
"approve" in his recommendation to Riley on Citron's request to sell $600 
million in taxable notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrator's office decides whether an item belongs on the 
consent calender. "If it's on the consent calender, it generally means the CAO 
did not believe it to be significant for discussion," Kiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kiff said that does not absolve the supervisors of failure to question 
Citron's requests to sell more than a billion dollars in notes during four 
months last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it fair to criticize the board for not paying better attention?" Kiff 
asked. "Yes, I think it is fair." Riley himself was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had an even earlier warning that they should be keeping a 
closer eye on Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year before the county's bankruptcy, county Auditor-Controller 
Steve E. Lewis warned supervisors in an internal audit, kept off of the board's 
agenda, that Citron was making "risky and unusual" transactions without 
consulting a committee charged with oversight and violating government codes to 
maximize returns. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the supervisors said they remember receiving the Aug. 5, 1993, audit, 
although Supervisors Steiner and Riley unearthed it in their offices after 
being questioned about it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 For some time, it apparently has been routine for the supervisors to approve 
bond issues without discussion. But they would have been hard-pressed to ignore 
the hubbub surrounding Citron's investment strategies during the election 
campaign last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Feb. 7 speech announcing his candidacy and in dozens of campaign 
appearances that followed, Moorlach focused on Citron's continual downplaying 
of ever-rising interest rates, which jumped four times during the course of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach also criticized Citron's devotion to a controversial investment 
strategy, using investors' holdings as collateral to get short-term loans at 
what were then low interest rates, and then buying long-term bonds paying a 
higher rate. As long as Citron could renew the short-term loans at low interest 
rates, the fund's investors realized a profit. But when the Federal Reserve 
Board hiked interest rates, the fund began losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates forced the pool to post $215 million in added collateral 
during April and May alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After Moorlach and several brokers reviewed the financial records for the fund 
in May, Moorlach wrote a lengthy, detailed letter to Riley, with copies to all 
the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said he was reacting to a quote by Riley in The Times that said, "I 
don't how in the hell (Citron) does it, but he makes us all look good." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Riley, Moorlach said the supervisor's quote "displays an 
ignorance that prompts me to write so that you may, in fact, understand what 
your current treasurer is doing. Especially since he is doing it with your 
tacit approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach pointed out that the pool already had declined in value from $7.5 
billion to $6.3 billion and Citron continued to bet on stable or falling 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool has borrowed short-term and loaned long-term, analogous to the 
savings and loan fiasco," Moorlach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the supervisors received Moorlach's letter, they approved -- 
without discussion or debate -- the first of Citron's requests to sell notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 7, the supervisors approved Citron's request to issue $250 million in 
taxable notes "to be used for any purposes the county is authorized to use 
monies" and $200 million in tax and revenue anticipation notes. Both requests 
were on the consent calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, again in a consent calendar item, supervisors approved Citron's 
request to borrow $600 million for unspecified purposes by selling taxable 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 19, the supervisors approved Citron's revamping of part of the June 7 
deal, approving $111 million in taxable notes and $70 million in tax-exempt 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, on Sept. 20, again without discussion, the supervisors approved 
Citron's request to issue $320 million in pension obligation bonds, partly 
issued in variable rate bonds. The Bond Buyer, a trade newspaper, said the 
following day that Orange County was the first to issue pension obligation 
bonds using a variable-rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, the $110 million in variable rate bonds was at the core of 
the county's cash flow crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the supervisors accepted without discussion Citron's annual 
report, in which he downplayed the pool's "paper losses" and noted that his 
office "continues to use reverse repurchase agreements as part of our 
investment strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he did not want to be "a Cassandra regarding the economy," and 
said he fit President Harry S. Truman's description of a successful leader -- 
one who makes "correct decisions 80% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "This probability of error keeps me diligent to see that any miscalculations 
of economic conditions do not have an overly negative effect on our investors," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it was learned that the Board of Supervisors had been warned as far 
back as 1982 that Citron was not following California law in making and 
recording some of his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1982 internal audit said Citron was recording the county's repurchase 
agreements as loans. Because of that, he claimed the county didn't own the 
underlying securities, and reasoned that the investments were therefore not 
subject to requirements of state law, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law limited the types of investments the treasurer was allowed to 
make, but Citron argued that those limits didn't apply when he invested in 
repurchase agreements.

O.C. SUPERVISORS OK WETLANDS DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENT: KOLL REAL ESTATE GETS 
GO-AHEAD FOR BOLSA CHICA PROJECT. OPPONENTS VOW LEGAL CHALLENGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting in the face of personal attacks, calls for their resignations and 
threats of lawsuits, the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday capped 
an eight-hour public hearing by unanimously approving a plan to build as many 
as 3,300 homes in and around the Bolsa Chica wetlands near Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bolsa Chica's time has finally come," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, in 
urging board approval of the Koll Real Estate Group's plan. "This county needs 
economic development, particularly given the events of the past two weeks. 
Large projects like Bolsa Chica need to be brought on line as quickly as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Councilman Ralph Bauer, who opposes the project on 
environmental and economic grounds, had a different view. "They crammed this 
down our throat," he said. "The board just went through the largest municipal 
bankruptcy in history and apparently has learned nothing from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the city of Huntington Beach and its school districts 
vowed to fight the project in court, saying that it would cost tens of millions 
of dollars in services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal still must receive approvals from the California Coastal 
Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers and a final ratification from the 
supervisors, which could come next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan as approved, the Koll Real Estate Group would build the homes 
on 1,600 acres of the ecologically sensitive area along Pacific Coast Highway 
near Huntington Beach. In exchange for permission to build the houses, the 
company would spend about $48 million to restore 950 acres of degraded wetlands 
-- much of it now used for oil production -- by, among other things, 
constructing a functioning tidal inlet connecting the marsh to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica, the largest stretch of unprotected coastal marshland south of San 
Francisco, forms a natural habitat for dozens of species of fish, mammals and 
birds, including at least five types of birds considered endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the ecological importance of the wetlands that, for years, has inflamed 
the passions of environmentalists, who fear that development will ruin the 
sensitive ecosystem. The development plan has also been opposed by Native 
Americans, who say that it would disturb a sacred burial ground once used by 
their ancestors, and by history buffs, who object to the removal of a World War 
II artillery bunker at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the critical comments on Wednesday, however, centered on economic 
issues, apparently brought to the fore by the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had assumed this meeting would be postponed until the hemorrhage of public 
funds could be stopped," said Connie Boardman, president of the Bolsa Chica 
Land Trust, which has led opposition to the project. "Why in the face of the 
worst financial crisis in Orange County history are you using your time to vote 
on this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon LaBedz, a spokesman for the Surfrider Foundation, which also opposes 
the project, was even more strident. "I'm pretty sick of you," he told the 
supervisors. "We're calling for your resignation and the cancellation of this 
hearing. You have disgraced us, and you are about to disgrace the Bolsa Chica" 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, however, said that the Koll development, far from being a 
drain on the county's beleaguered economy, could only improve its financial 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the project will be affected by the economic situation," said 
Thomas B. Mathews, the county's planning director. "It's a private development. 
There is an impact on the general fund, but it will be mitigated by the 
developer." 
</P>
<P>
 A fiscal impact report prepared by an outside consultant for the county 
predicts a recurring annual drain of about $437,000 on the county's general 
fund resulting from the project. That deficit would be more than offset, 
however, by developer fees as well as by $54 million in increased state and 
local tax revenues during the estimated 15 years it would take to complete the 
project. About $25.1 million of that would go directly to the county. Once the 
project is completed, the report says, Southern California would reap added 
sales and real estate tax revenues of about $12.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the project would further bolster the region's economy, according to the 
report, by creating more than 10,000 jobs during the construction period and 
about 4,000 permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fiscal impacts of the project must be taken in a context with the 
benefits," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not enough to satisfy Huntington Beach city and school district 
officials, however, who argued on Wednesday that the project would impose the 
unreasonable costs of supplying thousands of new residents with services, such 
as police and fire protection, as well as educating their children in local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is financially irresponsible," Bauer said. "By this action, the board 
has saddled the people of Huntington Beach with upfront costs of $60 million 
and $5 million annually in perpetuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Krupp, a consultant representing the Huntington Beach City School 
District and the Huntington Beach Union High School District, had a similar 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an extremely frustrating process for the school districts," he 
said, explaining that the Bolsa Chica development would ultimately add about 
1,195 new students to the two districts at an annual cost of about $34.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, however, downplayed such concerns. Many of the city's costs, he said, 
would be offset by economic benefits such as increased tax revenues and 
spending. Other mitigating factors, he promised, would be worked out later. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the school districts, Mathews said, the increased costs would be 
partially offset by several million dollars in required developer fees. In 
addition, he said, the districts could reduce their estimates of added costs by 
reopening schools shut in recent years because of falling enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county of Orange is not the facilities planner for the school district," 
he told the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Krupp and Bauer said they would urge their respective agencies to 
initiate immediate legal challenges to the proposed project. "They totally 
ignored us," Krupp said of the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the packed hearing room, however, was unhappy with the board's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrianne Morrison, executive director of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an 
environmental group that opposed a more ambitious Koll development plan 10 
years ago, expressed satisfaction with the current project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just crossed over the threshold" to preserve the wetlands, she said. 
"Now that's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Riddell, president of the Huntington Beach Chamber of Commerce, called 
the development good for business. "I commend them for their proactive 
position," she said of the board. "Huntington Beach will benefit, and it will 
be a benefit for all of Orange County. It will help build a healthier economic 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, was overjoyed. 
"I'm excited," she said. "I'm overwhelmed. I'm very happy, but it's a happiness 
for the day, because there's still a lot to do. This is a milestone on a very 
long journey." 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved a recommendation by Supervisor Roger R. Stanton that the 
vote not preclude the purchase of the wetlands by interested parties, such as 
the Department of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez urged that there be a "very thorough effort" to 
address concerns about the cost of supplying police and fire services to the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a daylong meeting that featured signs bearing such slogans as "Save It, 
Don't Pave It" and punctuated by many expressions of heartfelt emotion, one of 
the most urgent came from a woman who described herself as a member of the 
Juaneno band of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirits of our ancestors are crying out," said Maria Francis of Anaheim, 
with tears in her eyes. "This is our holy land; please leave our sacred burial 
grounds alone. If you approve this, be prepared to deal with the disasters to 
follow: earthquakes, fires and floods." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the supervisors had any comment. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Bolsa Chica Plan 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors approved a plan Wednesday to develop 
the Bolsa Chica wetlands and the surrounding area. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Homes: Koll Real Estate Group, the Bolsa Chica landowner, wants to construct 
as many as 3,300 homes on 1,600 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improvements: In exchange for permission to build, Koll would spend about 
$48 million to restore 950 acres of degraded wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prices: Condo prices would start at $200,000; luxury view homes would cost 
up to $1 million. Average home price would be $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Construction: Koll wants to start building in 1996 and finish in 13 to 15 
years. First homes could be occupied by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jobs: Could create more than 10,000 jobs during construction, about 4,000 
permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: Upon completion, development could generate $12.5 million annually. 
During building, project would generate $54 million in state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Objections: Environmental and financial. City and local school districts say 
project would cost their agencies about $95 million upfront, with added 
expenses annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * Endangered species: Marsh and surrounding upland is habitat for five 
endangered bird species: the light-footed clapper rail, Belding's savannah 
sparrow, California least tern, peregrine falcon and brown pelican. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Next: 
</P>
<P>
 * Opponents, including the city of Huntington Beach and local school 
districts, have promised legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Development requires approval by California Coastal Commission, which could 
review it this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Army Corps of Engineers must also approve; expected to take action in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Board of Supervisors must give final ratification, possibly next summer.

 In a crippling new blow to Proposition 187, a federal district court judge 
Wednesday prohibited most key provisions from taking effect until a trial 
determines the constitutionality of the sweeping illegal immigration ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer means that the measure's 
bans on public and secondary school education, non-emergency health care and 
social welfare services for illegal immigrants probably will be blocked for at 
least six months to a year -- if they are ever allowed to become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer, announcing her decision after a freewheeling two-hour court debate 
in Los Angeles, said the measure's education, law enforcement, social welfare 
and health care bans raise serious constitutional questions as well as other, 
more practical, issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of medical services for illegal aliens could result in greater 
health risks for the general population," said Pfaelzer, echoing arguments of 
initiative foes that the measure would prohibit illegal immigrants from 
receiving immunizations and other non-emergency treatment for such highly 
contagious diseases as tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer also barred implementation of a portion of the measure mandating that 
law enforcement officers seek to verify the legal status of all arrestees and 
notify those suspected of unlawful status that they must become legal or leave 
the country. Additional requirements that educators, social workers and health 
administrators quiz people about their status and report suspects to 
authorities were also blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer kept in place new state sanctions against the manufacture or use of 
fraudulent citizenship documents -- the one portion of the measure that she and 
another federal judge had previously allowed to take effect. She also declined 
to enjoin a portion of the initiative excluding illegal immigrants from public 
colleges and universities. However, that section of the measure is on hold in a 
separate lawsuit filed in a state court in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Under crisp evening skies, about 100 anti-Proposition 187 protesters, joined 
by the lawyers fighting the measure, lauded the judge's ruling in an impromptu 
celebration outside the Downtown Los Angeles courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for the U.S, the Constitution and for the immigrant 
community," said attorney Peter A. Schey, director of the Center for Human 
Rights and Constitutional Law, one of four civil rights attorneys who presented 
oral arguments to Pfaelzer on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Atty. Gen. Charlton G. Holland, who represented the state, said he 
was disappointed with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office can immediately appeal Pfaelzer's ruling 
to higher courts. However, the legal standard for earning a reversal by the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is far tougher than winning the preliminary 
injunction hearing, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 To overrule Pfaelzer, appellate judges would have to determine that she abused 
her discretion when she decided that Proposition 187 opponents were likely to 
succeed in their lawsuit or suffer irreparable harm if the initiative were 
enforced immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 David Puglia, a spokesman for state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, said a decision 
has yet to be made on whether to appeal the injunction. The state, he said, 
will consider that question and other options in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will seek the course that brings implementation soon rather than later," 
he said. "How we do that . . . is not certain." 
</P>
<P>
 One consideration for the state is whether it might take longer to appeal the 
injunction than to continue moving forward to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative sponsors, who were scattered throughout the audience at the packed 
court hearing, expressed displeasure but added that they expect to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a victory for the other side, but this is long from over," 
said initiative co-author Alan C. Nelson, a former director of the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, who chaired the pro-Proposition 187 campaign committee, said the 
decision "would force the people of California to be victims of illegal 
aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 During the far-reaching court hearing on four anti-Proposition 187 lawsuits, 
much of the debate focused on a central question: Whether the measure was an 
unconstitutional infringement on the federal government's mandate to oversee 
immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rosenbaum, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California's 
legal director, argued that it would be akin to California's setting up its own 
post office system or military. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the dominion of the federal government," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 State attorneys disputed that the measure conflicted with federal 
responsibilities, arguing that it was in essence aimed at limiting benefits to 
illegal immigrants. Other state laws, they noted, now prohibit illegal 
immigrants from receiving certain benefits and services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here today to invade Haiti," said Cyrus J. Rickards, a deputy 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers challenging Proposition 187 also reiterated arguments that the 
measure's wording tends to oversimplify the multitude of immigration 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the social services and health categories, the measure solely permits 
publicly funded assistance for U.S. citizens and immigrants "lawfully admitted" 
to the United States. That definition excludes many asylum applicants and tens 
of thousands of other foreign nationals who have some measure of legal 
protection from deportation under U.S. procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer said that in reaching her decision, she took into account that 
Proposition 187 was approved by a 59%-41% margin last month and that state 
voters are extremely frustrated at federal immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said, portions of the initiative appear to establish a state 
scheme to regulate immigration -- thus intruding on the federal government's 
overriding role to handle immigration policy. Moreover, the bans on health and 
social welfare services appear to conflict with federal statutes outlining who 
is eligible to receive care, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the Nov. 8 election, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stuart R. 
Pollak, acting on lawsuits brought by the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
other school boards and individuals, ordered that the initiative's elementary, 
secondary and post-secondary education bans be blocked before further court 
hearings. The next session before Pollak is scheduled for February. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-November, after a hearing in Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge W. 
Matthew Byrne Jr. issued a temporary restraining order halting implementation 
of all portions of the ballot measure except its sanctions for the sale and use 
of fraudulent citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's temporary restraining order, already extended once by Pfaelzer, had 
been due to expire after Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne and Pfaelzer had given the state permission to work on its proposed 
regulations for implementing Proposition 187 while the court hearings proceed. 
But Pfaelzer had ordered that any completed regulations not be made public -- 
let alone enforced. She reiterated those instructions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Health Services spokeswoman Shannon Bowman said regulations are 
still being prepared by the state's health and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're letting the departments have all the time they need to do a thorough 
and thoughtful job," she said. "They're trying to get them completed as soon as 
possible. I can't tell you if it will be three days, a week, two weeks, or a 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 With state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren readily conceding in interviews that 
portions of Proposition 187 -- as it appeared on the ballot -- are legally 
problematic, Lungren's lawyers argued Wednesday that regulations now being 
drafted would minimize its potential legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pfaelzer questioned whether regulatory moves could preserve the 
proposition's legality, Holland argued that state regulators could act with 
"surgical" precision. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys challenging Proposition 187 countered that no guidelines could 
cloak the measure's lack of constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need an act of Houdini to change this law and that's what they were 
trying to do," Rosenbaum said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In issuing her ruling, Pfaelzer agreed that "there's very little you can do by 
regulation" to change the initiative's requirement that law enforcement 
officers inform suspects that they must obtain legal status or leave the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Persons who have a right to stay," the judge said, "may mistakenly leave 
because of this notice. . . . It's not an innocuous notice." The public school 
ban, she added, clearly runs counter to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
ensuring free public schooling for undocumented youngsters in Texas. During the 
election campaign, Wilson and leaders of the Proposition 187 "save our state" 
campaign committee acknowledged that a vote for Proposition 187 would result in 
a taxpayer-paid lawsuit to overturn the 1982 Plyler vs. Doe decision. More on

PENA VOWS FAST ACTION ON SAFETY OF SMALL PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The federal government will speed up what had been a behind-the-scenes program 
to toughen safety requirements imposed on commuter airlines, bringing them up 
to the level of the larger air carriers, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
said Wednesday, one day after another fatal crash of a commuter airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena promised to conduct "the most comprehensive review ever" of airline 
safety. He said that within 100 days the Federal Aviation Administration will 
complete new rules imposing stricter standards on the small aircraft flown by 
the commuter airlines and put them in effect. And within several weeks the 
agency plans to convene a meeting of airline chief executives, safety experts, 
pilots and manufacturers to review safety issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their increasingly important role in the U.S. transportation industry, 
many commuter airplanes have operated under considerably more lax federal 
regulations than the larger passenger jets. The propeller-driven aircraft ferry 
passengers between smaller communities and larger airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash of an American Eagle Jetstream Super 31 as it approached 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina in foul weather Tuesday 
followed the crash of another American Eagle plane, an ATR-72, in icy 
conditions in Indiana on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Carolina crash, in which 15 of 20 passengers and crew were killed, 
focused new attention on the safety of the piston-engine planes and whether the 
government has done enough to protect passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect acknowledging that more can be done, the Transportation Department 
said that it would step up surveillance of airline safety programs "above and 
beyond what is occurring now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, who visited the North Carolina crash site Wednesday morning, said later 
in a speech to an aviation group in New York that the FAA would put together 
rules on the staffing of the airplanes "to ensure that there is always enough 
experience in the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
 Under current regulations, pilots of planes with fewer than 31 seats can fly 
up to 1,200 hours in a year and 120 hours in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots of larger planes are allowed to fly no more than 1,000 hours in a year 
and 100 hours in a month. The pilots of smaller planes also face less demanding 
training requirements. Airline dispatchers, who participate in preflight 
weather briefings and then follow the progress of flights by larger airplanes, 
are not required to do so for smaller aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 These discrepancies will be eliminated when the tougher rules go into effect, 
FAA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several airlines, including American Eagle, say that they voluntarily follow 
the stricter standards on all their flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schulz, a Transportation Department spokesman, said that the more intense 
safety program, which Pena said would take effect within 100 days, originally 
was not expected to be in place until next November, one year after the review 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether the commuter airlines are as safe as the major 
carriers -- and whether the federal government is taking sufficient steps to 
protect the traveling public -- has been troubling to aviation experts, 
frequent travelers and others flying aboard the often bouncy, cramped 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1991, the National Transportation Safety Board said that the FAA 
needed to beef up its inspections of commuter airlines. In March, 1992, the 
General Accounting Office, a congressional investigating agency, found that 
inadequate inspection of commuter air operations contributed to safety risks. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aviation industry sought to deal with the latest disaster -- in the 
week before the Christmas travel season -- airplane safety experts advised 
travelers to avoid small airplanes in risky weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But following that advice can be difficult. The planes often are the only 
convenient transportation in communities lacking jet service. In many cases, 
the skies have become crowded with the commuters -- many with fewer than two 
dozen seats -- as they jump from one regional airport to another to feed 
passengers to the major airlines' hub cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The small planes have grown in popularity among the airline companies because 
they are cheaper to operate on short hauls with limited numbers of passengers. 
Since 1983, their usage has increased from 2.3 million departures to 3.1 
million last year, when they carried 50 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in each of the three main measures that federal officials use to keep 
track of safety -- accidents per miles, accidents per flight hour and accidents 
per 100,000 departures -- the smaller aircraft showed higher risks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to David Stempler, executive director of the International Airline 
Passengers Assn., which claims 110,000 members worldwide, in the 15 years ended 
March 31, 1994, commuter aircraft with fewer than 31 seats had 30 fatal 
accidents, while larger airline jets, flying far more flights, had 15 fatal 
accidents, and mid-sized aircraft -- those with 31 to 109 seats -- had one 
fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest planes, he said, "are the real hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a paranoia, and rightfully so," about flying on them, said Jack 
Skloff, owner of Dimensions travel agency in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Fernandez, manager of Travel Bound Inc. in Falls Church, Va., said that 
in recent weeks "people have shied away from the commuters." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Watkins, a Chicago electronics salesman waiting in line at 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport to board a USAir Express commuter flight 
to Charlotte, said: "Does this accident scare me? Sure, but I'm concerned every 
time I step onto an airplane. Will it slow me down or keep me from flying? Of 
course not. Our air safety system overall is the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple factors contribute to the apparent increased risk posed by the 
commuter lines, said Mike Overly, editor of Aviation Safety, a monthly 
publication of the Aviation Safety Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, he said, "commuter flights do a lot more takeoffs and landings" than 
the average commercial jet flight, "and these are the most dangerous times of 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for a commuter airplane to make six flights in a day, and 
large jets might make half as many trips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, "commuters are flying in much more hazardous terrain," and often 
in areas frequently hit with poor weather. 
</P>
<P>
 His advice to travelers: "Get a weather report, especially in winter, and 
exercise your option to stay off a plane if it looks like bad weather." 
</P>
<P>

Washington contributed to this story.

PROBE FINDS THAT THE MOON HASN'T BEEN A QUIET SATELLITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K.C. COLE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the Apollo astronauts left their final footprints in the moondust 
25 years ago, Earth's nearest neighbor has been largely neglected for the more 
exotic lure of planets and star systems far, far away. Now, new findings beamed 
back from a pint-size military probe named Clementine have served up a full 
plate of lunar surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have yielded the first complete global portrait of the Earth's 
orbiting partner. No longer just a pockmarked face, the moon seems to have had 
a far more interesting history than previously imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more interesting findings are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Volcanic activity as recent as a billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * A wildly variable crust. 
</P>
<P>
 * The possibility of ice lurking in the shadow of the south pole. 
</P>
<P>
 * Confirmation of a crater large enough to span the continental United States 
from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 * A fresh-looking crater that may have been created in an impact recorded by 
sharp-eyed 12th-Century monks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thought that nothing much happened on the moon in the last 3 billion 
years," said geophysicist Maria Zuber of Johns Hopkins University and the 
Goddard Spaceflight Center. "Now we know that we don't understand the moon as 
well as we thought we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were discussed at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting 
and will be published in Friday's issue of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the fate of the Earth and the moon have always been 
linked, and that our permanent companion cannot be taken for granted as a mere 
prop for poets or backdrop for lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't be here if it weren't for the moon," said Carle Pieters of Brown 
University. She explained that scientists now believe that the moon was 
condensed from the debris of a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized object 
that stripped off a good part of the Earth's outer mantel and crust. 
</P>
<P>
 After a billion years or so of volcanic activity fed by the heat of 
radioactive decay, the moon was supposed to have cooled down rather uniformly, 
leaving a surface "as smooth as a billiard ball," Zuber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Clementine's 71-day rendezvous with the moon early this year revealed 
a global topography marked by steep peaks rising 10 miles higher than the 
lowest valleys. These unexpectedly craggy features may have frozen into place 
as parts of the moon's surface cooled rapidly while others remained hot enough 
to melt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing light off the moon in 11 different visible and infrared wavelengths, 
the spacecraft produced more than a million images revealing extreme variations 
in both the thickness of the crust and the rigidity of the surface. The deepest 
valley -- the floor of the continent-size South Pole Aitkin Basin -- is rimmed 
by the moon's highest peaks, suggesting that an enormous object may have 
crash-landed at an usually low angle, plowing up mountains in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be serendipity," Zuber said. "But it leads us to believe that 
impacts might have played a far greater role in the moon's evolution than we 
thought." The basin dominates the dark side of the moon that always has its 
back turned to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the fire-and-ice scenario more evident than in the newly mapped 
South Pole region. Evidence of relatively recent lava flows in the Schroedinger 
Basin suggest that the moon was erupting with volcanoes perhaps 2 billion years 
after it was supposed to have settled into staid middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to the pole, a large depression rotates about the moon's axis shadowed 
from sunlight, making it a promising site for ice deposits. Ever since 
scientists found convincing signs of ice at the poles of hell-like Mercury -- 
"the last place in the solar system you'd look for water," according to Pieters 
-- speculation about ice on the moon has been rampant, especially given its 
practical appeal as a water source for future lunar missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though liquid water does not exist on the moon, ice could accumulate, 
molecule by molecule, in the cold, shadowed regions at the poles. "It would be 
like a rock," said planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker, whose name became a 
household word when a comet named for his astronomer wife, himself and a 
colleague produced fireworks on Jupiter earlier this year. "It's too early to 
say whether it's really ice, but the data is tantalizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally intriguing is the new light shed on a medieval sighting of fireworks 
on the moon recorded by eight Canterbury monks. On July 18, 1178, they wrote 
(in Latin, of course), "The upper horn of the new moon seemed to split in two 
and a flame shot from it . . . (after which) the moon . . . writhed . . . and 
throbbed like a wounded snake." In 1976, space scientist J.B. Hartung suggested 
that this description was exactly what would have been seen had the monks 
chanced to witness a large impact on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Clementine has come a few steps closer to confirming the monks' 
observations. The crater in question -- called Giordana Bruno -- "is very 
fresh," Pieters said. Its soils are just beginning to take on the reddish hue 
that accumulates after years of space weathering. The question is, how many 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clementine data gives new information, but we still don't know how long 
it takes material in the lunar environment to show these signs of age," Pieters 
said. If the answer is millions of years, then the crater could be older than 
it looks; but if it's hundreds of years -- as many scientists speculate -- it 
could be the very impact the monks recorded. Said Pieters: "Either it's very 
young, or we don't understand weathering." 
</P>
<P>
 The little craft that produced all this new information was supposed to be 
lost and gone forever by now -- true to its namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed to test Star Wars technology, Clementine was supposed to orbit the 
moon almost as an afterthought; its primary mission was to home in on an 
asteroid and track it "while flying by really fast," on its way out of the 
solar system, Pieters said. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere a failure occurred and it never kept its rendezvous with the 
asteroid. Clementine, Pieters suspects, is still hanging around Earth orbit. 
With a price tag of only $100 million and an inception-to-launch time of less 
than two years, it proved to be exactly the kind of fast, cheap and productive 
mission that NASA has been hankering for. 
</P>
<P>
 As for future lunar rendezvous, it is unclear whether another Clementine-type 
project -- or any number of other possible visits to the moon -- will be 
approved anytime soon. Said Pieters, who is optimistic that one of four lunar 
missions now awaiting approval might be launched within three years: "We had 
fun while it lasted."

POSTAL SERVICE SEES WORKERS HOLDING KEY TO ITS SURVIVAL; MAIL: WITH CHANGING 
MARKETPLACE, THE FOCUS IS ON A MORE PRODUCTIVE, MOTIVATED LABOR FORCE. BUT 
PROGRESS IS LIMITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The gleaming, graffiti-free facade of the world's largest single-story mail 
sorting plant dominates South Central Avenue near Gage Avenue, rising 
temple-like amid used furniture stores, struggling recycling plants and the 
shells of long-gone factories. 
</P>
<P>
 With a work space larger than 10 football fields, the mail-pumping heart of 
the Los Angeles Postal District hums with the industrial music of automatic 
address scanners, keyboard operated sorters and two miles of conveyer belts 
that carry more than 8 million pieces of mail a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But, critical as the machines are, it is the nearly 800,000 members of the 
nation's largest civilian work force -- as diverse as any in America -- that 
makes the difference in whether the mail arrives on time at the right house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some eye-popping automation," said David Mazer, a Postal Service 
spokesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when all is said and done, it is a man or a woman at the end of the line 
who takes the mail out on the street and puts it in your box," Mazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting those carriers, clerks and sorters to work harder and smarter -- to 
exert "discretionary effort," in agency argot -- is a major push of the Postal 
Service these days. 
</P>
<P>
 A more productive and motivated work force is essential to the agency's very 
survival in a rapidly changing marketplace where customers increasingly have 
quicker and more reliable alternatives. Rising wages and benefits now account 
for more than 80% of the Postal Service's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr., who took over the agency in 1992 with 
orders to cut costs and boost productivity, has sought a bolder and more 
elusive goal: to foster teamwork and creativity throughout a sprawling 
organization that for decades has sought improvement through punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet progress so far has been scant. Union officials said the only change they 
notice is that workers are pushed harder than ever. Some bosses still base 
sensitive personnel decisions solely on financial considerations. Carriers and 
clerks feel demeaned when they are hassled into working when they are 
legitimately sick. Minority groups are squabbling over promotions and their 
rightful place in an agency that has a long record of affirmative action. 
Worries About Stress 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of the Los Angeles district's employees surveyed in 1992 said 
the relationship between unionized workers and their supervisors deteriorated 
in the past five years, with fewer than a third saying they were treated with 
"dignity and respect" and the majority saying they worry about on-the-job 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Americans, a mail carrier is the only federal employee with whom we 
will ever have a first-name relationship, the only one we will ever tip at 
Christmas. As a result, the delivery of the mail provides a barometer of the 
nation's ability to provide an important service at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
 And many postal workers, from those casing the mail to top officials, contend 
by that measure they are doing a good job. They say they are proud of what they 
do and embarrassed or even offended by criticism -- often unfounded, they argue 
-- from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "These employees are really conscientious," said Joyce E. Turner, a supervisor 
in the Los Angeles Mail Processing and Distribution Center. "But . . . all we 
hear is that some disgruntled employee got ticked off and shot everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 For many African Americans, the Postal Service has long stood for such 
quintessential American ideals as opportunity and upward mobility. And with the 
average unionized postal worker earning $43,000 a year, including benefits, for 
tasks that generally require few skills, the agency has long been considered a 
point of entry into the American middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 A job there has made distant dreams attainable. James Smith, for example, was 
just out of high school and fresh from picking cotton when he became a 
temporary carrier 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he and his siblings have college degrees, which he helped finance. All of 
it, he said, "started with the post office." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Postal Service has become better known in recent years for the 
corrosive tension between workers and their bosses than for the opportunities 
it offers. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of post office gun violence that claimed 34 lives and left 20 people 
wounded nationally between 1983 and 1993 shocked Americans and left the agency 
with an unshakable and macabre reputation for hiring psychotic gunslingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those tragedies prompted Congress to focus on problems within the agency. The 
General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concluded in a report 
this fall that the Postal Service is saddled with a "dysfunctional 
organizational culture." Mistrust separates autocratic managers from 
adversarial workers and their unions, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which occasioned a Senate committee hearing last month, also 
concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The morale of postal employees has suffered because hard workers go 
unrewarded, poor ones are ignored and all non-managers are kept out of the loop 
when it comes to important decisions. Meanwhile, a rising tide of mail and 
staff reductions in an ill-considered 1992 early retirement plan has forced 
workers to put in ever more hours of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disputes over those issues often result in formal discipline charges, which 
unions counter by filing grievances. In 1992 alone, according to the report, 
the Postal Service spent $200 million processing those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yet labor negotiations tend to focus on traditional union concerns of job 
security, wages and benefits and on management's desire for leverage to control 
costs. The current round of agency-union negotiations has gone to arbitration 
over just those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Senate hearing, Runyon proposed forming a joint union-management 
committee to quickly convert a corporate culture he has characterized as 
"operation-driven, cost-driven, authoritarian" to one that is 
"success-oriented, people-oriented and customer-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is most tense in the giant, factory-like processing plants, 
such as the one on South Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The three daily "tours" there move to the rhythms of the time clock and the 
precise schedule of dispatches and arrivals at more than 140 truck bays. 
Letter-sorter operators type zip codes at the wrist-wrecking rate of one per 
second for 45 minutes without a break and optical scanner operators have to 
move so fast they are prone to back injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Postal Workers Union, which represents clerks and mail sorters, 
contends the machines are dangerous and has persuaded the federal Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration to conduct a study. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Debra Brewster was an air mail record processor at the 
Worldway mail center at Los Angeles International Airport, another vast and 
bustling processing plant. Now, she is on a stress disability leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always told that we have to get so much mail out, that we have to meet 
this quota," she said. "If a piece of mail falls under a machine, they say: 
'Leave it there because it will slow your productivity down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is somewhat better in post offices themselves. Carriers spend 
the early part of their shift "casing" the mail -- tossing it into wooden 
cubbyholes that correspond to individual addresses -- just as they have done 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But disputes arise when carriers wind up with more mail for their routes than 
the maximum they are required to carry, as happens several days a week in most 
parts of Los Angeles. Supervisors have to either authorize overtime to get the 
extra delivered or leave it for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vargas, a carrier in the East Los Angeles station who tried to work out 
a solution to that dilemma with her supervisor, said she was rebuffed and told: 
"It's our job to manage the mail." Leave Policy Hit 
</P>
<P>
 One major source of complaints and grievances is the agency's restrictive 
leave policy. Many managers are loath to let workers take a day off, unless it 
has been approved well in advance. As a result, some workers claim to be sick, 
when they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford the luxury of an employee calling in just because they don't 
want to come in that morning," said Charlesetta Chavez, a Rancho Park 
supervisor who heads the Los Angeles chapter of the National Assn. of Postal 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is expected to discipline those with a pattern of absenteeism and 
to justify overtime, while meeting service goals. Many supervisors feel caught 
between recalcitrant workers and demanding bosses. And Chavez said more of her 
members than ever before have themselves been disciplined in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles W. King, who retired in 1992 after 16 years as the Los Angeles 
postmaster, said: "Postal supervisors have always been under pressure to meet 
budgets and get the mail out whether or not they had the necessary resources to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 To cope, he said, "you do everything you can to pressure" carriers and 
sorters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the problems, as a group, workers are proud to wear the stylized 
eagle of the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 8 in 10 unionized workers in the Los Angeles district said in the 
1992 survey that they were proud of their jobs. Despite the complaints, the 
overwhelming majority also said they liked their work, pay and benefits and 
were "committed to the success of the Postal Service." 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps as a reflection of Southern California's still-weak economy, the 
jobs are in great demand. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Los Angeles district advertised upcoming employment tests 
only by word-of- mouth and flyers at a few post offices. Yet, 33,000 people 
applied and 8,000 eventually took the tests for what will be only 600 to 700 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also testifying to the desirability of the jobs is that they have become the 
focus of a growing inter-ethnic competition. During the 1940s and 1950s, postal 
service jobs paid relatively poorly and, with the postwar economy booming, 
attracted few whites or even Latinos. African Americans, however, were still 
being denied jobs in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal workers alerted family members of upcoming tests or brought in 
relatives for temporary jobs. Later, African Americans with seniority and 
college degrees benefited from affirmative action and began getting promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, African Americans represent 62% of the Los Angeles district's nearly 
11,000 employees, although they constitute only 10% of the local civilian labor 
force. They hold 75% of the positions in middle management and three of five 
higher level jobs. Latinos represent 35% of the local civilian labor force but 
only 15% of all postal workers and an even smaller percentage of managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing those numbers, Dr. Tirso del Junco, a Los Angeles surgeon and an 
appointee to the agency's Board of Governors, said last summer that African 
American managers should be doing more to "open the doors of opportunity to 
everyone." African Americans said, in response, that they were being punished 
for their success. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring is done fairly, postal officials said, and vowed to try to interest all 
groups in applying. "The marketplace has changed so that we have to be 
concerned with all kinds of people, not just Latinos," said Los Angeles 
postmaster Jesse Durazo. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, postal workers just starting out in Los Angeles remain hopeful. Others 
feel their lives have been ruined by jobs that became nightmares. Some are 
frustrated to be still hoisting a heavy bag, as their bodies age. And others 
haven't lost their desire to keep America's letter boxes filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are four of their stories. Camille Hill 
</P>
<P>
 By the time mail carrier Camille Hill hoisted her capacious leather bag from 
the back of her truck at 9:30 one recent morning, she'd been on the job for 3 
1/2 hours, organizing the mass of political flyers, catalogues, credit card 
solicitations in the order of her East Los Angeles route. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five hours she would fill the bag 10 more times, hike 20 city 
blocks, drop off five parcels and exchange chitchat several dozen times. The 
routine is both legendary and mundane, and her presence was as much-awaited as 
a love letter and as taken-for-granted as a holiday merchandise catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's point of departure was the corner of Dangler Avenue and Fisher Street, 
in a neighborhood where dogs patrol tiny plots protected by patterned iron 
fences. She knows what to expect from every one, those that are overfed and 
lazy or those that are bony and hyperkinetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every mail carrier, Hill has dog stories. But she also has people 
stories, about the "customers" who look forward to seeing her five times a 
week. Although she does not speak Spanish, the primary language of virtually 
everyone she serves, Hill knows much about their lives -- who has had babies, 
who has been on vacation, who is sick and who has died. 
</P>
<P>
 For some who are infirm and housebound, hers is the day's only face, its only 
voice. She is a safety net of sorts, a quick-to-laugh link to the outside world 
that no communications system based on electronics or profit alone could 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 As she put a bill and some advertisements into one mail slot she shouted a 
greeting at the screen door, knowing that just on the other side of it sits an 
unseen elderly arthritis sufferer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to holler at her every day and ask how she is because she's home alone 
while her daughter is working," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her customers know the mail will be late the day that Hill is off because it 
will be carried by someone who is working overtime or is unfamiliar with the 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 48, and other carriers assigned to poorer neighborhoods are instructed 
to be particularly careful the first and third of every month, when robbers 
sometimes lay in wait to steal Social Security and welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier robberies in the Los Angeles district of the Postal Inspection 
Service, which covers most of Southern California, except San Diego, have more 
than tripled in the last three years to 139, the highest in the nation. 
Carriers have been attacked with knives, meat cleavers and pepper spray; they 
have been forced at the point of a shotgun to hand over their bags. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 100 postal inspectors, police officers and sheriff's deputies work 
under cover on those days. Hill said she relies on the people along her route 
to look out for her as well, making sure to park near houses where she knows 
people are at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill noted the Federal Express and United Parcel Service trucks she often sees 
making deliveries along her route and said she is aware of the competition. 
But, she said, she doesn't feel threatened. "We have good mail service and I 
don't feel like we have a problem," she said. "I really don't." Victor Delgado 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Delgado, a carrier for 15 years, believes the rungs have been cut from 
his career ladder. And he believes the reason is that he is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, 37, said he has taken all the steps -- the practical as well as the 
purely political -- to position himself for advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 He has helped train other carriers. He served on a special postal district 
committee to make sure Latinos were treated equally. He helped organize career 
awareness conferences and social events honoring the postmaster. He took 
college classes in labor relations. He even filled in as an acting supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of it helped. Every time Delgado applied to become a permanent 
manager he was rejected. And he believes it was because many of the district's 
managers, including most of those who sat on promotions boards, are African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel officials said that district policy requires promotion boards to be 
racially diverse. But Sylvia Woodside, the district's chief of personnel, said 
that she could not speak for how things were done before her arrival two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged the perception by some Latinos that they are unwelcome. But 
she said efforts to change that are under way. Employee councils of every 
ethnicity are being formed. And the district plans to hire a Latino program 
specialist to "find employees that are qualified, eager and have potential" for 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Delgado filed an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint. "I said: 
'Something is wrong here. The station manager says I'm a superior carrier, and 
that I have all the qualifications, and writes me an excellent reference, and 
then my application comes back and it says I'm not good enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He later withdrew the complaint, fearing it would hurt his career. Soon after, 
he said that he was blackballed anyway. He was no longer invited to attend the 
career events, let alone help organize them. He was no longer asked to be an 
acting supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Delgado is trying to find a future outside the post office, or perhaps 
with the Postal Inspection Service. He delivers his route during the day and, 
when the Dodgers are in town, he moonlights as the manager of a concession 
stand at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a supervisor in the post office "is out of the question," he said. 
Debra Brewster 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Brewster was overjoyed when she got a job at the post office 15 years 
ago. Now, she considers herself to be one of its victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently a graveyard shift mail processor at the Los Angeles airport 
sorting facility, Brewster has been on stress leave since early October. That 
was when she says a supervisor she had been feuding with for seven months shook 
her by the arms and screamed at her. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems started, she said, when she injured her back last spring trying 
to guide a cart loaded with hundreds of pounds of mail. A doctor recommended 
that she be given a less physically demanding "detail," as post office tasks 
are known, until her back healed completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But her supervisor accused her of being a slacker and wrote letters to oppose 
paying her worker's compensation benefits. A federal claims examiner later 
ordered her paid. 
</P>
<P>
 She was assigned to another unit but Brewster claimed the same supervisor 
continued to harass her. Finally, she says, they tussled in a passageway, with 
the supervisor grabbing her arms and shaking her. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster, 40, has been off ever since. She takes three types of tranquilizers 
to help her sleep. Even so, nighttime finds her pacing her apartment. The 
supervisor remains on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here I truly enjoyed working for the post office and . . . 
I took my job very seriously," she said. "As time goes on, I'm in it just to 
survive, to send my son to college, to feed my kids." James Smith 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the Postal Service is an easy target for wry jokes. But James Smith 
reveres the agency he has spent nearly 30 years working for. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he became a temporary carrier, Smith had been picking cotton in Florida 
for $3 a day. Now 48 and a high-ranking executive, he drives a top-of-the-line 
BMW, owns a View Park home worth $500,000 and has a master's degree from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a job to me, it's a career . . . that has allowed me to have a 
middle class way of life," said Smith, one of the district's top customer 
service executives. 
</P>
<P>
 But his success has not come without sacrifice. He distinguished himself early 
by working six or seven days a week, sometimes 16 hours a day, even though back 
then post office wages were low and there was no overtime pay. He said he's 
never called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only job I've ever had is to make my boss look good" he said, adding that 
he has little patience with mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he and other supervisors have long been accustomed to disciplining 
workers for their mistakes first and talking to them about it later. Now, he 
said, he realizes another approach is needed. He said he thinks the change in 
approach is healthy, but not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to learn . . . that others can't always give 110%," he said. "I have 
to understand that others can't give what I give." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Delivering Southern California's Mail 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service carries the mail to more than 10 million addresses in 
Southern California, a human and logistic task comparable only to waging war. 
Postal operations for the area stretching from San Luis Obispo to the Mexican 
border are divided between five districts, which together employ more than 
49,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA POSTAL OPERATIONS / LOS ANGELES POSTAL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
 1) The Los Angeles postal district covers the city of Los Angeles south of the 
Santa Monica Mountains and some unincorporated areas on the Eastside. It serves 
nearly 1 million residences and 100,000 businesses, divided into 1,800 delivery 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Facilities 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district has 43 neighborhood post offices, 19 postal counters 
(where stamps are sold and mail can be dropped off), 22 contract post offices 
(inside stores and other private locations) and three processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Processing and Distribution Center opened in 1989 on the 74-acre site of a 
former Goodyear Tire plant in South Central Los Angeles. The 1.1-million square 
foot facility includes the district's administrative offices, repair and 
maintenance facilities for a fleet of 2,700 cars, trucks and vans and the 
world's largest single-story mail processing floor. That floor covers an area 
the size of 10 football fields; more than two miles of conveyer belts wind 
through it. Mail is received, processed and sent back out through more than 140 
truck bays. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail Volume 
</P>
<P>
 About 8.4 million pieces of mail are delivered daily in the Los Angeles 
district, not including parcels; more than 3 billion pieces were delivered 
during 1992. The average customer receives 2,700 pieces of mail annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial Impact 
</P>
<P>
 The annual payroll of the Los Angeles district is $505 million; revenues for 
the year ended Sept. 30 were $456 million. If the district was a private 
employer, its payroll would rank as the 22nd largest in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages 
</P>
<P>
 Postal clerks, carriers and mail handlers earn an average of $32,458, or 
$15.60 per hour. With overtime and benefits, they average $42,711. 
</P>
<P>
 For comparison, United Parcel Service truck drivers earn an average of 
$33,930, or $18.85 per hour. With overtime and benefits, they earn an average 
of $43,821. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment 
</P>
<P>
 The district's mail is sorted, trucked, moved, monitored and delivered by 
10,750 clerks, carriers, handlers, supervisors and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Los Angeles district postal worker is 43 years old and has been on 
the job 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REST OF THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district's efforts are replicated in four other Southern 
California postal districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other districts handle mail for the rest of Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
 2) Van Nuys, serving a U-shaped area that also takes in Mojave and Pasadena 
and swings up the coast to San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Santa Ana, encompassing Orange County and part of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Long Beach, covering the cities and unincorporated areas of southern and 
western Los Angeles County, including Malibu, Beverly Hills, Torrance, 
Hawthorne, Gardena and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 5) San Diego, serving that city and sweeping east and north to San Bernardino 
and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>

 DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE POSTAL WORK FORCE 
</P>
<P>
 The postal work force in Los Angeles differs dramatically from the larger 
civilian work force, with far higher percentages of both Anglo and Latino 
workers. For all Southern California, the makeup of the postal work force is 
much more like that of the labor force as a whole.

TINY STRUCTURE IN BRAIN MAY BE KEY TO RECOGNIZING FEAR; SCIENCE: RESEARCHERS 
SAY THE AMYGDALA HELPS READ SOCIAL SIGNALS AND LINKS THE MENTAL AND THE 
PHYSICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is any text on human affairs so closely read as the faces of the men and women 
around us? The vocabulary is unmistakable: the pursed lips of distaste, the 
widened eyes of fear, the wrinkled nose of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 To live without the ability to read such facial expressions is to be 
illiterate in an almost universal, unspoken language of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now scientists have discovered "rare and remarkable" evidence that an 
almond-sized structure hidden deep within the human brain may be the key to 
recognizing the play of emotions in facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage it and a person can no longer recognize fear in another's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the most significant observations in the history of the study of 
facial expressions," said Caltech neurobiologist John Allman. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocative finding, made public Wednesday, adds to a growing storehouse 
of tantalizing insights into the neurobiology of emotions. It hints at how a 
critical juncture in the brain serves as an intermediary between the mind's 
intangible intellectual activity and the body's more physical responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said it also is evidence that the mind's emotions evolved in 
tandem with the body because fear -- so crucial to the functioning and survival 
of human beings -- apparently occupies a distinct physical place in the brain, 
separate from the seat of any positive emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 In research published today in the journal Nature, scientists at the Salk 
Institute in La Jolla and the University of Iowa College of Medicine have 
discovered that a part of the brain called the amygdala plays a central role in 
discerning human social signals. The organ is located near the base of the 
brain's gelatinous, three-pound sponge of tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The team reached its conclusions by studying an unusual patient -- "a case in 
a million" -- in whom the amygdala cells had been destroyed by disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the cluster of special neural cells, human beings apparently cannot 
recognize fear, nor can they decipher the suite of emotions in more complex 
facial expressions, the researchers said. But they have no trouble recognizing 
to whom a face belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 What the researchers found most striking was that no positive emotions were 
affected. In this instance, the patient could not perceive fear in another's 
expression, yet had no trouble recognizing the broad smile and crinkled eyes of 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient looks at a face of fear and she has no idea what she is seeing," 
he said. "She can recognize happiness perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 She was asked to rate pictures of faces showing expressions of half a dozen 
basic emotions and put through a variety of standard mental evaluation tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "This information is extremely important for our understanding of social 
behavior in general," said Antonio R. Damasio, the neurologist who led the 
research team. "What is at stake here is how we utilize a language not made up 
of words or signs to communicate meaning to others." 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, philosophers and scientists have puzzled over the relationship 
between the mind and the millions of neural cells that make up the brain. 
Researchers have tried to decipher how the brain creates mental experience by 
studying monkeys, rats, snails and -- indirectly with computerized imaging 
techniques or brain-wave measurements -- human volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier studies with laboratory animals had convinced researchers that the 
tiny organ is crucial to the formation of emotional memories and fear 
responses. In a long series of experiments with laboratory animals, Dr. John L. 
McGaugh at the UC Irvine Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 
pinpointed the amygdala as the site where adrenaline and other hormones affect 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Using advanced computerized imaging techniques, other researchers have 
observed the way blood flows and pools in brains of human volunteers and 
determined that the organ also plays a central role in the onset of clinical 
depression. It even appears to cement recollection of charged events more 
firmly in the mind, by linking emotions to long-term memories. 
</P>
<P>
 But until now, researchers had no direct way to plumb its function in the 
human brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens the door to a different view of the brain," said Dr. Leslie 
Brothers, a UCLA research psychiatrist at West Los Angeles Veterans 
Administration Medical Center who researches the role of the amygdala in 
non-human primates. "I was thrilled. This makes it very clear that the amygdala 
is involved in receiving social signals in humans." 
</P>
<P>
 Several researchers cautioned that because the report concerns a test of 
impaired brain function in a single person, the results may not be widely 
applicable. But other scientists said the finding fits neatly into a broad 
pattern of research results from animal experiments and tests of human patients 
with brain defects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is consistent with lots of other emerging findings," McGaugh said. "The 
basic premise is a strong one and is going to gain ever-increasing support." 
</P>
<P>
 In research that has not yet been published, for example, Damasio's group has 
tested a second patient with more severe neurological damage centered in the 
amygdala. He has lost the ability to recognize fear and anger in others, Allman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third patient, with less severe damage to the amygdala, is no longer able to 
tell in what direction someone is gazing. "She literally could not tell whether 
someone was looking at her or not," Allman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would make normal social discourse very impaired. If you can't make eye 
contact with a person, it makes you very uncomfortable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damasio and several other scientists believe the research offers important 
evidence that the mind and the body evolved together, with primary emotions 
such as fear becoming a separate and integral part of the brain because they 
play such an important role in survival. The amygdala is tightly connected to 
other parts of the brain responsible for the "fight-or-flight" reflexes that 
are probably older than the human species itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all emotions have the same value," Damasio said. "It is quite likely that 
emotions such as fear have a much higher adaptive value because it can signal a 
situation of danger. It has been segregated, selected and developed apart from 
others. This is the clue that neurobiology is giving us. 
</P>
<P>
 "An emotion is not a luxury. It is something vital for our survival because it 
is part and parcel of how we guide our behavior and reason," he said. "This is 
woven into the fabric of our biology." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Mind and Emotion 
</P>
<P>
 * The Discovery: 
</P>
<P>
 When a part of the human brain called the amygdala is destroyed, a person no 
longer can recognize common emotions in facial expressions, especially fear. 
</P>
<P>
 * What It Means: 
</P>
<P>
 It demonstrates how the brain acts as a broker between intangible activities 
of the mind and physical responses, suggesting that primary emotions are an 
integral part of the brain's neural circuits.

BOLAND, HAYDEN PLAN NEW SCHOOL BREAKUP EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vowing to work together despite their vast political differences, 
Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) and state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) announced Wednesday a joint legislative plan to dismantle the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference at Northridge Middle School, the legislators 
said that while previous efforts to break up the district have failed, the 
political climate has changed in Sacramento -- with the election of 28 new 
Assembly members and Speaker Willie Brown's power diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most legislators now would favor it," Hayden said. "This bill is in 
somewhat better condition . . . than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, the former campus radical, and Boland, the former real estate agent, 
agreed that the school district is too far removed from the people it serves: 
parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Hayden probably is as liberal as I am conservative," Boland said. "Yet, 
from both of our perspectives, LAUSD must be broken up." 
</P>
<P>
 While Hayden was hesitant to blast the school district, Boland was only too 
willing. "Everyone knows that LAUSD is the perennial doormat of public 
education," she said. "Every restructuring program they have ever put forth has 
been a total failure." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said they would oppose the latest attempts to split 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to think that the best place to chart the course for L. A. schools 
is in Los Angeles, not Sacramento," school board President Mark Slavkin said. 
"Rather than evoking legislators from Eureka to San Diego who probably have 
never been to Los Angeles schools . . . they should join with us. Let's just do 
it here rather than continue the cause as a political issue around which to 
posture and to plug into perceived anger." 
</P>
<P>
 Said board member Jeff Horton: "It's a whole lot of effort that I don't see 
helping the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Boland's bill, which will be introduced next month, the number of 
voters' signatures required to place a breakup initiative on the ballot would 
be reduced from 25% to 8%. Additionally, Boland would seek to amend current law 
so that the Los Angeles Board of Education would be unable to veto breakup 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once passed, this legislation will give disaffected parents, for the first 
time, a legitimate chance of dismantling this bloated bureaucracy," Boland 
said. "Breaking up this school district into smaller autonomous districts will 
empower children, parents and teachers and with it an infusion of people 
bringing new energy and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Hayden's bill, which is intended to complement Boland's legislation, all 
federal and state court orders mandating desegregation would be maintained in 
new, smaller districts. Additionally, new districts would be allowed to 
maintain collective bargaining agreements and required to maintain 
socioeconomic diversity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee would likely be formed to develop the breakup proposals, under the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he supports dismantling the system because -- like other 
bureaucratic institutions -- power is too far removed from its constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this philosophical concern that has brought me to conclude over the 
years that the Los Angeles school district is way too large for any district or 
organization for parents or children or teachers to have an effective say in 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, the nation's second largest, enrolls 636,416 students and has an 
annual budget of about $4.5 billion. Budget cuts over the past several years 
have required teachers and other employees to take pay cuts and raised class 
sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, particularly in the San Fernando Valley, have long felt 
disenfranchised from the district's headquarters downtown. To help decentralize 
decisions, the school system has broken into clusters of schools and adopted a 
reform program, known as LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last attempt to break up the district, several board members and 
teachers union leaders waged campaigns of their own to fight the legislation. 
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein said Wednesday that the 
union's position hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing dictates that these districts will look better," she said. "I don't 
care what anyone says, you are reinventing all over again the Los Angeles 
Unified School District." 
</P>
<P>
 While the lawmakers did not say how many school districts would be created, 
they said the Valley should definitely have at least one -- but probably more 
-- districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two school boards instead of one is not enough for me," Hayden said. "I 
believe deeply that education will improve if parents and community (members) 
have an easier time dealing with the school board." 
</P>
<P>
 The actual breakup proposals would be crafted by a community coalition, 
including legislators, parents and business leaders. Under present law, those 
proposals would then be reviewed by the county Office of Education and the 
state Board of Education. The Los Angeles school board now has the power to 
veto breakup proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 18 months ago, an Assembly committee overwhelmingly rejected a proposal 
to break up the school district. That action essentially killed the breakup 
movement, which had gained considerable political momentum during the election 
year. Former state Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys, a former staunch 
supporter of the district, joined the movement after winning a special election 
in the Valley two years ago. Hayden's bill replicates Roberti's failed 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar efforts over the years have failed. Former Assemblywoman Marian W. La 
Follette tried repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- to persuade the Legislature 
to support breakup bills. And, even as long as 20 years ago, bills were 
introduced to dismantle the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hayden and Boland said they believe that parents in the Valley are the 
most dissatisfied with the school district but that they believe the movement 
will spread to other parts of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Valley does (break off from the school system) and, in a few short 
years, people are happier, then I think people on the Westside and elsewhere 
will consider it," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Valley community and business leaders who attended the news conference 
said they welcomed the lawmakers' renewed efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have smaller school districts and we need to have local control," 
said Gerald Curry, president of the United Chambers of Commerce. "The L. A. 
school district really has become a behemoth."

$1-BILLION AUCTION OF BONDS TO LAUNCH O.C. RESTRUCTURING; BANKRUPTCY: THE 
CRISIS CLAIMS FIRST JOB CASUALTIES AS 47 TEMPORARY SCHOOL WORKERS ARE LAID OFF. 
CREDITORS PACK A U.S. TRUSTEES HEARING ON HOW FUNDS WILL BE DIVIDED.

<P>
 As anxious creditors jockeyed for a crack at Orange County's bankrupt 
investment fund, the county's chief financial adviser announced Wednesday that 
$1 billion of its safest remaining securities would be auctioned this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes said the auction would be the first 
step toward restructuring the county's investments, which have dropped $2.02 
billion -- or 27% -- in value this year. The sale would bring in badly needed 
cash for local agencies whose savings are tied up in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis triggered job cutbacks for the first time, as 47 custodians, clerks 
and classroom aides who had begun work over the past few weeks for the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District were told that Friday would be their 
last day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all casualties from this -- no doubt about it," said Supt. Peter A. 
Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, creditors packed a U.S. Trustees hearing in Los Angeles, 
with representatives from schools, cities and special districts clamoring for 
seats on committees that will suggest how the beleaguered fund's remaining 
holdings will be divided. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident that there would be a struggle for spots at the front of the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the schools feel we have a case for 100 cents on the dollar, and we 
intend to aggressively pursue that case," said Supt. James A. Fleming of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Health officials said that preventive services, such as well-child care, may 
have to be put on hold while other crucial public health programs -- such as 
tuberculosis and AIDS services, restaurant inspections and immunizations -- 
take priority in the strapped county's spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * County supervisors and community leaders called for local government to be 
pared down and restructured in the wake of the financial crisis. Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton created a task force to consider cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streamlining of government could be the silver lining in this cloud," 
said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sources at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating 
the financial crisis, confirmed that investigators visited Orange County in 
April when the investment practices of Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron 
became a campaign issue. They reported back to the commission's enforcement 
branch that they found the practices risky but in violation of no law and not 
subject to the SEC's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan approved a plan that would allow the 
county to receive a $200-million line of credit from Bank of America for its 
day-to-day business transactions. The credit line will allow the county to 
continue its normal banking practices and make sure its checks do not bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business leaders announced the creation of a high-powered team to help 
burnish Orange County's image and restore its financial health. Taco Bell 
Chairman John Martin, Fluor Chairman Leslie G. McCraw and Rockwell Chairman 
Donald R. Beall are expected to take active roles in a task force being formed 
by the Orange County Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the Industrial League 
of Orange County, which represent about 13,000 local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's a 'red team' or an 'orange team' or a crisis response 
team," said H. Fred Mickelson, chairman of the chamber. "But we're going to 
function as a single, clear voice for business in Orange County." School 
Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
 The day brought bad news for 47 temporary school workers who learned that they 
would be without work after Friday. Because of the financial crunch, Saddleback 
Valley Unified School District officials decided that they could not approve 
routine hiring, promotion or job extensions for those workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that before Friday something turns around and they say, 'Hey! 
You guys can continue,' " said Ronni Hughes, a district employee whose husband 
is a substitute janitor and was one of those laid off. "It's hard to take. It's 
hard to take if it's Christmas. It's hard to take if it's the Fourth of July. 
It's hard to take if it's Groundhog Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects to save about $50,000 a month in salaries and benefits 
because of the cuts, said Jennifer Huff, executive director of personnel. She 
said the employees will be hired back if the district can find money in the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 47 employees have been working as substitutes and were told 
recently they would receive full-time jobs, school officials. Others had just 
finished their application and interview process and were awaiting rubber-stamp 
approval by the school board this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people would have had jobs, would have had paychecks, would have been 
out there spending money on Christmas presents and now they won't be," said 
George Anderson, president of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was turmoil at the U.S. Trustees office in Los Angeles as 200 
people -- mostly attorneys and financial advisers representing Orange County's 
creditors -- packed a hearing that lasted much of the day. Panel Appointments 
</P>
<P>
 As is typical of bankruptcy cases, many of the public agencies with the most 
money in the investment pool were eager for a place on the creditors 
committees. Membership provides access to the latest information and the best 
opportunity to represent a creditor's interests; 187 agencies have money in the 
pool -- now valued at $5.4 billion -- along with youngsters whose damages from 
private lawsuits were deposited in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Those appointed to the committees by Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany were 
representatives the Orange County Department of Education, the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the Orange 
County Sanitation Districts, the city of Irvine, representing all the cities in 
the county, and the city of Mountain View, representing municipalities outside 
Orange County. Tiffany said she may add further members later. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Tiffany proposed a package of costcontainment measures 
intended to save taxpayers millions of dollars by limiting the amount of money 
collected by bankruptcy attorneys and financial advisers. Costs "could clearly 
be astronomical" without such controls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uncontrolled attorneys are probably worse than a toddler in a candy store," 
Tiffany added in an interview. "There's a public interest here. We have to 
control fees. Every dollar that is pulled out for administrative costs is one 
less dollar that can be used to cover the very serious shortfalls that exist in 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with her proposed controls, Tiffany estimated that legal and financial 
advisory fees would be as high as $30 million. Without controls those costs 
could skyrocket to $40 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial of Tiffany's cost containment proposals was to 
urge creditors not to retain their own investment advisers or accountants, 
relying instead on financial information provided by the county's consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 In contentious corporate bankruptcies, creditors and debtors typically retain 
their own financial advisers to dig up information to bolster their arguments 
before the bankruptcy judge. Normally, the debtors -- in this case Orange 
County and its investment fund -- are required to pay both sides' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany said that having teams of consultants on both sides of the Orange 
County case was unnecessary because the financial interests of the county and 
its creditors are the same. The county has "a natural desire to get as much 
money to the people as they can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel Harrow, a bankruptcy adviser who attended Wednesday's meeting, said 
creditors need to be confident that they are getting credible financial 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need assessments from people who are beholden to them only so they know 
they're getting good information," said Harrow, who was seeking business for 
his consulting firm. Board Takes Action 
</P>
<P>
 While the creditors were meeting in Los Angeles, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors tried to resume normal county business. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved Supervisor Roger Stanton's proposal to create a management 
council to handle the day-to-day operations during the crisis, establish a 
"strike team" to review potential budget cuts and form a committee to look at 
the issue of reinventing the way county government operates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county's financial problems surfaced, there has been a growing call 
for trimming local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe any rational leader should expect the taxpayers of Orange 
County to agree to refinance a clone of the former county bureaucracy," Stanton 
said. "I believe the restructuring of Orange County is inevitable." Bond Offer 
Rejected 
</P>
<P>
 In updating plans Wednesday for unwinding the county's shrunken portfolio of 
bond holdings, Hayes -- named the county's financial adviser last week at the 
urging of Gov. Pete Wilson -- disclosed that he had received the first serious 
offer to buy the securities, but had turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an offer," Hayes said. "I'm not at liberty to say from whom. 
We're working to get the best price for the bonds and other instruments in the 
portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 The county will be selling $1 billion of fixed-rate, non-structured securities 
issued by federal government agencies -- among the less volatile of the mostly 
risky holdings remaining in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said that although he wants to sell the securities as soon as possible, 
he does not want to make any ill-considered transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working to get the best price for the bonds and other instruments in 
the portfolio," Hayes said. "I have 180 days to do it. I don't want to pass up 
any opportunities. We could have traded today, but we chose not to." 
</P>
<P>
 A sale will be made "when it's in the best interest of the people of Orange 
County," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But time is not on the county's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still highly volatile," Hayes said of the $5.4 billion in holdings. "It 
is still possible that the value erodes further, because we're in a very risky 
portfolio -- and that's why we shouldn't be in a risky portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was speculation in the financial markets that the Federal Reserve 
Board would delay any further increase in interest rates until January to ease 
the county's financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has been tightening credit to fight what it considers incipient 
inflation. But for Orange County, each percentage point increase in interest 
rates from here on will mean a $300 million hit to its portfolio, county 
financial advisers say.

O.C. TASK FORCE WILL STUDY TOTAL GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL; SUPERVISORS: STEINER 
PROPOSAL CALLS FOR DRAMATIC DOWNSIZING OF COUNTY BUREAUCRACY, MORE PRIVATIZING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Setting the stage for what could be a massive government overhaul, the Board 
of Supervisors on Wednesday established a task force to suggest ways to 
restructure the way Orange County does business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the county's investment debacle, Supervisor Roger R. Stanton 
called on his colleagues to form a committee that would not only make sweeping 
changes in county government but also would establish safeguards to prevent 
future investment troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked of downsizing and letting private businesses handle some county 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that any rational leader should expect the taxpayers of 
Orange County to agree to refinance a clone of the former county bureaucracy," 
said Stanton. "I believe the restructuring of Orange County is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which was unanimously approved by the board, was praised from 
several other politicians and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streamlining of government could be the silver lining in this cloud," 
said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, the former federal immigration commissioner from Newport Beach, 
said the board should go further than just restructuring county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a disbanding of county government," said Ezell, who helped 
author Proposition 187 on the November state ballot, which denies health and 
education services to illegal immigrants. "This is the time to do it. . . . If 
we look at what we would save by eliminating county government we could pay off 
the debt in a couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 More power should be returned to cities, who could easily administer current 
county tasks, Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Board of Supervisors has become a kingdom that isn't necessary 
anymore," he said. "They've outlived their usefulness, like the monarchy in 
England." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is clear that the board would not go so far as to eliminate 
itself, supervisors may be forced to make drastic changes in county government 
operations because of their financial straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, county government is one of the largest employers in the county 
with more than 18,000 workers. The county's sphere of influence has diminished 
over the years as cities have incorporated, but the size of its bureaucracy has 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
 The county provides such diverse services as police and fire protection, bus 
service, libraries, parks, medical care for the poor and trash hauling. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, supervisors have asked county department heads to cut or 
suspend all but essential services and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity to streamline and restructure cannot be lost," Stanton said. 
"The ramifications of success in this endeavor extend beyond the present 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will be headed by Stanton and Supervisor William G. Steiner and 
will include members of the business community and citizen watchdog groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, a former college professor, said he is working on a "paper" to be 
released in the next few days that will address how he believes county 
government should be reshaped. He said he would expect that a new county 
government would be drastically streamlined with many current county operations 
being privatized. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who joins the board in January, 
said she strongly supported the formation of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restructuring, reinventing, whatever you want to call it, it's a question of 
making the system work because it's badly out of whack right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said any effort to reinvent county government would have to be 
accompanied by Orange County being granted with charter status, which provides 
a government with more flexibility on a wide range of issues. Such an action 
would have to be approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Stanton, Bergeson stressed that the county needs to look more closely at 
privatizing many of its services to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the private sector can respond in a more competitive way, that should 
be an option for the county," said Bergeson, who has unsuccessfully pushed 
legislation in recent years that would have allowed Orange County to privatize 
such services as janitorial work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a wake-up call," Bergeson said. "This is probably the best 
opportunity Orange County will ever have to reinvent its style of government,

SUPERVISORS OKD CITRON REQUESTS WITHOUT DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even after former Treasurer Robert L. Citron's risky investments had been 
publicly questioned in a bitter election campaign last spring, the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors rubber-stamped his requests for more than $1.3 
billion in borrowings from June to September. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Citron's requests were granted by the supervisors, without discussion 
or debate, on a single motion to approve everything appearing on the board's 
"consent calendar," which lumps together things such as grant applications and 
minor equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 A request on June 14 for authority to issue $600 million in taxable notes was 
approved, even though Citron did not provide any detailed explanation of how 
the money would be used, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 20, the five-member board also approved an unusual and risky 
agreement that allowed Citron to issue $320 million in pension obligation bonds 
backed solely by the county. A portion of the issue, $110 million worth, 
allowed bondholders to demand redemption of the bonds for cash on just one 
week's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 These bonds, known as "seven-day floaters," left the county vulnerable to 
rising interest rates, as well as to the whims of nervous bondholders. The 
county defaulted on the bonds Dec. 8 after investors, unnerved by the first 
signs of the county's financial troubles, demanded their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 On the advice of his attorney, Citron has declined to comment on the 
bankruptcy controversy after making a few statements early last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents are scrutinizing the bond deals, including the June 
$600-million issue, to see if the investment fund's risks were properly 
disclosed to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-ranking county official said Citron routinely received approval from 
county supervisors to sell huge sums of notes without providing any explanation 
of how they would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's typical of how business was done," said the official, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the $600 million was part of Citron's steadfast bet that 
interest rates would drop. It was a speculative "arbitrage deal," the official 
said, adding, "That money wasn't for anything. The purpose was for the money to 
be invested to earn interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, three of the five supervisors said that without referring to their 
records, they could not recall approving any of Citron's requests to issue the 
more than $1.3 billion in notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the consent calendar sometimes contained 60 
or 70 items. But, he said, the bond issuances in question were approved "based 
on the recommendation of the treasurer. I think a lot of people relied on the 
recommendation of the treasurer -- to everyone's misfortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger Stanton said that in 1992, after the supervisors unknowingly 
approved a $37.7-million contract, then-board Chairwoman Harriett Wieder 
directed that all items involving more than $500,000 be put on the agenda for 
discussion. Wieder could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If bond requests totaling $1.3 billion were put on the consent calendar, 
Stanton said, "it would be a stimulus for rage." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he could not remember any discussion on the 
specific bond requests, but he said "as a matter of general process we review 
these things." He said he would look for a recommendation of the county 
administrative officer, Ernie Schnieder, indicating that it was in compliance 
with budgets and policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never picked up from the CAO's office that there was anything to be 
concerned with," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing number of critics, such as defeated treasurer candidate John M. 
W. Moorlach, say the campaign controversy over Citron's investments certainly 
should have caused the supervisors to question the flood of bond requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disingenuous of them to say they didn't know," said Moorlach, a Costa 
Mesa accountant. "If you are going to say 'We rely on staff,' then you better 
get better staff. . . . It was like moving furniture around on the Titanic 
(last summer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Argued Fullerton accountant Snow Hume, after poring over the 1994 agendas of 
the Board of Supervisors: "They may have been given reassurances that things 
were OK. They may have said they didn't understand the issues. But it seems to 
me if they had any questions at all, they should have yanked it off the consent 
calendar." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kiff, an executive assistant to Supervisor Thomas Riley, said that while 
staff members review consent calender items for each supervisor, the board 
relies heavily on the advice of the county administrator's office or the county 
department heads in approving agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrator's office decides whether an item belongs on the 
consent calendar. "If it's on the consent calendar, it generally means the CAO 
did not believe it to be significant for discussion," Kiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kiff said that does not absolve the supervisors of failure to question 
Citron's requests to sell more than a billion dollars in notes during four 
months last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had an even earlier warning that they should be keeping a 
closer eye on Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year before the county's bankruptcy, county Auditor Steve L. Lewis 
warned supervisors in an internal audit, kept off of the board's agenda, that 
Citron was making "risky and unusual" transactions without consulting a 
committee charged with oversight and violating government codes to maximize 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the supervisors said they remember receiving the Aug. 5, 1993, audit, 
although Supervisors Steiner and Riley unearthed it in their offices after 
being questioned about it last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they had not seen the audit, the supervisors would have been 
hard-pressed to ignore the hubbub surrounding Citron's investment strategies 
during the election campaign last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Feb. 7 speech announcing his candidacy and in dozens of campaign 
appearances that followed, Moorlach focused on Citron's continual downplaying 
of ever-rising interest rates, which jumped four times during the course of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach also criticized Citron's devotion to a controversial investment 
strategy, using investors' holdings as collateral to get short-term loans at 
what were then low interest rates, and then buying long-term bonds paying a 
higher rate. As long as Citron could renew the short-term loans at low interest 
rates, the fund's investors realized a profit. But when the Federal Reserve 
Board hiked interest rates, the fund began losing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates forced the pool to post $215 million in added collateral 
during April and May alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After Moorlach and several brokers reviewed the financial records for the fund 
in May, Moorlach wrote a lengthy, detailed letter to Riley, with copies to all 
the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach said he was reacting to a quote by Riley in The Times that said, "I 
don't how in the hell (Citron) does it, but he makes us all look good." 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Riley, Moorlach said the supervisor's quote "displays an 
ignorance that prompts me to write so that you may, in fact, understand what 
your current treasurer is doing. Especially since he is doing it with your 
tacit approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach pointed out that the pool already had declined in value from $7.5 
billion to $6.3 billion and Citron continued to bet on stable or falling 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool has borrowed short-term and loaned long-term, analogous to the 
savings and loan fiasco," Moorlach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the supervisors received Moorlach's letter, they approved -- 
without discussion or debate -- the first of Citron's requests to sell notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 7, the supervisors approved Citron's request to issue $250 million in 
taxable notes "to be used for any purposes the county is authorized to use 
monies" and $200 million in tax and revenue anticipation notes. Both requests 
were on the consent calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, again in a consent calendar item, supervisors approved Citron's 
request to borrow $600 million for unspecified purposes by selling taxable 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 19, the supervisors approved Citron's revamping of part of the June 7 
deal, approving $111 million in taxable notes and $70 million in tax-exempt 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, on Sept. 20, again without discussion, the supervisors approved 
Citron's request to issue $320 million in pension obligation bonds, partly 
issued in variable rate bonds. The Bond Buyer, a trade newspaper, said the 
following day that Orange County was the first to issue pension obligation 
bonds using a variable-rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, the $110 million in variable rate bonds was at the core of 
the county's cash flow crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the supervisors accepted without discussion Citron's annual 
report, in which he downplayed the pool's "paper losses" and noted that his 
office "continues to use reverse repurchase agreements as part of our 
investment strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron said he did not want to be "a Cassandra regarding the economy," and 
said he fit President Harry S. Truman's description of a successful leader -- 
one who makes "correct decisions 80% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "This probability of error keeps me diligent to see that any miscalculations 
of economic conditions do not have an overly negative effect on our investors," 
he wrote.

 Even as interest rates were rising and questions were raised about 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's performance, county supervisors were 
giving him the go-ahead on investments. 
</P>
<P>

returns on the county investment pool -- is violating government codes designed 
to safeguard investments.

</P>
<P>
 * May 17: Federal funds rate is increased to 4.25% 
</P>
<P>
 * May 31: After reviewing investment pool records he had long fought to 
obtain, Moorlach sends a letter to all supervisors detailing problems with the 
pool, says its value has already declined from $7.5 billion to $6.3 billion and 
points out that Citron is betting on stable or falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 7: Without discussion or debate, supervisors approve Citron's request 
to issue $250 million in taxable notes "to be used for any purposes the county 
is authorized to use monies" and $200 million in tax and revenue anticipation 
notes. Both requests were on the "consent calendar," meaning discussion was not 
deemed necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 14: In another consent calendar item, supervisors approve Citron's 
request to borrow $600 million for unspecified purposes by selling taxable 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 19: Again in a consent calendar item, supervisors approve Citron's 
revamping of part of the June 7 deal, approving $111 million in taxable notes 
and $70 million in tax-exempt notes. Citron estimates that "based on current 
cash flow projections, the county needs to borrow an additional $64 million 
from Aug. 1, 1994, to July, 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 16: Federal funds rate is increased for the fifth time since February, 
to 4.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 20: Without discussion, supervisors approve a Citron request to issue 
$320 million in pension obligation bonds that holders could redeem on just one 
week's notice, a dangerous feature during periods of rising interest rates. A 
portion of the bond issue, $110 million, also has a feature that allows 
interest rate paid by the county to change weekly, exposing it to rising rates. 
According to the Bond Buyer publication, "this is believed to be the first 
pension obligation bond issue to use a variable-rate structure." 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 18: Supervisors accept without discussion Citron's annual report, which 
notes that he "continues to use reverse repurchase agreements as part of our 
investment strategy." Reverse repos add to the county's exposure to rising 
interest rates. Citron downplays "paper losses" the county has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 15: Federal funds rate is increased from 4.75% to 5.5%, the largest 
increase of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 6: Four days after disclosing that its investment pool has suffered at 
least $1.5 billion in losses, county files bankruptcy.

HIS NEIGHBORS WERE ENRAGED -- BY THE FATHER'S ARREST. SUPPORTERS ACROSS FRANCE 
SAY THE REAL CULPRIT IS RISING NARCOTICS USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE.

<P>
 Franck Verlaque was bad news, and everyone here knew it. In and out of trouble 
since his teens, he was, at 23, an ex-con and, his parents said, a drug abuser. 
He drove recklessly through this quaint village, drank heavily at the local 
tavern and terrorized his own family. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in September, to no one's great surprise, Franck was shot to death. The 
killer turned out to be his own father, a merchant who had recently added the 
words "Andre Verlaque and Son" to the sign outside his television sales shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As his only child lay dying in a shed next to their house, the stocky 
52-year-old walked to the nearby police station and said simply, "I've just 
killed my son." He was handcuffed and led off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was enraged, not by the shooting but by the arrest. Everyone 
said Andre Verlaque was a good man, an honest man. The real culprits, they 
decided, were the drugs that have reached into ever-smaller corners of France, 
turning youths such as Franck into uncontrollable demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Trets circulated a petition, contending that Franck's death "could not, in 
good conscience, be considered a crime" and asking that Andre be acquitted. The 
drive quickly collected 5,800 signatures -- 200 more than the town's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sadly, drugs have arrived in our small village," said Francois Coquillat, a 
butcher who led the petition drive. "The Verlaque family did everything for 
their son. They gave him everything. But, in these last days, Franck had become 
a veritable beast." 
</P>
<P>
 No one outside his family really knew if Franck was a drug addict. His mother 
said so. And Franck did take tranquilizers, often exceeding the dosage the 
doctor recommended to calm him down. But hard drugs? No one in town had ever 
seen him take them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush to blame drugs for the shooting, and the sympathy that Trets 
quickly won across the country, symbolized a deeper current in modern France: 
the frustration and fear felt by people watching drug abuse unravel the fabric 
of their society, from Paris to the smallest villages. 
</P>
<P>
 When the case comes to court next year, the question will be whether Andre 
Verlaque, during an argument over car tires, killed his unarmed son out of a 
genuine fear for the safety of his family, as he claims, or out of simple 
frustration with an errant son. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the villagers in Trets believe he deserves to be acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, drugs once were considered by most to be an American big-city 
phenomenon, no closer to everyday life than television and movies. Now, in many 
cases, the problem of drug-abusing youngsters is as close as the corner cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies have counted more than 150,000 heroin addicts in France, 10 
times greater than just a few years ago. Police in Paris recently seized six 
pounds of crack cocaine, the largest haul in the city's history. And the 
country's legislators will soon change the law to allow doctors to routinely 
prescribe methadone for recovering addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 45,000 people were arrested in France for drug offenses last year, 
and of those, 64% were younger than 25. The police seized 18% more heroin, 
twice as much crack and nine times as many amphetamines in 1993 as in the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Trets' troublesome son touched another special nerve in rural 
Provence, a province known for family quarrels as well as family values. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no coincidence that writer Marcel Pagnol chose this sun-kissed setting 
for "Jean de Florette" and other tales of internecine intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Verlaques were, as Andre's attorney put it, "a French family like so many. 
So many." 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, Franck was warmly welcomed into the family. Andre and his 
wife, Claude, unable to have a child, adopted him as an infant and doted on 
him, townsfolk remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre, descended from generations of Verlaques in this region, wanted nothing 
so much as to see his son follow in his footsteps, to take over the family 
business and raise his own family in this peaceful village. "This son was the 
light of their lives," said a friend of the Verlaques. "They thought he was the 
most beautiful child around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Franck grew into a rebellious teen-ager, and the arguments at the 
Verlaques' two-story home, in a modest hillside neighborhood on the edge of 
town, soon became well known. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was barely 19, Franck held up a gas station near town. He was arrested 
and spent two years in the prison where his father would later be held. 
</P>
<P>
 After Franck was released, the family resolved to start fresh. He married, and 
last summer he and his wife, Dominique, had a daughter, Estelle. They lived in 
an apartment on the second floor of his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Franck and his father went together to the wholesale markets to buy electronic 
goods for their shop. But at home, at night, the arguments resumed. Police were 
summoned regularly, and they suggested that Franck's parents file charges. But 
the parents declined, fearing that it would hurt their granddaughter and create 
even deeper divisions in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to discipline his child often, and always verbally," said Coquillat, 
the butcher and a lifelong friend of the elder Verlaque. "He tried to put 
Franck on the right road." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people in the town knew the family had troubles. But, as the French like 
to say, they respected the family's privacy. By that, they meant that they 
gossiped about the Verlaques but never offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all knew the boy was turbulent," Coquillat said. "He finished discussions 
with his fist. He destroyed that family. But no one talked about it. We know, 
but we don't talk. That's our way." 
</P>
<P>
 Franck spent much of his free time drinking pastis -- as many as a dozen in a 
single sitting -- in the Cafe de Commerce, on the main road of Trets. The hefty 
young man, with black hair and a mustache, was a fixture in the dingy barroom 
surrounded by tarnished soccer trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were, well, not afraid exactly, but wary of him," said Frederic, the 
bar's 49-year-old owner. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, a copy of the acquittal petition was fixed to the bar's 
door. It was headlined: "Solidarity in the Face of Tragedy." If Franck had any 
defenders in Trets, they weren't willing to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before his death, Franck had seemed depressed, the tavern owner 
said. Two collisions had left his Fiat damaged and touched off arguments at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of Sept. 1, Franck and his father began their last argument, in 
front of his mother. Franck's car had two flat tires, and he wanted to borrow 
the tires from Andre's car. It was, as one lawyer in the case said, "the drop 
of water that made the bowl overflow." 
</P>
<P>
 The argument continued as the men went to a work shed next to the house. 
There, Andre took the rifle he used for rabbit hunting, hoisted it to his 
shoulder and fired one shot into his son's chest. Franck died within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the police and prosecutor, the case is open and shut. Franck may have 
threatened his parents, they say privately. But without any charges or evidence 
of an immediate threat of violence from his son, Andre had no right to open 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In Trets, though, the general feeling was perhaps best summed up by Frederic, 
the bar owner. "It was well done," he said. "Franck deserved it. . . . His 
father did a good thing in getting rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the petition drive spread across France, Coquillat, who also heads 
the local merchants association, was inundated with telephone calls. Mayors in 
surrounding villages signed the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marseilles, about 30 miles away, a mother who had been imprisoned for four 
years for killing her drug-addict son added her name. A nurse left work to 
drive to Coquillat's shop to sign the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir," she told the butcher, "I thank you because I see drugs circulate in my 
neighborhood every day, and it's about time someone denounces it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the petition was delivered to court, it included letters from parents 
expressing frustration with the problem and their sympathy for a family torn 
apart by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we can never touch the big problem of drugs. It exists and it 
will always exist," said Muriel Coquillat, the butcher's daughter, who 
remembers playing with Franck when they were children. "But we had to stand 
together as a town for Mr. Verlaque," she added. "All of us have known each 
other since we were children, and we will know each other until we are 80 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
 That Franck Verlaque was a drug addict was accepted as a fact. Town leaders 
believed his mother, who said her son had become an addict while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he took drugs," said Marguerite Lyons, the father's first attorney. 
"But was he a drug addict? Well, there are worse ones." She was replaced later 
by a criminal lawyer more convinced of Franck's drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The family rallied around the father, even as they buried Franck in a cemetery 
near town. 
</P>
<P>
 His widow, who still works in the family store, said her husband had treated 
her and their daughter with kindness. Still, she wants her father-in-law 
acquitted, her attorney said. "She hopes that this case will call attention to 
the problem of drugs in France," said Annick Kechichian, the attorney. All 
Dominique would tell reporters was that the whole affair "has been horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 The people here sided with the family out of esteem for the TV store owner, 
but also out of concern for bad publicity. Trets is, like all towns, concerned 
about its civic image. And it didn't want to become known as the scene of 
family violence. By blaming drugs, the residents figured, even homicide could 
be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franck's father is a victim too," Coquillat explained. "He doesn't need to go 
to prison to be punished. He'll be imprisoned by his heart for the rest of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks in jail, Andre Verlaque was released pending a charge of 
voluntary homicide. The maximum sentence is 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a long time before we again resume a normal life," he said as he 
left jail. "It will be a long time before we forget what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "If I have one message for parents in the same situation, it is 
that they should try, at all costs, to make peace with their child before 
something like this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 While Andre welcomed the petition drive, he was worried about the publicity, 
and he urged his attorney to be discreet. "He doesn't want the press to take up 
his case because he knows that killing your son is something terrible," said 
Lyons, the lawyer. "It's not like buying a baguette." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a murder, of course, but there also was the love for a son," she 
added. "We all know that often parents are the last people who can help a 
drug-addicted child." 
</P>
<P>
 In their search for places to put the blame, Trets residents settled on drugs, 
which they believe turned a wayward youth into a dangerous threat and a father, 
however briefly, into a killer. And it was easy for many here to picture 
themselves in Andre Verlaque's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had run out of options," one resident said. "He could no longer 
communicate with his son. And his son was no longer receptive to the heartfelt 
love of his parents."

ORANGE COUNTY OKS CONTROVERSIAL 3,300-HOME PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
SUPERVISORS SAY REVENUES FROM THE BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT ARE NEEDED. 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE OUTRAGED. 
</P>

 Acting in the face of personal attacks, calls for their resignations and 
threats of lawsuits, the Orange County Board of Supervisors Wednesday capped an 
eight-hour public hearing by unanimously approving a plan to build as many as 
3,300 homes in and around the Bolsa Chica wetlands at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bolsa Chica's time has finally come," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, 
urging approval of the Koll Real Estate Group's plan. "This county needs 
economic development, particularly given the events of the past two weeks. 
Large projects like Bolsa Chica need to be brought on line as quickly as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Bauer, a Huntington Beach councilman who opposes the project on 
environmental and economic grounds, disputed that view. "They crammed this down 
our throat," he said. "The board just went through the largest municipal 
bankruptcy in history and apparently has learned nothing from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the city of Huntington Beach and its school districts 
vowed to fight the project in court, saying it would cost tens of millions of 
dollars in services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal still must receive approval from the California Coastal 
Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as a final ratification 
from the supervisors, which could come next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan as approved, the Koll company would build the homes on 1,600 
acres of the ecologically sensitive area along the Pacific Coast Highway near 
Huntington Beach. In exchange for permission to build the houses, the company 
would spend about $48 million to restore 950 acres of degraded wetlands -- much 
of it now used for oil production -- by, among other things, constructing a 
functioning tidal inlet connecting the marsh to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica, the largest stretch of unprotected coastal marshland south of San 
Francisco, forms a natural habitat for dozens of species of fish, mammals and 
birds, including at least five types of birds that are endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the ecological importance of the wetlands that, for years, has attracted 
the passionate devotion of environmentalists, who fear that development will 
ruin the sensitive ecosystem. The development plan has also been opposed by 
Native Americans who say that it would disturb a sacred burial ground used by 
their ancestors, and by history buffs who object to the removal of a World War 
II artillery bunker from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the critical comments on Wednesday, however, centered on economic 
issues, apparently brought to the fore by the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had assumed this meeting would be postponed until the hemorrhage of public 
funds could be stopped," said Connie Boardman, president of the Bolsa Chica 
Land Trust, which has led opposition to the project. "Why in the face of the 
worst financial crisis in Orange County history are you using your time to vote 
on this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gorden LaBedz, a spokesman for the Surfrider Foundation, which also opposes 
the project, was even more strident. "I'm pretty sick of you," he told the 
supervisors. "We're calling for your resignation and the cancellation of this 
hearing. You have disgraced us and you are about to disgrace the Bolsa Chica." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, however, say that the Koll development, far from being a 
drain on the county's beleaguered economy, could only improve its financial 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the project will be affected by the economic situation," said 
Tom Mathews, county planning director. "It's a private development. There is an 
impact on the general fund, but it will be mitigated by the developer." 
</P>
<P>
 A fiscal impact report prepared by an outside consultant for the county 
predicts that the project will drain about $437,000 a year from the county's 
general fund. However, that deficit would be more than offset by developer's 
fees, as well as $54 million in increased state and local tax revenues during 
the estimated 15 years it would take to complete the project. About $25.1 
million of that would go directly to the county. Once the project is completed, 
the report says, Southern California would reap added sales and real estate tax 
revenues of about $12.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the report says, the project would further bolster the region's economy 
by creating more than 10,000 jobs during the construction period and about 
4,000 permanent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fiscal impacts of the project must be taken in a context with the 
benefits," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not enough to satisfy Huntington Beach city and school district 
officials, who argued Wednesday that the project would impose unreasonable 
costs by forcing the county to supply thousands of new residents with services 
such as police and fire protection, as well as education for their children in 
local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is financially irresponsible," Bauer said. "By this action, the board 
has saddled the people of Huntington Beach with upfront costs of $60 million 
and $5 million annually in perpetuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Krupp, a consultant representing the Huntington Beach Unified School 
District and the Huntington Beach Union School district, had a similar 
complaint. "This has been an extremely frustrating process for the school 
districts," he said, explaining that the Bolsa Chica development would 
ultimately add an estimated 1,195 new students to the two districts at an 
annual cost of about $34.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, however, downplayed such concerns. Many of the city's costs, he said, 
would be offset by economic benefits such as tax revenues and increased 
spending. Other mitigating factors, he promised, would be worked out later.

BROWN ORDERED PAY HIKES FOR STAFF AFTER ELECTION, GOP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Willie Brown, acting as Assembly Speaker shortly after Republicans 
made major gains in last month's election, ordered pay raises of 5% to 10% for 
dozens of legislative staff members, according to Republican legislative 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The unannounced action, which occurred after the Nov. 8 election and before 
the newly elected Assembly met Dec. 5 to organize its session, has angered 
Republicans, who accused Brown of granting a "12th-hour, behind-the-scenes pay 
increase that nobody knew about." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is locked in a 40-40 tie with GOP Leader Jim Brulte for Speaker, 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican sources distributed to news organizations in Sacramento a document 
indicating that 41 members of the Democrats' Office of Majority Services 
received pay raises of 5% to 10% effective Nov. 20. Calls to that office were 
not returned Wednesday, and it was unclear when the 41 Democratic political 
staffers last received a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The office operates a range of services, from televised press announcements to 
tracking legislation in the Assembly and Senate. Some members leave the state 
payroll to work in political campaigns and return after elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the pay raises surfaced in the days after the election. At the end of 
November, a Times reporter asked Darolyn Davis, Brown's spokeswoman, about the 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous," Davis said, calling the rumor baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, Davis said that a handful of legislative staffers did 
receive raises as part of the normal pay system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens every November or at the beginning of December," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the people who received raises had not received pay hikes for 
some time, and insisted that there were no 10% raises in the package, adding 
that the pay boosts were "typical." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the GOP accounting, the director of majority services, Gale 
Kaufman, who was Brown's chief campaign strategist this year, received a 10% 
pay raise, which brings her salary to $129,600. 
</P>
<P>
 This is believed to make her the highest paid legislative staffer in 
California. Other staffers who received Brown's pay raises included William 
Cavala, a longtime Brown assistant, whose salary reportedly rose to $109,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged," said Assemblyman William Hoge (R-Pasadena), a minority member 
of the Assembly Rules Committee, which assists the Speaker in operating the 
Assembly. "We were not advised of this. This is why the people of California 
are so upset with Willie Brown. That's why he is not Speaker today, nor will he 
ever again be Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers have received a 37% boost in pay starting this month as a result of 
a decision by an independent salary-setting commission. They now will be paid 
$72,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Assembly Republicans oust Brown and take over the Assembly, they are 
certain to fire most of the staffers in the Majority Services Office and 
install their partisans. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether taxpayers could then expect a reduced GOP staff at lower 
salaries, Hoge avoided a direct answer. But Hoge said he and other GOP members 
were angry that Brown acted unilaterally without consulting the GOP members of 
the Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're having pay increases of these kinds of significant dollars, one 
would think that certainly the Rules Committee would have been checked with," 
Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Brown's lieutenants, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), issued a 
statement Wednesday in which he said the about 600 Democratic staffers in the 
Assembly received an average 11% increase this year, while the 250 Republican 
staffers got an average 19% pay raise. It was not clear when the various pay 
hikes occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Perry, Brulte's press secretary, said Katz's 19% estimate of Republican 
pay increases "just doesn't sound right to us." He said he did not know the 
correct figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democratic staffers not in the Office of Majority Services reported 
receiving pay raises last year in the neighborhood of 3% to 4%, while others 
received none. Some of the staffers are preparing for pay cuts or removal if 
Brulte and the Republicans take over.

AT LEAST 3 KILLED AS PLANE CRASHES ON FRESNO STREET; ACCIDENT: LEARJET HAS 
ENGINE TROUBLE WHILE RETURNING TO AIRPORT. IT SLAMS INTO APARTMENT COMPLEX, 
CREATING GRIM SCENE OF DESTRUCTION. 
</P>

<P>
 A private jet on a military training mission over Central California crashed 
on a Fresno street and careened into a crowded apartment complex Wednesday, 
spewing gas and flames in a two-block-long path of destruction that claimed at 
least three lives and injured at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers scouring the scene found body parts, scorched metal and 20 
burned-out cars in a poor section of southeast Fresno. They continued to search 
for more fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 The confirmed dead were the civilian flight crew, who a source said came from 
Klamath Falls, Ore., and a person on the ground. Their names were not 
immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Fire Capt. Bob Waterston said the search for additional possible 
victims was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, piloted by two civilians and belonging to a Georgia-based company, 
Phoenix Air, had finished chasing an F-16 fighter during a war game shortly 
before noon. The plane was returning to the Fresno airport when the crew 
radioed the tower about engine trouble, according to a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot apparently attempted to land on Olive Avenue about two miles 
southwest of the airport, and witnesses said the crew tried to wave off cars 
and pedestrians. The twin-engine Learjet skidded along the wide street, mowing 
down power poles and electrical wires before crashing into the two-story 
apartment building and exploding in a fireball. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Brandon said he was baby-sitting when he heard a monstrous vibration and 
then what sounded like a sonic boom. "The entire street was on fire," Brandon 
said. "The ground was black and there were pools of fire everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon ran out of his house and down the block and saw Arlinda Henderson on 
the second floor of the apartment complex, surrounded by flames and screaming 
for help. Brandon walked her to safety and ran back to rescue Henderson's 
boyfriend, Dallas Magner, who had been injured in a recent car crash and could 
not walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thunder knocked me out of my chair and threw me on the floor," said 
Magner, 54. "Everyone was screaming. Fire everywhere. If not for (Brandon), I 
wouldn't have made it out alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was fast approaching Clinton Howe's electrical contracting business. 
"All I could see was one solid flame 30 feet high coming toward me. 'If it 
keeps coming we're in trouble,' I said." 
</P>
<P>
 It stopped. For the next three minutes, more than a dozen empty cars parked 
along the plane's path exploded in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters needed 45 minutes to put out the fires. Federal Aviation 
Administration investigators and military men in fatigues and black berets were 
on the scene, and Fresno's mayor and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) arrived to 
view the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A large section of the aircraft was left in the middle of the street. Yellow 
blankets marked body parts and sensitive aircraft parts. Flame retardant foam 
was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sign of the fuselage or anything," Capt. Waterston said. "It all 
got destroyed in the fire. What a time of the year for such a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a mile-long section of the residential, commercial and industrial 
neighborhood would be evacuated for at least a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Two buildings in the 102-unit apartment complex, with its "Now Renting" 
banners still intact, were destroyed or badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the search for more victims would focus on a dozen or more 
apartments ravaged by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The two pilots, both in their 30s, flew training missions for the Air National 
Guard on the West Coast. "They have been doing this for a long time, and 
they're both very good," a source said, "but I don't know . . . how often they 
practiced emergency situations."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: TOUGH LOVE FOR AN ERRANT ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson may have sounded like a Christmas Scrooge, but it turns out 
he was speaking for virtually all of Sacramento when he said last week of 
bankrupt Orange County: "We are not in a position where we can bail out bad 
judgments." He well could have added, Nor should we.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not a nickel," Assembly Democratic leader Willie Brown of San Francisco says 
when asked whether state government should spring for a cash bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to use to bail with?" asks Sen. William A. Craven 
(R-Oceanside), chairman of a new Special Committee on Local Government 
Investment Practices. He's referring to the fact that Sacramento is borrowing 
$7 billion just to keep its own books afloat. And this still will leave a 
$2.8-billion hole unless Washington coughs up the immigration money Wilson 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) notes that Sacramento has a 
special, legal obligation to keep schools open, but asserts: "Why should the 
state come up with the cash? Make the county come up with the cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also chimed in Tuesday on schools, saying "there's a considerable 
difference" between a district that merely deposited surplus funds in the 
county's investment pool, and a district that did "the egregious thing of 
betting on the come" by borrowing money to place in the pool. "That's like 
taking the milk money and playing bingo with it." 
</P>
<P>
 One influential Orange County Republican, who asked not to be identified, 
predicted a gradual county "meltdown," but declared nonetheless: "There 
shouldn't be any state bailout." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So that's pretty much the attitude in California's Capitol: The state 
essentially is broke itself and even if it were sloshing in money, why should 
any of it go to cover gambling losses? 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't exactly mean "drop dead." It's more like the attitude of a 
strapped parent whose son has just left his tuition money on a craps table in 
Las Vegas. There's outrage, astonishment and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid is reined in, advanced monthly payments, given a co-signature on a 
bank loan and perhaps even lent some of the family's meager savings. But there 
is no freebie gift of bucks. There's lots of advice and new rules. And the 
student is forced to cut back and/or find more income. 
</P>
<P>
 For government, there are not many ways to increase income. Certainly, 
wagering on future interest rates is too risky, as Orange County found. The 
traditional way is to raise taxes, although supply-siders argue that this does 
more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There absolutely won't be a tax increase," vows Orange County 
Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson, who is vacating her state Senate seat to 
replace Chairman Thomas Riley on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so certain. Says Sen. Craven, whose committee holds its first 
hearing Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 "The communities of Orange County are going to face an extremely large 
financial loss. They are going to have to cut their public services or raise 
additional revenue. There is no way around that. We may need to cut them some 
slack to allow either unusual service cuts or unusual tax increases, as they 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either way, we're talking about something seriously painful here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the embarrassed county's credit, it isn't asking for a cash bailout. "I 
don't think we should look to the state or the federal government to solve our 
problems," Bergeson says. "We're in good economic position in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 But she believes the Wall Street brokerages that played dealer in the county's 
gambling binge now should offer a line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is only contempt at the Capitol for how Orange County -- 
specifically resigned Treasurer Robert L. Citron -- parlayed its investment 
pool into a 27% loss, there is growing respect for the way it is trying to 
minimize the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in power here is saying, It's your mess, get out of it. For one thing, 
the debacle could further damage the state's credit rating. "We've got the 
worst paper in the country right now," laments Senate leader Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward). "We're at the bottom of the sack." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is fear that other counties may have been playing fast and loose 
with their investments and that's being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probable that the governor and the Legislature will rein in the 
investment authority of local governments -- after loosening it through the 
deregulatory 1980s -- and require more oversight. They'll advance payments to 
Orange County and its victims and consider loan guarantees; perhaps even loans, 
although Wilson tends to oppose that. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento wants to help. But it also wants to send a message: Gamble at your 
own risk.

RUNAWAY TRAIN HITS ANOTHER IN CAJON PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An out-of-control Santa Fe freight train slammed into the rear of a parked 
Union Pacific coal train as it descended the treacherous Cajon Pass before dawn 
Wednesday, moments after the crews of both trains jumped to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash derailed five locomotives and four cars and sparked a fire that 
burned for hours. The flames and jumbled wreckage were clearly visible to 
motorists on Interstate 15, about 18 miles north of San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Santa Fe crew members were injured as they jumped from their 
locomotive about 1,500 feet before the collision, as the train accelerated to 
45 m.p.h., according to witnesses who talked to them. Both men were listed in 
stable condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two crew members in the rear locomotive of the parked coal train fled about a 
minute before the crash and watched the collision from a safe distance, a 
railroad spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 82-car Union Pacific train was headed to Los Angeles from Provo, Utah. The 
train, carrying a shipment of coal destined for Japan, had stopped on the 
tracks for a red signal, to allow another train to cross the tracks farther 
ahead, said Union Pacific spokesman Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew was monitoring Santa Fe dispatches and heard that the mile-long 
freight train was barreling toward it, unable to stop, Davis said. The two crew 
members in the rear locomotive, as well as crew members at the front, ran from 
the train, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing motorist, Fred Dressler, hurried to the scene after he watched 
flames erupt in the morning darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 He said one of the Union Pacific crew members told him, "We saw the headlights 
and we bailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressler said he ran to the aid of the two dazed Santa Fe crewmen who jumped 
clear of the train. One of them told him the train had lost its brakes and was 
traveling about 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 On that stretch of track -- six miles into a 3% downhill grade -- the normal 
speed is about 15 m.p.h., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for San Bernardino County Medical Center identified the Santa Fe 
crew members as Leland Whitsitt, who suffered chest injuries and a spine 
fracture, and Keith Stockwell, who sustained blunt abdominal trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Railroad operations manager Ron Jackson said investigators had not 
yet determined what caused the double-deck freight train to lose control. 
Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal 
Railroad Administration and the state Public Utilities Commission were 
dispatched to the scene, near the junction of I-15 and California 138 as it 
leads to Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Fe train was headed for Los Angeles from Birmingham, Ala., carrying 
furniture and other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 The train had stopped about half an hour earlier and, at the time, its brakes 
were functioning well, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the track -- one of three through the pass -- is expected to be 
reopened today. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroad officials say the heavily traveled 23-mile-long grade through the 
Cajon Pass is one of the most challenging for trainmen because of its curves 
and steepness. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, a runaway Southern Pacific freight that reached speeds of 105 m.p.h. 
jumped the track on a curve at the bottom of the grade and plowed into a row of 
houses in San Bernardino, killing four people and injuring 30 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, a gasoline pipeline that was damaged in the cleanup of the 
derailment ruptured in a fireball, killing two more people, injuring 31 others 
and destroying or damaging 29 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, a Union Pacific freight train lost control and reached 
speeds in excess of 70 m.p.h. before it recovered its brakes and screeched to a 
halt in the Santa Fe rail yard in San Bernardino.

 A vacuum cleaner hummed in the background and two dogs pranced at his feet as 
Brother Arnold Hadd led the way inside a century-old brick dwelling house at 
Sabbathday Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the casually dressed, 38-year-old Hadd hardly fit the image 
of a custodian of a rich religious tradition and American cultural phenomenon 
that threatens to slip into the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brother Arnold, as elder of the Shaker society at Sabbathday Lake, and the 
seven other society members say that role is one they feel keenly these days. 
As the last active community of a Protestant sect that in the 1850s encompassed 
18 societies and 6,000 people, the Sabbathday Lake Shakers -- who this year 
celebrated their 200th anniversary -- say they feel a special duty to ensure 
that their religion endures. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain burden on us to live the life as absolutely authentically 
as possible," said Brother Arnold, who along with Sister Frances Carr 
administers the community, located on an estate of 18 buildings and 80 acres of 
working farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 For the community members, authenticity does not mean donning the same garb as 
their ancestors or eschewing modern conveniences. It does mean holding true to 
the basic rules of Shaker life, including celibacy and communal ownership of 
wealth, and to the sect's core teachings, such as the value of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult life," Brother Arnold said recently. "It requires a 
very mature person to be able to commit themselves." But, he added, "I feel 
more fulfilled here spiritually than I ever felt anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are worries he and others feel about the future of their community 
-- and their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be naive if we said it doesn't concern us," Sister Frances said of 
the potential demise of a sect whose finely crafted furniture, songs and 
utopian way of life are still firmly embedded in the American mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she takes heart that Sister Ann Lee, the charismatic leader of 
the original Shakers, fled to America from Britain in 1774 with eight followers 
-- the same number that now exist at Sabbathday Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot developed out of that," Sister Frances said. "While we don't expect 
such a resurgence, who is to say what will happen in the next few years? 
Certainly, there's a great deal of interest being shown in everything about 
Shaker life." 
</P>
<P>
 While minuscule, the Sabbathday Lake community need not fade into history 
since, unlike some other Shaker societies, it has always accepted new members, 
Sister Frances points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrying about the future is not a luxury the Sabbathday Shakers often have. 
With a 1,800-acre estate to maintain, the society's six women and two men, ages 
30 to 87, are seldom idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Frances takes charge of cooking and shopping. Others tend to the 
gardens and a flock of sheep, work in the print shop or create handcrafted 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 For income, the community sells 38 varieties of herbs that it grows and 
packages, along with lumber and gift items. It also leases property. And it 
grows much of its own food. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Pennsylvania Amish, the Shakers make use of technology, both new 
and old. While wood stoves provide the main source of heat in the dwelling 
house, there is a dishwasher and a microwave oven in the kitchen and a personal 
computer in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaker traditions seem hardly threatened by such modern efficiencies. In 
addition to celibacy and common ownership of goods, the community carries on 
the Shaker custom of private confession among members. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily life still follows a monastic routine. Members are summoned by bell to 
breakfast at 7:30 each morning, with prayers following the meal. Prayers also 
accompany a noon meal. Religious services are held on Wednesday nights and 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 For inspiration, the Shakers need only look at the pictures lining the walls 
of the leaders who guided the community during its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1747 in Britain, the Shakers -- so named because members often 
violently shook during worship -- settled in Albany, N.Y., in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite renewed persecution, the movement claimed new members in the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries, forming communities throughout New England, as well 
as in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Pennsylvania -- and later in Florida and 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabbathday Lake community, founded in 1794, at one time had more than 50 
buildings. The bustling community operated a grist mill, manufactured wooden 
items such as tubs and barrels, produced woven goods, raised garden seeds and 
medicinal herbs, ran a school and cared for orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 But like other utopian movements, Shakerism saw its numbers decline. By the 
1940s, just four communities remained. 
</P>
<P>
 While their numbers are small, Shakers still have a relevant message for 
today's world, Brother Arnold said. "This is still a viable way of life. I 
personally feel very ordinary people can be made to do extraordinary things 
through this life."

4 ISRAELI SOLDIERS, 1 PALESTINIAN INJURED ON ANNIVERSARY OF HAMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four Israeli soldiers and a Palestinian were injured in three separate 
incidents Wednesday, the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Islamic 
militant group Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army and police called in extra patrols and canceled all leaves in 
anticipation of the occasion.Hamas, the main rival to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, opposes peace with Israel and has carried out a string of attacks 
on Israelis, including the October bombing of a Tel Aviv bus. 
</P>
<P>
 In Deir al Balah in the autonomous Gaza Strip, about 2,000 Hamas members 
marked the anniversary at an unruly rally where speakers demanded that Israel 
release their spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, or face further bloody 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no solution except through holy war," speaker Bassam Nassar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masked gunmen fired into the air and painted walls with red graffiti 
threatening Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel with further attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deir al Balah rally included displays of martial arts and speeches calling 
for the escalation of attacks against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin will pay the bill in the blood of his soldiers and the livers of the 
settlers," one slogan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, an Israeli reserve soldier made a 
wrong turn and found himself in the center of a hostile group of youths who 
stoned his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier was bleeding from the head and his car was damaged before Israeli 
troops rescued him and took him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the West Bank town of Tulkarm, two Israeli soldiers were slightly injured 
when they drove over a bomb, the army said. No other details were immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian stabbed a soldier at a lookout post near the 
Jewish settlement Ganei Tal. Israeli troops opened fire, wounding the assailant 
in the legs.

REBEL CHECHENS READY FOR NEW RUSSIAN ASSAULT; CAUCASUS: THE RENEGADE REPUBLIC 
EXPECTS A FIGHT TODAY AS DEADLINE TO SUBMIT TO THE KREMLIN EXPIRES. A 
HELICOPTER FROM MOSCOW IS SHOT DOWN AS PEACE TALKS FALTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Showing no chink in their defiance, rebel Chechens shot down a Russian 
helicopter gunship Wednesday and steeled themselves for the bloody storm of 
their capital that they expect when the deadline to submit to Kremlin rule 
expires today. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks, mired in the dispute over whether the mountainous Muslim republic 
is part of Russia, broke down, and Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev went on 
television to exhort his citizens to smite the Russian interlopers until they 
"die of fear and horror." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian tank columns closing in on Grozny from three directions stopped six to 
10 miles from the Chechen capital, according to Russian Nationalities Minister 
Nikolai Yegorov, who is largely handling the crisis for the Kremlin. The troops 
were ordered to seal off the city early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that the Russian forces moved into Chechnya to "liberate it from the 
Dudayev regime," Yegorov said they would not storm Grozny before the deadline 
but left ominously unclear what would happen next. He said only that Chechens 
who do not surrender their weapons will be disarmed by force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appeal to the leaders of the unlawful armed formations: Stop trying the 
long patience of the Federation!" an official Russian government statement 
said. Meanwhile, fighting broke out sporadically north of Grozny. Chechen 
sources reported a massed attack of nearly 200 tanks and armored vehicles 
Wednesday evening on their position 10 miles northwest of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 They said missile and aviation attacks left 24 villagers dead to the capital's 
north, but Russian air force officials denied that they had hit any civilian 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualty counts in the four days of Russian intervention in Chechnya vary, but 
it appeared that dozens of people have been killed. Russia's Independent 
Television also reported that about 100 soldiers have been taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 To the southwest of Grozny, Chechen militants shot down a Russian helicopter 
gunship and, according to Russian counterintelligence chief Sergei V. 
Stepashin, "literally tortured the crew" to death. Video footage on Russian 
television showed Chechens kicking the wounded pilot onto a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, reports on the Chechen offensive dominated the newspapers, many of 
them full of trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "War won't solve a single problem," read a headline in the respected New Times 
magazine. "The Afghanistan variation is proposed for solving the Chechen 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A poll by the Russian Mnenie service found that although a majority of 
Russians thought the Chechnya crisis threatened Russia's integrity, only 11% 
favored using force to resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who underwent elective surgery on his nose 
on the eve of the offensive, was expected to return to work in the Kremlin 
today, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 World response to the Chechnya conflict has been fairly muted. Western 
countries, including the United States, have said that they see Chechnya as 
Russia's internal problem and that it would be in nobody's interest for Russia 
to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev let the world know Wednesday that its 
response should stay that way. "I wouldn't advise anyone to interfere in 
Russia's internal affairs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya, which has fought Russian attempts to incorporate it since the 18th 
Century, declared its independence in 1991. Moscow tried everything from talks 
and economic pressure to covert support for Dudayev's opposition to bring it 
back into the fold, but nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Kremlin sent in tank columns and thousands of troops backed by 
planes and helicopters. It said military pressure would help bring results at 
peace talks. Russian officials said they would not storm Grozny, only encircle 
it. They also sought to stop the influx of arms and supplies to Chechen rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad weather has hindered the operation, as has unexpected resistance from 
residents in the republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan who blocked the Russian 
troops as they passed through toward Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Yegorov laid out the Kremlin's long-term plan for the republic of about 1.2 
million people. He said he plans to stay in Grozny as the president's 
representative and oversee the imposition of the Russian constitution here and 
elections in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev had different plans. He told his citizens that "the soil must burn 
under the feet" of Russian soldiers, and he told central Ostankino Television 
that he will never forsake his resistance to Russian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian troops "will be attacked from the rear in the traditional tactic 
of mountaineers," he said. "Hit and run, hit and run, until they give up out of 
fear and terror." 
</P>
<P>
 In Grozny, the streets were largely deserted except for residents lining up 
for bread. 
</P>
<P>
 There appeared to be little hope that negotiations would allow Moscow and 
Grozny to avoid greater bloodshed. Although the Chechen side said it had left 
the talks in the neighboring city of Vladikavkaz merely for a "working break," 
it also refused to sign a document acknowledging that Chechnya is part of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were put in a position in which we had no choice but to cut off the 
talks," Usman Imayev, the chief prosecutor of Chechnya, told Russia's Itar-Tass 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Yegorov said Chechnya had demanded that it be treated at the talks as an 
independent state, and "We will never agree to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Boudreaux reported from Grozny and Goldberg from Moscow.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RUSSIANS PLAYING THE BLAME GAME OVER CHECHNYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Famous last words. Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev, speaking late 
last month, boasted that "one regiment of paratroopers would need just two 
hours to solve the whole issue" in breakaway Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after Moscow sent thousands of troops streaming toward the Chechen 
capital of Grozny, those words come off as bravado so outrageous as to be 
almost comical. Except that to Russians there is nothing comical about the 
flaws in intelligence and military planning revealed by snags in the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, media and analysts ask, was Russia's crisis with Chechnya allowed to get 
so out of hand that only massive force could solve it? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the Russian march on the breakaway region seem so impromptu? And why 
were Russian troops caught by surprise when villagers outside Chechnya, in 
neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia, blocked their way, leading to deaths, 
injuries and the humiliating loss of armored vehicles? 
</P>
<P>
 In the finger-pointing that has gathered momentum since Sunday, one target is 
taking the most blame -- the Federal Counterintelligence Service, a rough 
Russian equivalent of the FBI known by its Russian initials, FSK. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would give the FSK an F for its preparation of the operation without a 
moment of hesitation," said security expert Sergei Blagovolin, an adviser to 
President Boris N. Yeltsin. "They failed to recruit people who are against 
(Chechen President Dzhokar M.) Dudayev -- and there are very many of those 
people in Chechnya. They could not work properly with the opposition. That's a 
kindergarten level of work. The FSK's preparation for the operation was 
disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 The FSK is charged with fighting foreign spies, terrorists and threats to 
Russia's security, including economic dangers. It came formally into existence 
only in January after yet another revamping of the remnants of the Soviet KGB, 
and it answers directly to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, in contrast to the all-powerful KGB, it must also answer to the 
likes of nationalist lawmaker Alexander Nevzorov. Nevzorov demanded that FSK 
Director Sergei V. Stepashin come to Parliament to face the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stepashin is a lazybones," Nevzorov snapped. "It's his fault that 18-year-old 
soldiers with runny noses are fighting there, not officers' battalions trained 
for that purpose. . . . Let the FSK pay for sending a special contingent of 
troops there." 
</P>
<P>
 Stepashin was also taking flak from the Russian media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it really impossible to foresee (and therefore prevent) the reaction of 
the populations in Ingushetia and Dagestan?" wondered Dmitri Ostalsky in the 
newspaper Sevodnya. Ingush and Dagestani villagers burned at least 30 military 
vehicles, and dozens of soldiers were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Minkin's questions in Moskovsky Komsomolets, Russia's most popular 
daily, were even sharper: "If (we had to invade) Chechnya, why did it have to 
be done so stupidly, so talentlessly, so unpreparedly? There have been reports 
that paratroopers arrested Stepashin -- he didn't know the password. Is this 
cooperation? And why in winter? It's hard enough to operate in the mountains 
even in summertime. Why do we know nothing? Is there a plan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also appeared little impressed by the initial performance of the new 
Russian army in its biggest operation since it was created in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the military side of the operation, I would give them only a C," 
Blagovolin said. "So far, they have avoided a lot of bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of the respected newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, wrote 
scathingly: "The start of the Chechen expedition as a fact and its first 
results (the reaction of the local population, the losses among Russian troops, 
the colonels taken captive!!!) testify to the total incompetence of those who 
planned it both from the point of view of ethnic politics and the military 
aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian troops struggling toward Grozny have come in for fewer attacks 
than the FSK, perhaps because they are seen as unfortunates fulfilling an 
unpleasant task. 
</P>
<P>
 But their slow progress did their image no favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer it takes for our military actions there, the greater will grow 
Dudayev's authority and prestige," worried Sergei Oznobishchev, director of the 
Center for International Security Problems at the USA-Canada Institute, a 
Moscow think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian army is also clearly suffering from the weak turnout in recent 
military drafts and the diminishing officer corps, both of which have left most 
units undermanned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where can we get soldiers other than the 18-year-olds you saw on TV?" asked 
Col. Gen. Yuri Rodionov, a member of Parliament's defense committee. "It's all 
very easy to discuss problems, but it is very difficult to organize such an 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most commentators did not blame the army for how it carried out its 
orders -- they instead pointed out that the orders would never have needed to 
be given if not for the FSK. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the FSK that, by all accounts, organized the Nov. 26 attempt at 
storming Grozny by forces that claimed to be Chechen opposition to Dudayev but 
were actually stacked with recruits from the Russian army. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem was that the Russian soldiers were recruited by the FSK so 
clandestinely that their own commanders didn't know that their men would be 
moonlighting. That got the Defense Ministry understandably mad at the FSK. 
Another problem was that when the Russians were routed, officers were taken 
prisoner and forced to admit their role in the would-be coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging its shame, the FSK sacked its deputy chief, Yevgeny Savostyanov, 
who had overseen the Caucasus region for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, the disastrous Nov. 26 attack on Dudayev was the third of its 
kind, military observers say. When the FSK realized the last storm had failed, 
analysts believe, it immediately began to push for a major operation to squash 
Dudayev once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered by public opinion, the FSK may take its revenge on Dudayev 
personally. According to Russian reports, it has been putting together a 
super-elite group of 120 commandos to slip into Grozny and "liquidate" the 
Chechen president.

NATO MAY BOLSTER U.N. MISSION IN BOSNIA; MILITARY: DEFENSE CHIEFS OF 19 NATIONS 
WILL MEET NEXT WEEK TO CONSIDER OPTIONS. BUT WITHDRAWAL PLANS ARE LIKELY TO 
PROCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Following a week of intensive hand-wringing about how to rescue the 
23,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping force from Bosnia-Herzegovina, NATO on 
Wednesday swung its focus instead toward bolstering the beleaguered U.N. 
contingent so it can stay and be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first priority is looking at how to strengthen UNPROFOR," said a senior 
alliance official here, using the acronym for the peacekeepers formally known 
as the U.N. Protection Force. "The second priority is planning for a 
withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said an emergency meeting 
of defense chiefs from 19 nations involved directly or indirectly in the Bosnia 
peacekeeping operation will convene Monday at The Hague to discuss the military 
feasibility of proposals for strengthening the U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, is 
expected to represent the United States, while the U.N. commander for 
operations in the former Yugoslav federation, French Gen. Bernard de Lapresle, 
is also expected to be present. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. and NATO officials, the generals will probably concentrate, 
at least initially, on the practicality of a joint U.S.-French proposal first 
aired earlier this week in Washington following a meeting between U.S. Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry and his French counterpart, Francois Leotard. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan would create a secure corridor for humanitarian aid to flow between 
the Adriatic port of Split and the besieged Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, 
reorganize forces to give better protection to Sarajevo's airport and bring in 
groups of 10 to 20 peacekeepers from isolated areas to reduce the potential for 
hostage-taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at ways they can carry out their mission better," said British 
Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came during a meeting here of NATO defense ministers. One of 
the main agenda items was to discuss planning operations for a withdrawal of 
the U.N. forces if conditions in Bosnia deteriorate further. 
</P>
<P>
 While planning for such a pullout was discussed and preparations for such an 
operation are expected to continue on an urgent basis, the ministers of those 
NATO nations directly involved in the Bosnia mission, and also the United 
States, clearly were concentrating on how the U.N. force might be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 "All ministers agreed withdrawal would be a major defeat for the international 
community and lead to more violence," explained a senior alliance official. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. official talked of a "dramatic turnaround in attitudes" within the 
alliance, which for months has been critical of the U.N. mission and at odds 
with its senior commanders for refusing to sanction NATO air strikes against 
increasingly bold Bosnian Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs, who now control roughly 70% of Bosnia, have repeatedly 
violated U.N.-declared "safe areas" and weapons-exclusion zones, taken hundreds 
of U.N. peacekeepers hostage and killed a Bangladeshi soldier earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While alliance sources did not rule out the possibility of additional troops 
for the U.N. force, they did stress that there will be no pressure to change 
the peacekeepers' present mandate, which is primarily to escort humanitarian 
aid deliveries and patrol the six U.N.-designated safe areas and two 
weapons-exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Any specific recommendations emerging from the Hague meeting would have to be 
endorsed by the United Nations before being implemented, alliance officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed to be several reasons for the NATO about-face: 
</P>
<P>
 * Only as they began to face the cold reality of a U.N. force withdrawal did 
the alliance countries realize both what a humiliating defeat that would be for 
the international community and what a potentially disastrous television 
spectacle it would provide if a withdrawal became disorderly or if a desperate 
civilian population, facing starvation, tried to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nations not directly involved in Bosnia, including the United States, 
understood more clearly that, despite their glaring shortcomings and the 
barrage of criticism leveled against them, the U.N. peacekeepers were 
delivering humanitarian aid successfully in many areas of Bosnia -- areas where 
people might not survive without it. The U.N. mission is also credited with 
helping prevent the war from spreading elsewhere in the volatile Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 * For NATO, a push to strengthen the U.N. force offers a way to rekindle its 
present chilly relations with the world body and prove it can engage 
constructively in peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance for the United Nations and NATO to work together positively," a 
senior U.S. official commented. It is also an opportunity to ease tensions 
within the alliance itself between countries contributing to the U.N. mission 
such as France and Britain and those, such as the United States, that have 
consistently pressed for greater use of NATO air power. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more important, the U.S.-French proposal aimed at improving the 
efficiency of the U.N. force would also be ideal if a withdrawal became 
inevitable. It would provide an air and land escape route out of Sarajevo and 
reposition small, remote units closer to command centers.

 "It is useful because it can be used for both scenarios, even if the second 
(withdrawal) is more remote," commented Italy's defense minister, Cesare 
Previti.

 While the United States has no ground troops in Bosnia currently, President 
Clinton has agreed to provide more than 20,000, or about half the NATO forces 
expected to be needed to carry out a successful rescue of the U.N. 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has stressed that U.S. participation would depend on three conditions: 
American troops must be under NATO command, with no U.N. control; the force 
must be large enough to "intimidate" any Bosnian Serb attempt to stop it, and 
Congress must support it. More on Bosnia

CARTER WEIGHS BOSNIA TRIP AT REQUEST OF SERB WARLORD; BALKANS: FORMER PRESIDENT 
WILL MEDIATE IF RADOVAN KARADZIC KEEPS PROMISES TO EASE TENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter said Wednesday that he will visit 
Bosnia-Herzegovina at the invitation of Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic 
to try to mediate an end to the bloody Balkan war -- provided Karadzic follows 
through with a six-point plan to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter told Cable News Network that, if he makes the trip, he will not "take 
sides" in the war but will listen to the views of both the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government and Karadzic's Serbian insurgents, who have seized more than 70% of 
the territory of the former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
 That evenhanded approach contrasts with the official policy of the Clinton 
Administration, which regards Bosnia's Serbs as the primary aggressors in the 
conflict and considers the government and its supporters to be the victims. The 
Administration has accused the Serbs of a long list of war crimes stemming from 
their policy of "ethnic cleansing," a program of murder, torture and 
intimidation intended to force non-Serbs out of areas under Serbian control. 
</P>
<P>
 In a CNN interview, Karadzic said he outlined to Carter a six-point plan 
intended to ease the crisis. It includes an immediate cease-fire in the 
Sarajevo area, along with pledges to end the harassment of U.N. relief 
operations, release detained U.N. troops, free Bosnian government soldiers 
younger than 19, permit the reopening of Sarajevo's airport and guarantee human 
rights in areas under Serbian control. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said that he will accept Karadzic's invitation if the Serbian forces 
keep those promises, which he described as "a step in the right direction and 
an improvement on his position over the past few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Karadzic assured me that all of the tangible moves would be made 
immediately and then the world could see for itself that he was indeed going to 
honor the things that he had committed to do," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse written statement, the White House expressed skepticism that 
Carter's intervention would be enough to settle the conflict that has bedeviled 
the international community for almost three years. But it welcomed Carter's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we are skeptical about the Bosnian Serbs' intentions, if the steps 
outlined by Karadzic are implemented, they would help reduce tensions and ease 
the humanitarian situation in Bosnia," the White House said. "The next step 
would be agreement among the parties on a countrywide cease-fire and renewed 
negotiations on a political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will give Carter up-to-the-minute intelligence information 
about Karadzic's compliance with his promises, a senior Administration official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see how things happen on the ground," the official said. "We will 
be in a position to inform former President Carter of the implementation of 
Karadzic's commitments. Carter wants to see if Karadzic makes good on the 
promises." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said Carter told Clinton that he will make the trip only if the 
Bosnian Serbs keep their pledge and "President Clinton thinks that is a very 
prudent course." 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic said: "It is a good opportunity to discuss the situation and confirm 
that now we are just at about the time to do some breakthrough. I do hope we 
will have President Carter here to visit Serb and Muslim sides very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The intervention is the third by Carter in less than a year in areas of 
diplomacy that usually are the exclusive sphere of the White House and the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two previous situations, in North Korea and Haiti, the former President 
negotiated directly with dictators whom the U.S. government was trying to 
isolate and exclude from normal diplomatic discourse. Both times, Carter 
defused potentially serious crises, although critics said he agreed to 
concessions that the Administration had earlier refused to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his two earlier diplomatic efforts, Carter returned with words of 
praise for North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, who died shortly afterward, and 
Haiti's military ruler, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. The former President said he had 
invited Cedras -- denounced by Clinton as a tyrant and a murderer -- to teach 
Carter's Sunday school class at the Plains, Ga., Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter operates in a twilight area between private activism and official 
diplomacy. His status as a former President brings substantial prestige to his 
activities, sometimes allowing him to make deals that would not be possible 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said that, if he goes to Bosnia, he will have no official standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any portfolio. . . ." he said. "If I should go to Sarajevo . . . 
it would be representing the Carter Center, not representing the U.S. 
government. I have not been asked to be an official emissary of the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he does not plan to negotiate independently but instead will urge 
Karadzic to accept the peace plan outlined by the United States, Russia, 
Britain, France and Germany -- known as the Contact Group -- which would 
partition the country between the Serbs and a federation of the government and 
the Bosnian Croats. That plan would give 51% of the territory to the 
Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Serbs, who now hold more than 70%. The 
plan has already been accepted by the Bosnian government and the Croats.

COLLOR AIDE GETS 7 YEARS IN BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after clearing former President Fernando Collor de Mello of corruption, 
the Supreme Court threw the book at his top aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The court voted unanimously late Tuesday to convict Paulo Cesar Farias, the 
high-living treasurer of Collor's 1989 presidential campaign, of falsifying 
official documents. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and fined 21,000 
reals, or about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight judges also convicted three Farias employees of the same charge, 
handing down prison terms ranging from 14 to 28 months. Two other employees 
were acquitted, and Collor's personal secretary, Claudio Vieira, was cleared of 
charges of corruption and obstruction of justice.

BERLUSCONI'S GOVERNMENT MAY NOT SURVIVE THE YEAR; ITALY: A DAY AFTER THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S INTERROGATION BY JUDGES, A COALITION PARTNER BREAKS RANKS IN 
PARLIAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a heady spring of change and promise, he vaulted to power almost 
effortlessly, bringing new ideas, plans and promises to a country dispirited by 
cronyism and political corruption. Now, seven months later, Silvio Berlusconi's 
days in power seem numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after magistrates interrogated the prime minister in a bribery case 
involving his Fininvest business empire -- "a spectacle of injustice," he 
snapped -- Berlusconi's right-wing coalition splintered in Parliament on 
Wednesday as support for his leadership eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 Today many Berlusconi allies and enemies alike arise convinced that the 
government that promised Italians a brighter future may not live out the year. 
"The Berlusconi chapter is closed. . . . We think the government is finished," 
said Marco Formentini, mayor of Milan and a nominal Berlusconi ally. "It's time 
to think of a new political alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Formentini represents the Northern League, a populist-federalist party that 
had been a pillar of Berlusconi's coalition. On Wednesday, the League broke 
with the government, voting with the opposition for formation of a special 
commission to oversee a reorganization of Italian broadcasting. Berlusconi's 
$7-billion-a-year interests include ownership of three of Italy's seven 
national television channels. 
</P>
<P>
 League supporters exchanged shouts and abuse Wednesday on the Parliament floor 
with legislators of Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the National Alliance, its 
extreme-right-wing stablemate. "The moment of truth is coming," said Alliance 
leader Gianfranco Fini. 
</P>
<P>
 An atmosphere of political crisis hung over chilly, polluted streets around 
the downtown Parliament on Wednesday night as politicians maneuvered in search 
of a fulcrum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, the Senate is likely to approve Berlusconi's austerity 
1995 budget; it must pass by year's end. Once that is done, Berlusconi says he 
will ask for a vote of confidence, a move that could bring down his government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old Milan entrepreneur emerged from an eight-hour session with 
magistrates in Milan on Tuesday in a cold fury. The magistrates believe he may 
have known of about $205,000 in bribes allegedly paid by Fininvest to tax 
inspectors in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no shred of paper or any person to affirm that I ordered any illegal 
acts or was aware of any in conducting my businesses," Berlusconi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming their inquiries are politically motivated, the government is dueling 
with judges who have led a corruption probe that has ensnared more than 3,000 
business leaders, public officials and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against me and my government there is a plot whose vastness and intensity 
could be compared to a coup d'etat," Berlusconi complained after meeting the 
judges. Conspirators, he said, "want a crisis, and they are working so that 
things go badly with the sole purpose of getting rid of me."

ETHIOPIA COURT DESCRIBES SLAYING OF EMPEROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Ethiopian court described Wednesday how feudal Emperor Haile Selassie was 
"strangled in his bed most cruelly" by Marxist usurpers nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors of Ethiopia's royal family say the trials of ousted dictator 
Mengistu Haile Mariam and 66 of his military deputies that began Tuesday are 
laying to rest some of the ghosts of the bloody revolution but that the last 
act in the story is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengistu remains in exile in Zimbabwe and will be tried in absentia. Many of 
the accused could face the death penalty if found guilty of killing thousands 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor's mysterious death in August, 1975, nearly a year after he was 
deposed, has long been recorded in popular legend but has never been described 
officially. The charges allege the execution was ordered in writing by 
Mengistu's men.

COUNCIL IN NORTHWEST APPROVES PLAN TO SAVE SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Setting the stage for a drastic shift in Northwest water policy, an 
influential planning council Wednesday approved a $177-million plan to help 
migrating salmon in the Columbia and Snake rivers on their way to the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next spring, federal river managers will "draw down" the volume of 
certain reservoirs to unprecedented levels in hopes of speeding young salmon 
downstream and out to sea.Water would also be spilled over the top to lure the 
fish away from the deadly churning turbines at some dams. The draw-downs would 
be phased in over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under court order to devise a strategy to save the region's salmon from 
extinction, the Portland-based Northwest Power Planning Council -- with two 
representatives each from Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington -- voted, 6 to 
2, on proposals to help replenish the once-bountiful salmon runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits to the fish, as yet unproven, could come at the expense of the 
system's other water users -- industry, agriculture, recreation, navigation and 
hydroelectric rate-payers. The program would cost the Bonneville Power 
Administration $177 million a year -- $57 million in lost hydropower revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are already incurring costs for not taking action," said council 
chairman Angus Duncan. He pointed to the collapse of the West Coast salmon 
fishery, which was closed this year off Washington and restricted off Oregon 
and Northern California.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AUCTION TODAY: Thomas W. Hayes, the county's chief financial adviser, 
announced that $1 billion of the safest remaining securities will be auctioned 
this morning. He said that the auction will be the first step toward 
restructuring the county's investments and bringing badly needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * TASK FORCE: Business leaders announced creation of a high-powered team to 
help the county improve its image and restore its financial health. Executives 
from Taco Bell and Rockwell Corp. are among those taking active roles. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREAMLINING GOVERNMENT: Supervisor Roger R. Stanton is forming a task force 
to study cutting down on the size of Orange County government. Peer Swan, Swan 
chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District, said such a move "could be the 
silver lining in this cloud." 
</P>
<P>
 * QUICK CONSENT: County records show that the Board of Supervisors 
rubber-stamped requests for more than $1.3 billion in notes, even after 
then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron's investments had been publicly questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHO'LL GET PAID? Anxious creditors lined up for a shot at the bankrupt 
investment fund at the U.S. Trustees office in Los Angeles. They sought spots 
on the creditors committees, which provide the best opportunity to represent a 
creditor's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEALTH SERVICES: Officials said that preventive health services may have to 
be put on hold while other crucial services, such as immunizations and AIDS 
services, take priority.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SERVICES RANKED FOR POSSIBLE TRIMMING; FINANCES: 
COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON WHAT IS VITAL AND WHAT IS 
NONESSENTIAL. MANY HEALTH CONCERNS ARE GIVEN TOP PRIORITY.

 The triage has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis prevention, trash disposal, restaurant inspections -- these are 
services Orange County department heads say the public cannot do without. But 
well-child visits, outreach to prevent mental illness and improving landfills 
may fall by the wayside in the county's worst-ever fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials reluctantly prepared Wednesday to take the paring knife to 
nonessential services, revealing for the first time what some of those services 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
 A County Board of Supervisors resolution approved late Monday ordered all 
department heads to prioritize their contracts with thousands of providers -- 
from toilet paper vendors to nonprofit agencies that care for abused children 
and addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using as criteria what is of most benefit to the community -- and 
keeping the community out of danger," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, county director 
of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads said they must prepare for a worst-case scenario. County 
administrative office staff met late Wednesday afternoon to "start the 
countywide review" of the emergency lists, said Murray Cable, director of the 
county's Integrated Waste Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released Wednesday, Supervisor Roger R. Stanton suggested that an 
operations management team be formed to coordinate all day-to-day county 
services and facilitate the "health, safety and welfare of the public." He 
suggested that the team be headed by Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez with assistance 
from a host of county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Low priority items on preliminary lists prepared by administrators -- which 
have yet to be approved by top officials -- range from furniture for the 
Superior Court to a $35-million project to close a mothballed county landfill. 
Stallworth said certain prevention services, such as well-child checkups at 
public health clinics, fell toward the bottom of his preliminary list. Such 
exams "could be done by other clinicians in town and . . . could be delayed 
(with) minimal hazard to the community," Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Infectious diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as food inspections 
at restaurants and immunizations, have been assigned top priority, Stallworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable that the community health will not be jeopardized," he said 
-- although he and his employees are not as comfortable with the "big unknown" 
of what will be cut and by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, county mental health Director Tim Mullins said his list, completed 
about 2 p.m. Wednesday, has near the top such things as medications and 
involuntary detention for the severely mentally ill, as well as support and 
care for patients in residential facilities. Prevention services for youths 
were deemed less important. Mullins said drug and alcohol services receive the 
bulk of their funding from the state and federal governments, so they may not 
be as affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins and other administrators said they were not asked to make 
recommendations on layoffs, but merely to prioritize programs or services. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable, of the waste management district, said he submitted a list to the 
county administrative office that calls for his agency to cancel or suspend 
hundreds of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that need to be done in order to bury the refuse and to protect 
the public's health and safety are the things that will be done," Cable said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any contracts for planning or reports or plans for building at the three open 
landfills are in limbo, as is a five-year plan to close the mothballed Santiago 
Canyon landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contracts for archeology and paleontology in case we run across a 
fossil," he said. "Under law, we're still going to need to bring someone out to 
do that. . . . We will start that again, but in these (emergency) conditions, I 
don't need to have someone come out and look at a whale bone." More on

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; PLANS TO OPEN NEW SCHOOL STALLED; EDUCATION: 
DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO OPERATE FOOTHILL RANCH ELEMENTARY'S 
SPRAWLING HIGH-TECH CAMPUS. CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE TO USE PORTABLE CLASSROOMS. 
</P>

 Jenna Scherman, 10, never thought her fifth-grade year would be marred by 
something so strange and hard to understand as a bond crisis or that the word 
depressed would ever enter her vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, her world has collided with the adult world, leaving her and her 
brother and sister -- and 367 classmates -- angry and in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenna and her fellow students, as well as 14 teachers and the principal, 
learned this week that they had become victims of the Orange County bond 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 They were looking forward to moving to the sprawling new Foothill Ranch 
Elementary School on Jan. 3, but its opening has been delayed indefinitely 
because the Saddleback Valley Unified School District does not have enough 
money to run the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just so mad," Jenna said at her family's home in this unincorporated 
community near Lake Forest and the Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park. "Everyone is 
so sad. Someone should do something! All the kids are so depressed now, because 
everyone was so excited, and now, they've taken it away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, Jenna, her sister, Katie, 8, and brother, Robert, 5, have 
attended school in portable trailers on the campus of Portola Hills Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 That unpopular reality will continue for the foreseeable future because about 
$62 million in district funds were in the county's greatly diminished 
investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Wong, Foothill Ranch principal, said the district "just doesn't have 
the money to operate another school site" as long as its funding is under a 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Foothill parents Tuesday, Wong listed a second reason for 
the delay: "The funds to make final payment to the contractor are held up by 
the bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Wong backed away from that assessment. Although the district 
owes the contractor more than $300,000, Wong said he has received 90% of his 
fee and will get the rest in two soon-to-be-paid installments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we continue to stay at Portola Hills, it saves considerably on operating 
costs -- electricity, janitorial services, whatever," she said. "And until this 
is sorted out, we'll just have to endure it." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials could not be reached for comment, saying through 
intermediaries that they were meeting with county officials to seek at least a 
short-term solution in hopes of opening the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jenna Scherman is trying to muster a can-do optimism despite 
the sadness and confusion. She and most of her schoolmates have taken to 
raising funds themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every little bit helps," she said. "We can always do bake sales and 
carwashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said a second-grade class began collecting money during recess Wednesday, 
raising $1.39. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another student in that class is very perplexed," the principal said. "He 
wants to know why the county would be so foolish as to throw all of its money 
into a 'pool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As confusing as the crisis is, Jenna has no trouble finding the emotion that 
expresses it best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry," she said. "It's really complicated for the little kids, because 
they don't know what's going on, and it's complicated for me too. I just think 
whoever screwed this up -- whoever did this -- should be . . . Well, he should 
be severely punished for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Katie, hates the delay, saying that the Foothill-bound students at 
Portola have never felt that they truly belong -- and for that reason cannot 
wait to get to the new place, a jewel of a campus capable of housing 650 
students. At the top of a steep hill, the school offers a stunning view beyond 
Newport Beach to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students had been looking forward to the opening -- not only 
because the school is within walking distance of most homes, meaning no more 
busing -- but also because of its high-tech features. It will have a computer 
network linking all classrooms and a multimedia library center. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard about the bankruptcy, I got all sad, because I wanted to go to 
the new school more than anything," Katie said. 
</P>
<P>
 And 5-year-old Robert? "I feel the same way my sisters do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other parents affected by the news, Carol Scherman, 38, worries about the 
growing pessimism and lack of trust in otherwise well-cared-for kids who now 
know the meaning of a broken promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nothing to do with this crisis, and to see the children -- especially 
-- be hit with this, was difficult to swallow," she said. "This was going to be 
a big week at school, but the news just kind of crushed everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other parents, Scherman is most angry at the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors, whom she vows to remember come election time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so disappointed at the lack of fiduciary responsibility on the part of 
the supervisors," she said. "It's very hard as a citizen, a homeowner and a 
businesswoman to fathom the thought that they didn't know what was going on 
with the finances in the county. I just can't buy what I've been reading in the 
papers, that it was the result of one person. I think it's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenna does too, so much so that, as soon as she's able, she may run for 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "You bet, when I grow up, if this is still going on, I'll try to do something 
about it," she said. "I couldn't do any worse than they have, now could I?"

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; AGENCY HEADS SORT SPENDING OPTIONS; OPERATIONS: 
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS TRASH PICKUP, TB PREVENTION AND RESTAURANT 
INSPECTIONS ARE DEEMED ESSENTIAL. VASQUEZ HEADS NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The triage has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis testing, trash disposal, restaurant inspections -- these are 
services county administrators say the public can't do without. But well-child 
visits, outreach to prevent mental illness, and landfill improvements may fall 
by the wayside as the county scrambles to recover from fiscal disaster. Top 
Orange County officials reluctantly prepared Wednesday to take the paring knife 
to non-essential services, revealing for the first time what some of those 
services might be. 
</P>
<P>
 A Board of Supervisors resolution approved Monday ordered all department heads 
to prioritize their contracts with thousands of providers, honoring only those 
that were "necessary to protect health welfare or safety of county residents" 
or prevent economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using as criteria what is of most benefit to the community -- and 
keeping the community out of danger," said Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's 
director of public health, who was still working on his priority list 
Wednesday. Department heads -- some of whom had already turned in their 
recommendations -- said they are preparing for a worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county supervisors Wednesday created an Operations Management 
Team, headed by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, to make day-to-day decisions and 
help determine where to pare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will expedite communication," said Vasquez, whose team includes Sheriff 
Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Health Care Agency Director Tom 
Uram. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said it was not clear when all the departments would submit their 
lists to the team or when final determinations would be made on which contracts 
to slash. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday, Supervisor William G. Steiner recommended in a memo 
to the county's bankruptcy attorney that $2.9 million be paid to more than 100 
organizations that do business with the county, providing everything from 
foster care to abandoned infants to inpatient care for the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor, who was appointed as liaison to nonprofit agencies, noted that 
most of the money could be billed to federal, state and other funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-priority items on preliminary lists prepared by administrators -- which 
have yet to be approved by top officials -- range from furniture for Superior 
Court to a $35-million project to close a mothballed county landfill. 
Stallworth said certain prevention services, such as well-child checkups, would 
fall toward the bottom of his list. Such exams "could be done by other 
clinicians in town and . . . could be delayed (with) minimal hazard to the 
community," Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Infectious diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, as well as immunizations 
and food inspections at restaurants, have been assigned top priority, 
Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable that the community health will not be jeopardized," he said 
-- although he and his staff are less comfortable with the "big unknown" of 
what will be cut and by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, county Mental Health Director Timothy P. Mullins said his list, 
completed about 2 p.m. Wednesday, has near the top such things as medications 
and involuntary detention for the severely mentally ill, as well as support and 
care of patients in residential facilities. Prevention services for youths, for 
example, were deemed less important. He said drug abuse services receive the 
bulk of their funding from the state and federal governments, so they may not 
be as heavily affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins and Stallworth said they were not asked to make recommendations on 
layoffs, but merely to prioritize programs or services. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray Cable, director of the county's Integrated Waste Management District, 
said he submitted a list to the county administrative office that would suspend 
80% of his agency's contracts and would cancel most of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that need to be done in order to bury the refuse and to protect 
the public's health and safety are the things that will be done," Cable said, 
adding that other contracts might be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Any contracts for planning or reports, or plans for building at the three open 
landfills, are in limbo, as is a five-year plan to close the mothballed 
Santiago Canyon landfill. Only services that will keep refuse coming into the 
landfills and enable the department to continue earning money, and the 
regulatory activities key to protecting the air and ground water, will be 
provided, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contracts for archeology and paleontology in case we run across a 
fossil," he said. "Under law, we're still going to need to bring someone out to 
do that. . . . We will start that again, but in these (emergency) conditions, I 
don't need to have someone come out and look at a whale bone." 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors who supply the county with equipment remained in limbo Wednesday, more 
than a week after the bankruptcy filing. Nonprofit contractors remained anxious 
as well about when -- and whether -- they would be paid, although some were 
hopeful that Steiner's recommendation would help their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies dependent on state and federal dollars administered by the county 
said they could not afford to wait much longer. And county department heads 
said they are increasingly worried that state and federal dollars they receive 
may be jeopardized if they can't come up with the required matching county 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes beyond two months, we are going to face having to close our 
doors to be able to survive as a corporation," said Art Amidon, executive 
director of Roque Center Inc., which provides detoxification services and a 
long-term alcohol recovery home for 104 clients. That agency was on Steiner's 
list as one that ought to be paid the $56,479 it is due.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; LITTLE FISH HOOKED IN BOND POOL; CRISIS: AGENCIES WITH 
PROGRAMS SUCH AS KILLING BUGS AND GIVING PRESENTS TO NEEDY CHILDREN ARE CAUGHT 
IN THE FINANCIAL FIASCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County is learning about the long reach of county government as its 
financial fiasco unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with schools and fire departments, little-known agencies that clean 
cemeteries, catch rats and distribute Christmas presents to needy children are 
caught up in the county's financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may be shocked to find that the county's Fish and Game Propagation 
program has $107,722 invested in the county fund. Jail commissaries are owed 
$843,955.36. And the Irvine Child Care Project is unable to get its $313,621 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality improvement, victim assistance, racial sensitivity training for 
police officers -- programs that often are taken for granted -- are now 
threatened with extermination. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes. Exterminators are endangered too. The county's mosquito-abatement 
program is listed as a half-million-dollar partner in the swooning investment 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Operation Santa Claus got out just in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The program run by Orange County's Social Services Agency has given Christmas 
gifts to poor children for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of its county connection, some of the program's operating cash is 
sunk under a sea of red ink this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of its cash is paralyzed, however, thanks to a bit of creative 
bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every summer, when we do our planning to figure out how much our expenses are 
going to be and what we're going to do, we transfer enough out of that fund to 
the Orangewood" Children's Home, said Bob Griffith, chief deputy director of 
the Social Services Agency, which runs Operation Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said it is simpler to write checks on the Orangewood account than to 
go through the county for every dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, roughly $30,000 that Operation Santa Claus needs for hundreds of 
bicycles and gift-wrapped toys is safe; only $10,000 remains in the county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, few county agencies and little-known programs have experienced such a 
fiscal Christmas miracle, which must please the rats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never asked if I wanted to be in that fund," grumped Gil Challet, head 
of the Vector Control District, which eradicates Orange County mosquitoes, 
gnats, rats and other vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 Challet was surprised that his district had nearly $2 million in the county 
treasury, a figure that begins to approach his yearlong operating budget, he 
said with alarm. The county also lists more than $500,000 that the Emergency 
Mosquito Abatement program has in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Challet was especially irked because he had no say in the matter. His 
agency's funding is automatically handled by the treasurer, as is every county 
agency's. Which is why Griffith was having a stare-down Wednesday with two 
architects who wanted to know how Vector Control intended to pay for ongoing 
construction of a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Human Relations Commission, the county's budget crisis is just 
beginning to hit home. The people who document hate crimes and teach racial 
sensitivity to police departments are in jeopardy because they are affiliated 
with the county's Community Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "All managers lost our cost-of-living increases," said Rusty Kennedy, 
executive director of the commission. "So I lost that this week. We had a 
freeze on all purchasing, freeze on all hiring, freeze on all extensions of 
hiring, a freeze on all non-essential everything. Our orders are not to spend 
anything you don't have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Which so far means: "No Xeroxing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kennedy and others must wonder if limiting use of the copy machine is just 
the first step down a slippery road, especially for agencies that aren't 
high-profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Operation Santa Claus, the volunteers look at Kennedy's and other 
county agencies and think: There but for the grace of St. Nick. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a surprise to a lot of people how many community organizations 
are tied to the county and rely on the county," Griffith said. "I'm not 
surprised, because I've been involved with it a long time. I know." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Small Agencies, Big Concerns 
</P>
<P>
 Several smaller public programs--agencies that do everything from giving 
Christmas gifts to the poor to killing mosquitoes--have money tied up in Orange 
County's bankrupt investment pool. The future of some of the programs is in 
jeopardy. Here is a sampling of the smaller investors: Fund: Amount in pool 
Victim/Witness Assistance: $723,822 Emergency Mosquito Abatement: $584,313 
Irvine Child-Care Project: $313,621 Alternate Dispute Resolution: $277,695 Air 
Quality Improvement: $243,762 Public Guardian: $232,384 Coast Community College 
Child Development: $190,587 Fish and Game Propagation: $107,722 Human Relations 
Commission: $26,071 Operation Santa Claus: $9,996 Santa Ana Gardens: $8,109

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON FENDS OFF CHRISTMAS GRINCH; NOTEBOOK: THE FORMER 
TREASURER-TAX COLLECTOR SENDS CARDS AS USUAL, BUT THE COUNTY'S FISCAL PINCH IS 
FELT BY OTHER YULE EVENTS, ALONG WITH SOME MORE EARTHLY ACTIVITIES.

 Season's greetings: He may be holed up in his Santa Ana home. And he may be 
refusing interviews after resigning Dec. 7 as the county's treasurer-tax 
collector. But one thing's for sure -- Robert L. Citron didn't lose the holiday 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of a financial debacle largely created by his risky investment 
strategy, Citron still mailed out season's greetings last week to county 
workers and officials. Wishing recipients "Happy Holidays," the simple card 
showed Citron and his wife, Terry, standing in their living room next to a 
small Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Said County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who received one of the Citron 
cards: "It was lovely." 
</P>
<P>
 Bathroom backup: For students in the Rancho Santiago Community College 
District, the county budget crisis has transformed bathrooms into an unwelcome 
hangout. Students have been waiting in long lines all week after a funding 
freeze left the district unable to reopen most campus restrooms, which had been 
shut down for a construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who have been working bathrooms, it's been rough to have people 
bombarding their buildings and lining up," said Chancellor Vivian Blevins. 
"There's always someone in there and always someone waiting to get in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief is in sight, however. Exams are over this week, and the campus will 
soon be empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Blevins: "People have been telling me, 'Vivian, there's a lot of things 
we can do without, but we can't live without the bathrooms.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Catering to the elite: With cutbacks, layoffs and hiring freezes looming for 
county government, Salomon Bros., the county's financial adviser, has 
nevertheless been feeding at the public trough this week. For three straight 
days, the county has served up catered lunches of sandwiches and pasta to the 
financial trouble-shooters. "The bankrupt county is buying them lunch," said 
one county staffer of the meals billed to taxpayers. "It's annoying (the) 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
 A Christmas carol: Unlike Christmases past when throngs of carolers cheered 
holiday travelers at John Wayne Airport, Christmas present will probably see 
just one Yuletide singing group at the airport. Because of the county financial 
disaster, the airport, which is owned and operated by the county, has canceled 
its holiday performances. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, the airport divided about $3,000 among about a dozen 
community caroling groups to lift holiday spirits before takeoffs and after 
landings. 
</P>
<P>
 But not this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the county's current financial crisis," said Airport Manager Jan 
Mittermeier, "I do not feel it would be prudent to underwrite the performances 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one group has said it will perform even without the airport's 
traditional stipend. The Golden West Carolers of Golden West College in 
Huntington Beach are scheduled to roam the terminals singing seasonal favorites 
from 4 to 6 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartening to see people in Orange County rolling up their sleeves and 
making sure the holidays are still pleasant," said Pat Ware, an airport 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 O Christmas tree: The County Treecyling Program, which turns discarded 
Christmas trees into mulch, has fallen to the county cutback ax. County 
officials whacked the annual environmental undertaking, calling it a 
"nonessential seasonal program." The program was scheduled for Jan. 7 and 8 at 
Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley. Most cities, however, are 
expected to continue their Christmas tree recycling programs, said county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern cold front: Placentia resident Dale Goodman has found herself the 
target of jabs from East Coasters this week following Orange County's financial 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People back east are calling me, laughing," said the 52-year-old who recently 
failed in her bid for election to the City Council. "They say, 'Sure, you have 
good weather, but we're fiscally sound.' "

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; O.C. CAN RETAIN CRITICAL BOFA SERVICES; COURTS: BANKRUPTCY 
JUDGE SAYS COUNTY CAN KEEP PRIOR ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING $200-MILLION LINE OF 
CREDIT AND AGREEMENT THAT WILL HELP IT MAKE GOOD ON PAYROLL FRIDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County received court approval Wednesday to maintain vital banking 
services from Bank of America, including a $200-million credit line and an 
agreement that will enable the county to make its $16.4-million payroll Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan allows Orange County to 
enjoy the same banking services it did before it filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6, 
providing some measure of stability as it focuses on solving its financial 
crisis, attorneys for the county said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's decision came after the county and the San Francisco-based bank made an 
emergency joint request, just two days before payroll checks to county and 
school employees were due to be issued. Without Ryan's approval, county 
officials would have been hard-pressed to make this week's payroll on time, 
possibly having to hand-write checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a mess," said county bankruptcy attorney Lee Bogdanoff. 
"We have been using this (automated payroll) system for a long time and it made 
sense to keep using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ruling will help the county with day-to-day operating needs, the 
bank, which is also an underwriter and trustee for various county bond issues, 
has not yet offered any additional credit. County sources had indicated that 
Bank of America was considering other means to help the county, but attorneys 
for the bank Wednesday declined comment about any such plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ruling was made on an interim basis by Ryan, who will revisit the 
matter at a Jan. 4 hearing. None of the dozen or so attorneys in the court, 
some of whom represented investors in the county's troubled portfolio, voiced 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that this petition is in the best interests of the debtor 
(Orange County), that it was brought in good faith, and that the debtor would 
suffer irreparable harm if the court didn't approve the motion," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and attorneys for the bank told Ryan in court and in court 
papers that maintaining banking services was critical to allowing the county to 
run at least some of its operations smoothly in the midst of the financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these facilities cannot be continued with the bank, the consequences could 
be disastrous," said the county's acting treasurer, Matthew Raabe. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the bank, which has had a longstanding relationship with the 
county, said the bank is not seeking any advantages, such as extra collateral 
or a release from potential suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bank wants to help out the county so it can focus on the larger issues of 
this case," said Bank of America attorney Theodore C. Albert. "We are acting in 
good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan also approved an existing agreement that allows the public to pay certain 
county fines and fees by credit card that can add up to tens of thousands of 
dollars daily, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement about banking services is virtually the same as the one that 
existed before the bankruptcy, but the bank took the precaution of adding a 
condition that it can pull out of the arrangement at the end of the bankruptcy 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank could also terminate the relationship with the county if the county 
were to give a higher priority to paying its debts to another creditor, said 
Bank of America attorney Harold Lichterman. 
</P>
<P>
 As before, all debts incurred by the county in using the bank's services and 
credit line would be due on the same day, Lichterman explained to Ryan, so a 
termination of the agreement would not leave the county with more than a day's 
worth of debts.

FBI RECOVERS S.F. RETURN ADDRESSEE FROM BOMB THAT KILLED EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pipe bomb that killed a New Jersey advertising executive listed a return 
addressee of "H.C. Wickel," and the FBI on Wednesday pleaded for the public's 
help in identifying the name. 
</P>
<P>
 The typed return label showed Wickel in the Department of Economics at San 
Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one by that name has ever taught or been enrolled at the school, said 
Daniel Hagberg, chief postal inspector in San Francisco, and the Unabomb Task 
Force asked for calls from anyone with information about the name. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where this case is going to be solved -- through public involvement," 
said Jim Freeman, head of the FBI's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomber has killed two people and injured 22 others in 15 bombings since 
1978. The two bombs in 1993 were mailed in Sacramento and had Sacramento State 
University listed as the return address. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Snabel, head of the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said 
laboratory analysis of the bomb that killed Thomas J. Mosser on Saturday 
revealed that it was about the size of two videotapes stacked together.

VICTIM OF BOTCHED RAID TO GET $2.75 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government agreed Wednesday to pay $2.75 million to a business 
executive who was shot and seriously wounded when federal drug agents stormed 
his suburban house in a botched pre-dawn raid based on a false tip from an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement before a federal judge closes an extraordinary case in which 
the U.S. attorney's office took the unusual step of admitting liability in the 
lawsuit by Donald Carlson, 43, a computer company executive from Poway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This resolution adequately compensates Mr. Carlson for his injuries and the 
horror he suffered while it protects the taxpayer from the risks of additional 
litigation," said Alan D. Bersin, the U.S. attorney in San Diego. Bersin 
inherited the case when he was appointed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is the highest in recent memory in a lawsuit against federal law 
enforcement nationwide and is comparable to monetary settlements of recent 
misconduct cases in Southern California involving local police, according to 
lawyers on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors admitted liability, they blame the informant, Ronnie 
Edmond, who was convicted Nov. 30 on charges of making false statements to 
federal agents in the 1992 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by Bersin as a sophisticated con man, Edmond had worked with police 
in Florida before becoming an informant for Operation Alliance, a multi-agency 
task force based at the U.S.-Mexico border. Edmond gave U.S. Customs Service 
agents a wild and detailed account of international drug trafficking and 
purported corruption, claiming that a South American cartel was using Carlson's 
house to store several tons of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 26, 1992, agents executed a search warrant based on that tip -- 
although colleagues had raised serious questions about Edmond's credibility and 
at one point dismissed him as an informant. 
</P>
<P>
 When the raiding team battered down his door, Carlson -- thinking he was being 
attacked by criminals -- armed himself with a pistol and fired, wounding an 
agent slightly. The ensuing gunfire hit Carlson in the arm, chest and thigh. He 
spent six weeks in intensive care, incurred $361,000 in medical expenses and 
suffered permanent injuries, including lung damage and a paralyzed diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson's attorney praised the decision of Bersin, who became U.S. attorney 
last year, to settle the case. But the lawyer, R.J. Coughlan, alleged that the 
agents' use of the informant was extremely reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he held out the carrot of the largest cocaine haul in the history of San 
Diego, they were blinded," Coughlan said. "The downside of the settlement is 
that this case will not receive a complete public airing."

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; FEDERAL INQUIRY FOCUSING ON 3 MERRILL LYNCH BROKERS; 
FINANCE: TIES BETWEEN O.C. OFFICIALS AND ADVISERS ARE UNDER SCRUTINY AS 
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION BROADENS ITS PROBE. BROKERAGE SAYS IT ACTED 
PROFESSIONALLY.

<P>
 Federal investigators have focused their attention on three brokers at Merrill 
Lynch, an investment bank that has handled millions of dollars worth of bond 
transactions for Orange County's troubled investment fund, legal papers served 
Wednesday indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, played by far the biggest role 
in selling derivatives and other exotic financial instruments to the county and 
extended $2.5 billion in credit to purchase securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating Merrill and 
broadened its probe Wednesday, issuing subpoenas for the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors, sources close to the supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC opened its inquiry into the Orange County fiscal fiasco last week, and 
officials at the New York-based brokerage were among the first to be 
subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers is also investigating the brokerage, 
in response to complaints from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters about 
campaign contributions from three Merrill executives to former Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard T. Silverman defended the firm and the 
brokers. "We believe that Merrill Lynch acted professionally and properly in 
all its dealings with Orange County," he said late Wednesday from his New 
Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
 The three brokers named in the subpoenas were Michael G. Stamenson, Debra M. 
Harris and Duane J. Canaga, each of whom gave Citron $1,000 during his 
reelection campaign last spring. All three work at Merrill's San Francisco 
office selling securities. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times computer review of campaign statements shows that the Wall Street 
giant and its employees had contributed more than $15,000 to Orange County 
supervisorial candidates from 1986 to 1992, making it the single largest 
contributor to county campaigns from the financial sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson, who has worked at Merrill Lynch since 1970, was the firm's top 
broker on municipal investments in California and the lead broker on the Orange 
County account. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 39, lives in Lafayette, Calif., and declined to comment. Canaga, 51, 
who lives in San Francisco, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson, 54, was the broker who sold San Jose high-risk investments that 
nearly led the city to file for bankruptcy a decade ago. Many of the 
investments were similar to the ones that triggered the crash of Orange 
County's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC investigators appear to be focusing on the political and financial 
relationships between county officials and their financial advisers -- and 
whether those ties may have influenced how county bonds were bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Merrill Lynch played a key role in pushing for legislation 
that Citron supported, widening the authority of counties to put local tax 
money into more exotic investments. Lobbyists for the brokerage were key 
players in the passage of at least five bills, backed by Orange County 
lawmakers and approved since 1987, that steadily deregulated the investment 
practices of treasurers such as Citron, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Orange County became the largest municipality to declare bankruptcy in 
American history, Merrill Lynch has been the only Wall Street firm that did not 
sell off the collateral it was holding for the county. As other brokerages 
dumped $11.4 billion in holdings onto the market, Merrill Lynch officials 
promised to stand by the county.

TRANSIENT LOSES HIS 2-STORY HANDMADE HOME; THOUSAND OAKS: ONE-TON STRUCTURE, 
OUTFITTED WITH REFRIGERATORS AND A TV, DRAWS SOME ADMIRATION FOR BUILDER'S 
INGENUITY, BUT IS TOWED AWAY FOR CODE VIOLATIONS.

 As onlookers winced, the two-story house on wheels that transient David M. 
Russell had hewn out of scrap wood tilted crazily before thumping onto a 
trailer to be hauled to a Thousand Oaks storage yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing gets down to legislating and micro-managing others' lives," 
said the former UCLA dental student as his makeshift home was hauled away by 
city workers Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, now homeless for the second time in 18 months, had lived secretly in 
a three-room attic apartment in a nearby office building for three years before 
being evicted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wednesday, resilient to the end, the 41-year-old man busied himself with 
weatherproofing the one-ton structure even as a city crew prepared to take it 
away from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't stand it," said Diane Bennett, who watched as the iron forks of 
a five-ton front loader gingerly angled Russell's handiwork toward the trailer. 
"I've watched him build it and have become very attached to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, the 15-foot-high patchwork of wood and ingenuity had been 
taking shape under a palm in a parking lot behind a technology firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers rolled it off company property and to the curb of a street after 
being told that the ramshackle shelter -- fitted with two small refrigerators, 
a television and two microwave ovens -- violated building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that it posed a traffic hazard on the street, city officials made 
good on their threats and hauled the ungainly structure to an impound lot, 
leaving Russell to face winter without a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a no-win situation for us," Public Works Supt. Mel Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell was alternately impassive and flustered by his sudden change of 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a damning system," he said, "you're damned if you do and you're damned 
if you don't." The structure, which began in March as a one-man lean-to and 
grew as Russell wheeled it from business park to business park, is as much a 
testament to unfettered dreams as a casualty of nonconformity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't understand why he wants to live like that," said his mother, 
68-year-old Eleanor Russell of Seal Beach. "He doesn't want to take orders. He 
wants to be his own man, his own boss. . . . But you can't always do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Though born of need, Russell's jumble of trash bin scraps soon became in his 
mind a prototype of a cabin in a schooner or a houseboat that could be produced 
on a mass scale. Then it was hauled off, recoverable only if Russell can find 
$800 in impound fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get on," he said as he gathered four shopping carts full of possessions. 
"I'll just go back to where I was before, with nothing, except whatever skills 
I've picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 His skills are considerable, according to several observers. "He's obviously a 
talented carpenter," said Deputy City Atty. Jim Friedl. "I can't see why he's 
not doing this for somebody, holding down a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, asked by an admiring observer why he did not ply his skills on the 
job market, nodded toward his two-story creation. "This is my job," he said.

GROUP SUES SCHOOL BOARD OVER PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Spencer, president of a San Fernando Valley group that supports 
Proposition 187, filed a lawsuit Wednesday charging that six members of the Los 
Angeles board of education are illegally using public funds to block the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said the board illegally used taxpayers' money to oppose the measure 
during the campaign and that the district is spending public funds in its legal 
challenge against the proposition. He said a 1976 state Supreme Court decision 
bars public institutions from taking positions on ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a taxpayer, I am being compelled to furnish contributions of money to the 
school board of Los Angeles so that they can further their pro-illegal 
immigration propaganda," said Spencer, president of Voice of Citizens Together. 
"We are committed to taking this to the ultimate conclusion. . . . These six 
board members will have to pay the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit does not include Barbara Boudreaux, who did not vote with her 
school board colleagues to challenge Proposition 187 and who has said she 
believes that the school district should not spend its money on political 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The district and other school boards have filed a lawsuit in a San Francisco 
state court challenging the provision barring illegal immigrants from attending 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Mark Slavkin denied Wednesday that the district is using 
taxpayer money illegally and said that he believes Spencer's lawsuit is without 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it ironic that he is using the court system to pursue his own 
political agenda while at the same time he is criticizing others for doing the 
same," Slavkin said. "I think this is just another diversion that has nothing 
to do with illegal immigration or improving public education." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer's group has launched a recall campaign against Slavkin, and petitions 
are expected to be distributed today, beginning the drive to collect voters' 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have maintained that board members are entitled to take 
positions on ballot measures.

FEINSTEIN OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AS VICTOR; POLITICS: ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE 
TONY MILLER PROCLAIMS SHE IS THE WINNER 'FAIRLY AND SQUARELY,' CITING NO 
EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD. HUFFINGTON STILL HAS NOT CONCEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Democrat Dianne Feinstein's election to a full term in the U.S. Senate over 
Republican Rep. Mike Huffington was officially certified Wednesday by 
California's top elections officer, who declared that she won the contest 
"fairly and squarely." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has yet to concede, saying he is investigating claims of massive 
voter fraud that may have tainted the election result. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's victory was proclaimed by acting Secretary of State Tony Miller in 
formal documents to Gov. Pete Wilson and to the clerk of the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein won by 163,564 votes out of 8.5 million cast in the Senate race Nov. 
8, Miller said. That is a margin of 1.9% -- slightly larger than at the end of 
the unofficial ballot counting in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffington has questioned the election results, Miller said 
Wednesday: "Feinstein clearly won this fairly and squarely. There is nothing to 
indicate anything to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Huffington nor any official of his campaign could be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the total count from the 58 counties gave Feinstein 3,977,065 
votes to Huffington's 3,813,501. An additional 714,410 votes were cast for four 
minor party candidates or for unofficial write-in candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's margin after the unofficial tally of votes had been 156,671. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a Democrat who is leaving office, said no evidence of any voter fraud 
has been submitted by the Huffington campaign, by the proponents of Proposition 
187 or by anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not received anything that even suggests that this election was won 
because of voter fraud. There has been a lot of huffing, but nothing 
submitted," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miller has certified Feinstein as the winner, the results presumably 
could be challenged in court if there is evidence of fraud, some election 
experts said. Also, the U.S. Constitution makes the Senate the final arbiter of 
the qualifications of its members, but no valid state election outcome has been 
overturned by the Senate in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter Feinstein-Huffington contest was the most expensive ever waged for 
any seat in Congress -- costing more than $40 million, including $27.5 million 
of Huffington's personal fortune, which had been estimated at $70 million at 
the beginning of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the San Francisco Examiner reported that Huffington and his 
wife, Arianna, have put their Santa Barbara-area mansion on the market for an 
undisclosed price. They bought the home in Montecito six years ago for $4.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Examiner speculated that the Huffingtons would move to Newport Beach, 
where they lived during much the campaign, in part because it was near 
Huffington's campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving from Texas several years ago, Huffington used his personal funds 
to finance a successful U.S. House campaign, unseating Republican incumbent 
Robert Lagomarsino in the 1992 primary. After nine months in the House, 
Huffington announced that he would run for the U.S. Senate.

HARRAH'S, TRIBE PLAN $22-MILLION CASINO; GAMBLING: THE PROJECT SHOWS MAINSTREAM 
GAMING INDUSTRY'S WILLINGNESS TO VENTURE INTO RESERVATION PARTNERSHIPS IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Following the foray of Caesars World into California Indian gaming, Harrah's 
Casinos disclosed Wednesday that it will develop a gambling hall on a 
reservation in northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrah's officials and tribal leaders of the Pala band of Mission Indians will 
formally announce plans today to build a $22-million bingo and card club casino 
on the Pala reservation, 50 miles north of San Diego and 85 miles southeast of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement reflects a growing willingness of mainstream casinos to join 
California tribes in bringing a flavor of Las Vegas to the state, rather than 
resist the spread of gambling to California as a threat to their Nevada 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also reflects efforts by gaming giants to capitalize on reservation 
gambling in California in the face of resistance to the spread of gambling 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indian gaming is an attractive area because a lot of jurisdictions voted down 
gaming (in elections) last month," Harrah's spokesman Steve Brewster said. 
"With Indian gaming, we don't have to worry about legislative procedures or 
referendums. We can go in, get the approvals, and we're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster said the Pala reservation was considered an excellent site to attract 
day-trippers because of its location on California 76 six miles east of 
Interstate 15. The San Diego-Riverside thoroughfare carries about 55,000 
vehicles a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesars World announced plans two years ago to develop a $25-million casino on 
the Agua Caliente Indian reservation in downtown Palm Springs. That project has 
been stalled by lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with Caesars, Harrah's -- the casino division of the Promus 
Cos. -- said it would not introduce electronic slot machines to California, 
which are banned by the state but are nonetheless used by a handful of Indian 
tribes. More than 2,000 electronic slot machines are now available for play on 
three other San Diego County reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the proposed 61,000-square-foot Pala casino will be dedicated to 
bingo, table games and pull tabs, Harrah's said. The facility also will feature 
a restaurant, lounge and retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The 900-member Pala band now gets most of its income by leasing land to a sand 
and gravel company. Tribal secretary Stan McGarr said the gaming facility is 
expected to generate more than $1 million annually for the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really hope to find economic self-sufficiency through this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGarr said the facility is expected to open in about a year, after approval 
by the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Harrah's will open a casino on the Ak-Chin Indian 
Reservation outside Phoenix, and has signed agreements to develop Indian 
casinos in Washington state and in Alabama. The Memphis-based company operates 
14 casinos in seven states.

GUNMAN SEIZED AFTER HOLDING 36 HOSTAGE AT COLLEGE

 A smirking gunman held up to 36 people hostage in a college lecture hall for 
nearly two hours Wednesday before he was jumped and disarmed by five students, 
one of whom was shot and wounded in the struggle.

CASE DISMISSED FOR PAIR WHO PUT SITTER IN CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
 A judge dismissed charges Wednesday against parents who left four children 
with a teen-age baby-sitter for 16 days, saying they were foolish but not 
reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their judgment in my opinion was appalling," Chief Pittsburgh Magistrate 
Donald Machen said of James Fignar, 37, and Bonnie Railing, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the couple displayed "extremely poor judgment," they had no criminal 
intent and knew their children were not in danger, Machen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you are able to get your lives back together," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been charged with four counts each of child endangerment for 
leaving the children, ranging in age from 2 to 10, with a 14-year-old 
baby-sitter while they went to Lawrenceville, N.J., where Fignar had a 
temporary construction job. 
</P>
<P>
 Railing accompanied her husband because his crew was shorthanded. The pair 
admitted to Machen that they also stopped in Atlantic City, N.J., for a few 
hours to gamble.

CLINTON CRAFTS MIDDLE-CLASS MESSAGE; PRESIDENT: HE HOPES TONIGHT'S SPEECH TO 
NATION WILL REASSURE THOSE FEELING FORSAKEN BY THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IT'S A 
CHANCE TO REBUILD A BATTERED IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than a chance to unveil specific economic proposals, President Clinton's 
address to the nation tonight is being designed to address the insecurities of 
millions of Americans who think that they have been left behind by the nation's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, it is an attempt to enable the President to return to the 
central themes that propelled him into office two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech will be more about who Bill Clinton is and what motivates him than 
about specific proposals, according to aides who have worked on early drafts of 
the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a budget speech," said White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10-minute address, scheduled to be carried by the major networks at 6 
p.m. PST, the President will attempt to portray himself as the valiant champion 
of the downtrodden and forgotten American majority, doing battle against 
entrenched Washington interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton came from the middle class and through the grace of God and the power 
of the middle-class dream made himself the most powerful person in the world," 
said White House political adviser Paul Begala. "That's who he is. That's what 
drives him. That's what he has to communicate to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Another White House adviser said that the President plans to describe what he 
considers to be the principal problems and issues confronting the nation and 
explain his priorities for the next two years. The address is intended to be 
upbeat, a look forward rather than a rehash of the last two years and the 
November Democratic electoral debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech comes at a pivotal moment in the Clinton presidency, according to 
scholars and fellow politicians, who generally agree with the appropriateness 
of the President's planned approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his party's disastrous showing at the polls, Clinton must quickly 
establish himself as an effective leader -- or fade into irrelevance as 
resurgent Republicans seize the agenda and demoralized congressional Democrats 
pull away from their President. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to regaining authority, analysts argue, is for Clinton to be himself. 
That is seen as the only way for the all-too-adaptable Clinton to rebuild his 
battered credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to convince people that there is a body of core beliefs that he is 
committed to and willing to go down in flames for," said Alonzo Hamby, an Ohio 
University biographer of President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, of course, is no Truman, the immutable Missouri mule. Clinton's 
political profile has been likened to a kaleidoscope of shifting images, 
variously tinted to suit the conditions of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Democratic presidential candidate Paul E. Tsongas offered this 
devastating assessment of Clinton this week in calling for the creation of a 
centrist third party: "The problem you have here is fundamentally a lack of 
moral authority and what the President has to figure out is how to reclaim 
that. And it is not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton can perhaps use his famous flexibility to his advantage, making 
his presidency relevant to the voters and benefiting from the inevitable 
blunders of his ambitious Republican adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece of widely subscribed advice for the sometimes hyper-activist 
chief executive: When it comes to new ideas and new programs, less is better. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Democratic House leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri: "I think what 
you are going to have in the next two years is less proposals, and simple, 
straightforward proposals that have the potential to connect with middle-income 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to keep his speech short and thematic, Clinton is doing what many 
scholars and politicians believe he should do. Indeed, many think that he has 
talked too much already. More talk will not change the public's perception of 
Clinton, which has hardened after two years of virtually constant exposure, 
some argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma Rep. Dave McCurdy, his longtime ally and fellow "new Democrat," said 
as much publicly when he recently chided the President with an admonition from 
Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Do not say things. What you are stands over you (all) the 
while and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Carll Ladd, head of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, put 
it more bluntly in an interview: "If you've got a record which is considered by 
a good part of the citizenry to be a failure, you're wasting your time talking 
to them. They are tired of hearing from you." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps mindful of this, Clinton has been uncharacteristically invisible and 
silent this week, having uttered not a word in public as he has engaged in four 
days of closed-door meetings with political and budget advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his present difficulties, a number of factors can be turned to his 
advantage, analysts contend. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, even though he does not have all the answers to the nation's 
economic problems, neither does anyone else -- including his Republican 
opponents. It is by no means certain that the formulas that helped the GOP 
sweep the November election can be applied to the new responsibilities of 
governance. And they are divided among themselves on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, Clinton still has a few months' time to recover from his past 
errors before the campaign season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective for Clinton, said opinion analyst Ladd, is "to see if he can 
accomplish something in that span so that after six months he can go the public 
and ask, 'Even if you didn't like the first two years, how do you feel now?' " 
</P>

DRASTIC PRUNING REPORTEDLY PLANNED TO SAVE HUD ITSELF; HOUSING: MANY FEDERAL 
PROGRAMS WILL GIVE WAY TO BLOCK GRANTS, SOURCES SAY. CUTBACKS ARE SEEN AS A 
REACTION TO GOP SWEEP IN NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development is planning sharp reductions 
next year, including consolidation of 60 specific housing programs into broad 
funding grants that would free states and localities from most federal 
oversight, sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned cuts, described by Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros in 
closed-door sessions with public housing advocates and others, would make 
Housing and Urban Development one of the biggest and most visible victims of 
the budget-cutting fervor sweeping across Washington in reaction to the 
November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of $27 billion, the department has become a favorite 
target of conservatives because of chronic problems associated with urban 
housing projects and the agency's origins in the Great Society movement of the 
1960s. The departments of Energy and Transportation are other prime targets for 
large-scale budget reductions, which the White House has been scrambling to 
make to offset a middle-class tax cut that the President plans to propose 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was clear that Cisneros' plan would reduce HUD's budget, people who 
attended the meeting said that officials did not specify how much money would 
be saved. Cisneros also talked about his plans to replace the Federal Housing 
Administration, which provides mortgage insurance to millions of home buyers, 
with a quasi-government corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros canceled an interview with The Times scheduled for Wednesday. The 
President is expected to announce the proposed changes in a speech tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior official of the department said that Cisneros talked to the 
interest groups instead of the press because he "does not want to scoop the 
President." He believed that he needed to "level with them" early on so that he 
can "rally their support" behind him in what he expects to be a tough battle on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's managed to prevent HUD from completely being chopped by presenting 
alternatives," said the official, who spoke only if not identified. But 
Republicans in Congress are expected to make further reductions in whatever 
budget for the department is handed to them by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the people who benefit from affected programs warn that the 
changes could have tragic consequences for cities as more people go without 
shelter because they lack government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an overreaction to the (Republican) election victories," said Rick 
Nelson of the National Assn. of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. "I think 
there's a great potential for serious problems. We're talking about adding to 
the list of people who can't survive in the cities." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans on Capitol Hill said the proposal indicates that Democrats 
have finally realized what Republicans have been preaching for years: The less 
federal government the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "HUD cannot continue to exist the way it is. That is why we need this radical 
restructuring," said a Republican congressional aide, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. It will get rid of a lot of the archaic federal micro-management so 
money will be spent quicker and get to the people who need it. People will be 
better served because local officials won't have to listen to a HUD bureaucrat 
nickel-and-diming them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with representatives of about 100 interest groups Wednesday, 
Cisneros said that the radical changes he is proposing are a lot better than 
eliminating his department, as the White House was considering last week and 
incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 While making clear that the White House and HUD are still in negotiations 
about the shape of the agency and size of the budget cuts, Cisneros said it is 
likely that most of the housing and community development programs the 
department now administers would be combined into one, two or three types of 
block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Block grants give the recipients great flexibility to spend the money as they 
see fit, instead of focusing funds where the federal government believes they 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many details still are unclear. For instance, Administration officials still 
are struggling over whether the grants would go to states or directly to cities 
and counties. 
</P>
<P>
 This situation worries advocates for the homeless, who fear that because of 
the rising negative sentiment toward homeless people in cities across the 
country, local officials will starve programs for the homeless and direct funds 
toward community development or other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeless are likely to get lost in the shuffle," said Fred Karnas, 
director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnas and others said that Cisneros made it very clear that major changes 
must be made if the agency wants to stave off outright elimination. Gingrich 
told the Washington Post earlier this week that the agency is a prime candidate 
for elimination.

GINGRICH SAYS HE WILL NOT SERVE LONGER THAN 8 YEARS AS SPEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) will serve no longer than eight 
years in the post under an agreement reached by Republican leaders Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich himself suggested the eight-year limit, which was expected to be 
ratified by House Republicans on Friday, an observer who asked not to be 
identified said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of sweeping reforms, House Republicans are setting limits on the 
length of time members can serve as committee chairmen, and also on terms of 
service for members of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have chosen Gingrich as their nominee for House Speaker and he 
will be formally elected when the first Republican-majority House in 40 years 
convenes Jan. 4. In order for Gingrich to serve eight years, Republicans would 
have to keep their hold on the House for three more elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich was said to have told his fellow Republicans that he had no problem 
with an eight-year limit, noting that presidents also were limited to eight 
years in office. 'Contract With America'

HOOKED ON PHONICS SETTLES WITH FTC ON ADVERTISING CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under an agreement disclosed this week between the makers of the reading 
program Hooked on Phonics and the Federal Trade Commission, the manufacturer 
must abandon its advertising campaign or conduct far more research into the 
program's effectiveness -- and disclose any evidence of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County-based Gateway Educational Products, maker of Hooked on Phonics, 
agreed to a settlement that bars the parent company from making unsubstantiated 
claims about the program's ability to teach people to read. The settlement, 
which was signed Aug. 29, was made public Wednesday by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC had charged that Gateway was making sweeping, unproven promises that 
the program could teach anyone to read, regardless of their limitations. 
Gateway admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, and will pay no penalty, said 
Christian S. White, acting director of the commission's bureau of consumer 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They offered a one-size-fits-all solution -- you have reading problems, this 
is the product," White said. "Gateway's evidence just doesn't back up these 
broad, sweeping claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The claims, according to the commission, included statements that Hooked on 
Phonics can teach even those with reading problems, such as dyslexia; that the 
product improves users' reading levels and classroom grades significantly; that 
it can teach reading at home, without a tutor; that it teaches comprehension of 
the meaning of words, and that it has helped almost 1 million people learn to 
read at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also said that testimonials by people who have taken the 
program are used misleadingly in commercials and do not prove that their 
experiences were typical of the average user, which is a violation of federal 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the commission nor Gateway would discuss specific steps that the 
company must take if it wants to continue its highly successful sales pitch. 
Gateway spent $35 million on advertising in 1993 and recorded $60 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gateway released the results of a yearlong study of several 
first-grade classrooms in the Inglewood Unified School District. Although the 
results showed vast improvement in students' reading skills, the FTC apparently 
did not find the results adequate to support Gateway's broad claims of success. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling for more research to back up Gateway's marketing 
campaign, the settlement requires the company to make available to FTC 
officials all research findings, including complaints from consumers, "that 
contradict, qualify or call into question" its claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooked on Phonics emphasizes identifying sounds with letter symbols. It is 
made up of coordinated workbooks, cassette tapes and flash cards. The learner 
listens to the tape while following in the book to hear the correct 
pronunciation of letters and words. The program kit costs about $230. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reading experts are not so sure that the program is as effective as 
testimonials claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Farstrup, executive director of the International Reading Assn. in 
Newark, Del. -- a not-for-profit education group -- said he is concerned that 
the program overstates its benefits as it makes its money from illiterate 
people who tend to be poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway officials released a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Trade Commission has not challenged the effectiveness of the 
Hooked on Phonics program in helping large numbers of consumers, including 
those appearing in its advertisements," read the statement. "Gateway has worked 
out advertising ground rules with the FTC to which we are strongly committed." 
The officials refused further comment.

MAJOR ANNOUNCES N. IRELAND INVESTMENT, SEES BRIGHT FUTURE; ULSTER: THE BRITISH 
LEADER SAYS THE CEASE-FIRE HAS BROUGHT OPTIMISM. SINN FEIN DELEGATES WALK OUT 
OF BUSINESS CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major declared Wednesday that Northern Ireland has reached 
an optimistic "turning point" in its future as he announced about $100 million 
in new business investment that will create 300 jobs for the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
 During an overnight visit to Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, Major 
said there are few days when one can say with confidence, "I can see the 
future." He said Wednesday was one of those days. 
</P>
<P>
 Major told a meeting launching one of the new projects, British Telecom's 
$46-million offices in Belfast, that there is a general atmosphere of optimism 
in the province now that the paramilitary groups there have observed a 
cease-fire for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was part of a two-day international business conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can keep the political talks successfully on track and economic 
development rolling as it is now continuing to roll," Major said, "then the 
prospects for Northern Ireland are very bright indeed, not just in the short 
term but in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process that is now unfolding is not yet certain, but it is 
developing in a way few people would have envisaged just a few months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Major said news reports on the province have too long been dominated by "the 
troubles" -- the violence that racked Northern Ireland for 25 years -- when in 
fact it has become an attractive place for business investment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 delegates attended the Belfast conference, which was marred only by 
the walkout of six delegates from Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish 
Republican Army, and representatives from Belfast and Londonderry over the 
British Northern Ireland Office's refusal to increase the size of their 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, leading an American delegation, said that 
U.S. firms "will take full advantage of the dramatically improved climate" in 
Northern Ireland.

BIPARTISAN PANEL FAILS TO BACK ANY RED-INK REMEDY; BUDGET: COMMISSION ONLY 
VOTES TO ASK CLINTON TO SEEK ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM REFORMS. PLAN TO RAISE 
ELIGIBILITY AGE FAILS TO WIN ENDORSEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hamstrung by political sensitivities, a bipartisan commission Wednesday failed 
to agree on a plan to restrain the federal budget deficit, instead voting to 
ask President Clinton and Congress to strive for eventual reforms in Social 
Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we delay action now, the choices will be higher taxes for Americans still 
in the work force or larger benefit reductions to retirees," members of the 
Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform said in a letter to 
Clinton after acknowledging their inability to agree on a plan with tough 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Under determined attack from labor and senior citizen groups, the commission 
failed to muster a majority for the controversial plan offered by its chairmen, 
Sens. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and John C. Danforth (R-Mo.). The senators wanted to 
raise the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare to 70 in the year 
2034, cut Social Security payroll taxes and require all Americans to use the 
tax savings to open mandatory private savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference before Wednesday's final commission meeting, John Rother, 
public policy director of the American Assn. of Retired Persons, the nation's 
largest senior group, said he was "appalled" that Kerrey "continues to use 
seniors as the scapegoat for our nation's deficit problem." Larry Smedley, 
executive director of the National Council of Senior Citizens, said the 
commission is trying to "sacrifice our children or grandchildren on the altar 
of voodoo economics." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kerrey, undaunted by the attacks and the failure to get the 20 votes 
needed to make his plan an official recommendation, vowed after the three-hour 
meeting to take his campaign to the American people to make major changes in 
Medicare and Social Security. "Our true objective is to change the law," Kerrey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-member commission -- which includes 20 members of Congress, several 
private citizens, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado and Mayor Sandra W. Freedman of 
Tampa -- voted, 24 to 6, to send the letter to Clinton, warning about a growing 
disparity between federal spending and tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2012, combined spending for entitlements -- including Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, federal pensions, welfare and farm price supports 
-- and interest on the national debt will consume all revenues, leaving nothing 
for other federal programs, according to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey and Danforth said their plan to slow the growth in Social Security and 
Medicare spending would keep the deficit at about 2.5% of the nation's economic 
output. Otherwise, the programs would consume an ever-growing share of 
resources. But the commission's critics deny that there is an impending crisis. 
They note that Social Security, collecting more tax revenues than it pays out 
in benefits, is not projected to have a problem until 2025. The only 
short-range threat comes from Medicare, whose hospital insurance fund is 
projected to become bankrupt in 2001. Dealing with health care inflation will 
avert a crisis, Kerrey's opponents insist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is the crisis that justifies these Draconian cuts?" said Richard 
Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers of America, one of the dissenters 
who refused to sign the letter to Clinton. Rather than making drastic changes 
in Social Security now, the "enemy is rapid health care inflation in both the 
private and public (sectors)," said Smedley, of the senior citizen group. He is 
chairman of the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, which joined the 
denunciation of the Kerrey-Danforth plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The political delicacy of the issue was underlined by the identity of the two 
commission members who failed to vote Wednesday: Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), who 
will be chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who will be ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Their committees handle Social Security legislation. They apparently thought 
that issue had such potential for controversy that they refused to sign the 
letter to Clinton, even though it essentially did no more than underscore the 
seriousness of the long-term problem.

PROJECT STILL FACES MORE IN A LONG SERIES OF HURDLES; CONTROVERSY: LEGAL 
CHALLENGES ARE ALMOST CERTAIN. THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN -- 24 YEARS IN THE MAKING 
-- MUST BE APPROVED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS.

<P>
 Approval by the Orange County Board of Supervisors of the Koll Real Estate 
Group's plan to build 3,300 homes in and around the Bolsa Chica wetlands is not 
likely to end the bitter controversy that has surrounded the project for the 
last 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the gavel signaled the end of Wednesday's meeting, 
environmentalists and other project opponents were expressing disappointment 
and threatening legal action to further slow the progress of the massive 
development, which has been under discussion since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will further damage the last remaining unprotected wetlands south of San 
Francisco," said Bruce Monroe, a spokesman for the Sierra Club's Save Bolsa 
Chica Task Force. "We need the wetlands to purify our air and produce food. 
It's a nursery for fisheries. If you kill the wetlands, you do permanent, 
irreparable damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Wednesday's approval of the Koll plan an "arbitrary and capricious" 
decision showing a lack of concern for the board's constituency, Monroe said 
that his group would file a lawsuit challenging the proposed development as 
damaging to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the houses are in place," he said, the Koll Real Estate Group "could 
spend lots of money and still fail to bring back the wetlands. You can't bring 
invertebrates back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to such legal challenges, the project has other hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bulldozers can begin their work, county Planning Director Thomas B. 
Mathews said, the project must be approved by the California Coastal 
Commission, which is likely to review it this spring. It also will face 
scrutiny from the Army Corps of Engineers, expected to take action sometime in 
1995. And finally, the project must come back to the Board of Supervisors for 
final ratification, probably next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the development to consist of homes ranging from condos or 
townhouses priced around $200,000 to luxury view homes expected to sell for up 
to $1 million. The average price of a home at Bolsa Chica, said Lucy Dunn, 
Koll's senior vice president, will be about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers want to begin building in 1996, with completion in 13 to 15 years. 
But because construction will take place in phases, Mathews said, the first 
homes could be occupied as early as 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process is painfully slow," Dunn said. "Clearly, though, the county wants 
to achieve a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's vote by the supervisors has been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, when Signal Landmark, now owned by the Koll Real Estate Group, 
acquired the property, about 100 development plans have been prepared for the 
1,600-acre Bolsa Chica site, according to Dunn. Only one had previously made it 
as far as the supervisors' boardroom: an ambitious plan, first proposed in 
1972, that included 5,700 homes, a 1,300-slip marina, two 2,000-foot jetties 
and an array of oceanfront hotels, shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, the plan was strongly opposed by many environmentalists. So, 
after winning approval from the supervisors in 1985, the project got bogged 
down in legal and political challenges, most notably from a group called Amigos 
de Bolsa Chica, then the voice of the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to break the logjam, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and 
Huntington Beach's then-Mayor John Erskine formed a coalition that included 
representatives from the developer, the state, the city, the county and Amigos 
de Bolsa Chica. Meeting regularly for six months beginning in November, 1988, 
the group developed an agreement that eliminated the proposed marina, hotels 
and restaurants, significantly reduced the number of planned houses, and 
sharply increased the number of wetland acres the developer would restore. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from that 1989 agreement, called the Bolsa Chica Planning Coalition 
Concept Plan, that the current proposal evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, however, was opposed by other environmentalists, who in 1992 formed 
the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, with the goal of raising enough money to purchase 
the wetlands and preserve it as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, supported by many environmentalist groups, the trust has held 
discussions with the Department of the Interior regarding the possible federal 
purchase of the area or a land swap to save it from development. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust wants to preserve the marsh and surrounding upland in part because 
it is habitat for five endangered bird species: the light-footed clapper rail, 
Belding's savanna sparrow, the California least tern, the peregrine falcon and 
the brown pelican. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group also contributed to a long delay by switching its 
development application two years ago from the city of Huntington Beach to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was made, Dunn said, because the county had greater expertise in 
wetlands restoration, but critics charge the company with jilting Huntington 
Beach in the hopes of getting a better deal from the more development-inclined 
supervisors. The switch was possible because Bolsa Chica, though close to the 
city, is in unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons for the change, the plan has generated at least eight 
public hearings -- some of them highly emotional -- in the last two years, as 
well as two environmental impact reports prepared by the county.

ON-LINE MICE AREN'T STIRRING; CYBER SHOPPING LACKS APPEAL OF TRIP TO MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When buying things for himself, Rob Lingelbach is a cutting-edge consumer who 
would rather head for his computer than the mall. The technically adept 
Lingelbach can order his choices from a computer screen in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to buying gifts, not even Lingelbach shops from the on-line 
shopping services. Instead, the computer-savvy Angeleno becomes the 
old-fashioned mall maven who wants a shopping experience that is touchy-feely 
and filled with scents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a specific product in mind when I shop for myself," Lingelbach 
explained. "But I browse when I'm looking for a gift, and it's easier to browse 
in a store because you can see and touch the product." On the computer, he 
notes, "you can't use your nose to shop for cologne." 
</P>
<P>
 This is hardly the sort of customer the on-line shopping services have in mind 
at this time of year as they scramble to become players in the holiday 
retailing sweepstakes. And Lingelbach is the rule, not the exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with limits even devotees acknowledge andplagued by the coolness of 
the all-important female shopper, on-line retailing has proven a 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has evolved from a novelty in the early 1980s to a retail 
alternative that offers products from hundreds of major store chains and 
catalogue operators, computer shopping remains a distant also-ran to its prime 
competitors: mail-order catalogues and television shopping networks. 
</P>
<P>
 While computer-based retailing is expected to generate a paltry $136 million 
in sales this year, cataloguers will take in a whopping $40 billion, industry 
analysts say. And TV shopping channels such as QVC and Home Shopping Network 
will realize more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, television retailers and catalogue operators can't offer consumers 
the feel, touch and scent of products, either. But they succeed largely because 
they get the attention and holiday season dollars of women. On the other hand, 
only about 14% of on-line shoppers are women, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "On-line shoppers are primarily men who have a lot of experience with 
computers on the job," said Ethel Klein, publisher of EDK Associates, which 
specializes in market research on female consumers. "On-line shopping is not 
very user-friendly to women because they have less experience with computers. 
That situation is changing because young girls are getting early exposure to 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
 But on-line retailers have also had difficulty attracting those who already 
use computer services. Only 25% of those subscribing to cyber services such as 
Prodigy, America Online and CompuServe shop in the virtual malls those 
companies provide, according to some industry estimates. More of those 
companies' subscribers use the electronic mail feature or other menu items 
available on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted by the disappointing response to past appeals, on-line services are 
now responding with bolder marketing and new products designed to make 
computer-assisted shopping more interactive and interesting.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the new products are electronic "catalogues" on CD-ROM, which offer 
clearer color images of merchandise than those found on traditional on-line 
services. Some of these disks also offer stereo sound and faster product-search 
capability.  
</P>
<P>
 2Market, a computer-based shopping service launched this month, is among the 
entrants to this brave newer world of retailing. The company offers a single 
CD-ROM containing thousands of brand-name products from more than two dozen 
retailers, for a subscription price of $19.95. The 2Market disk features such 
big retailing names as Spiegel, Sharper Image and Nature Company. It also 
includes software programming that comes up with gift ideas when the shopper 
provides criteria such as a cost range and the age, gender and special 
interests of the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts are dubious whether many shoppers -- accustomed to no-cost 
browsing in stores and in the dozens of catalogues that come in the mail -- are 
prepared to pay money for a catalogue of catalogues on a disk. 
</P>
<P>
 "A subscription price for the disk is ludicrous," said Joshua Harris, 
president of New York-based Jupiter Interactive Productions Inc., an on-line 
consulting company. "Can you imagine the Beverly Center charging an admission 
price?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many retailers are also cautious about the immediate prospects. Lands' End, 
the big catalogue merchandiser, has been on line on Prodigy and CompuServe for 
two years. Lands' End opted for space on the new 2Market product because it -- 
like other retailers on the CD-ROM -- was given the opportunity to design its 
own presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen on line is very primitive, and the presentation is very 
flat," said Michael Atkin, vice president of marketing at Lands' End. "We're 
involved because we want to find out if people want to shop this way." 
</P>
<P>
 But 2Market's founders -- Apple Computer Inc. and America Online -- argue that 
CD-ROM technology's superior graphics will help overcome the drawbacks to cyber 
shopping that have so far overwhelmed its advantages of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s, shoppers expressed a big need for convenience, and consumers 
want even more of it in the 1990s because they have even less free time," said 
Thomas Burt, chief operating officer of 2Market. 2Market's marketing studies 
indicate that its potential customer base is a time-conscious upscale household 
in which each spouse works, generating a combined average income of about 
$75,000. Of course, 2Market is aiming at households with computers -- and that 
market is growing steadily. An estimated 37 million U.S. households have 
computers, and about 10 million of those computers have the CD-ROM drive needed 
to generate interactive pictures and sound from a disk. There should be 
computers in at least 40 million homes by 1995 -- and 17 million will have 
CD-ROM technology, according to industry projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies are also exploring this retailing frontier. Contentware Inc. 
in White Plains, N.Y., produces a CD-ROM that carries catalogue items from 
retailers such as J.C. Penney, Spiegel and Marshall Field. The Canadian firm 
Magellan recently introduced CD-ROM-based shopping software called the 
Merchant. And CompuServe, one of the on-line services giants, last summer 
introduced a CD-ROM that includes Brooks Bros. and 11 other merchandisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On-line retailing is still in its early stages, and some retailers have been 
disappointed with the results," said Lorraine Sileo, an industry analyst at 
Simba Information, a market research firm in Wilton, Conn. "But CD-ROM-based 
shopping is an attractive alternative to traditional on-line shopping, and it's 
part of the effort to find the right formula." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in cyberspace just as in real malls, the last-minute holiday fever 
is at a high pitch. Just this week, CompuServe is rushing out a special holiday 
disk. And its Electronic Mall, with more than 130 merchants, is pushing 
discounted merchandise and featuring contests to lure customers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of CompuServe's electronic merchants -- a company called the Gift Sender 
-- is sponsoring a "We Believe in Fruitcake" contest in which shoppers are 
asked to describe ways to make use of a fruitcake without eating it.

THE EMERGING INTERACTIVE WORLD; NEW DIGITAL CABLE IS PUT TO THE TEST; 
MULTIMEDIA: TIME WARNER HOPES 'FULL-SERVICE NETWORK' WILL BECOME ULTIMATE 
DIVERSION IN THEME PARK-STUDDED ORLANDO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The diversions in this resort city already include Walt Disney World and a 
dozen other theme parks, but entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday 
unveiled what it hopes will be the biggest diversion of them all: an elaborate 
cable television system aimed at luring Americans into an entirely new world of 
interactive video technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long-delayed technology and marketing trial, about 4,000 Orlando homes 
are being wired to what Time Warner calls a "full-service network" designed to 
enable people to shop from home, watch movies on demand and even play video 
games with people on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debut of the full-service network is a turning point for the 
communications industry," said Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner. "With 
digital interactivity, consumers are in total control of the programming they 
bring into their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Time Warner project is the most grandiose of the interactive television 
trials that are getting under way across the country. All the tests are aimed 
at determining what kind of technology is best for delivering interactive 
services and what kinds of services consumers are interested in. The stakes are 
high, with the market expected to be worth as much as $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all in the learning business; interactive TV remains a mystery and we 
want to find out what it is that consumers want," said Vincent Grosso, vice 
president of interactive services and development for AT&T.  
</P>
<P>
 By enabling consumers to purchase goods with the click of a TV remote-control 
button or telephone key pad, communications executives think they can grab a 
big share of the $55-billion-a-year mail-order market and the 
$15-billion-a-year video rental market and also be a conduit for other 
information services such as newspapers and computer on-line databases. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, the industry has had a great deal of trouble building the 
right mousetrap. Electronic hardware and software agile enough to handle 
simultaneous requests for movies, games or shopping by thousands of viewers has 
proven difficult and expensive to develop. Creating a billing system has been 
equally tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear to us how to do the billing -- whether to bill per 
(transaction) or for time of use," said Edward W. Birs, president of 
Interactive Digital Solutions, a Mountain View, Calif., unit of Silicon 
Graphics, the company that helped Time Warner develop the computer software and 
hardware for its cable system.  
</P>
<P>
 The Time Warner trial is nothing if not gold-plated: Besides a large 
television set, trial customers have a hand-held remote to manipulate a 
high-powered customized computer that sits on top of the set. There is also a 
color printer to print receipts, shopping coupons and other documents, as well 
as an Atari game controller to play video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials Wednesday were mum about how much all of this will cost. But 
industry insiders say it must be at least several thousand dollars per 
household just for the equipment that sits in the living room, and the wiring 
will cost thousands more. That has led to some snickering about the realism of 
the trial. And the services available now are limited to movies, shopping and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Several families that have been using the Orlando system -- but who have not 
been required to pay full price for all the services they select -- praised the 
project, saying they were especially impressed by interactive services such as 
playing video games against neighbors and being able to start a movie at will, 
rather than having to wait for a predetermined start time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The novelty hasn't worn off yet. We are still enjoying the system, and we 
hardly even use our VCR anymore," said Orlando resident Thomas Gerry. Fewer 
than two-dozen Orlando homes have been hooked up so far, but many more will be 
in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 To be successful, Time Warner and its partners will have to convince ordinary, 
paying cable TV customers like Alvin Cowans that they need a higher-tech cable 
system. Cowans, president of the McCoy Federal Credit Union in Orlando, said he 
has read about the Time Warner trial but is so far unimpressed with what it 
promises in the way of new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's really paid a lot of attention to it that I know," Cowans said. 
"There's so many other activities going on in Orlando like the Orlando Magic 
(basketball team), Disney World and the beaches, that people aren't really 
excited about sitting in front of their TV set all day shopping and watching 
movies."

RALPHS AND OWNER OF ALPHA BETA TO SELL STORES; RETAILING: DIVESTITURE OF 27 
OUTLETS, APPROVED BY STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IS LIKELY TO PAVE WAY FOR 
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST GROCERY MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ralphs Grocery Co. and the owner of the Alpha Beta chain have agreed to sell 
27 of their nearly 400 Southern California stores in an antitrust settlement 
that is likely to pave the way for the largest supermarket merger in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The store divestitures were approved by the two chains and the California 
attorney general and were announced Wednesday after months of negotiation. The 
Federal Trade Commission will also scrutinize the proposed merger and 
divestiture plan but is expected to approve the supermarket union. 
</P>
<P>
 State antitrust regulators have been studying the possible anti-competitive 
ramifications of the proposed deal since September, when Yucaipa Cos. -- owner 
of the Alpha Beta, Boys, Viva and Food 4 Less chains -- announced plans to 
acquire the 121-year-old Ralphs chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "While litigation to protect consumers was certainly available as an option," 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said, "I am pleased that the merging parties came early 
to the table to negotiate this result, allowing the state to avert a lengthy 
and expensive court battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The two chains also agreed to reimburse the state for about $400,000 in 
attorney's fees and other expenses, said Lawrence Tapper, a deputy attorney 
general involved in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27 stores to be sold -- most of them Alpha Betas -- were selected after 
regulators identified regions that have high concentrations of stores owned by 
the two supermarket giants. For example, in Los Angeles, there are three Ralphs 
along the 3rd Street corridor that runs through Hancock Park and the Fairfax 
District -- one at La Brea Avenue, one at Fairfax Avenue and one near La 
Cienega Boulevard. There is only one major challenger in the area -- an Alpha 
Beta store at Wilshire and Hauser boulevards. The companies agreed to sell the 
Ralphs at 3rd and Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, major competing supermarket chains and smaller 
independent grocers will be allowed to bid for the 27 stores. If the company 
doesn't receive a fair offer from a grocer for a particular store, it can seek 
state approval to put a different outlet on the sales block, a Ralphs executive 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 27-store divestiture is huge and hurtful," said Jan Charles Gray, senior 
vice president at Ralphs and spokesman for both companies. "But we agreed to it 
to move the planned transaction along. We believe this transaction will be good 
for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 people are employed in the 27 stores. Many workers with adequate 
seniority will be retained under union contracts, while others could be laid 
off. However, the combined company will probably expand, and any displaced 
workers would be the first hired for new positions, said Rick Icaza, president 
of the Los Angeles office of the United Food & Commercial Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
 If the merger is consummated, the Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva store formats will 
vanish from the local grocery landscape. Most of those stores will be converted 
to Ralphs and the rest will become Food 4 Less warehouse stores. In addition, 
some Ralphs will be converted to the Food 4 Less discount format. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 173 Ralphs, 128 Alpha Beta, 45 Food 4 Less, 22 Boys and 7 Viva 
stores -- 375 in all. Under the settlement, the new combined chain would have 
348 stores, eclipsing Vons, which currently leads with 336.  
</P>
<P>
 The new chain would also leapfrog Vons and become the sales leader in Southern 
California. The merged company would have a market share of about 27%, compared 
to Vons' 19%. Several antitrust experts have said this degree of concentration 
is not necessarily cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 If the FTC also approves the merger, Ralphs' Gray said the combined company 
will be able to better compete on prices with Vons and Lucky -- which currently 
rank No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in Southland sales. Vons and Lucky have 
declined to comment on the merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one food industry executive called on federal regulators to block the 
merger, contending that the new entity would have too much clout. The FTC does 
not comment on cases under review and would not discuss the state's antitrust 
settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a major competitor is eliminated, it's not healthy for the 
consumer," said the executive, who asked for anonymity. "This marketplace has 
functioned very well because it's been so competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some consumer groups also remain leery of the deal. If unchecked, it could 
lead to additional mergers and the kind of consolidation that leads to big 
price hikes, said Ken McEldowney, director of San Francisco-based Consumer 
Action, a statewide group. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, this is not two small chains trying to get some clout," he said. 
"These are two chains that already have large market share who are combining to 
get largest market share." 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity probably wouldn't take the lead in price cutting. Ralphs has 
not been as aggressive on prices as Lucky and Vons, said Ed Comeau, an industry 
analyst at Lehman Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies hope to complete the merger in mid-January.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: COMPUTERDOM'S WINDS OF CHANGE WILL BRING A BLAST 
OF FRESH ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his most private moments, Intel Chief Executive Andy Grove must rail 
against the seeming injustice of it all. Unlike tainted Tylenol, Intel's 
Pentium hasn't hurt anyone. The Pentium is hardly the Corvair or the Pinto of 
microprocessors that causes life-ruining computational crashes; it is not 
"Unsafe at Any Speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Intel has effectively been cast as the outrageously arrogant GM (General 
Microprocessors?) of today. The digital masses on the Internet rising up in 
righteous wrath to smite this silicon giant are now computerdom's Ralph Naders. 
Even IBM -- once the Goliath of its time -- has unabashedly sided with the 
forces of consumerism. Clearly, Intel's miscalculations have been on a scale 
far grander than those of its Pentium. The result is that the world's most 
profitable microprocessor company has deservedly taken a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real issue here isn't the shameful spectacle of a successful innovator 
with a flawed product arrogantly insisting that it knows what's best for 
customers and getting into a statistical shootout with IBM over just how bad 
the flaw is. No, the important issue involves the painful reality that these 
products are now hurtling beyond the level of complexity that can successfully 
be designed and tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentium-type problems will prove to be the rule -- rather than the isolated, 
aberrant exceptions -- as new generations of complex hardware and software hit 
the market. More insidious errors and harmful bugs are inevitable. That is the 
new reality. The Pentium is merely today's sour taste of tomorrow's complexity. 
This is the dirty little secret that everyone from Silicon Valley to Redmond, 
Wash., to Route 128 in Massachusetts knows but would rather not discuss in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly acute for microprocessors, which are essentially 
sophisticated software crystallized into silicon. Roughly every three years, a 
new generation of microprocessor emerges. Those chips invariably run about five 
times faster, are filled with four times as many transistors and offer far 
greater functionality than their immediate predecessors. This has been the 
immutable rule of microprocessors for the past 20 years. Indeed, in another 
three years there will be a next-generation microprocessor that makes today's 
Pentiums seem as fast as sedated sloths. 
</P>
<P>
 All these exponential improvements in microprocessor price and performance 
come at the cost of complexity. Testing all this complexity to assure that 
there are no mistakes in design or manufacture becomes a task that is in itself 
orders of magnitude more complex with each new generation. It now seems fair to 
say that our ability to successfully test microprocessors has been outstripped 
by the product's inherent complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is increasingly true for software -- why do you think Microsoft and 
other leading software companies are always late shipping their products? The 
problem will get worse over time, not better. 
</P>
<P>
 What further complicates this complexity is the difficult question of what 
should be tested. Currently, IBM and Intel are in hot dispute over dueling 
spreadsheet calculations: Intel assumes a thousand calculations per hour; IBM 
postulates 5,000 calculations per second. Whose assumptions are more realistic? 
If all you're doing is word processing and desktop publishing, errors in 
floating point logic are irrelevant to you. Then again, what happens if there 
is an error in a microprocessor that leads to your word processor randomly 
deleting the word not every few thousand times it appears? Is that a nuisance? 
Or is it a software recipe for a communications disaster? The issue of how to 
test -- and along what dimensions -- will clearly become one of the most 
important design issues of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 You can be sure there will be lawyers arguing that microprocessor companies 
and their software brethren haven't performed adequate testing before loosing 
their products on an unsuspecting marketplace. Woe betide the executive who has 
the "smoking e-mail" in his hard drive detailing that he knew of the bug but 
considered it too insignificant to fix. Testing seems destined to become 
tomorrow's legal battlegrounds as consumers demand more value and less risk 
from their digital consumption. If they don't get it, watch them sue. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more and more types of software interact with the microprocessor -- 
indeed, as more and more types of memory chips and video and sound chips 
network with the microprocessor -- it becomes mathematically impossible to test 
for all the permutations and combinations that might lead to subtle flaws or 
humongous errors. Customers -- not vendors -- will be catching more and more of 
tomorrow's bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 This has two immediate implications. The first is that hardware will become 
more software-like. Microprocessors will increasingly be designed for remote 
diagnostics and a software fix to quickly bypass or repair logic flaws. In 
other words, silicon will be designed to be remotely re-edited, not just 
replaced. (Unless, of course, it's simply cheaper to throw away the old 
microprocessor.) 
</P>
<P>
 The second is that smart individuals and organizations will not trust a single 
microprocessor or software package for their most vital calculations. For 
example, people will make sure that spreadsheets are calculated on Microsoft 
Excel as well as on Lotus 1-2-3, and on PowerPCs as well as Pentium processors. 
The Boeings, GMs and Mercks of the world would be wise not to become too 
dependent on a single computational platform. 
</P>
<P>
 As our computers use complexity to become more powerful, that same complexity 
also makes them more vulnerable. We have to take steps to make sure we are not 
harmed by their vulnerability.

SONY ASSIGNS SAGANSKY NEW DUTIES IN SIGN OF MORE CHANGE; ENTERTAINMENT: HE WILL 
JOIN THE STUDIO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jeffrey Sagansky, named to a senior position at Sony of America earlier this 
year, is taking on added responsibilities at Sony Pictures Entertainment in a 
move that could portend further changes at the troubled studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony of America President Michael P. Schulhof, in a letter to Sony Pictures 
executives late Wednesday, said Sagansky will join the studio's board of 
directors and executive committee. Without mentioning specific duties, Schulhof 
added that Sagansky will take a "more active role" in the studio. Sony 
executives were unavailable for comment on the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The development raises questions about the future roles of Sony Pictures 
President Alan J. Levine and Columbia-TriStar Motion Picture Cos. Chairman Mark 
Canton, who have been running the company since Sony Pictures Chairman Peter 
Guber left under pressure in September. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said Levine was in on the decision to expand Sagansky's role. But 
Hollywood sources speculated that Levine and Canton's jobs are in danger, after 
the parent company said it would take a $3.2-billion writedown on the studio. 
Schulhof is also said to be under intense pressure to turn the studio around. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony previously denied that Sagansky would take a hands-on role at the studio 
even though he is known as a tough and resourceful manager. Instead, it said 
Sagansky, who is based in New York and will continue to report to Schulhof, 
would serve as a strategic planner. 
</P>
<P>
 But insiders always suspected that the executive would be drafted into service 
at the studio. Sagansky previously ran TriStar Pictures before it was acquired 
by Sony. At the time, he told friends that he didn't enjoy the movie business. 
He had a much more successful stint as the entertainment chief at CBS before 
resigning earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo-based Sony Corp. purchased the studio for $3.4 billion plus considerable 
debt in 1989. At the time, critics said it overpaid for the company and its 
expensive management team of ex-producers Jon Peters and Guber. But Sony 
proceeded to invest millions more in reviving its Columbia Pictures and TriStar 
Pictures units, as well as the Culver City lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia, in particular, performed poorly, releasing a string of expensive 
failures that included the infamous "Last Action Hero." Sony also wound up 
paying out tens of millions of dollars in executive settlements to Guber, 
Peters and a succession of other ex-studio heads.

 Euro Disney to Cut Prices: Although the company said the number of visitors to 
the Euro Disney theme park outside Paris -- battered by two years of losses and 
poor attendance -- has risen this year, it has announced plans to cut admission 
prices next spring. It also said Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz 
al Saud, a major stockholder, has agreed to reduce his stake in a way that will 
not hurt the value of the company's shares. Euro Disney said it will cut prices 
in the peak season to $36 per adult from the current $41.50 to $46.

 Philip Morris Chairman to Retire: The executive duo installed six months ago 
to run the tobacco-food behemoth is breaking up.Chairman William Murray said he 
will step down effective Feb. 1 and the Philip Morris Cos. board promptly named 
Chief Executive Geoffrey C. Bible as his successor. Bible will be the company's 
third chairman in a year. Murray said he wants to make good on a promise to his 
family to retire before he turns 60. No change in direction is expected at the 
company, which generates $61 billion in annual revenue from sales of the 
best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro and popular food and beverages such as 
Maxwell House coffee, Kraft cheese, Oscar Mayer meats and Miller beer.

 Accounting Board Backs Down on Stock Options: The Financial Accounting 
Standards Board voted not to require companies that grant stock options to 
their employees to deduct the value of those options from earnings.The FASB 
yielded to political pressure from opponents who argued that the rule was bad 
accounting and bad public policy, board members acknowledged. Technology 
companies, which often use stock options as an important form of compensation, 
were vehement in their opposition to the proposal. The board's action means 
that companies will be encouraged to deduct the value of options from earnings 
but not required to do so.

TWO BIG DIAGNOSTIC FIRMS PLAN TO MERGE; MEDICINE: NATIONAL HEALTH AND ROCHE 
BIOMEDICAL WOULD FORM THE LARGEST CHAIN OF TEST LABS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consolidation in the $30-billion medical-testing business accelerated 
Wednesday as La Jolla-based National Health Laboratories and Swiss-owned Roche 
Biomedical Laboratories said they would merge into the nation's largest 
diagnostic laboratory chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials and analysts said the merger idea was a response to intense 
price pressure coming from cost-conscious managed-care firms and the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the third-largest and fourth-largest U.S. medical testing 
companies would form a chain with 39 medical laboratories and annual revenue of 
more than $1.7 billion -- roughly half from each partner. The labs will have a 
coast-to-coast geographic reach and be able to perform blood analyses and 
drug-use, genetic and allergy testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will "make the company significantly more competitive in a swiftly 
changing and ever-more-demanding health care marketplace," said James Maher, 
National Health's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Maher, who will be chairman of the combined company, said the deal is expected 
to generate $90 million in savings over two years. National Health had sales of 
$638 million for the first nine months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low-cost producers are going to be the ones to win managed-care 
contracts," C. Fred Toney, research analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San 
Francisco, said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Powell, president of Roche Biomedical, will be president and chief 
executive of the new firm. Roche Biomedical, a Burlington, N.C.-based unit of 
Roche Holding A.G. of Switzerland, had sales of $550 million for the nine 
months ended in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Brundage, a PaineWebber analyst, said there is "considerable overlap" of 
facilities. He expects to see at least four labs closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of consolidations has been sweeping the medical industry -- from 
hospitals to group practices to insurers -- as cost constraints force companies 
to look for ways to improve their efficiency. Much of that consolidation has 
been driven by the rapid growth of U.S. enrollment in health maintenance 
organizations, which promise to minimize costs by limiting their members' 
choice of doctors and closely monitoring hospital stays and the necessity of 
medical tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Under HMO plans, doctors are asked not to order diagnostic tests deemed 
unnecessary to the patient's care. That can mean fewer doctors' orders for 
laboratory tests and less business for the labs. The HMOs are also pressuring 
the medical laboratories to charge less for performing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Clinton Administration has cut reimbursement rates for 
laboratory procedures under the federal Medicare program for the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Such factors have made it difficult for small, independent labs to survive and 
have led to the development of ever-larger laboratory chains. Analysts said the 
combined revenues of National Health and Roche would exceed those of the other 
leading U.S. diagnostic firms, operated by Corning Inc. and SmithKline Beecham 
PLC. 
</P>
<P>
 National Health has been struggling to repair its reputation since December, 
1992, when it pleaded guilty to federal charges of Medicare fraud. The company 
agreed to pay $111 million to settle accusations that it fraudulently billed 
Medicare by bundling fees for unnecessary medical tests with charges for needed 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 National Health stock climbed $1.50 to $13.50 a share Wednesday on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger is subject to approval by federal agencies and National Health 
shareholders. Investor Ronald O. Perelman's MacAndrews & Forbes Holding Inc., 
which owns 24% of National Health, will back the plan and retain 12% of the new 
firm.

GENERAL MILLS PLANS SPINOFF OF ITS RESTAURANTS; CORPORATIONS: ANALYST PRAISES 
THE MOVE, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE PARENT TO FOCUS ON CONSUMER FOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<P>
 General Mills Inc. said Wednesday that it will spin off its restaurants as a 
separate company, effective June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The as-yet-unnamed corporation will be the world's largest full-service 
restaurant company, with about $3.2 billion in revenue.It will hold about 20% 
of the parent's existing debt and include Red Lobster, Olive Garden and China 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills said the spinoff will allow it to focus on consumer foods, which 
include Betty Crocker mixes, Hamburger Helper, Wheaties, Cheerios and Pop 
Secret Microwave Popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good move," said Michael Kayes, an analyst with NationsBank Corp., 
which had 1.2 million General Mills shares as of Sept. 30. "It lets them 
concentrate on what they do best." 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills shares rose $2.50 to close at $58 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Each General Mills shareholder will receive one share of the new restaurant 
company for every share owned. The spinoff will take effect at the end of 
General Mills' fiscal year, as Chairman and Chief Executive Bruce Atwater 
retires. 
</P>

 Atwater said the change will make the best use of his two top managers: 
Stephen Sanger, 48, who was elected president and chief executive of the food 
division, and Joe R. Lee, 53, elected to similar jobs for restaurants.

BANKERS TRUST DERIVATIVE SALE VIOLATED LAW, REGULATORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators have concluded that Bankers Trust New York Corp., in its 
sale of risky derivatives to Gibson Greetings Inc., violated federal securities 
and commodities anti-fraud laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil suits naming Bankers Trust could be filed within the next several weeks 
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, according to regulatory officials and a source close to Bankers 
Trust.These sources said the bank is negotiating the final terms of a consent 
decree with the two agencies that would settle the suits and require Bankers 
Trust to pay fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions against Bankers Trust, following a six-month investigation, would 
represent the most decisive move yet by federal regulators to combat abuses in 
the sale of these complex financial instruments, known as derivatives because 
they are derived from other underlying securities, such as stocks or bonds. The 
latest flap over derivatives involves Orange County, which filed for bankruptcy 
last week after its treasurer invested county funds in exotic bets on interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said there were two breakthroughs for regulators in the Bankers Trust 
case. The first was evidence of fraud, which the SEC and CFTC have authority to 
police in financial markets. The second was the regulators' decision to treat 
the derivatives sold by Bankers Trust variously as securities and commodities 
futures -- making them subject to regulatory supervision by both agencies.

 GE Unlikely to Accept Minority Role: Sources familiar with recent 
conversations between Turner Broadcasting System and NBC said they believe that 
NBC's parent corporation will demand at least 51% control of the resulting

that Turner is "pressing forward" with a proposal to give General Electric Co. 
a 35% stake.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND RATES END MIXED; DOW SURGES 30.95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bond market went on a wild ride Wednesday before closing mixed, while 
stocks rallied in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term interest rates tumbled after the government reported a relatively 
modest rise in consumer prices in November, which some analysts said 
significantly lessens the odds that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten 
credit again when it meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on one-year Treasury bills slid to 7.19% from 7.33% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, yields also declined on intermediate-term bonds in the two-year to 
10-year range, but they inched up on the longest-term issues: The 30-year 
Treasury bond yield closed at 7.86%, up from Tuesday's 7.85%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said the bond market was influenced not only by the Fed outlook 
and the inflation report, but also by continuing year-end portfolio shifts by 
institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year Treasury note yield, for example, sank to 7.76% from 7.82% on 
Tuesday after a sudden surge in demand for that issue early in the day. Traders 
said it appeared that a large investor was selling mortgage-backed securities, 
which have been particularly volatile this year, and buying five-year 
Treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, buyers took control as short-term interest rates fell 
back. The Dow industrials jumped 30.95 points to 3,746.29, and stocks' gains 
were broad-based: advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 on the 
New York Stock Exchange, where trading was heavy at 355 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 4.82 points to 
454.97, a 1.1% rise that beat the Dow's 0.8% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts are optimistic that the stock market will stage its traditional 
year-end rally if the Fed indeed decides against another rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks continued to rise, which analysts said suggests investors 
believe interest rates are peaking. Among banks, First Interstate rose 1 1/4 to 
70, First Chicago gained 3/4 to 47 1/2, BancOne added 1/2 to 27 and Bank of 
Boston rose 1/2 to 27 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other financial issues gaining included Federal National Mortgage, up 2 7/8 to 
72 7/8; Chubb, up 2 5/8 to 74 7/8; and Charles Schwab, up 1 3/4 to 33 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrials, Union Carbide jumped 2 to 30 1/8, Caterpillar gained 1 
1/8 to 52 3/8 and Scott Paper leaped 2 1/8 to 68 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many retail stocks advanced, including Nordstrom, up 2 1/2 to 47 3/4; Dayton 
Hudson, up 1 1/4 to 79 1/8; and Home Depot, up 1 1/8 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, AT&T shot up 1 3/4 to 51 after receiving a $1.2-billion 
contract from Flag Ltd. to build an undersea cable system. But computer 
networker Novell tumbled 1 3/8 to 15 7/8 after posting lower fourth-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal bond insurer MBIA leaped 3 7/8 to 54 after saying it doesn't 
expect any losses on bonds of government entities it has insured in Orange 
County. The insured bonds have been issued by municipalities that aren't 
seriously threatened by the bankruptcy of the county's investment fund, MBIA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mostly higher overseas. In London the FTSE 100 index surged 34.2 
points to 2,980.6, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index added 13.52 points to 
2,024.77. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average gained 56.01 points to 
18,931.49. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed down 6.44 points at 2,401.55. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, the dollar weakened slightly against other major currencies 
except the Japanese yen, as traders ignored more government data showing strong 
U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar ended at 100.28 Japanese yen, up from 100.19 on 
Tuesday, but at 1.569 German marks, down from 1.579. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, coffee futures tumbled in a continued reaction to the 
U.S. Agriculture Department's global supply forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Green arabica coffee for December delivery finished 6.5 cents lower on New 
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange at $1.44 a pound, a six-month low.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CRISIS COULD FORCE SOME MONEY FUNDS TO CUT SHARE 
PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shock waves from Orange Couny's bankruptcy continued to rile financial markets 
Wednesday: Federal regulators said privately that it is highly possible that 
one or more money market mutual funds stuck with county debt will have to mark 
down their share prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Money funds strive to maintain $1 share prices so that they can be marketed as 
"safe" short-term cash accounts.But in September, a small institutional money 
fund became the first in fund history to "break a buck" in share price because 
of losses on short-term investments that went awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with many money funds owning small amounts of taxable or tax-exempt 
Orange County notes or debt, the possibility of additional -- if minor -- fund 
losses has risen. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal bankruptcy court trustee working on the county case said Wednesday 
that certain money market funds have been listed as creditors of the county, 
but the funds weren't named. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts note that about a dozen major fund groups, among them Putnam 
Investments, Franklin Resources, Alliance Capital Management and Benham Group 
have already said they would cover any money-fund shareholder losses incurred 
because of Orange County debt in their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper Mutual Funds said it owns $198 million of Orange County notes in five 
of its taxable money funds. Like other major fund firms, Kemper said it will 
step in if necessary to keep the funds from falling below $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "The biggest worry is that a smaller (fund company) won't have the 
financial resources" to bail out its funds, said Ralph Norton at fund tracker 
IBC/Donoghue Inc. Federal regulators have indicated that may well happen in 
coming weeks or months.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BUSINESS TEAM AIMS TO RESTORE COUNTY'S IMAGE; 
STRATEGY: TOP LEADERS SEEK ALLIANCE TO MEND THE AREA'S FINANCES AND STANDING. 
THEY OPPOSE TAX AND USER FEE HIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County business leaders who hustled this year to keep Taco Bell and 
other companies from leaving the region are assembling a high-powered team to 
help restore the county's shattered finances and tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's a 'red team' or an 'orange team' or a crisis response 
team," said H. Fred Mickelson, chairman of the Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce & Industry. "But we're going to function as a single, clear voice for 
business in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's business community, which has remained largely in the 
background as the county tumbled this month into history's biggest municipal 
bankruptcy, presented a united front during a news conference Wednesday at the 
Center Club in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of government being over here and business being over there are 
over," said Loren C. Pannier, chief financial officer at CKE Restaurants in 
Anaheim and chairman of the Industrial League of Orange County, which will 
co-sponsor the business task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a way to insert ourself into the process" of restoring the 
county's health, Pannier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior business executives said they have not sought active roles in 
containing the crisis up to now because the situation has been so fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to find out what's going on before you can help," said William P. 
Foley II, president of Fidelity National Financial Inc. and chairman of CKE 
Restaurants, parent company of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to business observers, the task force's success or failure will be 
determined by its ability to harness the county's top corporate movers and 
shakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for this to work, it's got to be the power people in Orange County 
doing it," said Dennis Aigner, dean of the School of Management at University 
of California, Irvine. "We've got to get business people to go inside 
(government offices) at least temporarily to see what can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was short on specifics -- in large part, Pannier said, because the 
county is still struggling to get a grip on the crisis. "An attempt is being 
made to make (the crisis) more factual, less emotional, to calm it down," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said county supervisors and state officials have endorsed the 
creation of a business-driven team that would function much like the "red 
teams" that government and business leaders have formed in recent years to keep 
disgruntled companies from leaving California. 
</P>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, now a financial consultant to Orange 
County, said Wednesday that some members of the county's business community, 
such as Irvine Co., have stepped forward to "offer encouragement and advice" 
but that none has offered any direct financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will incorporate "some of the best financial minds" in the 
county, Mickelson said. Taco Bell Corp. Chairman John Martin, Fluor Corp. 
Chairman Leslie G. McCraw and Rockwell International Corp. Chairman Donald R. 
Beall are expected to take active roles in the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are being made for an East Coast trip in the next two weeks to lobby 
Wall Street investment firms and Washington lawmakers. The message, Mickelson 
said, will be simple: "Business is bullish on Orange County. Business is not 
bankrupt. We are economically strong and vital." 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders also pledged to use their "resources and mental horsepower" 
to help elected officials as they tackle tough questions that are sure to 
surface as the 187 municipal governments, school districts and agencies 
participating in the county's bankrupt investment fund struggle to balance 
their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Orange County Chamber of Commerce & Industry and the 
Industrial League -- which Wednesday announced plans to merge by spring -- 
voiced unanimous opposition to any tax increases or higher user fees as 
solutions to the fiscal debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to raise taxes," Pannier said. "We've got to determine what can 
be done (to cut government expenses) before we start asking people for more and 
taking more money out of the economy."

FACTORY OUTPUT HIGH, BUT INFLATION SLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's factories are pushing closer to capacity although signs of 
inflation remain sparse. Analysts say the Federal Reserve is bound to raise 
interest rates yet again to check economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnaround in food and energy costs sent consumer prices up 0.3% in 
November, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The gain was the largest since 
August, but analysts said there are no signs of an impending price spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the nation is ending its third straight year of price increases under 
3% -- the first time that has happened in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve reported that U.S. factories operated in 
November at their highest capacity in 5 1/2 years as industrial production 
climbed 0.5% for the 17th advance in 18 months. Auto production increased 
nearly 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "These reports tell the Federal Reserve they don't need to panic, although we 
are past most economists' definition of full employment," said Roger Brinner, 
of DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. "The 
economy needs to be slowed down. But we're not at any crisis point on 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predicted no change in the timetable for the next round of interest 
rate increases. They said they expect the Fed to take no action when its policy 
makers meet Tuesday, waiting instead until Feb. 1 after the first such meeting 
of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Commerce Department said the deficit in the U.S. 
current account bulged 10% to $41.7 billion in the third quarter, the largest 
trade gap in nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The current account is the broadest measure of foreign trade, covering 
merchandise, services and investment flows. The huge imbalance mirrored the 
trend in monthly reports showing deteriorating U.S. trade as the economy 
boosted imports while U.S. businesses lost export sales because of weakness in 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports generally were in line with Wall Street expectations and financial 
markets rallied. The Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain of 31 points. 
Bond yields fell, but later rose, with the yield on the 30-year bond at 7.86%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Consumer Price Index, up just 0.1% in October and 0.2% in September, was 
rising at an annual rate of 2.7% through November and almost certainly will be 
under 3% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predicted the good news will not deter the Fed from pushing interest 
rates higher to tighten credit because the central bank is convinced economic 
growth is too strong to keep inflation at bay much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve wants growth held down to around 2.5%.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; EXPECT MORE TRAVELERS, MORE TRIPS 
IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Business travel, after a tough start in the early part of this decade, is well 
on the road to recovery, according to recent projections by the United States 
Travel Data Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall travel will grow in 1995, including the business travel segment, said 
Shawn Flaherty, spokeswoman for the center. "The economy is better, and people 
are feeling good about their finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "And not just people, but companies too," she said. After several years of 
restructuring and internal turmoil, many companies have begun to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies may be settling down, but they aren't staying put, say travel 
managers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I really see growing in 1995 is international travel," said Tom 
Nulty of Associated Travel International, a San Diego-based super-regional 
travel agency specializing in corporate travel. With markets becoming 
increasingly global, business travelers will be going abroad more in an effort 
to expand the markets for their products and services, he said, adding, "The 
Pacific Rim and Europe will be hot markets for 1995."  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Travel Data Center projects an overall increase in travel of 5% in 
1994, with slightly greater growth in the business segment. Growth will 
continue at about a 4% rate in 1995, Flaherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishers of Official Airline Guides are even more optimistic, projecting 
a 5% to 6% growth rate next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, travelers will have taken 1.12 billion trips, including 293 million 
business trips, Flaherty said. In 1995, the center is projecting an estimated 
1.2 billion trips overall, including 307 million for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some travel managers are already feeling the increase. December is 
typically a slower month for business travel, said Jackie Ludwig, business 
manager of Santa Cruz Travel in Santa Cruz. "But we're doing a lot of it for 
the next two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth will come not only from more business people hitting the road, but 
from the increasing frequency of trips among those who are already traveling, 
Flaherty said. Approximately 39.8 million people will have traveled on business 
in 1994, an increase of 13% over 1991. By the end of the year, the average 
business traveler will have taken six trips, up from 5.2 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increasing number of travelers and trips, there will continue to 
be a strong effort to conserve costs on the road.  
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to a lot of business customers who ask how (they) can take advantage 
of cheaper fares," Nulty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said more corporate travelers are considering Saturday night stays to 
get better fares, and are trying to stay at hotels that include a meal in their 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies are saving money by cutting back on luxuries. "Instead of 
flying first class, they're traveling coach," said Shannon Roche, travel 
manager at Bugle Boy Industries in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some good news for companies trying to decrease corporate travel 
costs this year, at least in California, Nulty said. Business travelers going 
between the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area should benefit from the 
aggressive price war between low-cost carriers Southwest Airlines, Reno Air and 
Shuttle by United. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making its annual forecast, the U.S. Travel Data Center also 
released results of its latest survey of business travelers and their habits.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Men outnumber women as business travelers (61% compared to 39%). 
</P>
<P>
 * About a third of business travelers belong to an airline frequent-flier 
program, and the average business traveler participates in two of them. In 
addition, 16% belong to a hotel frequent-stay program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approximately 70% of business travelers make their trips alone, and 21% 
travel with one other person. The rest travel in larger groups.  
</P>
<P>
 * The average business trip lasts four days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Travelers who reported flying within the past year took an average of four 
trips. Only 11%, or about 2.3 million, said they took more than 10 trips a year 
by air. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approximately half of all business trips were for the primary purpose of 
attending conventions, seminars or trade shows.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; CAPITAL GAINS UNCERTAINTY PROVES TAXING TO ISRAELI 
INVESTORS; MIDEAST: PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN IS TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT 
PROPOSAL, BUT SOME SAY HE MAY BE BACKING AWAY FROM IT.

<P>
 The fate of a planned capital gains tax has dominated the news in Israel this 
week, stealing headlines from the Nobel Peace Prize, guerrilla violence and an 
unprecedented trip to Japan by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 To tax or not to tax -- the question, coming just weeks before the levy is due 
to take effect, has stirred fevered debate and sent the stock market on a 
roller coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty has been heightened by the absence of Rabin, who is visiting 
Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax proposal has upset investors in Israel's active stock market, long 
viewed as the only place where heavily taxed and inflation-ravaged Israelis 
could make money and legally keep their earnings away from the tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Hounded by Israeli reporters accompanying him from Oslo -- where he received 
the Nobel Prize over the weekend along with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and 
PLO leader Yasser Arafat -- a tight-lipped Rabin has refused to comment on the 
tax, a 10% levy on stock trading profits approved by Parliament last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But banner headlines in Israeli newspapers, quoting sources close to Rabin, 
portray him as leaning toward postponing implementation new the tax, which is 
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of reports prompted a peeved Rabin to deny having authorized anyone 
in his entourage to speak about the tax.  
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified sources were quoted as saying Rabin was weighing three 
options: delaying the tax for one to two years, a shorter delay, or making the 
tax contingent on comprehensive tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in my entourage was authorized to speak in my name on the subject of 
the bourse," Rabin told Israel Radio, adding that he will speak about the tax 
when he returns home early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin publicly resisted the tax for months, only to endorse it when it was 
announced in August. 
</P>
<P>
 He stunned Israelis at the time by saying they should not expect the country's 
prime minister and finance minister "to tell the whole truth" on tax policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Army radio said recent opinion polls showing the tax had cut deeply into 
Rabin's popularity sparked his reported change of heart on implementing it. He 
faces reelection in 1996, and his Labor Party is already in trouble over the 
peace agreement with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Radio shows have been flooded by telephone calls from frustrated Israeli 
investors opposed to the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average guy on the street has money in the Israeli stock market, whether 
through direct investments or through mutual funds and savings plans, and has 
lost a lot of money in 1994," said economist Jonathan Katz of consulting firm 
Capital Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Israelis were encouraged by easy credit available from banks last year to 
take out loans to buy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 They then watched their investments dry up as the benchmark Mishtanim Index 
fell 30.5% since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the capital gains tax alone, which was announced in August, cannot 
be blamed for the market's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people are looking for something optimistic to get the market out of its 
slump," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's a game of politics now. The Labor Party has seen its popularity 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Abraham Shohat, a strong supporter of the tax, said he 
managed to speak to the elusive Rabin by telephone Tuesday and told him party 
members still back the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting of Labor deputies Monday, the brouhaha over the tax provoked 
an outburst from Transport Minister Yisrael Kessar, Rabin's temporary 
replacement and the only Cabinet minister noted for his customary silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every country has a capital gains tax!" Kessar shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why shouldn't Israel?"

 The economy has deteriorated largely because of a decline in world prices for 
cocoa and coffee and the depletion of the nation's forests. Efforts to impose 
economic austerity have led to civil unrest, but the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank are pressing for reforms before granting new loan 
credits.

 Russian Debt Payments Rescheduled: Russia agreed to pay Western commercial 
banks $500 million in back interest by April and got another three-month 
extension on payment of its $26-billion principal.The agreement ended two days 
of talks between a Russian delegation led by Deputy Finance Minister Andrei P. 
Vavilov and representatives of about 600 creditors, led by Deutsche Bank of 
Germany. Under the accord, Russia will pay the banks $100 million by year's end 
and another $400 million by April. The money will be held in trust until the 
debt-restructuring agreement is finalized. The $500 million to be paid by April 
reflects back interest owed by Russia for 1992 and '93.

 Venezuela Financial Crisis Brings New Takeover: The country's longstanding 
money woes claimed a new victim with the state takeover of one of the nation's 
largest banking and insurance groups. Authorities had attempted in August to 
strengthen and pump fresh capital into Grupo Latinoamericana Progreso, which 
controls 15 companies in Venezuela and others in Colombia, Panama, the 
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. But that plan failed, and they took 
possession of the consortium early Wednesday for the nominal payment of one 
Venezuelan bolivar, less than one cent.

O LITTLE SAIGON; ASIAN GARDEN SHOPPERS CAN BREAK WITH TRADITION AND SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In many ways the holiday season at Asian Garden Mall in Westminster is no 
different than at any other mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas carols blare over the loudspeakers. Stores are trimmed in lights and 
garlands, and poinsettias decorate a stage where a holiday music program takes 
place Christmas Eve. Children sit on Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those who want a different holiday shopping experience head for Asian 
Garden Mall, in the heart of Little Saigon, which has the largest Vietnamese 
population outside of Vietnam. Part bustling street bazaar, part traditional 
shopping center, Asian Garden Mall is like no other mall in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign that things are different here: large white statues of the 
Happy Buddha and the gods of longevity, prosperity and fortune that greet 
shoppers at the mall's entrance. Inside the two-story structure, colorful shops 
bear signs in Vietnamese and English. Many stores and kiosks overflow with a 
hodgepodge of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 (Shoppers who visit the mall between now and Little Saigon's Tet Festival Feb. 
3 to 5 will find the shops even more packed with goods in anticipation of the 
annual lunar new year celebration.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain hunters can find kiosks stocked with look-alike Chanel, Gucci and 
Dooney & Bourke handbags ($20 each) and inexpensive costume jewelry, including 
some Austrian crystal earrings and necklaces like those seen at fine department 
stores. In the upstairs "island," crowded stalls are filled with children's 
clothes, unusual imported toys, hair bows, lingerie and designer name T-shirts 
(three for $10). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little bit different from your typical mall," says Zyta Sulek of 
Irvine, who brought two friends visiting from Canada to search out bargains and 
experience the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers come here seeking gold. One entire wing of the top floor is 
devoted to jewelry -- 112 individual merchants who sell 18- and 24-karat gold 
jewelry, jade, pearls and other gemstones. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get much better deals on jewelry here," says Debbie Falcon, a Garden 
Grove resident who recently visited the mall with her husband, Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants' cases are filled with gold baubles, making traditional jewelry 
store cases look sparse by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a unique way of displaying a lot of merchandise in a small space," 
says Kathy Buchoz, manager of Asian Garden Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hoa Phung jewelry store, a pair of 24-karat gold hoop earrings sell for 
$50. Leather goods are also popular; a $600 designer leather handbag might be 
$100 cheaper here than in other malls, Buchoz says. 
</P>
<P>
 People come from all over, lured by the prospect of bargains or to find that 
odd gewgaw one can't find any place else. Looking for a glow-in-the-dark statue 
of Our Lady of Fatima? It's here. Buddhas of every description? They're all 
over. Bolts of silk and velvet from Asia? You've come to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also more typical mall fare. Isana carries authentic name-brand 
perfumes and leather goods, including Pierre Cardin shoes and Christian Dior 
belts for men (usually at 20% off). Sunstation has assorted designer sunglasses 
from Calvin Klein, L.A. Eyeworks and other well-known makers (a pair of Donna 
Karan wire-rim sunglasses is $245). 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers, especially those who have trouble fitting into regular sizes, 
come here for custom-made suits, shirts and shoes. The mall is ideal for people 
who wear petite sizes. Several shops carry fine Italian suits of 100% wool. 
</P>
<P>
 Such amenities have drawn shoppers from outside the Vietnamese community, 
Buchoz says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Nguyen, director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster, 
warns shoppers to be careful if they are the first to visit a shop in the 
morning. Should they pause to admire an item, the shopkeepers will expect them 
to buy it -- not to do so will mean bad luck for the shop the rest of the day. 
Uncooperative customers risk disappointing the shopkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers also discover that much of the merchandise has no price tag. In this 
mall, shopkeepers expect customers to bargain for their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to look at the quality, the price, then bargain," Nguyen says. The 
shopkeeper "will look at your face and attitude" to arrive at a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers also need to check their purchases thoroughly; quality can vary from 
store to store, Nguyen says. Isana, for instance, offers authentic leather 
handbags from Courregees of Paris, Guess and other well-known lines. However, 
at a kiosk downstairs, the faux designer handbags often lack the quality of the 
real thing, but with a $20 price tag, many shoppers simply don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter bought 10 of them," Buchoz says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower prices are due to lower overhead: Not only do stores pay lower rents 
than at most other malls, says Buchoz, but often they employ family members to 
work the store. In addition, most inventory is imported from Asia, where labor 
is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one other distinguishing characteristic of Asian Garden Mall, Buchoz 
says: The mall is open 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be the only mall open on Christmas Day," she says.

ICONS OF STYLE; CLOUT. PANACHE. THE 14 WOMEN WHO GRACE THE PAGES OF A NEW LOOK 
AT -- DARE WE SAY IT? -- POWER HAD IT. AND OTHERS COULDN'T WAIT TO COPY THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 14 women taste-makers limned in Annette Tapert and Diana Edkins' 
fascinating new book, "The Power of Style" (Crown Publishers), have only two 
things in common: They were all thin, and other women envied them. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, they are a diverse lot. Several, such as Rita Lydig, who sat for 
painter John Singer Sargent, were hauntingly beautiful. Others, including Elsie 
de Wolfe and Diana Vreeland, were as plain as milk toast. Some -- designer Coco 
Chanel is the premier example -- were wildly successful entrepreneurs, while 
others did little more than manage, albeit spectacularly, the complex 
households of their wealthy spouses. Some were quietly kind, while others, 
notably Daisy Fellowes, were upper-crust sadists who turned their yachts into 
torture chambers with attentive staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 What links these women, beyond a penchant for chic clothes, nonstop jewelry, 
white flowers and small dogs, is their gift for creating a personal style that 
other women clamored to copy. As Chanel boasted, "If I cut my hair, others did. 
If I shortened my dresses, so did everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to have sworn off shaving your legs to wonder if power is quite 
the right word for a person's ability to get free fashions, as so many of these 
women did, because designers knew other women would wear almost anything these 
icons of style put on their uniformly bony backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Power in the larger world means what President John F. Kennedy had -- the 
ability to shape events and institutions. Not what "Power of Style" subject 
Jackie Kennedy Onassis had -- the ability to tug at a nation's heartstrings and 
move large numbers of pillbox hats. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever you call the special quality of these women -- clout, influence 
or panache -- they left their distinctive mark on their times, even if the vast 
majority of men are utterly unaware of it. De Wolfe, for instance, who died at 
80-something in 1949, single-handedly created the profession of interior 
decorating. It was she who persuaded millions of American women that the 
quality of their lives would soar if they only swathed those pesky sofas and 
easy chairs in yards of cheerful chintz, a design philosophy that persists in 
many circles today. As Tapert points out, De Wolfe was in the business of 
selling lifestyle long before such contemporary merchants as Ralph Lauren and 
Martha Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Edkins, who lives in New Jersey, mined such pop-culture archives as the files 
of Vogue magazine in whose pages many of these women cast their weird spell to 
find the photos that contribute so much to the book's effect. Manhattan writer 
Tapert supplied the text. "This book is so much about self-invention," says 
Tapert, whose other writings include collections of soldiers' letters and a 
joint autobiography of Siegfried and Roy, Las Vegas' white-tiger guys. "We all 
have two lives: the one you're given and the one you make." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of Tapert's women were born to wealth and some had looks that 
could be highly leveraged, others fashioned their widely imitated lifestyles 
out of very unpromising materials indeed. Tapert cites the example of Pauline 
de Rothschild, who turned her husband's once neglected French vineyard, Chateau 
Mouton Rothschild, into a synonym for sophisticated style. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she eventually became a baroness, De Rothschild survived a ghastly 
childhood. Tapert describes how the 12-year-old Pauline, half-starved and 
weakened by rheumatic fever, was living in a fleabag Parisian hotel "with a 
mother who was one step up from a hooker." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of succumbing to despair, Pauline was able to focus on the single 
object of beauty in that pitiful hotel room, an enormous bouquet of lilies and 
white lilacs. Those flowers became her signature. As Tapert notes, illness, 
philandering husbands, losing their fortunes, even the ravages of time did not 
deter her subjects from their fierce devotion to style. It was their 
consolation and their revenge as well as their legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 When unpleasantness entered her subjects' lives, Tapert says, "They blocked it 
out. They moved on." What quality of character allowed them to become originals 
is a mystery, Tapert says. She notes that in the course of writing the book, 
she often found herself asking, "Where did this woman find the confidence to be 
different?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Tapert developed a certain respect for all the women whose lives she 
examined. "In order to look that good takes an enormous amount of work and a 
lot of discipline," she says. Her favorite was Millicent Rogers, a gorgeous 
blonde best known for her groundbreaking collection of Native American art and 
a bittersweet affair with Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 The only woman Tapert never warmed to was the Duchess of Windsor. "She really 
was vacuous," says Tapert, suggesting that the duchess' best and highest use 
was keeping the duke from dwelling too much on the throne he had given up for 
the woman he loved. (Tapert makes note of the rumor that the duchess was really 
a man.) 
</P>
<P>
 While all 14 women succeeded fabulously as makers of taste, they had variable 
success in that other area so important to most women -- as mothers. Several of 
the women swapped their children for handsome settlements when they divorced, 
although the truth may be that their husbands used their superior power in 
arenas other than style to ensure that they got custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Fellowes was one of the non-model mothers. A celebrated socialite of the 
'20s and '30s, Fellowes was once walking in the park when she spotted a group 
of especially well-dressed little girls. "Whose lovely little children are 
those?" she asked their nurse. "Yours, Madame" was the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellowes' sense of style was evident in even the most tiresome circumstances. 
Tapert tells the story of the time Fellowes discovered she had caught gonorrhea 
from one of her many lovers. Fellowes informed the gentleman in a telephone 
call in which all she did was clap, clap, clap into the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of today's women practice the religion of table decoration with 
the fanaticism of an Elsie de Wolfe, Tapert thinks that many contemporary women 
have unfulfilled aesthetic needs (how else to explain how Martha Stewart sells 
magazines by urging them to make their own chocolate cups and Craftsman-style 
birdhouses?). "There's a message in the book, a subtle message," Tapert says. 
"I think a lot of women are really afraid these days to bring out their 
aesthetic side. But I think you can be elegant, and I think you can be feminine 
and still compete. You don't have to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 A former actress, Tapert says she wouldn't want to be any of the women she 
profiled, but she did find take-home lessons in their lives. In writing the 
book, she says, "I realized more than ever how far good manners go." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she is far less confrontational than she used to be. She also 
pays much closer attention to the myriad details that add up to stylishness. 
She spends more time making sure her clothes fit perfectly. "And," she 
confesses, "I put everything on satin hangers now."

FIRST PERSON: THIS MACHO MENACE RULES THE ROOST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not since junior high had I seen such a raw assertion of male fury. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd scoffed when my family told stories at dinner of how this adolescent thug 
kept them cowering behind closed doors. I shrugged it off when I heard that 
this urban predator chased my 5-year-old son and his kindergarten pal to the 
top of our jungle gym and kept them perched there in terror as he taunted and 
strutted. 
</P>
<P>
 I even laughed it off when my wife, Pam, said he had rammed his head under her 
skirt and ravaged her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 But early one morning, when my 7- and 10-year-old daughters ran shrieking into 
the house, I decided to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 We hadn't anticipated this frightening turn of events last spring, when we 
agreed to accept the fluffy yellow chicks that my daughter's first-grade class 
had incubated. 
</P>
<P>
 The puffballs blossomed into a striking pair. Both have rich, rusty-orange 
plumage with black streaks. But while the hen, Henny Penny, is inherently 
good-natured, the rooster, Chile Pepper, has a hard-wired mean streak. A wild 
spray of iridescent green tail feathers and a coxcomb that is a sea of bright 
red cresting waves perfectly match his innate propensity for macho bluster. 
</P>
<P>
 That attribute came home to roost quickly. One morning, Pam answered a knock 
on the door of our house, which sits on a hill within sight of Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a social call," our neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam suspected as much. For one thing, it was not yet 7. For another, this 
usually sweet woman's eyes were spinning in her head like flaming pinwheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors had told us that they enjoyed the rooster's nascent crowing. 
They said it reminded them of the country; that it was something of an antidote 
to the sirens and gunshots that usually trouble our deepest sleep here in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, in a bold guerrilla action, the children caught the hen and cock 
as they roosted and stuck them in the cage they'd been avoiding since 
adolescence. "Now what?" we wondered. Someone pointed out that the cage fit 
neatly into Pam's new sideboard. In a moment of desperation, the kids shoved in 
the cage and shut the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird went off at 6 the next morning. Er-er-ERRR-rrr, Er-er-ERRRRR-rrr.  
</P>
<P>
 Our house rattled as it had on Jan. 17. But the neighbor didn't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chile, however, was hardly cowed by his nocturnal incarceration. His reign of 
terror continued. A few mornings later, I committed to the showdown. The time 
was ripe, I decided, to teach the kids something about facing fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullies -- physical, psychological, spiritual, political -- are contemptuous 
of weakness, I told them. Back a bully down quickly, and peace prevails. Show 
fear or indecision and he'll push in and take your soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooster had decided that our back yard was his turf, I mumbled as I 
marched toward the back door. Was that a reasonable conclusion? No. Did it show 
extraordinary disrespect for me and my family, who wanted only to live in 
harmony? Yes!  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll show that bird who's boss," I said, startled that a John Wayne, Col. 
Sanders-like twang had crept into my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam and the kids eased out behind me and stood by the screen door. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooster glimpsed me and went into ritualistic battle preparations. He 
raked his yellow talons through the lawn. He huffed out the feathers on his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexplicably, my pulse kicked into high gear. I crouched, trying to seem 
casual. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooster scuttled sideways, edging closer, until I was looking straight 
into his hard little eyes. In the fiery glow of those black-and-yellow disks I 
saw a dozen junior high bullies and barroom brawlers: Eyes reckless drunk on 
pure testosterone; eyes fearless with rage and adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, rooster," I snarled. At which he charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single startled motion, I rocketed to my feet and punted, sending that 
fat, feathery football eight feet down our steeply sloping lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperventilating, I turned to my family. They stared at me with a collective, 
pitying look that is impossible to describe or to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a you just kicked a chicken look. 
</P>
<P>
 More precisely, it was a the day is just starting and you've already subjected 
your family to the humiliating sight of their demented father, in his pajamas, 
trying to prove his masculinity by kicking a helpless family pet who is now 
emotionally scarred for life look. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooster, in fact, wasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the following weeks, he continued to grow. Our back yard has come to 
resemble a small Jurassic Park. Anyone who ventures in is stalked and then 
shredded by a bird the size of an ostrich and as ferocious as any velociraptor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam spoke to some friends in the neighborhood who also have roosters. They 
told her that for a time, in hopes that the cocks would not notice them, they 
put paper bags on their heads whenever they went out to garden. Now they never 
venture into their yard without swathing their legs in cardboard armor. 
</P>
<P>
 I was embarrassed for them. I was embarrassed for us for having such friends 
(although they were the only ones who empathized with our big fear -- that 
dinner guests might investigate our dining room's clucking sideboard.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than similarly sacrifice my dignity, I decided to put my knowledge of 
evolutionary psychology to work. My kids have a red plastic devil's pitchfork, 
a leftover from Halloweens past. Figuring that Chile needed to know this 
household's true pecking order, I held the fork over my head like a coxcomb and 
strutted around the yard like a cocksure, combative rooster. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile was too bewildered to attack. But as soon as I left, he was back 
assaulting squirrels, doves, sparrows, cats and kids -- then crowing defiantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brainstorm: I grabbed my old trumpet and stepped cautiously into the 
yard. The rooster spotted me. His eyes gleamed insanely. He dug and postured, 
edging sideways, puffing his wings. When he lunged, I let loose: 
Bleeh-blee-BLEEH-bleh, I trumpeted, aiming the sound right at his rage-filled, 
pea-sized, brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile backed away in bewilderment. But the effect didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings now, I watch him through our kitchen window, his yellow eyes 
burning with blood lust, daring me to step outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Please don't take this as a modern fable. It is simply a sad story. A story 
without resolution. A story of one man and a chicken.

YOUR PERFUME IS MAKING THEM SICK; OVERWHELMED BY THE SCENTS OF CHEMICALS IN 
PRODUCTS AND IN THE AIR, SOME ACTIVISTS ARE LEADING THE PUSH FOR A MORE 
FRAGRANCE-FREE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marie Schmidt of Arcadia cringes when she sees her monthly department store 
bills in the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt isn't worried about making payments. She is worried about getting sick 
from fragrance strips that some stores include with their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start sneezing and my nose starts running the minute I smell them," says 
Schmidt, whose respiratory system goes on red alert at the least whiff of 
scented products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like cigarette smoking," she complains. "They are invading my 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether she realizes it or not, Schmidt is part of what could be the next big 
nationwide battle that pits individual rights against public health concerns: 
the push for fragrance-free environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years from now it will be politically incorrect to wear perfumes in 
public," predicts Paul Imperiale, disability coordinator for the mayor's office 
in San Francisco. That city's fragrance-free plan, drafted in 1990, was never 
enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 With Americans now using perhaps a dozen scented personal-care products each 
day, fragrance foes' basic argument is this: your right to wear these products 
ends where my chemical sensitivities begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say those sensitivities are heightened by chronic sinus problems 
(suffered by 33 million Americans, according to the Asthma and Allergy 
Foundation of America) or allergies (endured by more than 50 million of us). 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond perfume, activists for fragrance-free environments are targeting 
restaurant bathrooms with those pungent deodorizers, office buildings that use 
pesticides and astringent cleaning products, and the neighborhood mall, whose 
host of synthetic odors assault the nostrils, especially around the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are putting so much into our environment that people are getting sick. I 
don't think it's a matter of personal rights now, I think it's a matter of 
everyone's health," says Joan Ripple, a consultant to state Sen. Milton Marks, 
who chaired a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the rights of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Marks, a San Francisco Democrat whose district includes Marin 
County, sponsored a controversial bill to deal with environmental chemicals and 
fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which was opposed by the fragrance and cleaning industries, would 
have required the management of all public buildings to post when the last 
pesticide application was and the chemicals used. It also asked people to 
refrain voluntarily from wearing fragrances to public meetings and designated 
fragrance-free zones near window or doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the bill failed last spring, the sentiment behind it appears 
to be growing. Consider these developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Tuesday, the City of Oakland approved a wide-ranging policy that 
accommodates those with chemical sensitivities. The policy requires the city to 
provide fragrance-free meeting areas for chemically sensitive individuals who 
need to meet with city employees. They will be asked to refrain from wearing 
scented products on that day. The policy still needs full council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several months ago, the University of Minnesota's School of Social Work 
banned students and faculty from using perfumes, colognes, shampoos and other 
products that might trigger allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Santa Cruz, officials have passed a resolution supporting the concept of 
smoke-free and fragrance-free environments as part of the city's implementation 
of the Americans With Disabilities Act. The city wants to "discourage the use 
of fragrances within city facilities and vehicles" and "provide information on 
alternative products which are fragrance-free." 
</P>
<P>
 * Marin County has set up fragrance-free zones where those with chemical 
sensitivities can sit during the monthly public hearings on county parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Boise, Idaho, Pastor Jon K. Brown of the First United Methodist Church 
has launched a fragrance-free service each Sunday at 2 p.m. He says his wife 
has multiple chemical sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In public policy terms, this could be defined as an issue of handicapped 
access, just like having a wheelchair ramp into a church or public building," 
Brown says. "To have services that aren't fragrance-free is to deny services to 
a group of people whose population is growing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple chemical sensitivity, or MCS, has been hotly debated in recent years, 
mainly because no one can conclusively say whether it exists. Suffers describe 
MCS as a hypersensitivity to synthetic chemical compounds ranging from Lysol to 
L'Air du Temps. They complain of symptoms that include headaches, nausea, 
dizziness, respiratory difficulties, fatigue and fainting. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some doctors regularly treat patients with MCS, others challenge its 
very existence and suggest that MCS could be psychosomatic. The California 
Medical Assn. doesn't recognize MCS; the American Medical Assn. does not list 
it on its roster of recognized diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "MCS is not an accepted medical disorder," says Irene Malbin, vice president 
of public affairs for the Washington, D.C.-based Cosmetic, Toiletry and 
Fragrance Assn. "There's no scientific or medical evidence that fragrances 
adversely affect public health. And it seems very unfair that people are now 
saying that you can't use products that are safe and regulated by the FDA (and) 
which the vast majority of people enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, support groups are springing up across the nation to lobby for 
legislative changes, and Congress has appropriated $250,000 to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Caprari, 34, of Pasadena, says he has no doubt about the reality of 
MCS. If he uses commercial shampoo, he has trouble breathing. If he slathers on 
scented deodorants, he breaks out in a rash under his arms. Caprari can't even 
wear clothes that have been washed in regular detergent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a concern," Caprari says. "I go to great lengths to be unscented." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stuart Epstein, an allergist who practices in Beverly Hills, treats many 
patients with chemical sensitivities and says those who have never experienced 
them may find it hard to believe that the problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms can be fleeting and depend on the type of chemical exposure, 
proximity and length of exposure, and other environmental factors, such as 
ventilation, Epstein says. Most people with chemical sensitivities also have a 
history of allergies, he adds. Some may have had their immune system affected 
by previous exposure to environmental chemicals such as pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say there is confusion about how fragrances and cleaning products 
affect these people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically it's not an allergy, it's an irritant, but people get mixed up 
because the symptoms are the same, the lungs constrict and air passages 
narrow," says Dawn Marvin, director of communications for the Asthma and 
Allergy Foundation of America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most perfumes on the market today are mainly synthetic, containing on average 
only 5% natural oils. Likewise, products labeled "fragrance-free" often contain 
fragrances that mask the stinky raw materials to create a neutral scent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in detergents, there are chemicals that don't smell particularly 
good, so you want to add a fragrance to neutralize them so people can use the 
product," says Malbin, of the fragrance industry association. 
</P>
<P>
 Public agencies that attempt to regulate the use of scented products -- 
cleaning, personal care and environmental -- are learning that the industry has 
a lot of clout. Two years ago, the city of Oakland drafted a policy requiring 
public meeting notices to include the statement: "In consideration of persons 
with disabilities, we ask people to voluntarily refrain from wearing perfumed 
personal care products to this event." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Margen, equal opportunity specialist with the Oakland city manager's 
office, says the city was "hammered" by industry lobbyists and representatives, 
some of whom flew in from the East Coast to organize local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a lawyer in a wheelchair and Avon Ladies saying this was going to 
cut into their market," Margen recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the brouhaha, fragrance advertising in magazines is still big 
business, exceeding $93 million last year, according to Leading National 
Advertisers, a New York firm. Yet a survey by Bruskin Goldring Research Firm in 
Edison, N.Y., found that 29% of 1,000 people surveyed disliked fragrance strip 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Pashby, senior vice president for Magazine Publishers of America, an 
industry group, says most magazines have the capability to offer fragrance-free 
editions but that few subscribers request it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Chang, publisher of Harper's Bazaar -- which gets three-quarters of 
its advertising revenue from beauty, cosmetics and fragrance companies -- says 
most of her customers relish the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like shopping as you go through the magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Yorker provides several hundred of its 816,000-strong circulation with 
scent-free copies, says Maurie Perl, vice president for public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology has also improved, making scents less invasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to basically soak the paper in fragrance and send it out to 
consumers," Pashby says. Now, the fragrance is encapsulated in bubbles or 
"scratch and sniff" type formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in time too. A 1992 California law requires magazine distributors to keep 
scents from escaping the ads before the strips are opened. Violators can be 
fined only $100 for each mass mailing, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those with fragrance sensitivities, this remains the grueling season. Half 
of all annual perfume sales occur between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But department stores, at least, have become more cautious since a 
Bloomingdale's patron received a $75,000 out-of-court settlement after being 
hospitalized for 11 days in critical condition in 1989, after having been 
sprayed with unwanted perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 These days most "fragrance models" in department stores ask first, then spray 
or offer a fragrance strip you can hold to your nose as you mull over that 
perfect present for Aunt Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Destito, a fragrance model at the Broadway in Arcadia, uses scented 
silk roses to introduce customers to Byblos and Cabotine perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say they can't smell the roses because they're allergic to 
perfume, but not very often," Destito says. "If I notice them shying away, I'll 
be more careful about how I approach them." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just fine with Melinda Wright of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 While she doesn't break out in a rash or get a headache from perfumes, Wright 
sees it as an issue of personal choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I wanted to try some perfume on," Wright says, "I would do it myself."

THRIFTY AND NEEDY BENEFIT WHEN COUTURE IS RECYCLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ever thought of owning a Valentino or St. John but felt guilty about spending 
so much money when it could go to a shelter for abused children or to emergency 
health services for AIDS patients? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, then, the small group of secondhand boutiques that offer fashion 
fans a chance to look and feel good. These shops are filled with gently used 
designer togs, jewelry, footwear, hats and accessories at a fraction of the 
original cost. Sales benefit community charities and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's consumerism with a conscience.  
</P>
<P>
 And the second chance these clothes get -- many of them elegant ball gowns, 
cocktail dresses and smart lunch suits -- fit another favorite theme of the 
decade: recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nature of these donations, which come mostly from local society 
mavens, it's tough to tell whether these once-pricey wares were ever worn, and 
some -- still tagged with the store price ticket -- never were worn. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling of stores where you can buy a holiday gown and spread 
holiday cheer. Saddleback Memorial Medical Center Thrift Store  
</P>
<P>
 Friday and Saturday, and the third Friday and Saturday of every month, the 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center Thrift Store in Laguna Hills transforms into 
the Couture Shop, spotlighting donations in mint condition with designer 
labels. Possible finds include items from DKNY, Anne Klein, Perry Ellis, 
Missoni and, for those vintage fans, Lilli Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, someone picked up a St. John dress for $40. A preview of this 
weekend's goods included a forest green Ann Taylor suit ($45) and a pink Diane 
Von Furstenberg wrap-around dress ($9). 
</P>
<P>
 Hatboxes, costume jewelry and watches are among the items that came from local 
estates. The monthly event brings in thousands of dollars for the medical 
center's programs, such as its women's clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Memorial Medical Center Thrift Store, 23740 El Toro Road, Lake 
Forest. (714) 586-6870. Open Monday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed 
Sunday. Stanley Market 
</P>
<P>
 With its mix of new and gently used clothes and accessories, the Stanley 
Market looks like many of the other boutiques in this upscale neighborhood. 
Take a closer look to to distinguish the difference -- it's obvious by the 
price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,540-square-foot space, which donates part of its proceeds to AIDS 
Services Foundation of Orange County, is a "Dynasty" diva's dream. It's loaded 
with many couture pieces, including a series of hand-beaded gowns by Gildas 
brought to the store by a collector of the local designer's fete frocks. 
There's a strapless column dress saturated in green and turquoise sequins for 
$2,500, considerably less than its originally cost. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of new suits and dresses from Leon Cliyne, another local 
favorite, including a hot pink peplum jacket and skirt ($120). The designer 
will be in attendance Sunday afternoon when the store celebrates its first 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the one-of-a-kinds, there is a wide selection of party wear: a 
draped Giorgio beaded jacket ($175); lots of gold and silver leather, including 
a gold bustier ($65) and a red Albert Nipon two-piece ($175). Among the 
accouterments are a Judith Lieber hot pink and black snakeskin handbag ($95) 
and Ralph Lauren Polo and Hermes ties ($25). 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise is accepted on consignment, and sales are split between store and 
clothes owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Market, 3420 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-1287. Open 
Monday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood Boutique 
</P>
<P>
 A gorgeous red and black Valentino dress for $198? Pinch yourself, it's a 
reality at the Orangewood Boutique, which contributes 100% of its revenue to 
the Orangewood Children's Foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps 
abused, abandoned and neglected children. The store, a landmark on the 
secondhand circuit for six years, offers an impressive selection of designer 
duds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover up in a perfect, red leather Mondi jacket ($148.50) or a fawn mink coat 
($900). 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of Irvine-based St. John here: a black knit dress covered in 
bright pink and gold paillettes ($250) and a navy sweater ($68.50). Find rarely 
worn shoes by Charles Jourdan, Bally and Bandolino, as well as hats, costume 
jewelry and handbags. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-in donations are carefully selected for the boutique, and those rejected 
are sent to other thrift stores. Consignment goods are accepted by appointment. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood Boutique, 2850 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 760-6640. 
Open Monday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 American Cancer Society Discovery Shop 
</P>
<P>
 Less glamorous than some, but still a source for treasures at a discount, is 
the American Cancer Society Discovery Shop. After more than a decade behind 
Ruby's, the store relocated to a larger space last summer, adding furniture to 
its mixed stock. 
</P>
<P>
 For fashions, it offers a pair of rhinestone necklaces ($25) and earrings 
($7.50) with a full beaded harlequin dress or strapless Victor Costa (each 
$50). A black, sheared chiffon dress bears the original $295 ticket but sells 
here for $85. If your idea of winter fun is casual and active, find like-new 
ski wear ($15 to $75) and a rack of new jeans from a store that went out of 
business ($6.50). 
</P>
<P>
 American Cancer Society Discovery Shop, 2301 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar.

CLOSET RX: SPRING FOR BARGAINS TO WEAR TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seen the clearance racks lately? Most discount and department stores still 
have a load of spring and summer clothing that they're almost giving away. It's 
hard not to pass on a silk blouse or a cotton net sweater that catches your 
eye, but it may be even harder putting it in the closet until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, you can wear some spring and summer clothing in 
fall and winter and not look like you've misplaced your calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our mild climate, you can get away with some summer clothing on 
nice days," says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "You just have 
to be careful about colors and fabrics. You don't want to look like an Easter 
egg at Christmastime." 
</P>
<P>
 Whites and blacks are shades that cross the seasons. Be wary of bright blues 
and pinks. However, with the right combination, you could make a summer color 
work in winter.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sky blue, powder pink and other spring shades are going to be big next 
season," says Liz Menzies of Swept Away Clothes to Go in Irvine. "You'll start 
seeing them displayed in January, so wearing them on a nice day could make you 
look like you're ahead of the trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer clothes often fit into the "layered look," which continues to be 
popular. "You could get away with a light blouse under a cotton sweater under a 
blazer. That kind of outfit works well during our kind of winters," Miller 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 "The slip dress, which was hot this past summer, can work for cooler weather," 
Menzies says. "If it's a neutral, a black or gray, you can match it with a 
long-sleeve 'baby' T-shirt, which is fitted and worn underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 The jumper dress that you probably put away in October can be paired with a 
cardigan. "It's part of the layered look, and it looks great when you add a 
pair of leggings," Menzies says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tan linen blazer I wear year-round," says clothing and jewelry 
designer Carol Steele of Newport Beach. "I'll often wear it with black or dark 
navy, which gives it a look that seems to work all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing summer clothes in the opposite season can also work when you change a 
few details.  
</P>
<P>
 "A cream outfit with a pastel scarf doesn't really go at this time of year," 
Menzies says. "But when you add a scarf with brown, olive and cream, it totally

time of year."

AT PERFUME COUNTER, IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THE NOSE KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 C har Bomboy, a "fragrance consultant" at Bullock's in South Coast Plaza, has 
been selling perfume for nearly three decades, and she's seen many changes over 
the years. One is that vendors aren't barricaded behind a counter -- "We call 
it 'the Fort' " -- anymore: "We stand on the other side so we can do more 
one-on-one with customers."  
</P>
<P>
 Other changes are that more men are into cologne; U.S. products are making 
their presence felt around the world, and less money is being spent launching 
new products: "There's a lot less wining and dining and romancing now," Bomboy 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We get visitors from all over the world at South Coast Plaza. We see so many 
different people that it's never dull. 
</P>
<P>
 The days of squirting people (are) gone, thank goodness. Years ago at 
Bloomingdale's in New York, customers complained about being attacked by the 
people selling fragrances, and they said they couldn't breathe in the store -- 
the air was too heavy with Giorgio. 
</P>
<P>
 We greet them. We always ask, "Would you like to try this?" and we never do 
anything without their OK. Also, we hand out creams and lotions, instead of 
sprays. I don't set myself up for rejection. People are in a hurry, but they 
love to take samples home to try. The samples are something to remember the 
store by. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing out in the open as I do, I'm constantly asked directions or store 
hours. I'm a great concierge; if I ever write a book about my life, it will be 
titled, "I Know Where the Bathroom Is." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason we have a full floor of fragrance counters is that sales warrant 
it. Fragrances are profitable for department stores. The business is growing; 
there are always new fragrances, and there's an excitement because of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, American woman only used one perfume, a spray or splash, but now they 
want accessories, like the body and bath items. And they want a fragrance 
wardrobe to match all their moods. Enjoying a fragrance is a very feminine, 
uplifting feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 About one out of 10 of our customers is a man. Ten years ago, men would go 
three blocks out of their way to avoid us, but now they are more knowledgeable 
and aware of their woman's taste. Some are quite adventuresome. 
</P>
<P>
 Men also buy fragrances for themselves, and balms, shave foams and deodorants. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of men's fragrances are purchased by women to wear. They like the 
way they react to their body chemistry, and they stay on longer. Calvin Klein's 
new fragrance is presented as one for men and women. It's fun to see a couple 
buy it, because it will be different on both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 I think you have to love the business and appreciate what goes into a bottle. 
It's not just a bottle on the counter or a pretty picture in an ad. So much 
expertise goes into that fragrance. And tradition -- some perfumes are 150 
years old.

 Designer Pamela Barish pared down the guest list for her Monday-night fashion 
show at her Venice studio, and she pared down her clothes as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a self-assured, tightly edited collection for spring '95 that 
had a little something for everyone: shapely knee-length shifts; jumpsuits; 
loose-fitting evening pajamas; sexy hip-huggers; an iridescent turquoise trench 
coat to die for. 
</P>
<P>
 But her single greatest accomplishment may have been to put all the models in 
black fisherman sandal-style jellies. "Where did she get those?" whispered a 
woman who'd seen one too many stiletto-induced accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The trim, brunette designer skipped shoes altogether, wearing nothing but a 
fresh coat of black-red nail polish on her toes and a white satin pantsuit for 
the traditional post-show stroll down the runway. Now that's pared down.

 More Than a Woman: We got a box of human hair in the mail the other day. Not 
just any human hair, but Jose Eber's Secret Hair. Plus a video in which women 
who swear by the legendary stylist's "hair enhancement system" show how easy it 
is to give the pinhead look the old heave-ho. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, just tucking four or five pieces of fluffy hair into her own thinning 
mane "makes life worth living," trills an attractive older woman. But our 
twentysomething daughter thought not: "She looked better before," muttered Ms. 
Cynicism, as only a girl with thick glossy hair could. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so wrong with wanting to beef up a flaccid bouffant? Or clip on a row 
of spiky bangs? "Shake your head, darling," Jose says, verging on a chuckle, to 
a newly big-haired woman. Oh, and send about $150 -- for five chunks of hair. 
Look for the Secret Hair infomercial or call (800) 641-6611 for more

 Deep Thoughts on Big Parties: Even the most stylish, meticulously planned 
party of the year can falter. Take last week's Fire and Ice Ball, the sumptuous 
fund-raiser for the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Fund at 20th Century 
Fox. While the beautiful people slipped into the dark and gusty night via 
limousine, the beautiful but unchauffeured waited more than an hour for their 
deliverance from valet Purgatory. We wound our Armani chiffon scarf (a 
prescient party favor!) a bit tighter at the throat and staggered into the wind 
in search of the elusive autos. Actor Michael York had the same idea, but 
turned back after a few minutes, the wimp. Finally, an official-looking guy 
coaxed us into his heated car (he could have been a serial killer) and back to 
our starting point, where our humble station wagon awaited. Home, James.

 Shopping Stud: Jack San is a happily married, retired corporate executive who 
lives in the San Fernando Valley and runs an escort service -- for women 
shoppers. "Expertise in apparel, men's gifts, jewelry, automobile, real estate, 
investments and more. No sex -- just shopping," reads his ad in a local 
magazine. (That last line is about the most alluring come-on we've heard in 
ages.) 
</P>
<P>
 San explains he's always been the guy people came to for consumer advice, but 
the idea for his second career took root six months ago when a friend was the 
victim of an unethical jeweler. "The woman selected a beautiful marquis-cut 
diamond that had one carbon spot. But when she returned to the store for the 
gem, she had me look at it and I found seven. Unfortunately, women get taken 
advantage of in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 San charges $150 for two hours -- the minimum -- and $50 an hour thereafter. 
He still helps his wife select evening gowns and cocktail dresses on the house. 
"She gets the freebies," he laughs. To arrange a shopping date, call (818) 
366-5559.

 Mixed Messages: Miss USA -- 26-year-old Lu Parker -- showed up at the Sears 
store in Torrance this week. No, she wasn't looking for a Craftsman tool kit or 
our favorite, a power saw bit clock. Parker was there to promote perfume and, 
it seems, share her thoughts on the damaging effects of pushing young girls 
into beauty pageants simply to fulfill a mother's fantasy. Parker said she 
wouldn't put a daughter of hers in a pageant unless the girl specifically 
asked, reports Associated Press. "But I'm not going to take them and put them 
in a pageant when they don't understand the ethics in the pageant and that not 
everybody can win the crown."

 Mystery Solved: The daughter of legendary French couturier Madame Alix Gres 
apparently stalled reporting her mother's death a year ago to thwart 
self-serving condolences from designers who were largely unsympathetic when she 
was alive. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to 
draw on her money," Anne Gres told the French newspaper Le Monde, which 
disclosed the death Tuesday. She went so far as to fabricate quotes supposedly 
from Mme. Gres and published Nov. 1 in Women's Wear Daily. Le Monde discovered 
the cover-up through a document in a district mayor's office in Paris.

 Model with hair standing on end posed against a solid-colored backdrop. Movie 
star wearing full skirt hunkered down in her seat. Actress photographed in a 
joyful jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Newton in 1973, Milton Greene in 1956 and Philippe Halsman in the 
1950s, right? Yes, and Stephanie Pfriender, Lance Staedler and Peggy Sirota in 
this month's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 A legendary fashion designer once observed that if there were no copying, 
there would be no fashion. A corollary might be: If there were no photo 
copying, there would be no fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 And, maybe, no cheap, easy way to learn about great photography. 
</P>
<P>
 A casual paging through recent American and foreign fashion and 
general-interest publications offers a veritable course in appreciation, with 
new work by established leading lights such as Newton, Richard Avedon, Hiro, 
Irving Penn, Deborah Turbeville and others as well as new likenesses (some 
acknowledging their inspiration, some not; some undoubtedly, ahem, unconscious, 
and some humorous) of images that Newton, Avedon, Man Ray, Guy Bourdin, J.P. 
Goude and others made famous. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think that getting to the source by way of the derivative is a 
little like reading "Fairest Shlump" in MAD magazine before taking in the Tom 
Hanks movie. But fashion, at least, often works that way. Where would the 
brilliant but long-ignored Yves Saint Laurent be this season without the furry 
candy-colored chubbies of Anna Sui? Certainly not the subject of admiring 
magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, our culture has a morbid fascination with imitations, good or bad, 
straight or parody. How else to explain the popularity of Madame Tussaud's? Or 
drag shows? Or trompe l'oeil ? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it is being a wanna-be, sure. But there's a craft involved in making a 
good copy, and that can be appreciated just for itself. Now, didn't we read 
that somewhere else? JOANNA RAEBEL

 Train sets and Christmas trees seem to go together like Santas and candy 
canes. But with 2,000 feet of train tracks, you know we're talking holiday 
celebration on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Pasadena is getting into the Christmas spirit with a Winter Wonderland 
that features train rides for $1, a 25-foot snowman (the inflatable type) and a 
15-foot Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-foot-by-45-foot train village, with replicas of Old World European towns 
professionally lit with theatrical lights, is the centerpiece of the 
wonderland, along with nine collectors' edition train sets.  
</P>
<P>
 The festivities take place at One Colorado, a courtyard tucked behind brick 
facades in the middle of Old Town, near Fair Oaks Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours for the event are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday through Dec. 30. Santa will 
be on hand Saturday, Sunday and Dec. 23 from noon to 5 p.m. Information: (818)

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; A TEA THAT HAS WRITERS TALKING; AUTHORS HELP GIVE OLIVE 
CREST BENEFIT A DIFFERENT SLANT

 Although they promised to hold "A Traditional Holiday Tea," members of Olive 
Crest Town, Gown and Apron added a novel feature to the usual tea-and-scones 
fare: talks by four Orange County authors. 
</P>
<P>
 At its first-ever holiday tea, the new support group for the Olive Crest 
Abused Children's Foundation featured writers Earlene Fowler, Elizabeth George, 
Maxine O'Callaghan and T. Jefferson Parker at the Center Club in Costa Mesa on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $45-per-person event drew a sellout crowd of more than 200 and was 
expected to net about $10,000 for the foundation. Tea and Company 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted this event to be a little different," said Barbara Steinberg, event 
co-chairwoman. "We're all tired of going to the same lunches, the same 
dinners." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were greeted at the door by the musical group Vocal Magic, whose 
members wore Dickens-style costumes and performed holiday carols. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the dining room, harpist Julie Earnhart played holiday melodies while 
guests bid on items at a silent auction and sipped champagne. They later sat at 
tables surrounded by glowing Christmas trees and garlands, where they were 
served Earl Grey and mango tea and assorted finger sandwiches, scones and 
sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 After tea, each author was invited to the podium to discuss how and why they 
started writing. While the other writers described childhoods spent penning 
poems and stories that eventually led to successful writing careers, Fowler had 
a different reason for becoming a novelist: 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a professional writer to escape doing story-tell hour at the 
library," said Fowler, author of the Benni Harper mystery series. Now she 
doesn't mind doing public speaking -- "as long as I don't have to do any animal 
sounds," she said. Donning Their Aprons 
</P>
<P>
 Town, Gown and Apron was formed in July, 1993, by Diane Antoci to increase 
public awareness of the Olive Crest Abused Children's Foundation and to help 
meet the needs of children in the organization's care. The word "apron" was 
added to the group's title because the 40 members volunteer for hands-on work.  
</P>
<P>
 "We needed help in the homes. The children needed to see there are a lot of 
people out there who care," said Lois Verleur, who co-founded Olive Crest with 
her husband, Donald, 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Anaheim, Olive Crest operates more than 20 group homes and a 
certified foster family agency serving Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San 
Diego counties. The programs provide 24-hour care and treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 "These children have multiple problems. It's not just baby-sitting," Verleur 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included: event co-chairwoman Angela Hartfelder, Holly 
German, Donna Horton, Dorothy Fitzgerald, Andrea Gullickson, Ruth Milversted, 
Jo Etta Brown, Diana Casey, Frankie Holland, Tricia Pratto, Genevieve 
Southgate, Mary Thompson, Doris Willis and Jean Zimmerman. KATHRYN BOLD

A PRIMER ON HOW TO DO NOTHING '90S-STYLE; BEHAVIOR: SARAH DUNN'S 
WELL-RESEARCHED MANUAL OFFERS A SATIRICAL LOOK AT ADOPTING THE LIFESTYLE THAT'S 
BASED ON SELF-DETERMINED LETHARGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twentysomethings have barely recovered from the "Generation X" backlash 
inflicted by Douglas Coupland's novel when along comes "The Official Slacker 
Handbook" and its own special set of generational generalizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The satirical primer provides lists and how-to essays on slacking '90s style: 
how to forestall utility termination, how to wear a proper goatee, how to mooch 
off your parents, friends and the government with the least amount of effort. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a working definition. (You slackers, if you've been industrious enough 
to read this far, congratulations and skip to the next paragraph.) "It is the 
inalienable right of every man, woman and child," writes Sarah Dunn in the 
introduction, "to work as little as humanly possible. (This book) will help you 
in your transformation from gainfully employed sane person to poverty-stricken 
malcontent." 
</P>
<P>
 Slackers are the people you see at coffee shops and cafes, writing poetry, 
thinking about their next great film, reading Celine's "Journey to the End of 
the Night" and being dutifully late for their shift as usher at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't coin the term, and I didn't create this (phenomenon)," says Dunn, 
25. A self-professed non-slacker, she hung out in coffee shops across the 
United States and interviewed dozens of people who led a slacker lifestyle, out 
of which came the idea for the manual. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to Dunn, what validates slacking in the 1990s -- and sets it 
apart from just your pedestrian, run-of-the-mill, sloth-like behavior -- is 
that its attendant emotional, spiritual and occupational lethargy is purely 
self-determined. Slackers don't slack because they can't get good jobs; they 
slack because good jobs would cut into the time they've scheduled for reading 
or thinking or drinking coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very seductive lifestyle," she says. "It's choosing intellectualism 
and embracing a higher value than whether or not you have a cellular phone. You 
can spend your time with friends and have a meaningful existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? The book glibly compares modern-day slackers -- in 
Philadelphia; Austin, Tex.; Portland, Ore., and Baltimore -- to the slackers of 
Cambridge in the 1790s, Paris in the 1920s and San Francisco in the 1960s. Same 
geist, different Zeit. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the question: Will the book present twentysomethings another 
battle with yet another label? 
</P>
<P>
 No, says Dunn, and what will save the book, according to many slackers, is its 
erudition, humor and self-deprecatory approach. "I might not exactly reflect 
what you slackers are really like," the book seems to say, "but I'm earnest, 
brilliantly funny and don't take myself too seriously, and somehow that makes 
me OK. Doggone it, people like me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunn acknowledges that many people have been -- and certainly will be -- 
stridently opposed to a book ostensibly meant to stereotype and pin another 
label on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's meant to be satire," she says. "And people who say, 'We can't be 
defined, we transcend language and classification,' seem to me incredibly 
pretentious and wrong. I think it is possible to make distinctions by what a 
group reads, does, wears or how it has sex. How valid that classification 
should be, that's the real issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Between waiting tables at night and writing in the morning -- such fitting 
pastimes for an English lit grad from the University of Pennsylvania -- Dunn 
started hanging out in a neighborhood cafe, where she became fascinated with 
both the number and intensity of slackers. She made friends with them and, as 
her time at the cafe grew, so did her network. 
</P>
<P>
 She took time to travel to other slacker cities (the list is on page 58 of the 
book) and talked to dozens of slackers who opened up their lives and their 
coffee bars to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Research is infused throughout the book. "Even stuff that came out of my head 
indirectly came from being around slackers," she says. "I knew that the biggest 
way I would fail is if slackers picked up on (wrong details). A lot of the 
research that went into this book was terribly liberating." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, going a day or two without showering doesn't bother her anymore. 
And when she worked as a waitress in a Philly restaurant, she started following 
her co-workers' example of not wearing underwear. ("Why We've Stopped Wearing 
Underpants" appears on page 43.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her dedication to detail and deep interest in the culture of slack have 
garnered many slacker kudos, often coming from corners Dunn had not expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared to hate this book," says Richard Linklater, slacker and 
director of the 1991 film "Slacker," about the wayward lives of his Austin 
slacker brethren. She "has managed to fuse frighteningly on-target observations 
with a historical perspective that is so often lost when people talk about 
slackers." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, however, also draws guffaws and rolled eyes from other 
twentysomethings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, I can't believe someone wrote something like that," says Erin Rogers, 
a twentysomething. "I want to say she's selling out, and wasn't the 'Generation 
X' backlash bad enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunn says it's the praise that comes from people predisposed to hating its 
concept that gives her hope the book will be seen as a farce with just enough 
veracity to hold its currency. For now, she'll continue to slack and drink 
coffee as she works on her next book. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has, by the way, gone back to regularly donning underwear.

WONDERS OF VITAMIN A BEING UNCOVERED; SCIENCE: INEXPENSIVE CHEMICAL WORKS 
AGAINST INFANT MORTALITY, BLINDNESS AND MEASLES. LABORATORIES FIND GENETIC AND 
CELLULAR FUNCTIONS.

 There are very few wonder drugs in the world, but Vitamin A may be one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 This dirt-cheap chemical can lower childhood mortality by about one-third in 
vast parts of the developing world. It prevents keratomalacia, one of the five 
leading causes of blindness. It's the closest thing to a specific treatment for 
measles. It's a fairly good therapy for some types of anemia. It may reduce the 
transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite safe, it's easy to store and one dose -- good for four months -- 
costs about 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the practical side of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about Vitamin A's role in the physiology of cells is pouring out 
of laboratories. Whole new functions are being uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A regulates hundreds of genes. It is a key modulator of the immune 
system. It helps aim cells along the tricky trajectory from primitive to adult 
forms, a job that may play some role in preventing the development of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Vitamin A is emerging as evolution's equivalent to the Swiss Army 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The substance's ability to fight infections in malnourished people is its most 
astounding property. First suggested more than 60 years ago, and proved only in 
the past decade, the significance of this finding is just beginning to become 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the most important breakthroughs in public health in the last 50 
years," the retired director general of the Pan American Health Organization, 
Abraham Horwitz, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamins are substances that are essential to life but cannot be made from 
scratch by the organism that needs them. (Many substances actually fit this 
definition, including some amino acids that form the building blocks of 
proteins. The difference is that, unlike amino acids, vitamins are required 
only in tiny amounts. They act more as catalysts for biochemical reactions than 
as raw materials for biological construction.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A -- unlike Vitamin C and the B vitamins -- is "fat-soluble" and can 
be stored in body tissue for prolonged periods. This raises the risk of toxic 
effects, but offers one particular advantage. Intermittent doses, acquired 
either through diet or pharmacological supplements, can tide an organism over 
many fallow months. 
</P>
<P>
 In many diets, Vitamin A deficiency is never a threat. Nevertheless, dietary 
sources seem to be insufficient in many parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Marginal intake is worsened by frequent infection, which depletes the body's 
Vitamin A stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter, egg yolk and liver contain large amounts of Vitamin A. Equally 
important sources are yellow and orange fruits and vegetables (such as squash, 
sweet potatoes and papayas), and dark-green, leafy vegetables. They contain 
large amounts of beta-carotene, a compound split by the body into two molecules 
of retinyl palmitate, Vitamin A. The latter gives rise to a family of 
derivatives known as "retinoids." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its discovery in 1913, Vitamin A has been regarded mostly as the vitamin 
of vision. A compound called retinal is essential for making the light-sensing 
biochemicals in the retina, or back wall, of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A deficiency shows itself, early on, as night blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the vitamin's more medically important role in vision involves a 
different part of the eye. Severe deficiency causes the cornea -- the clear 
cover of the eye's front -- to melt away, leaving behind opaque scar tissue and 
permanent blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A's anti-infective uses were discovered -- or, to be precise, 
rediscovered -- in the early 1980s by Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist working 
in Indonesia who is now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A deficiency -- at least as measured by subtle changes in the 
appearance of the eye -- occurred inconsistently in Javan villages. Some 
children showed signs of it while their neighbors showed none. Sommer and his 
colleagues sought reasons for these differences in the diets and frequency of 
illnesses (such as diarrhea) in a group of 4,000 preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers observed the children for several years and noticed something 
they had not expected to see. There was a clear relationship between Vitamin A 
deficiency and mortality. Moreover, there appeared to be a "dose-response" 
relationship: The more advanced the eye problems, the higher the death rate. 
(Children with severe eye changes were removed from the study and immediately 
given Vitamin A. None went blind.) 
</P>
<P>
 The team already had plans to conduct a study of 26,000 Sumatran children, 
half of whom would be given Vitamin A supplements and half of whom would not. 
Besides looking for eye changes in both groups, they quickly added illness and 
mortality as "endpoints" they also would measure. At the end of a year, 
mortality in the Vitamin A group was 34% lower than in the control group. 
</P>
<P>
 A simultaneous study that the Sommer team ran on Vitamin A supplementation in 
children hospitalized with severe measles showed even more dramatic results: a 
drop of 50% in deaths from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies appeared in 1986 and 1987 in The Lancet and the British Medical 
Journal. As it happens, the latter journal in 1932 had published a study 
showing that death rates from measles could be cut by 58% if ill children were 
given cod-liver oil, which is high in Vitamin A. The place where this research 
was done? 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "As best as one can tell, nothing else appeared on the subject," Sommer said 
of that experiment. "It did not change clinical practice. Some things people 
are willing and ready to accept, and some things they aren't, even with the 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitamin A's importance in other infections is emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 A paper published last year reported increased mortality (and greater immune 
depression) among HIV-positive drug users in Baltimore who were mildly 
deficient in Vitamin A. One published in June showed that pregnant, 
HIV-infected women in Malawi transmitted the virus to their babies 32% of the 
time if they were severely Vitamin A deficient, but only 7% of the time if they 
had sufficient stores of the vitamin. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little data to suggest Vitamin A supplements are helpful in people 
who are not deficient. Excessive doses, in fact, can be toxic, and occasionally 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the World Health Organization estimates there are about 250 
million children who are not getting as much Vitamin A as they need. A major 
effort is under way to right this.

WORKERS WHO SURVIVE LAYOFFS FACE TRAUMA TOO; DOWNSIZING: WATCHING THEIR 
COLLEAGUES PACK UP, EMPLOYEES LEFT BEHIND CAN'T HELP THINKING: IF IT HAPPENED 
TO THEM, IT CAN HAPPEN TO ME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON OLDENBURG, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone at the company knew it was coming. The rumor mill had whispered 
"layoffs" for months. So, last April, when a Midwest food manufacturer laid off 
200 employees -- from mid-level management down to the mail room -- the only 
surprise was the gut-wrenching feeling among the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock first of all," recalls a 46-year-old clerical worker at the 
firm who watched sadly as three colleagues in her department boxed their 
personal things and walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt bad. All of them were real loyal to the company so you got to think 
anyone can go any time. . . . I'm still wondering about my job. I know a lot of 
other people here who were scared and still are." 
</P>
<P>
 When corporate downsizing empties the next desk or work station, laid-off 
employees aren't the only ones whose lives change suddenly. Those who remain 
may still have their jobs the next day, but according to career and workplace 
experts they also face mixed feelings and frustrations typically shared by 
survivors of any kind of trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are frightened, suspicious, disappointed and paranoid. They suffer a 
whole range of negative feelings," said Robert Swain, co-founder and chairman 
of the New York-headquartered outplacement consulting firm Swain & Swain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The survivors are shellshocked and very frightened -- because they know they 
could be next," says Carol Kleiman, a nationally syndicated career columnist 
and author of "Career Coach" (Dearborn Financial Publishing, $15.95). 
</P>
<P>
 And at this time of year, when holidays are on a collision course with 
companies that would risk a Scrooge reputation to reduce losses and make 
operating statements look better before the calendar runs out, layoffs are 
especially taken personally -- even by those who escape them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Survivors have a great burden on them, a double burden," says Kleiman, adding 
that she receives lots of letters from tormented survivors of corporate 
restructuring who ask for advice. "They feel terribly guilty about their 
friends and colleagues who were let go. People feel totally distraught about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Savvy survivors also know they could be next. Studies show companies that 
undertake one round of downsizing more often than not do it again. "The 
survivors have to worry not only about the people who aren't there anymore but 
about their jobs," Kleiman says. "And they feel anger at the employer who did 
this. The one thing the employer can't say is it's not going to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what the survivor wants to hear -- that it's not going to happen to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing people displaced right now who I would never have thought would 
ever be displaced," says Swain. "The loyal soldier, the steady worker . . . and 
that's causing a lot of tremors in organizations. People say, 'By God, if old 
Henry can get it, anybody can get it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kleiman says despite the mistrust and feeling of jeopardy that has pervaded 
their work lives, survivors can't do anything about the course of events 
themselves, except to deal with it and put it aside. "The truth is you cannot 
dwell on it forever," she says. "And you cannot apologize for being there." 
</P>
<P>
 But some companies, worried about plummeting productivity in the aftermath of 
layoffs, have begun "re-educating" survivors about the new work world they are 
still part of. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is walk back on the battlefield and take a look at a fairly 
beleaguered group of people," says Swain, who for the past year has provided 
"survivor training" to corporate clients reducing their rosters. He calls the 
program "managing change training." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is a redefinition of the workplace, a recommitment to the 
organization and a renewal for the individual," says Swain, who estimates that 
30% of companies slimming their ranks have "caught on" and try to address the 
productivity and personal problems that simmer among the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kleiman agrees that survivors need to get themselves beyond the shock 
of the layoff, she isn't convinced of the corporate goodwill behind survivor 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ultimate message is, 'If you know this is going to happen, get yourself 
ready for it,' " she says. "You have to be proactive about this; you can't be 
helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleiman recommends survivors do this after a downsizing:  
</P>
<P>
 * Volunteer to do the work that needs to be done.  
</P>
<P>
 * Keep informed about the company's financial status and plans by asking 
questions, reading business publications and keeping an ear to the office 
grapevine.  
</P>
<P>
 * Be supportive of the other survivors who need each other, because the 
company has no loyalty to you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Update your resume.

CITY HALL NEWS: MONTEREY PARK; GROUP SEEKS TO KEEP BILLBOARD BAN FROM BEING 
OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In anticipation of a Monterey Park City Council decision to overturn a ban on 
billboards, a new coalition has turned to voters to try to keep the ordinance 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 8, the unnamed coalition filed notice with the city about its petition 
drive for a ballot initiative that would ban new billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents of this city don't want huge, brightly lit billboards. . . . We 
want open, countryside-like landscape," coalition leader Vince Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising wants to erect at least 11 billboards along the 
Pomona (60) and Long Beach (710) freeways in Monterey Park, about half on 
Operating Industries' landfill near hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council took the first step toward lifting the 5-year-old 
ban on new billboards. It voted 4 to 1 to have the city staff bring back a 
proposed ordinance to lift the ban in commercial areas and draw up a 
preliminary agreement that would allow the Regency billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency's plan is facing growing opposition from residents and from 
neighboring Montebello and federal officials. Montebello is threatening to sue 
Monterey Park unless the city completes an environmental review of the 
placement of the billboards along the Pomona Freeway, which runs between the 
two cities. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials are raising 
questions about the billboards' location at Operating Industries' landfill, one 
of the most polluted Superfund sites in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's council meeting, coalition leaders urged council members to retain 
the city's ban on billboards and avoid the potential cost of a special election 
-- at an anticipated cost of $70,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will succeed, no doubt about it, but (the city) could use $70,000 in 
better ways to serve our community, said Lucia Y. Su, a coalition leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The group must collect signatures from 20% of the city's registered voters -- 
about 4,600 people -- to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the council is not listening to the people, so the residents are 
forging ahead with a citizens' initiative," said Mayor Judy Chu, who opposes 
new billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed agreement with Regency to allow the billboards would prohibit 
tobacco, alcohol, gambling and indecent advertisements. City Councilman 
Francisco Alonso said opposition will fade when people become aware of the 
exclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants a billboard in the middle of town, but these are on land with no 
other use near the freeways," Alonso said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montebello, meanwhile, the City Council passed a law banning new billboards 
earlier this year, and now officials say they are not about to let such 
eyesores go up in their neighboring city. Also, they say, by erecting 
billboards on the contaminated landfill, people could be exposed to hazardous 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials are also concerned about the impact on the landfill, said 
Harrison Karr an attorney for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Consultant Robert Katherman, who represents Regency, said the company is 
already responding to Montebello's fears by preparing environmental information 
on the proposed billboard sites.

RESIDENTS REASSURED OVER FROZEN FUNDS; CLAREMONT: DAILY OPERATIONS WILL 
CONTINUE DESPITE $5 MILLION IN CITY INVESTMENTS TIED UP IN THE ORANGE COUNTY 
INVESTMENT CRISIS, OFFICIALS SAY. BUT LONG-TERM OUTLOOK ON BOND REPAYMENT IS 
UNCLEAR. 
</P>

 The Claremont City Council assured residents Tuesday night that although $5.38 
million of city investments are frozen in the Orange County fund, the city's 
day-to-day operations will continue as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are able to continue providing the same level of police, maintenance, 
trash collection and all other city services," Mayor Algird G. Leiga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiga said the city, along with other agencies that invested in the fund, has 
been placed on "CreditWatch" by Standard & Poor's investment rating agency and 
is also under review by Moody's rating service. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5.38 million now tied up in the Orange County pool is about half of the 
city's total investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city does not yet know the status of that money, Leiga said, "we 
believe that when all of the facts are known, a significant portion of 
Claremont's investment in the fund will remain intact." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have not begun to figure out what they will do if 
their money remains frozen in the Orange County pool when the bonds come due 
next July. They said they are assuming they will be able to obtain the money by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday night's City Council meeting, Leiga said that the city manager is 
looking at nonessential projects that might be postponed because of the bond 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents this week questioned the city's investment of the money, which 
was raised through municipal bonds called Tax Revenue Anticipation Notes 
(TRANs) that help ease cash flow shortages during the six-month periods between 
property tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I understand TRANs, it is to be used to smooth out cash flow," Claremont 
resident Tom Deno said at the council meeting. "I'm concerned that the city has 
gathered over $5 million in TRANs and used it not to smooth out cash flow but 
to reinvest in the Orange County fund." 
</P>
<P>
 The city issued between $4.5 million and $5 million in TRANs each year since 
1991, Leiga said. It then invested the money in the Orange County fund and 
withdrew it at the end of the fiscal year in July, when the bonds came due. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city did not use the money raised through the TRANs in its daily 
operations, Leiga said, "the idea is to have the reserves in case we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 1994-95 budget identified $120,000 in expected interest earnings 
from the Orange County fund investment. Leiga announced Tuesday that the city 
has revised the budget on the assumption that there will be no interest 
earnings from the fund, but that the principal will be intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Because TRANs are issued as tax-free notes, cities and other public entities 
are able to sell them at lower interest rates. In general, any profits they 
raise by investing the funds at higher rates must be refunded to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 However, cities that issue $5 million or less through TRANs bonds can keep the 
interest they make, said Jim Bajari, a government finance consultant in Carmel. 
Claremont is within the $5-million limit; the additional amount is interest 
earned through TRANs that was reinvested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer for another San Gabriel Valley city, who asked not to be 
identified, questioned the propriety of issuing TRANs to raise money that is 
not actually needed for the city's operation. The treasurer said Claremont's 
decision to issue $5 million in TRANs, which is equal to about half of the 
city's main operating fund, was "very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Claremont City Atty. Wynne S. Furth said, "This is a qualified, legal 
TRANs. It meets the letter and intent of the federal guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiga said the decision to invest that money in the Orange County fund seemed 
a prudent one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a track record of being safe for 10 years or more," he said.

MOUNTJOY'S BATTLE; POLITICS: THE STATE SENATOR-ELECT IS A KEY PLAYER IN THE 
SPEAKERSHIP FIGHT. IN AN EFFORT TO OUST WILLIE BROWN FROM POWER, HE REFUSES TO 
GIVE UP HIS ASSEMBLY SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Assemblyman/Sen. Richard L. Mountjoy walked into a local auto parts store, 
greeted the employees and asked, "Do I let him stay or do I kick him out?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Give him the boot," said one worker, with others chiming in that Assemblyman 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has been Speaker of the lower house far too 
long.  
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia Republican walked out, committed as ever to staying in the 
Assembly for as long as it takes to keep Brown from continuing his reign as 
Speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy had planned to give up his Assembly seat by now to take his place in 
the state Senate, a seat he won last month in a special election. But now that 
the Assembly is mired in a speakership battle, Mountjoy vows to stick around as 
long as he can to keep Brown from retaining the powerful speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has 40 votes and Republican leader Jim Brulte has 40 votes. So if 
Mountjoy moves to the upper house, Brulte loses one of his supporters and Brown 
retains the speakership on a 40-39 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy said that if the issue drags on so long that he has to give up his 
Senate seat to thwart Brown, then so be it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to carry out the will of the voters in my district," Mountjoy said 
in an interview this week, adding that he thinks Brown has done a "horrible 
job. The easy course for me to take would be to run to the Senate and duck the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy has been in the political oven since Dec. 5, the day the Assembly's 
41 Republicans were supposed to anoint Brulte. Instead, Assemblyman Paul V. 
Horcher of Diamond Bar slammed down his fist in the Assembly's ornate chambers 
and announced he was voting for Brown, creating the deadlock. He also said he 
was abandoning the Republican Party to become an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before have two state legislators from the San Gabriel Valley been at 
ground zero of a political explosion like last week's, experts and observers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my recollection of the last quarter of a century, we haven't had this kind 
of local notoriety," said political scientist Alan Heslop, a professor at 
Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy and Horcher both have left the center of the storm in Sacramento and 
returned to their conservative districts, where they have become celebrities of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy appears to bask in the public spotlight, driving around his district 
and chatting with constituents. The 59th Assembly District includes all or part 
of Claremont, Covina, Monrovia, Pomona and San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the preliminary results of a telephone poll indicate that his 
constituents support his stance by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a position I looked for. It's a position the voters of the district 
have put me in, and I'm going to carry out their will," said Mountjoy, leaning 
back in a chair at his district office. "I don't get nervous in battle." 
</P>

 Mountjoy contends that state law doesn't set a deadline for him to fill his 
Senate seat, just as long as he does so sometime during his term of office. The 
Assembly or Senate could vote to expel Mountjoy, but he considers such a move 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a display of outrageous political power, and the people of the 
state would come unglued," Mountjoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the speakership battle lingers and paralyzes the Assembly, local 
Republicans could try to pressure Mountjoy to take his Senate seat, even if it 
means Brown will be Speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, one of Mountjoy's key supporters says that he is fed up with the 
bipartisan bickering and that it's time for legislators to focus on running the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that Dick Mountjoy wants to stay in the Assembly to get rid of 
Willie Brown is not sound," said Forest Tennant, an influential Republican who 
is Mountjoy's friend and campaign contributor. "(Mountjoy's) job is to vacate 
his Assembly seat and move on to the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, written off by local Republican leaders, has been lying low, 
observers say.  
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman, who returned to his district last week, said he has met with 
supporters but has made no public appearances and has none planned. He said he 
is taking precautions, such as posting a guard at his district office, after 
reportedly receiving death threats at his Sacramento office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame you have to do this in a democracy," Horcher said. "Most people 
who threaten you are cowards. However, there is a chance someone may make good 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's 60th District, which neighbors Mountjoy's, includes Diamond Bar, 
West Covina, Hacienda Heights, La Mirada, La Habra Heights, Rowland Heights, 
and portions of Pomona and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The defiant assemblyman lashed out at local Republican leaders who are 
organizing a recall effort against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite a few Republicans in front of me who voted for Mr. Brown long 
before I was on the scene. Why don't they recall Mr. Mountjoy?" said Horcher, 
repeating a line of attack he used earlier this year during his unsuccessful 
campaign against Mountjoy for the Senate's 29th District seat. The Senate 
district includes Mountjoy's and Horcher's Assembly districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Mountjoy and more than 20 other Republicans voted Brown in as 
Speaker, preferring him over then-Assemblyman Howard L. Berman. Mountjoy has 
defended the 14-year-old vote, saying that Brown was the lesser of two evils. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Mountjoy optimistically predicts that he will be able to hold the party 
line and knock Brown off the top of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 If forced to give up the newly won Senate seat, Mountjoy said he would try to 
win it again in another special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be a senator eventually," he said.

TOPICS / BUSINESS; GOURMET FOOD CHAIN TO EXPAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bristol Farms Gourmet Specialty Food Markets will be acquired by an investment 
group as part of a plan to expand the chain, which is now in three upscale 
cities including South Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, Kamm & Co. Inc., a Beverly Hills investment company, is buying the 
Torrance-based gourmet food market, according to Irv Gronsky, owner and 
president.Company officials declined to reveal any financial arrangements but 
did say the sale is in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, when Gronsky founded the first Bristol Farms in Rolling Hills 
Estates, it has become one of the Southland's most successful upscale food 
retailers, generating just over $50 million in sales annually. Its South 
Pasadena store, which opened in 1985, is now one of that city's largest 
generators of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in ownership is part of a plan to finance new Bristol Farms markets 
across the Southland, said Louis A. Kwiker, a retail consultant for the 
investment group and former president and chief executive of Wherehouse Inc. He 
will take over as chief executive officer and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwiker approached Gronsky about the purchase, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronsky will continue to participate in company operations for at least four 
years as vice chairman, and other management personnel will remain, Bristol 
Farms officials said.

 ARCADIA: A 34-year-old transient was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of 
bank robbery and evading arrest. Robert Lee was being held without bail at 
Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles, police said.About 3 p.m. Saturday, a man 
armed with a semiautomatic handgun robbed the Great Western Bank in the 700 
block of West Huntington Drive. Bank employees called police, who followed the 
suspect to the 300 block of Fairview Avenue, where he crashed his car into a 
pole, police said. He then reportedly fled into a home and fought with the 
homeowner, who apparently was not seriously injured. After a standoff with 
officers, the suspect surrendered at about 1 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: A 20-year-old man was killed Saturday in a gang-related shooting,

CHECKPOINTS TO MONITOR DRINKING, SEAT BELT USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning in January, sheriff's deputies in La Puente will begin conducting 
monthly checkpoints for drunk driving and use of safety belts. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which contracts with the county for deputies' services, was recently 
awarded a $91,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to begin 
the program.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey revealed that less than half the children younger than 4 in La 
Puente were in child-safety seats, as the law requires, when riding in a 
vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 The first sobriety checkpoint will be on Jan. 6. The first seat-belt 
checkpoint will be on Jan. 21.

TOPICS; PSYCHIATRIC TEST MAY FOIL RELEASE OF RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted San Gabriel Valley sex offender who is scheduled for release from 
prison Sunday must first pass a psychiatric examination -- the same one that 
derailed the parole of "Pillowcase Rapist" Reginald Donald Muldrew in Covina 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Carnot Andrew Lyles, 38, is likely to pass the mental health exam 
because he has no history of mental illness, said regional Parole Administrator 
Jerry DiMaggio). 
</P>
<P>
 Pending results of the exam, Lyles is scheduled to be paroled to an 
undisclosed city in south Los Angeles County. Lyles had requested to be paroled 
to Pasadena so he could take care of his sick father. But Pasadena police 
believe they have found a way to block his parole there under a state law that 
prohibits a felon's release within 35 miles of the residence of victims who 
register protests. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Lyles was convicted of committing a sex act with a 9-year-old girl in 
Pasadena, among other felonies. Lyles, who is being held at the R. J. Donovan 
Correctional Facility in San Diego, also was convicted of raping and sodomizing 
a Pasadena woman in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to block Lyles' release, police contacted six of his victims and 
had them sign protest papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I know for sure is that he is not going to be released to the 
city of Pasadena," Pasadena Police Lt. Gene Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Correction officials were unable to confirm whether Lyles would indeed be 
prohibited from living in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Women's Coalition, a Pasadena-based women's advocacy group, is 
gathering signatures on petitions protesting Lyles' release for submission to 
Gov. Pete Wilson. This week, one of Lyles' victims delivered a letter to 
Wilson's Los Angeles office. On Friday, the coalition will hold a candlelight 
vigil at 7:30 p.m. in front of Pasadena City Hall.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; HEART ATTACK PATIENTS SOUGHT FOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Memorial Hospital is among nearly 300 institutions in the United 
States and Canada to participate in a large-scale clinical study on the effects 
of aspirin use among heart attack patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year trial will track 6,000 patients.It will study whether a 
combination of aspirin and an anticoagulant -- which delays or prevents blood 
clotting -- is more effective than aspirin alone in the long-term survival of 
heart attack patients. The anticoagulant is a drug called Coumadin. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington is one of 30 Los Angeles-area institutions to participate. 
Researchers in the Los Angeles area hope to enroll more than 650 patients 
through Dec. 31. To be eligible, men and women between ages 21 and 85 must have 
had a heart attack three days to three weeks before entry in the study. They 
also must be willing to be involved in a comprehensive medical follow-up for up 
to four years.

SANTA ANA ENTREPRENEUR HITS IT BIG WITH PINATA BUSINESS; PRODUCTS: OSCAR VARGAS 
LEFT THE HIGH-TECH COMPUTER INDUSTRY TO LAUNCH A COMPANY THAT HAS PROVED TO BE 
A LOW-TECH SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an increasingly high-tech world, Oscar Vargas is succeeding with a 
decidedly low-tech product: He makes pinatas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, owner of Pinata Party in Santa Ana, has an electronics degree and 
worked for years in the computer industry, but he always wanted to run his own 
business. He got the inspiration for Pinata Party from his sister, who made 
pinatas as a hobby and always had a backlog of orders from friends and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "High tech is so expensive to get into, and the products change so fast, 
almost every year," said Vargas, 41. "I saw what my sister was doing and 
realized right away that there was a wide-open area where somebody could do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 When Vargas opened his shop in 1985 in City of Industry, most of his business 
was generated by summer birthday parties. But now, he says, holiday sales of 
Santa Claus likenesses, oversized Hershey's Kisses -- sold under license from 
the Pennsylvania-based chocolate manufacturer -- and other year-end specialties 
are bringing in revenue from the Latino community and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar has the Cadillac of the business," said David Nadel, owner of the Party 
City store in Santa Ana. "They're very special pieces, a very unique product to 
be sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, pinatas are finding a market for use as home decorations, not 
just as targets for stick-wielding youngsters eager for the toys and sweets 
inside. And if people do buy them for the customary use, Vargas said, that's 
even better. "I like it when they get broken," he said, "because then you have 
to buy a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the holidays used to be the slowest time for Vargas' business, 
"Christmas has really been a good blessing for us," he said. "We used to have 
to pretty much shut down in the wintertime because, once it got colder and 
rainy, we sold less pinatas. Winter doesn't lend itself to outdoor birthday 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mainstays of his winter business are pinatas used in Las Posadas, a 
series of processions held between Dec. 16 and Dec. 24. According to Mexican 
tradition, Las Posadas depicts the Biblical story of Joseph and Mary's search 
for a room at an inn before the birth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 In observances of Las Posadas, the pinatas on hand for children at the end of 
the processions resemble satellites -- spheres with six to 12 arms that 
originally represented the months of the year, according to folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vargas started his business, he knew he could not compete on price with 
low-cost papier-mache pinatas imported from Mexico. He searched for a way to 
replicate the more expensive pinatas made of hardened clay, eventually hitting 
on a solution that blended traditional pinata designs with modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with some secrets from an aunt in Panama who had been making pinatas for 
40 years, Vargas began looking for a molding company that could mass-produce 
pinatas from polystyrene, a low-cost material that shatters just like clay. 
</P>
<P>
 He searched more than a year before he found a manufacturer with the right 
production equipment. "I'd tell them I wanted a hollow sphere that could break 
pretty easily," Vargas said. "They thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas first set up shop in the City of Industry but moved to Santa Ana five 
years ago. During the busy summer months, about a dozen employees apply paint 
and decorations by hand to the thousands of pinatas that Vargas has molded at 
plants in Anaheim and Gardena. During the slower winter months, hours are 
scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Having the pinatas mass-produced offers another benefit besides low cost: They 
are of uniform weight and size, an attractive feature for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a store is selling dinosaur pinatas, they want them the same size," said 
Vargas, whose pinatas retail for between $20 and $30 apiece. "Otherwise, 
customers see all the different sizes on the shelf and say, "That one's 
smaller, so it should cost less.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas now sells most of his pinatas through party stores but is hoping 
eventually to land a contract to produce them for Walt Disney and other 
well-known entertainment companies. Having a license to manufacture giant 
Hershey's Kisses, Vargas said, is the first step in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar does a good job," said Dawn Colon, spokeswoman for Hershey Foods Corp. 
The company stocks Vargas' pinatas at its visitor center in Pennsylvania, Colon 
said, and has sold about 2,300 of them in the past two years. "The quality is 
always there." 
</P>
<P>
 For the holiday season, Vargas turns out pinata Kisses decorated in Christmas 
greens and reds. Kisses also are hot for Valentine's Day and year-round as 
centerpieces for weddings. "Kisses are a good business for us because the sales 
come at what's a low point," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadel of Party City said he thinks Vargas has the potential to sell pinatas 
nationwide: "When we showed them to our franchiser's people back East, they 
loved them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vargas said he is leery of expanding too rapidly, preferring a slow and 
steady pace. "We've created a track record," Vargas said. "And little by 
little, we'll grow." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Pinatas Past and Present 
</P>
<P>
 * The first pinatas, which originated in Italy, were shaped like stars and 
used in Christmas celebrations. They represented the Star of Bethlehem and 
gifts that the Three Kings brought to the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 * After pinatas were introduced into the Western Hemisphere by Columbus, they 
gradually changed in shape and significance. Today, they are brightly colored 
containers made from papier-mache or clay in the shapes of animals, flowers, 
ships or stars. They are covered with crepe paper, then filled with candy, 
fruit or toys. 
</P>
<P>
 * In modern celebrations, the pinata is suspended from the ceiling and 
children use a stick to hit it until it breaks, spilling out its treasures. 
Pinatas have become a fixture in Mexico on birthdays, Christmas and other 
fiestas.

FIRM PLACES ITS PRESIDENT ON A LEAVE; MANAGEMENT: ABBEY HEALTHCARE TERMS ACTION 
A 'REQUEST' BUT CONCEDES THE EXECUTIVE HAS LITTLE SAY IN DECISION. PRESSURES 
FROM FAMILY ILLNESSES SPARKED DECISION, COMPANY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. said Wednesday that it has asked its president to 
step down and "take a leave of absence," marking the second time this year that 
the home health care company has pushed out its second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey said it removed Jerilyn P. Asher at least partly because of "personal 
pressures and the prolonged illnesses" in her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher has a daughter who was hospitalized recently with complications of spina 
bifida, a congenital, inoperable spinal condition. Also, Asher's mother is 
seriously ill in a Florida nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher, however, apparently never asked for a leave of absence and never asked 
to step down, the company acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reached a point where the board feels a leave of absence is best for all 
considered," said Richard J. Rapp, Abbey's chief financial officer. "She may 
not have realized that this was an option." 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokeswoman Susan Turkell said Abbey's action is "just a request," and 
that Asher has not responded yet, though Turkell acknowledged that Asher may 
have no choice but to accept the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her departure should have little effect on the company, Rapp said. "We've been 
operating on all cylinders with our chief operating officer," Steven Plochocki, 
he said. In addition, Chairman Timothy M. Aitken continues as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made on whether to replace Asher, Rapp said. She will 
remain on the board and will continue to be president of Abbey subsidiary 
Protocare Inc. in Waltham, Mass., through the end of this month. Rapp said 
Abbey has not decided whether she will continue with Protocare next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher remains at Protocare under an agreement that was part of Abbey's 
acquisition of the company in March. As Abbey's president since June, she had 
worked out of Boston, managing Protocare and working on developing new business 
for Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new business ventures she's been working on will probably cease, though 
she'll do some of them from her position at Protocare," Rapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher's appointment last spring filled a position that had been vacant since 
February, when Abbey forced out Victor M.G. Chaltiel as president and chief 
executive. Chaltiel, who also had come from a company acquired by Abbey, has 
filed a wrongful-termination suit against Abbey.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOS; HUNTINGTON FIRM PUTS ITS OFF-ROAD EXPERTISE TO USE FOR U.S. 
MILITARY 
</P>

 What's the difference between an off-road racing truck and a light-duty 
military attack vehicle? Maybe not that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Millen Motorsports, which made its name in professional rally and off-road 
racing, has been working with the U.S. Marine Corps to develop prototype attack 
vehicles that can fit inside cargo-carrying helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Hummer personnel carrier that won acclaim in the Persian Gulf 
War and now can be purchased from commercial dealers as a king-size civilian 
"sport utility vehicle" is too big to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines asked company owner Rod Millen, a builder and driver of race cars, 
to use his off-road expertise to develop a Helo Transportable Multi Mission 
Platform. 
</P>
<P>
 That project has been completed, and the company, based in Huntington Beach, 
is about to wrap up manufacture of a Joint Tactical Electrical Vehicle that 
both the Marines and the Army are funding, said John LaPlante, Millen's senior 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about a month away from completion of the vehicle, and then we'll have 
about six months of in-house testing," LaPlante said, noting that the basic 
suspension and engineering of a military vehicle that can cruise rough terrain 
is not much different from that of a professional off-road race truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A big way the tactical vehicle differs is that it uses a diesel engine to run 
an alternator that continually charges an array of batteries. Those, in turn, 
power a pair of electric motors that propel the four-wheel-drive vehicle, 
LaPlante said. 
</P>
<P>
 That design, he said, has several advantages over conventional internal 
combustion power: a lighter, quieter powertrain, lower emissions and more 
mechanical efficiency. And when being quiet is really important, the driver can 
shut down the diesel and switch to battery power for as long as 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 While many manufacturers are shifting away from military projects in light of 
dwindling defense budgets, Millen is taking the opposite tack. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactical vehicle "accounts for about a third of our annual budget, and we 
hope other projects will flow from it," LaPlante said. "Racing has its ups and 
downs too, and as long as they don't coincide with the defense industry's, this 
is one way to keep the company diversified."

HOOKED ON PHONICS AGREES TO FTC ADVERTISING RULES; REGULATION: THE O.C.-BASED 
COMPANY IS BARRED FROM MAKING UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S 
ABILITY TO TEACH READING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under an agreement disclosed this week between the makers of the reading 
program Hooked on Phonics and the Federal Trade Commission, the manufacturer 
must abandon its advertising campaign or conduct far more research into the 
program's effectiveness -- and disclose any evidence of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County-based Gateway Educational Products, maker of Hooked on Phonics, 
agreed to a settlement that bars the parent company from making unsubstantiated 
claims about the program's ability to teach people to read. The settlement, 
which was signed Aug. 29, was made public Wednesday by the commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The FTC had charged that Gateway was making sweeping, unproven promises that 
the program could teach anyone to read, regardless of their limitations. 
Gateway admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, and will pay no penalty, said 
Christian S. White, acting director of the commission's bureau of consumer 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They offered a one-size-fits-all solution -- you have reading problems, this 
is the product," White said. "Gateway's evidence just doesn't back up these 
broad, sweeping claims." 
</P>
<P>
 The claims, according to the commission, included: Hooked on Phonics can teach 
even those with reading problems, such as dyslexia; that the product will 
improve users' reading levels and classroom grades significantly; that Hooked 
on Phonics can teach reading at home, without a tutor; that the product teaches 
the comprehension of the meaning of words, and that Hooked on Phonics has 
helped almost 1 millionpeople learn to read at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also said that testimonials by people who have taken the 
program are used misleadingly in commercials, not proving the experiences of 
these users were typical of the average user, which is a violation of federal 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the commission nor Gateway would discuss specific steps that the 
company must take if it wants to continue its highly successful sales pitch. 
Gateway spent $35 million on advertising in 1993 and recorded $60 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gateway released the results of a yearlong study of several 
first-grade classrooms in the Inglewood Unified School District. Although the 
results showed vast improvement in the students' reading skills, the FTC 
apparently did not find the results adequate to support Gateway's broad claims 
of success. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling for more research to back up Gateway's marketing 
campaign, the settlement requires the company to make available to FTC 
officials all research findings, including complaints from consumers, "that 
contradict, qualify or call into question" its claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooked on Phonics emphasizes identifying sounds with letter symbols. It is 
made up of coordinated workbooks, cassette tapes and flash cards. The learner 
listens to the tape while following in the book to hear the correct 
pronunciation of letters and words. The program kit costs about $230. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reading experts are not so sure that the program is as effective as 
testimonials claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Farstrup, executive director of the International Reading Assn. in 
Newark, Del. -- a not-for-profit education group -- said he is concerned that 
the program overstates its benefits as it makes its money from illiterate 
people who tend to be poor. He said the members of his organization are 
concerned that Hooked on Phonics "will give a black eye" to groups promoting 
reading ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway officials released a statement Wednesday, refusing further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Trade Commission has not challenged the effectiveness of the 
Hooked on Phonics program in helping large numbers of consumers, including 
those appearing in its advertisements," read the statement. "Gateway has worked 
out advertising ground rules with the FTC to which we are strongly committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Candace Poindexter, who runs a reading master's degree program at Loyola 
Marymount University, said that although Hooked on Phonics may be effective in 
helping adults to read, it goes against California Department of Education 
reading framework for learning to read. Children should have a literature-based 
approach to reading that emphasizes meaning rather than just sounding out 
words, Poindexter said.

2 GROUPS JOIN TO CREATE O.C. BUSINESS COUNCIL; MERGER: CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, 
INDUSTRIAL LEAGUE 'SHOULD BE MUCH MORE POWERFUL COMBINED,' AN OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's two dominant business groups announced plans Wednesday to 
merge, creating an organization with 2,100 member companies with 350,000 local 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new organization, to be called the Orange County Business Council, will 
meld the Orange County Chamber of Commerce & Industry with the Industrial 
League of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to help the local business community make "an immense leap 
forward," Fred Mickelson, chamber chairman, said during a news conference at 
the Center Club in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups said they initiated merger talks in February and reached final 
agreement this week during separate board meetings Tuesday night and Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members voted unanimously for the merger, to be completed within 90 
days. The groups have not decided where the new organization's headquarters 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial League President Todd B. Nicholson will serve as president of the 
new Business Council. Chamber President Ken Moore will be executive vice 
president for economic development. A transition team that includes executives 
from each organization will oversee the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination "makes a lot of sense," said Jack Kyser, chief economist with 
the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "In many cases, business 
organizations are competing with each other for the same membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Aigner, dean of the UC Irvine Graduate School of Management, 
characterized the merger as "a really terrific opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Aigner, who is a member of the Industrial League's board, said that the 
chamber "has been much more of a marketing vehicle," while the league "has been 
much more involved with the business policy and lobbying types of things." 
</P>
<P>
 By combining, he said, "they're not competing with each other. . . . They 
should be much more powerful combined. It will be Orange County business 
speaking with one voice rather than two." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber President Moore said that, given the county's current financial 
crisis, "it's important now, more than ever, that we come together." The new 
group, he said, will be positioned to "take a leadership role in the state of 
California and perhaps the nation."

 Kia Strike: Kia Motors America Inc. said that its U.S. operations, based in 
Irvine, will not be affected by a strike in South Korea. Kia Motors Co. workers 
there, angered by the South Korean government's decision to allow Samsung Group 
to start building automobiles in 1998, walked off the job late last week. The 
action ended Monday but cost No. 2 Korean car maker Kia about $125 million in 
lost production.

DECORATING THE CHRISTMAS TREE IS BIG BUSINESS; COLLECTING: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
ORNAMENTS CAN RANGE FROM AN IMPERSONAL INVESTMENT TO A PERSONAL PASSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LIGNITZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<P>
 For most people who buy them, Hallmark's Keepsake Ornaments are a chance to 
put a piece of Americana -- a Barbie doll or a spaceship -- on their Christmas 
tree. For some, it's an appropriate gift for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others who collect them, the hundreds of perky ornaments issued 
annually are something else entirely. The significance can range anywhere from 
an impersonal investment to a personal passion. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hallmark became aware in the mid-1980s of the interest in the ornaments, 
it created two jobs to run a collectors club. Those jobs soon merged into one, 
and Rachel Perkal has held it for the entire 7 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are truly passionate about their collecting," Perkal said. "They 
are incredibly involved with it." 
</P>
<P>
 One collector, who literally wrote the book on collecting Hallmark Keepsake 
ornaments, Clara Johnson Scroggins of Tampa, Fla., said an ornament she bought 
in 1977 for $3.50 is now worth $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then you have this collector from the heart, that just loves Christmas, 
just loves to decorate, not just one tree but multiple trees," Perkal said. 
"They feel more alive at Christmas. Really, this is the high point of their 
year. That person is truly passionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallmark said there are more than 100,000 members in its Collectors Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The company issued its first 18 Keepsake ornaments in 1973, six glass balls 
with art, and 12 made from yarn. They "just blew out," Perkal said. 
</P>
<P>
 And year after year, the collection has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there are 240 ornaments. Each fits into a special category such as 
Miniatures, Showcase, and Memories. Some stand on their own, while others are 
parts of series. Some reflect popular culture, like "The Lion King," while 
others are more traditional. Some have lights, moving parts, or let buyers 
record messages. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now thousands of Keepsake Ornaments. Six people in the world have 
every one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every Hallmark ornament they have ever produced. That's the way I 
collect," Scroggins said. "It is not greed, it is not egotism. It came out of 
those early years when not very many ornaments were made." 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggins' collection of more than 250,000 ornaments is worth several million 
dollars and kept in climate-controlled, secure storage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggins started collecting in 1972, just after her first husband's death and 
the year before Hallmark started its Keepsake Collection. She started 
collecting silver ornaments, but soon was collecting all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time I kind of looked down my nose at Hallmark, because it was not the 
fine metal I had been buying," Scroggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she soon appreciated the fact that Hallmark was giving people something 
they hadn't had before: glass balls marked with designs or years, those marking 
special events, and single ornaments the buyer could give away. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hallmark has expanded its line to include all kinds of materials. 
And Scroggins has written six editions of "Hallmark Keepsake Ornaments, a 
Collector's Guide," the first in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggins is also one of those collectors Perkal described as simply loving 
Christmas. She starts decorating around Halloween, putting up several trees and 
wreaths, decorating each with its own theme, such as all sterling or all bells. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me I'm a natural Christmas lover," said Scroggins, who is in her 
60s. "I was born New Year's Day. I came from a family of nine children. 
Everything was done big at my house, so I always thought in terms of big, lots. 
I have never been able to outgrow that."

THEY'RE THE FACES BEHIND THE GREETING CARDS; HOLIDAYS: THE CREATIVE STAFF AT 
HALLMARK GOES TO UNUSUAL LENGTHS TO TRY TO MAKE THE MESSAGES MEANINGFUL.

 Forget the neckties, suits and tidy work spaces. In the huge, concrete 
Hallmark Cards office complex lies the unfettered world of greeting card 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code: sweaters, jeans and faux army boots. The neatness policy: 
whatever inspires the creative juices, including almost anything from hamsters 
to jumbles of plastic toys. 
</P>
<P>
 No daily quota, no deadline, no homework. It's an atmosphere designed to 
cultivate creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to holidays -- Christmas is the biggest card season of the 
year -- keeping energized is especially important. The Greeting Card Assn. 
projects 2.6 billion Christmas cards will be sold this year, more than three 
times the number of Valentine's Day cards, and more than a third of the year's 
projected total. 
</P>
<P>
 A private company, Hallmark won't disclose how much it spends to keep the 670 
creative staff members -- artists, writers, editors and designers -- fresh. But 
employees say everything from research trips around the world to workshops to 
free movies helps. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has libraries, a creative center, and a farm and farmhouse, which 
are located in Kearney, about 30 minutes from downtown Kansas City, where 
workshops and creative sessions are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Jim Howard, a senior writer at Hallmark Cards, plans to take a 
group of writers in January to work -- if you can call it work -- on next 
year's line of Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping for bad weather so we can tramp around in the snow," Howard said. 
Writers will walk through the woods "with the express intent of composing 
spontaneous haiku," a Japanese form of three-line poetry. The best poems could 
become part of Hallmark's Christmas Naturals line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one way we try to keep the newness happening, because in the woods, it's 
always a little different than when you were there the last time," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallmark, which claims 45% of the overall greeting card market, has come up 
with more than 2,500 individual Christmas card designs and about 550 boxed card 
designs for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ideas are drawn from the writers' own memories as children, awe-struck by 
a glorious Christmas tree or eager to dive into a mountain of presents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to continually see the events going on from the point of view of my 
kids," Howard said. "Even the little things, remembering what it's like to be 
really small and have a big tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lie down on the floor and look up at it, it looks much bigger. It's a 
marvelous, towering thing as a kid. If you get any of that stirring up in your 
mind, it feeds your writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Evoking that feeling in the office involves viewing classic Christmas movies 
like "It's a Wonderful Life," and discussing Christmas memories with other 
writers -- even those of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have written more than one piece on somebody else's memory," Howard said. 
"Everything's grist." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallmark protects its loose, unguarded atmosphere year-round. For Allyson 
Jones, who writes for Hallmark's humorous Shoebox Division, it is ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of her gray cubicle are lined with posters -- some of which she's 
doctored to insert her own face -- and goofy pictures of friends and relatives. 
She's moved in a wicker table, an upholstered chair and her own coffee maker. 
Every morning she gets a list of needed card ideas, pours herself a cup of 
java, slips on headphones and tries to come up with 10 or 15 good card ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones described writing for the Shoebox line as "short, punchy." If an idea 
doesn't work, "you throw it in the trash," she said. "You never rework 
anything. Because if it's not funny, it's not going to be funny. It's like if 
you keep hearing your dad tell the same jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallmark Chairman Donald J. Hall said that, when he started full time with his 
father's company, he toured different firms that involved creative work. Each 
ran its creative staff differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did find it needs nurturing and mentoring," Hall said. "I think the best 
thing we can do is create an atmosphere where it's appreciated and where they 
can see results." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Duvall, who does romantic as well as humor writing for the company's 
main line of cards, said her ideas come from various sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sincere sentiments she pens come when she's low. She asks herself: 
"If I were my own guardian angel, what would I tell me? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, 'I'm so lonely and pitiful and no one will ever love me -- but if 
someone did, what would I want them to say?' It's really kind of fun."

WARDENS IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Department of Fish and Game wardens contend that they get a bad rap in 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Among recent news coverage involving wardens: 
</P>
<P>
 * In June, 1993, after a fatal virus was discovered at the Venice canals, Fish 
and Game wardens rounded up and killed more than 300 Venice-area ducks, fearing 
that they would infect migrating wildfowl.Residents launched massive protests, 
leaving flyers, balloons and flowers at the site "in respect for our dear loved 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 * In May, Azusa police shot a 350-pound black bear that had wandered into a 
neighborhood. Initially, Warden Mark Jeter fired two tranquilizer darts at the 
bear, which grew groggy. But the bear was killed by 14 shots fired by four 
police officers after it left a containment area. 
</P>
<P>
 * In September, a 400-pound black bear was trapped in a Monrovia neighborhood 
after neighbors reported that he had been taking avocados from neighbors' trees 
and taking dips in hot tubs. The Department of Fish and Game has a policy to 
euthanize animals that stalk neighborhoods and show no fear of people. But Gov. 
Pete Wilson intervened, and Samson the bear was eventually taken to the Orange 
County Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 * In November, South Pasadena resident Paula Drake announced that she would 
defy an order by state Fish and Game officials to release 18 sick or injured 
squirrels that she rehabilitates at her home. Fish and Game officials 
eventually backed off from enforcing the state policy that qualifies squirrels 
as wildlife and prohibit their domestication.

COVER STORY; THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER; GAME WARDEN BRAVES PERILS OF A DARK, 
MENACING WILDERNESS TO STALK NOCTURNAL POACHERS IN MT. BALDY'S BACK COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On winter nights in the forest, as Orion the Hunter mocks from the heavens in 
starry repose, the game warden is listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Darkness swallows the forest whole, robbing the warden of sight, playing 
tricks on his mind. In the stillness, the patter of deer hooves on brittle 
sycamore leaves is no longer charming, the graceless crashing of a black bear 
through brush holds menace -- and the crack of a high-powered rifle is so sure 
that the warden sometimes imagines his heart caught in the cross-hairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jeter, 34, a state Department of Fish and Game warden, is on overnight 
patrol for poachers in the Angeles National Forest's Mt. Baldy area, just north 
of Glendora. He has no partner, no reliable radio contact, no immediate backup. 
Every hunter he meets is armed and most likely up to no good -- hunting at 
night for most animals is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the forest's unforgiving back country, his lonely patrol is one that 
most people never see -- and his job, Jeter says, is woefully misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 People look at the state seal on Jeter's four-wheel-drive in puzzlement. "Fish 
and Game?" they ask. "What kind of games?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or they remember the September news coverage of wardens preparing to kill 
spa-hopping Samson the bear in Monrovia -- until Gov. Pete Wilson pushed for a 
reprieve. State officials finally found Samson a home at the Orange County Zoo. 
Or the day Jeter fired tranquilizer darts at a scared bear that lumbered 
through an Azusa neighborhood in May and then was shot to death by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it 'fish and maim,' " lamented Jeter, a folksy Oklahoma native who 
lives in Glendora with his wife and two children. "(They say), 'You're either 
killing something or sitting in a coffee shop.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no coffee shop on Jeter's mountain beat -- the only coffee he gets 
is his own instant cappuccino out of a thermos. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and game wardens also get a bad rap from other law enforcement officers 
who dismiss them as "critter cops." But wardens have the same legal authority 
and power of arrest as police officers, and their work can be even more risky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game wardens stand six times the chance of being assaulted with firearms as an 
officer on the street, according to a 1990 federal study. The U.S. Department 
of the Interior study concluded that the game warden's patrol is the country's 
most dangerous form of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In his third year as a game warden, Jeter sets his own hours, working by land, 
sea and air. One day, he'll chase lobster poachers by skiff off Catalina Island 
or work a plainclothes detail at a swap meet, searching for illegal bear-claw 
jewelry (It is legal to kill bears with the proper permits, but it is illegal 
to sell their parts). On another day, he'll put on shorts and hiking boots and 
backpack eight miles into the woods in search of bighorn-sheep poachers. Or, on 
a busy hunting weekend, he'll patrol the forest by small plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all his assignments, Jeter prefers night patrol in the forest, a prime time 
for poachers who skulk through the canyons under the cover of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kill black bears and peddle their gallbladders -- for about $265 a gram 
-- for use in pricey Asian folk remedies for stomach problems and other 
ailments.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Angeles National Forest, wardens have found only one bear recently with 
a sliced-out gallbladder, near Ojai. But in June, Jeter and other area wardens 
arrested a Rosemead businessman for allegedly trafficking hundreds of 
gallbladders, most from black bears killed in other Western states. The arrest 
was the culmination of a 1 1/2-year undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In winter, when deer, bear and other large game animals are in season, Jeter 
patrols the forest about three nights a week for hunters. It's illegal to hunt 
most animals at night because the darkness gives hunters an unfair advantage, 
state fish and game officials say. Also, it is more dangerous to shoot in 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For cover, Jeter dims his two-way radio light and kills his headlights. His 
Ford Bronco's grille is painted black so the chrome doesn't catch the 
moonlight. If he parks for a long time, he pulls an olive-drab parachute over 
his truck and anchors it with a tree or rock to avoid a telltale silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 One night a week, under a blaze of stars, he camps out on a portable cot in a 
sleeping bag, with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun and flashlight at his 
side, a two-pound bulletproof vest snug beneath his clothes. He sleeps 
fitfully, trying to shut out the eerie scream of the mountain lion killing 
prey, and the hungry young owl that screeches and snaps its bill when it begs 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
 He's up by first light, when hunters start their day, antsy for action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something gets taken illegally or something gets poached, it's my fault 
that I wasn't there," Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights, Jeter sits for hours in his truck, or walks the roads, watching 
for lights, listening for gunshots. In the bustle of the city, sometimes 
gunfire passes unnoticed, or is dismissed as a car backfiring. In the still of 
the forest, there is no mistaking gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 If all is quiet, he drives on to hot spots, including water holes, where 
hunters search for forked deer prints in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter's Mt. Baldy beat is roughly 132,470 acres, a territory almost 10 times 
the size of Pomona. In California, about 265 wardens patrol 100 million acres, 
an average of 377,358 acres per warden. 
</P>
<P>
 In his forest-green Bronco, Jeter drives carefully on winding, unpaved roads 
with no guardrails. He keeps watch over deep canyons, thick with chaparral, 
manzanita and canyon oak, where bears prowl for acorns, holly leaf and coffee 
berry. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, far from the city lights, the forest is as black as the backdrop of 
a search-and-destroy video game. Poachers shine 1-million-candlepower 
spotlights into the hills until they hit pay dirt -- deer eyes, which glow 
emerald green. And then they shoot, sometimes with high-powered assault rifles, 
equipped with night scopes. The guns, which are legal for use but frowned on by 
many hunters, can quickly pump 20 or 30 rounds into a deer. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money, some hunters don't pay for the required licenses. It costs 
$24.95 for a hunting license, plus $16.55 for a "tag," or permit to shoot a 
deer, $23 for a bear permit. If you're caught without the proper permits, it's 
roughly a $650 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Others hunt while drunk, or try to take more than the two deer and one bear 
allowed under law. Still others set leg-hold traps -- and fail to check them 
once a day, as required -- or use illegal bait, such as a cut-up fawn or a deer 
shot out of season to attract bear, mountain lions or other animals looking for 
a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, right before deer season, Jeter got a tip about an illegal 
bait-and-shoot ruse in the foothills above San Dimas. About a quarter of a mile 
off the road, a hunter had hacked a 40-yard swath through laurel sumac and 
built an eight-foot-wide shooting lane. At the end of the lane, the hunter dug 
a pit, with brush trimmed around it so only his head could peek out. At the 
lane's other end the hunter left bait -- a water trough, two hunks of salt and 
a bale of hay. 
</P>
<P>
 For three dark mornings, Jeter staked out the pit, showing up at 3 a.m., so 
cold that he could barely move. The hunter never showed. Eventually, the brush 
grew back and covered the setup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter was undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you go all night and don't even see a light, not even hear a 
gunshot," Jeter said. "But if you don't do the time, if you don't do the hours, 
you'll never catch these guys. You can't expect to go out for an hour or two 
and go, 'No bad guys tonight. Time to go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This hunting season, Jeter has so far issued seven citations, mostly for deer 
poaching and weapon violations, about average. The season began in October for 
animals including deer and bear, and in November, for most others; deer season 
ended Nov. 6, and bear season ends Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Most violations are misdemeanors, punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and six 
months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 95% of all poachers get away, according to fish and game studies 
on detection rates. Last year, wardens issued 2,150 citations for poaching, 
about 17% of them for illegal taking of deer, the most common offense. In 1988, 
the Department of Fish and Game had 14 wardens in an undercover anti-poaching 
unit; now, because of budget cutbacks, the unit has only one permanent warden. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forest rangers also patrol the woods, but their shifts end by 5 p.m., and 
by midnight, sheriff's deputies are done with mountain patrol. After that, 
Jeter is the lone law enforcement officer on duty in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, nobody knows exactly where Jeter's patrol takes him. In the canyons, 
his radio contact fades in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Night patrol is heart-stopping duty. It is a tough drive, on windy, unpaved 
roads through steep canyons, hard to follow after long nights driving endless 
stretches, or when a light in the hills diverts Jeter's attention from the 
road. Sometimes, a tire on Jeter's Bronco catches the side of the road, or his 
bumper scrapes the canyon's steep edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, sometimes, Jeter watches the hills with a night scope and spots hunters, 
who sometimes spot him as well, so they unsling their rifles and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst moment is when Jeter drives up to one of the U.S. Forest Service's 
locked gates, which are there to keep people out of areas that are off limits. 
He is wary about reaching for the combination lock into the gate post's nook, a 
potential nestling place for rattlesnakes, though he's never found any there. 
With his back spotlighted by the Bronco's glaring headlights, he is a sitting 
duck if anyone wanted to take a shot. At that moment, if a twig or two cracks 
in the wind, it's enough to set Jeter -- a former federal drug enforcement 
officer -- on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not me thinking, 'Gee, that's a bear or a mountain lion,' " Jeter said. 
"It's, 'Is that a person? And what the heck are they doing 12 miles up, in the 
middle of nowhere, on the road or up behind this locked gate?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have a hard time believing that a mountain lion is going to come up 
and make me a meal. The thing I fear is the crazy person, the person who's not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Halloween, in a thicket of trees near Mt. Baldy, Jeter ran across three 
young people in white robes and black masks. Near pentagrams chalked in the 
dirt, they sat with a sword, owl's wing and a jar of goat's blood, chanting at 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 He confiscated the owl's wing -- someone said they got it from a road kill -- 
and sent the group on its way. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emergency, Jeter would try to radio his dispatch center in Sacramento or 
forest dispatchers in Arcadia for help from Azusa or Glendora police. But his 
back-country beat, which rises to an elevation of 6,000 feet, includes Devil's 
Canyon, Barbecue Alley and Valley of the Moons, places that aren't on any map. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Jeter hasn't run into a situation that he couldn't handle. In his 
three years on the beat, Jeter hasn't shot anyone or been shot at. Mostly, he 
runs into nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 In pitch blackness, for instance, he will hook a chain to a snapped yucca 
plant that blocks the road and use his truck to drag it away. Or he'll run into 
careless hunters who use their great-grandfather's old rifle, some with 
taped-up stocks, or the barrel rusted shut, or half a stock so they have to 
shoot from the hip. Old rifles aren't illegal, but they're dangerous, and the 
shooters are as likely to kill themselves -- or someone else -- as any animal. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent late-night patrol, Jeter issued a citation to a 60-year-old man 
for keeping a loaded rifle and handgun in his four-wheel-drive truck, next to 
his 13-year-old grandson. The craggy-faced man, a hunter for 28 years, said he 
keeps the weapons close for protection, not to take illegal shots from the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes later, Jeter suddenly stopped his Bronco. In the moonless 
night, he had spotted a glint in the road, maybe a shell casing from a 
.38-caliber handgun, the type of weapon owned by the man he had just cited. He 
backed up and looked, jacket-less and in short sleeves in air so cold that he 
could see his breath. No luck. He backed up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Jeter found a .38-caliber shell casing, but it was an old one, 
sitting upright in the road, full of water from the previous night's rain. But 
Jeter checked the casing anyway, against the shells he had just confiscated. No 
match. If the shells had matched, then maybe the man had lied -- and had indeed 
shot at something from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter says his job is nothing, compared with his brother's, who works as a 
policeman in Roseville, outside Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ride along with my brother sometimes," said Jeter, who has a degree in 
criminal justice from Sacramento State University. "We go to gang fights. Oh, 
man. Everyone's moving around. Everyone's (cursing) everyone. I am, like, 
stressed at the end of the night. . . . I think his job is a lot more dangerous 
than mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The warden's job demands a love of the outdoors, the ability to sit still in 
the wilderness for hours on end, for a starting salary of $26,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeter is not a hunter. He won't even run over snakes in the road. Instead, he 
uses tongs to move them out of the away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the forest, there are sights to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 On the darkest of nights, the Seven Sisters constellation lights up the sky. 
Once, in an electrical storm, Jeter watched a lightning bolt split a big pine 
tree and set it afire. Another time, in the early morning near the San Gabriel 
River's East Fork, he saw what looked like a dog at the side of the road, 
digging madly, dirt flying everywhere. It turned out to be a small bear, head 
buried in an ant hill, only its butt sticking out. 
</P>
<P>
 He even runs into regulars, such as the great horned owl that perches on the 
highway marker night after night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get bored of seeing (animals)," Jeter said. "Like the deer I saw the 
other night. That was great. It's not like, 'Oh, there's another deer, I see 
them every damn day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even on his days off, he drives to the forest with his wife, 11-year-old son 
and 10-year-old daughter, for camping, fishing or hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 His job takes its toll on the family. During the height of deer season, Jeter 
often leaves home Friday night and returns on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Jeter's dream job, the one he always had his eye on, even when he was 
working in drug enforcement. He still has the sixth-grade essay he wrote on why 
he wanted to be a game warden. As a kid, growing up near rural areas, he spent 
all day outside. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 10, in Florida's Panhandle, he and a friend decided to camp in the 
woods -- until it got cold and dark. Two hours later, scared to death, they 
moved to a spot under a street light on the edge of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come a long way now," he said. "Now, I don't need the street light." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Orion the Hunter, a winter constellation, lights the night sky for him, 
bow and arrow perpetually poised, ready for the kill.

COVER STORY; THE DIVISION PROBLEM; TEACHERS ARE FACING GREATER CHALLENGES AS 
SCHOOLS BECOME MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 History teacher Scott Samuel never thought of himself as an oppressive white 
male, but some of his students did. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing colonial America with his 11th-grade class at Hamilton High School, 
students argued that race relations in this country had not evolved enough 
because people like Samuel were still in positions of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel took the opportunity to engage the class in a discussion on racial 
issues and the power structure in the United States. He found himself 
explaining to his students that as a Jewish man, he had never considered 
himself part of the white majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience, he said, proved far more lively and valuable for students and 
teacher than reviewing a textbook reading assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, it also came as a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Jewish, I had never thought of myself as being part of an oppressor 
group," said Samuel, 26. "It totally threw me off to hear a group of people say 
they saw me in that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Such situations are becoming increasingly common in Los Angeles County 
classrooms, where teachers as a group have remained predominantly white while 
student bodies have grown more ethnically diverse. On the Westside, the 
demographic trend is most evident in the Culver City and Los Angeles school 
districts, where non-white student enrollment is 62% and 88%, respectively, 
while the share of non-white school staffers, most of whom are teachers, is 13% 
and 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 In these and other districts, teachers are frequently facing racial and 
cultural misunderstandings -- and finding their assumptions about themselves 
and their work under challenge. That has made for classroom tension -- a 
problem, education groups say, that merits as much concern as the more widely 
recognized problem of racial tension among students. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, some school districts and nonprofit groups have begun offering 
special training programs to help teachers understand and work effectively with 
minority students and colleagues. But such assistance, usually voluntary, so 
far has not reached a large percentage of teachers and in some cases has been 
criticized as confrontational and counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, educators say, the key to resolving racial issues among teachers 
will be teachers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a point where teachers are forced to change if they are to be in 
tune with their students," said Steve Martinez, principal of El Marino 
Elementary School in the Culver City Unified district. "An effective teacher is 
one that sees the change and responds to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts warn that in embracing such change, teachers must be careful not 
to undermine their main mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is that are you are working so hard to be politically correct 
without being educationally correct and not addressing the real issue of 
self-esteem: education," said Joel Kotkin, an author who has written 
extensively about ethnic issues. "In the real world you have to be able to 
compete based on skills." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, however, say teachers still must try to become more aware of 
minority concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "To effectively reach young people, we need to understand and address those 
special needs and (different) cultures," said Bud Jacobs, principal of Venice 
High School. "Because of L.A.'s diversity, adults learn more from kids than 
they do from other adults." 
</P>
<P>
 For teachers, the classroom problems that stem from racial or cultural 
differences can be as straightforward as a language barrier or as subtle as a 
misguided assumption about a student's behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Cohen, principal of McKinley Elementary School in Santa Monica, says she 
has dealt with teachers who have misinterpreted the behavior of students, in 
most cases Asian, who are being reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child may lower his head . . . but he is not showing disrespect," she says. 
"In his culture he is showing deference to an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel of Hamilton High, meanwhile, says he was taken aback on one occasion 
when his students reacted with outrage as he was describing the economic forces 
behind slavery in the South. The students, especially African Americans, felt 
Samuel was portraying slavery as justifiable.  
</P>
<P>
 Samuel says he continues to present such material to his students, but now 
points out to them that he is offering an analysis, not a point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the students) have a hard time drawing a line between what you are 
saying and where you stand," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers do not appear to be as aware of their students' feelings, 
however. Mike Schwartz, a junior at Hamilton High School, says that insensitive 
comments by some teachers at his school have contributed to a feeling among 
students that the teachers are out of touch and not worthy of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such example this year, he said, one of his teachers joked to a group 
of Latino students: "Hey, what are you doing? Don't you have any drugs to sell 
or tacos to make?" 
</P>
<P>
 When teachers are aware that racial sleights are occurring, whether by other 
teachers or by students, they do not always feel that it is their duty to 
address the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Aida Diaz, multicultural coordinator at Santa Monica/Malibu Unified, says 
teachers have told her that they do not believe they can do anything about 
other other people's prejudices. She disagrees, saying the prejudices often 
arise in school or in the media -- and teachers are uniquely positioned to 
combat them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My little boy came home the other day and told me that I couldn't vote 
because I was a Mexican ," she said. "I told him that he was Mexican too and he 
almost started to cry. He said, 'No, Mommy, I'm an American.' He has a picture 
in his mind about Mexicans that is not very positive. I want to know where he 
got this. I'm glad he thinks of himself as an American but he doesn't need to 
put down other people." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, teachers feel they are the victims of racial stereotyping. At a 
retreat for Los Angeles County teachers in Malibu recently, several minority 
teachers complained about their treatment by white colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Farrar, of Polytechnic School in Pasadena, said that numerous times 
during his career, white colleagues have acted surprised because he speaks 
without using the slang they expect from African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'God, Robert, you speak differently! Where are you from? What is 
your background?' " Farrar says. "The perception is that, I guess, as a black 
man, I should sound or act or look like what might be perpetuated in movies or 
songs."  
</P>
<P>
 In response to such problems, some school districts and teachers themselves 
make use of sensitivity training programs offered by nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A World of Difference," offered by the Anti-Defamation League, 
professional facilitators help teachers address stereotypes, prejudices, fears 
and frustration in a non-confrontational manner. Fees vary from a minimum of 
$500 for a three-hour session, to a maximum of $1,400 for a six- to eight-hour 
session and do not include instruction materials.  
</P>
<P>
 In the program, participants are asked to become aware of their biases and 
prejudices through discussions, educational videos and written exercises that 
they can use in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also urged to recognize the diversity of their students and regard it 
as positive. Organizers acknowledge that their teaching runs counter to the 
model of American society as a "melting pot" or as "colorblind." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to see (our differences) is a denial of who that person is," said 
facilitator Roberta Youtan Kay. "We are diverse, we are different from one 
another. There is a lot to gain in (accepting) our diversity. We will have a 
greater base of knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Another program offered exclusively for teachers is sponsored by the National 
Conference of Christians and Jews. The NCCJ Human Relations Retreat, a weekend 
of intense and, at times, confrontational exercises, is free of charge and 
offers teachers a $100 stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar seeks to educate teachers about the cultural and racial diversity 
of their students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teachers are teaching students who are different from them," said 
National Conference program director Lecia Brooks. "The school districts 
haven't been able to educate them about how to work with the rapidly changing 
demographics, but their principals nevertheless expect them to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 In one Human Relations Retreat this fall, the most dramatic moments came 
during a "speak-out." Nonwhite teachers sat on one side of the room, white 
teachers on the other. Without restraint, the minority teachers gave vent to 
the anger and frustration racism had caused them. At one point, even the 
facilitators joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Asian person I want you to know that it has taken me years to get over 
the training that I am not as good as you, that I have to be like you," said 
facilitator Henry Aronson, addressing the white teachers, his voice breaking 
with emotion. "I have to look, act, talk, walk and be like you in order to do 
anything appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the white teachers sat in silence, a few expressed feelings of 
guilt and shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a person of my race, I am ashamed of my father teaching me that it's OK 
for you to work for me but I can't be friends with you," said Anne Sivley of 
Lakewood Elementary School in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts criticize such methods, saying they sometimes backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original intention of these cultural sensitivity seminars is 
well-meaning," said David Hayes Bautista, director of the UCLA Center for the 
Study of Latino Health. "It is to let non-minorities experience what it is like 
to be a minority for a few minutes. Unfortunately, I think this hits such an 
emotional chord and the next steps are often misplaced (that) without raising 
issues of a larger shared vision that binds people together, the tendency is to 
harden divisions among groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel, who attended the NCCJ weekend retreat, agrees. Although he says he 
found the seminar valuable, he did not feel the "speak-out" was conducive to 
improving race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting real upset by the tone of accusation (by people of color) and 
by the apologies (from whites). Not only did I think that (was) inappropriate, 
but (also) unproductive. I can recognize when I've done something bad, but I 
don't need to apologize for it if I did not do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Program director Brooks, however, says the exchanges are valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of our program hinges on honest dialogue between people about 
their own experiences," she said. "Having group members who are ready to share 
what they have seen and felt -- and professional facilitators to help them 
express it -- is far more effective than any lesson plan ever devised." 
</P>
<P>
 Some school districts have also launched their own efforts to make teachers 
more aware of racial and cultural issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles district, teachers are required to take an eight- to 
16-week course in multicultural and racial sensitivity training. The district 
also offers foreign language courses and multicultural study guides to teachers 
who request them. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica/Malibu Unified last year implemented a plan, called Project 
REACH, designed to spread multicultural teacher training to all schools. Under 
the program, whose full name is Respect and Excellence Across Cultures and 
Heritages, one or two teachers from each school are expected to attend seminars 
such as the one offered by the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they create an action plan for their campuses that includes study guides 
to help their colleagues tailor course work to students of diverse ethnic 
backgrounds. Implementation of the action plans is left to the discretion of 
each school. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Diaz: "We want to be more multicultural every day and move beyond the 
food fiestas." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay, the facilitator for the World of Difference program, says such efforts 
could prove crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers can do so much to combat racism and prejudice," said Kay. "Their 
influence is so great working with kids every day. (And) the damage they can do 
is great if they are not aware." 
</P>

 Mark Jeter, a state Fish and Game warden, patrols the Angeles National Forest 
near Mt. Baldy. His job includes everything from searching for poachers to 
taking butchered deer meat -- nabbed from poachers -- to Sisters of the Poor 
charity in Long Beach.Here are some bits and pieces from a game warden's life: 
</P>
<P>
 What others in law enforcement call wardens: Critter cops. 
</P>
<P>
 How fishermen who exceed the state limit react when they see him: They stuff 
wriggling fish into their boots or pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 What people dressed in hunter orange say when Jeter asks for their hunting 
license: "I'm just shooting at rocks"; "I'm just trying to protect my buddy 
from bears." 
</P>
<P>
 What people try to steal from the forest: Jeter caught one man with an 
8-week-old mountain lion stuffed under his car seat, a rope around its neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wardens don't like dove season, which starts in the fall: Hunters shoot 
wildly at the sky, and pellets rain down, peppering wardens and others. Last 
year, a hunter in the Angeles took a shot at a low-flying dove, accidentally 
shooting a warden in the face.

offering one or more 1996 models under $10,000, Nissan's base four-door Altima 
XE, at $14,799, was shown as the company's least-expensive '96 model. Omitted 
was the entire 1996 Sentra line, which will not be available until January,

 Call it a tale of two cities with a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada High repeated as Suburban League champion and Montebello won a share 
of its second consecutive Almont League title. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada (13-1) waltzed its way through its first undefeated regular season 
in 10 years. The Matadores outscored their five league opponents, 196-44, 
giving up only one touchdown in their first four league games and reached the 
Southern Section final for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadores, who entered the Division VIII playoffs as the top-seeded team 
for the second year in a row, lost to Bloomington, 48-32, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello (10-2) went undefeated in Almont League play, culminating the 
regular season with a 42-0 victory over previously unbeaten Alhambra. The 
Oilers advanced to the Division III quarterfinals for the second year in a row, 
losing to eventual finalist Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada and Montebello have placed five players each on The Times' 1994 
Southeast All-Star football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe (7-4), which won a share of its second consecutive Del Rio League 
title, and St. Paul (7-3), which opened the season with six victories in a row, 
are represented by three players each. Two players from Schurr and La Serna 
were chosen. 
</P>
