MOVIE REVIEW; VIOLENCE, DRUGS AND CHESS; IN 'FRESH,' AUTHENTICITY ENDS UP BEING 
SACRIFICED FOR TITILLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Fresh" isn't. Glibly shocking, it would like you to think it deals with the 
hard realities of urban life, but in fact it uses its patina of social 
consciousness as a come-on for the most conventional kind of violent commercial 
filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and revolving around the life and hard 
times of 12-year-old Michael, Fresh to his friends, Boaz Yakin's debut film as 
a writer-director does have several effective acting performances, especially 
Sean Nelson's in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 But no amount of eye-catching acting can disguise the fact that this film is a 
masquerade. Despite its attempt at an authentic setting, "Fresh" has more in 
common with earlier Yakin writing projects like the Clint Eastwood actioner 
"The Rookie" than with something like "Boyz N the Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, however, "Fresh" has a promising air to it. Fresh's encounter with 
a kindly Latino lady who provides chocolate chip cookies while she gets some 
heroin ready for him to deliver has an intriguing quality. Who is this 
stone-faced youngster, so sure of himself in such an unnerving world? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because he lives with a saintly aunt and no less than 11 cousins in a 
crowded group home, Fresh spends much of his time out on the street working for 
a cross-section of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito) is the elegant local heroin connection, given to 
rhapsodizing about "the Land of H" and talking about his work as more secure 
than banking. By contrast, Corky (Ron Brice) and Jake (Jean LaMarre), the crack 
establishment, are much more volatile and bad-tempered individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 All parties agree, however, that Fresh is a stand-up little guy, smart, 
ambitious, the very picture of responsibility. Corky speaks for the entire 
neighborhood when he says, "Only reason you not the man, you too . . . little." 
</P>
<P>
 Adept at looking after himself, Fresh is, not by choice, estranged from his 
family. His mother is not around, his sister Nichole (N'Bushe Wright) is a 
heroin addict who the married Esteban is drawn to, and Fresh's father, Sam, is 
a story all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A speed chess wizard who (like the Laurence Fishburne character in "Searching 
for Bobby Fisher") hustles the unwary in Washington Square Park, Sam only meets 
with his son to tutor him in the game. A believer in values despite his 
dissolute lifestyle, Sam is given a smart and powerful presence by Samuel L. 
Jackson that emphasizes the ambivalent place he has in his son's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Nelson, who has done some previous TV and theater work, holds his own 
with Jackson as a boy whose face gives nothing away. Esposito, Wright, Brice 
and LaMarre also provide vivid performances, but even early on the 
uncomfortable sense that things are being artificially over-amped is present. 
</P>
<P>
 That artificiality soon takes permanent hold when a calculated-to-shock act of 
random violence turns Fresh's world around and motivates him to attempt a plan 
of such complexity that it takes the rest of the picture just to work itself 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Fresh" wants us to believe that the boy's chess-playing skills enable 
him to concoct such an intricate scenario, in fact the idea is so far-fetched 
and unlikely that audiences will have trouble following it, let alone believing 
that any kid could've come up with it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fresh's plan unfolds, the film's attempts at realism are revealed as no 
more than jive-talking window dressing. Like any exploitation film, "Fresh" 
turns out to want nothing more than to titillate and make us gasp, and 
everything authentic in the film is sacrificed toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
 As violent scene follows violent scene, it is possible to notice how phony 
even the film's painstakingly constructed macho dialogue starts to sound. And 
"Fresh's" willingness to use legitimate social problems as nothing more than an 
excuse for cheap thrills gets increasingly off-putting. Fresh and his father 
may be able to push those chess pieces around at breakneck speed, but audiences 
will want to be treated with more respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for intense, realistic depiction of urban violence, and for 
drug content, pervasive language and some sexuality. Times guidelines: It 
includes several graphic murders, including those of three young children, and 
the on-camera hanging of a dog. 'Fresh'

 Paris Update: The Paris Opera's sacked conductor Myung-Whun Chung was barred 
from a rehearsal studio Tuesday, a day after a judge reinstated him in the job, 
witnesses said. Chung, escorted by his lawyer into the futuristic edifice of 
stone and glass, was stopped at the studio door in a face-to-face clash with 
director Jean-Paul Cluzel as a rehearsal was about to start. Chung, 41, was 
dismissed two weeks ago in a contract dispute, the latest chapter in a string 
of scandals that have rocked the Paris Opera. A judge ruled on Monday that 
Chung should get his job back pending a final ruling on the dispute.

 Nirvana Release Halved: Plans announced last week for a double album of live 
Nirvana songs have been scaled back. The DGC Records release, due by the end of 
the year, will now be a single album, consisting of the band's "MTV Unplugged" 
acoustic special taped last November. Included will be two songs filmed for 
that show that did not air on TV. The second album of unreleased live 
performances has been postponed indefinitely. Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, 
who is compiling the album along with drummer Dave Grohl, explained the revised 
plans by saying that while the double release was planned as the "ultimate 
tribute" to Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, who committed suicide in April, 
"the emotional aspect of it all threw us for a loop. The live record is gonna 
happen, but not now."

 Paternity Claim Dismissed: Citing insufficient evidence, British magistrates 
on Tuesday threw out a claim by a woman living in the United States that 
homosexual pop star Boy George was the father of her son. The unnamed woman 
sued the flamboyant British singer of the 1980s group Culture Club last 
September, seeking maintenance of her 7-year-old son. The singer said at the 
time that he had never had sex with any woman and the birth must have been a 
"miracle." MOVIES

MOVIE REVIEW; SOLID STARS BUT 'MILK MONEY' STRETCHES PREMISE TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's one star who'd be a safe bet for getting away with playing an 
archetypal hooker with a heart of gold, she'd have to be Melanie Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Milk Money," as in "Shining Through," Griffith has a mix of vulnerability, 
dignity and moxie that persuades you to believe in her no matter what. Here, 
she has a strong assist from Ed Harris in a distinctively different kind of 
role for him, but they and director Richard Benjamin don't get much help from 
first-time screenwriter John Mattson. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has got to be just about the nicest guy in the world, a science teacher 
desperately trying to save some wetlands near his Pittsburgh suburb and 
single-handedly raising his 12-year-old son (Michael Patrick Carter), whose 
mother died during his birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and his pals (Brian Christopher, Adam LaVorgna) have reached the age 
when they think it's high time they see a woman naked. A couple of plot 
maneuvers later, Griffith not only winds up the woman they hire but also on the 
lam, staying in Carter's treehouse. Pretty much from the get-go Carter thinks 
Griffith would be the perfect mother for him and the perfect wife for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this premise for a comedy with both romantic and adolescent angles 
is a bit of a stretch, to put it mildly. It needs all the shoring up it can 
get, but Mattson instead keeps on stretching its credibility, throwing in some 
underworld caricatures (which wastes such stalwarts as Malcolm McDowell and 
Philip Bosco) and a number of crude, tasteless moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin brings to the film a graceful buoyancy and a perceptive affection for 
its key people that holds it together. But when it comes to hooker fantasies, 
"Milk Money" doesn't remotely possess the resiliency and punch of "Pretty 
Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the producers went for the best in such key assignments as cameraman 
(David Watkin), production designer (Paul Sylbert) and costume designer (Theoni 
V. Aldredge), it's hard to understand why they didn't bring in a seasoned 
writer to bolster the script. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad, because the chemistry between Griffith and Harris is just as 
potent as it was between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Benjamin plays for 
strength, which lies in the relationships between father, son and prostitute, 
and in the contrast between the brassy Griffith and the film's idyllic Norman 
Rockwell suburban setting. But only the least demanding audiences can be 
expected to buy into "Milk Money." 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for sexual themes and situations involving adolescents. 
Times guidance: Although no sex takes place between the prostitute and the 
boys, the film put considerable emphasis on sexuality and has a scene of 
considerable sexual innuendo. 'Milk Money'

THEATER REVIEW; 'NATURE GIRLS' STRIPS AWAY STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging from the title, "Sacred Naked Nature Girls" could be the theatrical 
equivalent of a Russ Meyer movie. However, the piece, which is currently 
playing at Highways as part of its annual "ecce lesbo/ecce homo" festival of 
lesbian and gay performance art, is aptly named. The performers are completely 
naked throughout the show. They are certainly natural -- no full-body makeup in 
evidence here. They are all female. And, by the evening's end, one realizes, 
with a little start of surprise, that they are indeed somewhat sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a structured, linear work, nor is it particularly disciplined in 
terms of pacing or text. However, the limitations in craft and continuity do 
not detract from the overall effect, which is rough, risky, uproarious and 
occasionally wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers -- Danielle Brazell, Laura Meyers, Akilah Nayo Oliver and 
Denise Uyehara (regular company member Bella Hui is absent from this 
engagement) -- work in what they have termed the "flesh memory" process. At 
times, the result is playful; a woman, engaged in exuberant sex with her 
partner, makes her voice ever tinier and breathier in order to feel truly 
"feminine." At other times, the result is painful; two women engage in 
simultaneous rape fantasy/recollections -- one ecstatic, the other horrifying. 
In the most beautiful and dramatic image of the evening, the small, ravaged 
silhouette of a rape victim, projected on the wall, merges into the towering 
nude shadow of a bountiful, benevolent mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nature Girls strip more than clothes away from the female form. They also 
strip away the crudeness and lewdness with which nude women are portrayed in 
most media. These women are not the airbrushed objects of male fantasy. They 
are the proud exponents of their own sexual agendas, with figure "flaws" 
defiantly intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritualized ceremony that closes the show takes on a near-sacramental 
significance. The women anoint one another with body paint, chatting and 
chanting. At one point, one admiringly comments to another, "Is that a new 
scar?" In this community of women, scars are medals of valor, as worthy of 
respect and honor as a man's battle decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sacred Naked Nature Girls," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. 
Thursday-Sunday only, 8:30 p.m. (the show is performed for women only on 
Thursday). $10-$12. (Friday's benefit performance $20.) (213) 660-8587. Running

TV REVIEW; A POORMAN'S LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an anecdote from the early days of television: A breathless champion 
of the new medium is explaining its virtues to a lifelong radio enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like radio with pictures!" the TV person says. 
</P>
<P>
 To which the radio person replies: "Pictures of what?" 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference between "The Love Channel," a new TV show hosted (on 
leased time) by former deejay Jim (Poorman) Trenton, and "Loveline," the radio 
call-in advice program that Trenton hosted for more than 10 years on KROQ-FM, 
is that now Trenton can be seen as well as heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is decidedly a mixed blessing. If Dick Clark remains "America's 
teen-ager," Trenton pretty much has a lock on the dubious distinction of being 
"America's juvenile." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Love Channel" premiered live Monday at midnight on Anaheim's KDOC-TV 
Channel 56, where it will continue weeknights until (a) Trenton really does 
become the Poorman paying for the air time and calls it quits, or until (b), 
saints preserve us, the show catches on, in which case KDOC or another 
commercial station might decide to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its radio counterpart that continues on KROQ minus Trenton (who has filed 
a $22.5-million lawsuit claiming ownership of the "Loveline" show), "The Love 
Channel" invites those at home to call in with their love, sex and/or legal 
problems. All three kinds came into play with the first caller: a 17-year-old 
girl from Hollywood who said her boyfriend is pressuring her to have anal sex, 
which has her worried that he might be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dick Cavett Show" it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers patient enough to tolerate Trenton's lowbrow sex jokes can get medical 
advice from Dr. Danielle Ardolino, a UCLA Medical School graduate who is 
completing her residency at the UC Irvine Medical Center, or legal tips from 
Dan Hustwit and Carlos Spiga, partners in a Century City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her "Loveline" predecessor, Dr. Danielle, as she is referred to on the 
show, constantly voiced her frustration with Trenton's infantile behavior, 
which he has parlayed into a career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late-night talk-show wars, Trenton trumpets himself as the only genuine 
alternative to Leno-Letterman-O'Brien, and on that count he's right. 
Technically, "Beavis and Butt-head" isn't a talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 From a production standpoint, the show looks better than most self-produced 
paid programming, suggesting that Newport Beach resident Trenton, who also is 
executive producer of "The Love Channel," has enough smarts to surround himself 
with a competent crew. 
</P>
<P>
 What they actually capture with their cameras is another story. Leased air 
time means that Trenton pays the station for a block of time, then lines up his 
own sponsors in the hope of recouping his outlay. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every aspect of the show contained a plug for one of his sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's few genuinely humorous bits came about 40 minutes in, 
when Trenton began earnestly begging the crew to find even more commercial 
spots that he was afraid hadn't aired yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the advertisers, he interrupted the plugfest as few times as 
possible with actual programming. Consequently, just three callers and one 
in-studio guest, who wore a bag over his head to conceal his identity, asked 
for advice about problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong show included several taped features that appeared to be regular 
segments -- each with its own sponsor, natch -- including "Nadia's Hollywood 
Trash Report," which jumped abruptly to -- imagine this -- a commercial just as 
Nadia was voicing her unsubstantiated opinion that the star of several hit 
action films has mob ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who tune in strictly to bask in Trenton's loopy, Beaver 
Cleaver-on-testosterone personality may have a hard time wading through all the 
sponsor-kissing on "The Love Channel," which might more accurately be called 
"The Plug Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the disadvantage of TV became blatantly clear: Now when Poorman 
becomes unbearable, you have to turn the sound and the picture down. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Love Channel" airs Monday through Friday at midnight on KDOC-TV Channel 
56.

 Stop us before we drive the 405 again: A driver's license with a no-freeways 
restriction? 
</P>
<P>
 The subject came up after DMV Director Frank Zolin told the Orange County 
Register that the agency might consider excusing applicants from the newly 
required freeway driving test if they promise to stick to surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a hot topic on KFI radio this week. "Some listeners thought the 
wimps should get on the freeway," said John Kobylt of "The John and Ken Show." 
"Others thought if people don't want to go on the freeway, it's better for the 
rest of us that they don't." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I found the comments made by Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson (Commentary, Aug. 
18) to be interesting, albeit lacking in some of the more serious areas. Here 
are some of the biggest: 
</P>
<P>
 * Education -- It is surprising, considering how important this area is and 
how much of a problem it is, that so little campaign time has been paid to it. 
California education has become a disgrace in the last 15 years. 
Kindergarten-12, as well as community colleges, the University of California 
and California State University have been cut to the bone. Without good 
education this state has no future. Worse yet, what kind of message are we 
sending our kids? 
</P>
<P>
 * Job retraining -- A popular word has become "McJobs." People will have no 
respect for themselves or society unless they can get quality jobs with decent 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poverty -- One in four children is living below the poverty line. With 
education the way it is, and the job market the way it is, what happens when 
they grow up? 
</P>
<P>
 * Unsupervised children -- Our streets are the way they are partially because 
so many children live in homes with one parent, who works all the time, or two 
parents, who both work all the time. Since our family structure is not likely 
to change, we need to provide day care for our youngest children, and 
recreational and scholastic activities for the older ones, i.e. get them off 
the streets! 
</P>
<P>
 These points are not easy-to-swallow rhetoric but tough problems requiring 
tough solutions. This nation was founded on sacrificing today so we can live a 
better tomorrow. Maybe it's time to go back to that mentality. 
</P>

 * I really had to "smile" at Kathleen Brown's statement, "If a family managed 
its checkbook the way California state government has managed its finances, the 
family would be bankrupt and its home foreclosed." Didn't she realize that she 
would have to sign her name and position of state treasurer? 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the name on the check is the party responsible and in charge.

<P>
 * So, Pete Wilson plans to ride the crime issue to a second term as governor? 
Never mind that crime rates have steadily risen on his watch. Let's see if we 
can understand his argument for reelection: Because crime is getting worse 
(while I've been governor), reelect me because I'm tougher on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every facet of life in Southern California has gotten worse over the 
last four years. It may not have been all Wilson's fault, but he sure didn't do 
anything to make it better. In terms of the economy, education and crime, he's 
had three, four, five, even 10 strikes. Mighty Pete should be out.

OVERPOPULATION AND RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Third World Fodder for First World Greed" (Column Left, Aug. 11), 
Alexander Cockburn puts forth some remarkably flawed conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that the population explosion is not to blame for the devastation of 
the Indonesian forest but that Japanese logging is the cause. Could it be that 
the lumber is being sold by the Japanese to build houses for exploding 
populations elsewhere? The soil depletion and water contamination in 
California's Central Valley is caused by over-farming, surely a result of the 
demand for food by an ever-increasing population. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a direct connection, worldwide, between overpopulation and the misuse 
and depletion of our resources. 
</P>
<P>
 ROGER NICHOLSON 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * Cockburn comes across as just another obstinate leftist ideologue who 
refuses to see or admit the problems posed by Third World overpopulation, not 
the least of which is self-perpetuating poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cockburn is correct to note that wealthier countries' smaller 
populations cause greater damage to some parts of the global environment due to 
greater per capita resource consumption, he perniciously downplays the crisis 
of ever greater numbers of poor people scratching the bleeding earth in ever 
more desperate efforts to survive. Abject poverty as well as apathetic 
affluence damages natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless family sizes and population growth rates are drastically reduced in 
these countries, they will never break out of the vicious circle that both 
destroys their environment and keeps them poor. But at least they will avoid 
Cockburn's sneering disdain for having succeeded economically.

<P>
 * In response to Jim Hoagland's commentary, "Faustian Dealings by the Vatican" 
(Aug. 21): I take exception to his tone, his inference and many of his outright 
statements. I disagree that Pope John Paul II's communication with Muslim 
nations is in error. Muslims, Jews and Christians have a lot more in common 
with God than without. I am not speaking of ecumenism, but of fundamental 
teachings by God. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Catholic Church I applaud the Pope's action, and see this 
step as an essential step to end the imperialism of the United Nations and the 
evil supporters of so-called population control. 
</P>
<P>
 What John Paul II is fighting is not only a "feminist U.N. agenda" but a truly 
sinister one: the forced murder of children. It does not get worse than that, 
Mr. Hoagland; that is why the church is uniting with all like-minded, spiritual 
people who choose to obey God and his holy commandments, not ignore them and 
assault them in the false spirit of secularism, materialism and hedonism.

NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mere suggestion to sell some of the collection from the Natural History 
Museum is astonishing (Aug. 16).Scientists are asked to put a price on 
knowledge and history -- on their research, hard work and lifetime efforts. I 
don't even think it's possible. Someday, when the future scientists are digging 
up Los Angeles, it won't take too long -- all they will uncover is the collapse 
of civilization and how it all ended with greed. So much for history! The 
reason you have museums is to preserve and learn, not destroy and forget. I 
wonder how much the "Mona Lisa" is going for these days?

SEEING BEYOND AN OLD STANDBY; GREATER FOCUS ON NON-DEFENSE BUSINESS IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Banking on the notion that bigger is better in surviving the nation's defense 
downsizing, the second- and third-largest U.S. contractors are combining to 
create a defense colossus, double the size of its nearest competitor. Thus two 
companies that once vied intensely are becoming one in an era of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, added job uncertainty will be created by the proposed merger of 
Lockheed and Martin Marietta and by the likely consolidation among other 
defense companies that will result. But whatever job losses may occur, they 
will come as California appears to have weathered the worst of the defense 
cutbacks that have rocked the industry over the last few years. The challenge 
now is to grow new industry to replace defense jobs, many of which are 
permanently gone. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger goes through, Lockheed Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer Daniel M. Tellep will head the new company, to be known 
as Lockheed Martin and to be headquartered in Bethesda, Md. Lockheed would 
dismantle its Calabasas headquarters, where 250 work. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has 20,000 employees in California, mostly in the Silicon Valley, 
Palmdale and Ontario. Although the consequences of the merger to these 
operations and employees are yet unclear, many economists believe that the 
biggest defense cuts triggered by the end of the Cold War already have 
occurred. The number of Californians in defense and aerospace plummeted from 
363,000 in 1988 to 197,000 today. Further downsizing industrywide is expected 
because of continued cutbacks in federal defense expenditures and industry 
consolidations. California employment in defense and aerospace is forecast to 
drop to 161,000 by 1996 as companies reshape themselves to cope with the new 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these ongoing changes, the state's economy has managed to stabilize 
and begin a slow recovery from its worst downturn since the Great Depression. 
But although the business environment has improved, the many onerous and costly 
state and local regulations are continuing to make California less attractive 
than many other states. There must be changes to make it easier and cheaper do 
business hewe. 
</P>
<P>
 Private efforts to revitalize the state's economy need a second look. Last 
March, Project California, headed by former Lockheed Chairman Roy Anderson and 
Hughes Aircraft Chairman Malcolm Currie, outlined a blueprint for energizing an 
economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 Their report targeted six new technologies -- such as advanced 
telecommunications -- on which a new economy might be built for the state. Only 
through a coordinated and passionate effort by public and private interests can 
such a vision be realized.

NEW WEAPON IN A FALTERING 'WAR'; ORANGE COUNTY WILL FORM INNOVATIVE COURT IN 
THE EFFORT AGAINST DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno was the state attorney for Florida's Dade County in 
1989 when she spearheaded the innovative Miami Drug Court, established to deal 
with drug addicts out of jail rather than behind bars. Thirty such courts have 
sprung up across the nation since then and 100 more are planned -- clearly a 
sign of the lack of success in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week more than 50 judges, health care workers and court officials 
gathered in a Santa Ana courtroom to study the concept. A Portland prosecutor 
with drug court experience in Oregon praised the program as an improvement over 
the old system. Now Orange County has decided -- rightly -- to try a drug 
court, starting perhaps early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such courts have one judge handling all cases. Violent criminals are excluded, 
but in some jurisdictions repeat offenders are eligible, a reflection of the 
difficulty in conquering addiction. Rather than wait for diversion programs to 
begin, defendants go directly to court and start treatment. Judges sometimes 
require weekly appearances and progress reports. The emphasis is on treatment, 
not punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year 3,000 to 5,000 people in Orange County were charged with drug 
possession. In Los Angeles County, which started a drug court this year, at 
least 25% of jail inmates are serving sentences for possessing or selling 
drugs. Those with no histories of violence or other crimes could be dealt with 
outside of jails, at a far lower expense to taxpayers. Such a change would free 
cells in the overcrowded jails for hard-core felons. And if drug court was 
unsuccessful in a case, the criminal still could be sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday a Little Rock judge imposed an absurd 10-year prison term on the son 
of U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, convicted of selling an eighth of an 
ounce of cocaine to a police informant he said entrapped him. It was his first 
offense, but the judge said he had no choice: 10 years was the minimum under 
state law; the maximum was life. 
</P>
<P>
 Excessive prison terms have not worked any better in solving the drug problem 
than attempts at stopping the growing of opium and coca. It is time to try new 
and creative solutions, like drug courts.

AT LONG LAST, FAREWELL; HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE WAR, THE FINAL RUSSIAN TROOPS 
ARE LEAVING EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nazi Germany, which Adolf Hitler swore would last for a millennium, was dust 
and ashes after only a dozen years. The foreign armies whose combined power 
rolled back Hitler's aggression have remained on German soil more than four 
times as long. This week the last legatees of the Red Army that conquered 
Berlin in 1945 are departing. At the same time the last of the Russian troops 
in the Baltic states are finally taking their leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania dates to 1940, when the three 
republics were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. At the time Nazi 
Germany and the Soviet Union were, if not exactly bosom allies, then at least 
eager conspirators in plans to dismember Europe. That lasted until mid-1941, 
when Germany turned on the Soviet Union and set off what became the costliest 
conflict ever waged between two nations. The map of Europe was revised again 
after World War II and redrawn yet again when communist control over Eastern 
Europe collapsed and the Soviet Union imploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people in the countries that were their unwilling hosts are sorry to see 
the last Russian soldiers head home. Under their protection a ruling elite was 
able to commit terrible crimes, just as their masters in the Soviet Union had. 
Memories of that long, repressive and brutal period should never be allowed to 
fade. At the same time the courage, suffering and endurance of those ordinary 
citizens of the Soviet Union -- soldiers and civilians -- who were among the 
chief victims and ultimately in the forefront of the victors over Nazism 
deserve also to be remembered and honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, nearly half a century after Nazism was crushed, is a proud and solid 
democracy and one of the world's strongest economies. Russia, less than three 
years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, struggles to achieve 
stability, create democratic institutions and establish an effective market 
economy. None of this could have been predicted when victorious Soviet troops 
raised their flag over Berlin in 1945. Nor can the political future be 
predicted today, as the departure of the last Russian forces from Europe brings 
an era to a close.

TRIAL WATCH; FAIR, BUT ALSO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the record, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito faces a daunting task in 
trying to ensure that the O. J. Simpson murder trial is fair. So far he seems 
to be doing his job with a firm and even hand.However, a sweeping gag order he 
would impose on the case is ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Lindbergh baby kidnaping in the 1930s, notorious trials have 
received inordinate amounts of news coverage. (It is worth remembering that in 
many of those highly publicized cases the defendants were acquitted.) Clearly, 
coverage of the Simpson case exceeds anything that has come before -- and some 
of the reporting, especially by the tabloid press, has been just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito's proposed solution is to ban anyone connected with the case from 
discussing documents, exhibits or evidence outside of court. He would also have 
attorneys file all legal motions in the case under seal, meaning that their 
contents could not be reported until they had actually been discussed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a sweeping order is far too broad. It would limit the free speech of not 
just attorneys -- who as officers of the court do have special responsibilities 
-- but also far-flung individuals like lab technicians who may have conducted 
scientific research on some piece of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sealing of court documents flies in the face of the Constitution's 
guarantee of not just a fair trial but an open trial. The challenge facing Ito 
is to balance those two requirements. We remain confident he can do so without 
relying on such an overly broad gag order.

DOCTOR SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am shocked at the Medical Board of California's decision not to revoke the 
license of Dr. Leo F. Kenneally when other doctors have lost their licenses for 
less (Aug. 15). Two women are dead because of his gross negligence and at least 
five others were seriously injured.The Medical Board determined that Kenneally 
must be allowed to practice for the sake of the poor and underprivileged women. 
</P>
<P>
 This is another example of "abortion distortion." Decisions relative to 
abortion are calculated to support it. Meanwhile, Kenneally, who has been put 
on probation by the Medical Board twice before, will continue to butcher women 
in the name of "choice."

 * The subhead states, "A women's group says the penalty is too lenient." The 
"women's group" -- Women's Advocate -- is described as "a group that works on 
behalf of women who are victims of medical malpractice." This group is one of 
the biggest, wealthiest, anti-abortion lobbying groups in California. More than 
the two deaths in 10 years at Her Medical Clinics, which -- although tragic -- 
reflect statistics far below the mortality rate of other clinics and for women 
who give birth, it is the efforts of anti-abortionist groups such as Women's 
Advocate that are responsible for Kenneally's suspension.

MURAYAMA ON WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for your Aug. 17 editorial, "The Prime Minister (Murayama) Says No to 
Denial." A few thoughts: Wouldn't there be a huge outcry if Germans wept at 
Hitler's tomb? Why is there no protest over the Japanese, who mourn at Tojo's 
grave, in their annual outpouring of grief at the Yasukuni Shrine? The 
arrogance of Japanese officials denying guilt over World War II is stupefying. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we see a glimmer of regret in Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama calling for 
a resolution of remorse in 1995. We won't hold our breath, though. Remember, 
this resolution died three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 When Japan apologizes for bombing Pearl Harbor, for the Bataan death march, 
when the Japanese admit they were the aggressors, that they were not freeing 
Asians from colonialism, when they sincerely apologize for their barbarism and 
their atrocities, then I might light an August candle for them. In the 
meantime, I'll light mine on Dec. 7.

 * How gratifying it is to be holier than thou. By the example of overcoming 
their own war guilt and denial, Americans can join Prime Minister Murayama's 
efforts to help the Japanese people overcome their war guilt and denial (Aug. 
16). What is needed is a grass-roots initiative calling on the President and 
Congress to admit publicly that the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was 
not necessary to end the war more quickly, nor to prevent large U.S. 
casualties. But the bombings were useful in deterring Soviet military expansion 
following the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 This would greatly enhance the effectiveness of Murayama's statement, "We must 
repent for our own history and tell younger generations about the wretchedness 
of war and numerous sacrifices caused by the war."

THE COMING DARK AGE OF U.S. RESEARCH; SCIENCE: A CENTURY OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH 
IN FUNDING ENDED 25 YEARS AGO. NOW WE FACE A PERMANENT ERA OF CONSTRAINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOODSTEIN, David Goodstein is vice provost at Caltech. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore issued a report recently called "Science in the 
National Interest." It promises to make spending on science and technology "a 
top priority" in future budgets. This is a great time to be a scientist, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. These are not happy days for American science. Newspaper headlines 
scream of fraud in the laboratory. Congress, when it killed the superconducting 
super collider, learned it can slay scientific dragons and is out prowling for 
more, driven by almost $5 trillion in national debt. With the Cold War over, 
the great national laboratories have lost their missions and haven't found new 
ones. Young scientists with Ph.D.'s can't find the kind of work they were 
trained to do. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it looks grim. But deep down, the truth is much worse. In 
spite of the vice president's best intentions, the good times for science will 
never return. 
</P>
<P>
 In science, good times meant times of exponential growth. Each professor would 
churn out about 15 Ph.D. students in a career, each of those wanting to be a 
professor and churn out 15 more Ph.D.'s. That's how exponential growth works: 
The bigger it is, the faster it grows. It couldn't go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended about 25 years ago. The last 20 years of growth -- from 1950-1970 -- 
were truly breathtaking. The prestige of helping to win World War II -- the 
Good War -- got the money flowing from Washington. The GI Bill of Rights sent 
college enrollments zooming. National and industrial laboratories boomed. This 
was the Golden Age of American science. Yet, looking back, we can now see that 
it was merely a smooth continuation of the exponential growth that started just 
after the Civil War.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere around 1970, funds for research suddenly became less plentiful. The 
best American students started to prove their abilities by reading the 
handwriting on the wall, and choosing other lines of work. Almost unnoticed, 
they were replaced by foreign students.  
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Age produced genuine excellence in American science, and it became 
necessary for young scientists all over the world to come to America to study, 
just as young American scientists had once been drawn to Europe, and, it is 
said, young Romans to Greece. Those foreign students, together with the growth 
of postdoctoral holding-tank appointments for young Ph.D.'s allowed us to go on 
pretending that nothing had changed in American research universities -- until 
almost the present. Now we can blame our problems on the end of the Cold War, 
or the national debt, or for that matter, El Nino. But the real reason is that 
nothing can go on growing exponentially forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of American science today are from a generation that came of age 
during the Golden Age. We think of those as normal times and wait wistfully for 
them to return; or, if we are of a more activist turn of mind, we demand that 
the public support us in the style to which we have become accustomed. We stand 
now on the threshold of our new and future condition: the permanent era of 
constraint. 
</P>
<P>
 American science has much to be proud of. We are a beacon unto the nations of 
the world. Our accomplishments are staggering. We may even have a bright future 
ahead of us. But the future will not be -- cannot be -- like the past. Those of 
us who were brought up to believe that winning research grants and turning out 
Ph.D. students were the noblest of all possible virtues will have to think 
again, or be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the real dilemma of American science. It needs to be reorganized from 
the ground up, but we who are its leaders still refuse to believe that we can't 
go on as we have always done before.

AN ANTIDOTE FOR OUR PARALYSIS OF ME-FIRST; COMMUNITY: WHEN WE EACH DEMAND THAT 
OUR INTERESTS BE SERVED, AS IN THE HEALTH-CARE DEBATE, NONE OF US WILL PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK H. BORSCH, The Right Rev. Frederick H. Borsch is bishop of the 
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the American Assn. of Retired Persons recently endorsed health-care 
reform plans that could lead to more universal coverage, it was reported that 
the organization's switchboard lit up with angry phone calls from members. "I 
don't want my insurance to change," said one 69-year-old woman. "Maybe that's 
selfish but, damn it, I feel I have earned the right to be selfish." 
</P>
<P>
 Were we able to hear more of what this woman wanted to say, she might tell us 
how she had worked hard much of her life to earn her government benefits. Maybe 
she had lost her spouse or had experienced a recent illness. She could be 
feeling vulnerable and frightened, perhaps particularly by advertising she had 
seen directed against health-care changes. 
</P>
<P>
 One can hear in her words at least a whisper of an awareness that she had once 
been taught a larger understanding of the responsibilities we can have for one 
another. Whatever her upbringing, in every major religion, and in forms of 
humanism, as well, one finds a version of the golden rule: Seek to do for 
others what you would want for yourself. There is also its corollary: Do not do 
to others and, when possible, do not let happen to others what you wouldn't 
want to happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
 There is renewed talk about the teaching of virtues these days. Traditionally, 
much of what has been understood as central to the virtuous life is a readiness 
to stand in another's shoes, to feel something of their pain and vulnerability, 
and to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Such virtue does not come naturally. Cute as little children may be, they are 
quite self-centered. True maturity is almost universally understood to include 
a capacity to keep one's own needs and wants from being the center of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom, then, is not understood as being able to do whatever one pleases. 
That, in fact, is bondage to a self-centeredness from which one seeks some 
measure of freedom in order to be free to be of service to others and to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an understanding of freedom may seem contrarian in the present climate of 
political discussion and debate in which self-interest appears not only to be 
accepted as the basis for participation but rather roundly affirmed. Indeed, 
one can see heads nodding when the woman says that she has earned the right to 
be selfish. From various parts of the political spectrum there is a spirit of 
libertarianism abroad that exalts economic self-centeredness and the absolutist 
rights of individuals, families or particular groups. Many of our political 
representatives evidently have no qualms whatsoever about making such 
self-interest not only the basis for their votes but the basis of their appeal 
to voters as well. Some of them, at least, some economists and evidently some 
religious folks as well would tell us that this is exactly how politics and the 
economics of our common life ought to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when we speak of the "mean-spiritedness" of much that is happening in our 
times, it is very likely that what bothers us is this societal inability to 
stop being so self-centered. We know that we can be generous and we would like 
to see ourselves as a different kind of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to say this is that we feel there ought to be another bottom line 
below the monetary line. Economics (as the root meaning of the word implies) 
should also be about how we live together, and the bottom line needs to take 
into account larger considerations, including some form of the golden rule. If 
the boomers or the busters or seniors or the X Generation are looking for a 
cause, this is the bottom line that could be there in our debates and in our 
votes about health care, our responsibility for our environment, control of 
violence, discipline about guns, our concern for providing jobs and many other 
issues of common concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may regard such a perspective in politics as naive, but we shall see. 
History has a way of reckoning with societies that lose their sense of a shared 
life -- of community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am not for myself," asks the Jewish proverb, "who will be? But if I am 
only for myself, who am I?" And, we may ask, if we are each only for ourselves, 
who are we?

PERSPECTIVE ON FORMER YUGOSLAVIA; GO NOW, OR BE PUSHED OUT LATER; COMPROMISE IS 
THE ONLY OPTION LEFT; THE SOONER OUTSIDE AID IS GONE, THE SOONER THE COMBATANTS 
WILL ACCEPT THAT. 
</P>

By GEORGE KENNEY, George Kenney, formerly the State Department's desk officer 
for Yugoslavia, resigned in protest of U.S. policy in August, 1992. He is a 
writer in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for the United Nations to call it quits in former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of war, U.N. intervention doesn't add to Western security. 
Continued bumbling rots away an already limited international capability of 
intervention. Nor does the United Nations do much for the former Yugoslavs -- 
it uses just enough force to make all belligerents believe they can't lose but 
never enough to make them stop fighting. U.N. intervention creates a "failed 
war," in which the longer the agency waits to leave, the more it extends the 
conflict and, ironically, the more difficult it will find its inevitable 
pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia has done its worst: Pullout leads to a wider war, but so does 
muddling. On the positive side, Greece and Turkey are less likely today than 
earlier to enter the conflict. With little effort the great powers could keep 
the destruction confined to the region of the former Yugoslavia. Other would-be 
aggressors have learned that aggression pays. Prolonged, incompetent U.N. 
intervention makes a bad example worse. 
</P>
<P>
 And the greatest butchery already has taken place. Indeed, Western inaction in 
the face of near-genocide against Muslims has given radicals ample grounds for 
new anti-Western propaganda. Finally, though, the war of Serb aggression has 
degenerated into a civil war in which military leaders on all sides are thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the United Nations locked in Serbian military superiority with an 
arms embargo. Then U.N. diplomacy helped legitimize Serbian gains. The United 
Nation's "Vance Plan" put Serb occupation forces in Croatia in the stronger 
bargaining position. As the war began in Bosnia, Serb leaders replicated those 
benefits, manipulating the U.N. negotiating process to gain maximum time for 
battlefield success. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the middle of 1993 the United Nations, in effect, changed sides. Its 
defense of Muslim positions bought the Muslim military time to regroup and 
discover new sources of arms. The Muslims began to believe that with a U.N. 
shield they could fight a long-term war of liberation. The United Nations, 
however, strives for neutrality -- recently, for example, it threatened Muslim 
forces on the offensive in central Bosnia. Its actions lead each side, not 
unreasonably, to expect to continue using the U.N. presence to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The West had a choice to end the war on its terms. "Lift and strike" 
originally intended not merely to fight, but fight and win. The best 
interventionist alternative to "war-winning" was Gen. Bill Odom's "war-ending" 
strategy, which required hundreds of thousands of additional Western troops in 
Bosnia. Less costly, a "stalemate" strategy, similar to the proposal from the 
so-called Contact Group (Russia, France, Germany, Britain and the United 
States), requires tens of thousands of troops to police a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO won't, however, launch an air war to save Bosnia. Neither Bill Clinton 
nor Congress would tolerate U.S. troops in Bosnia. If there are no Americans, 
the Europeans won't send more of theirs. "War-winning," "war-ending" and the 
"stalemate" are no longer viable policy options in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular alternative in the United States, lifting the arms embargo, seems 
easy. No casualties, no political fallout. And it seems moral. Embargo lifters, 
however, offer no index for success other than the claim of "doing what's 
right." That philosophy hardly qualifies as a policy, but lifting isn't even a 
choice. Once a trickle, smuggled arms are now a flood. U.N. muddling just slows 
down a de facto lifting of the embargo, except that the United Nations pays in 
lives for its delayed withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 We can expect a war of attrition where no side wins. The sooner the combatants 
realize they can't rely on outside support, the sooner they could accept 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 We should ask ourselves the question European governments must answer: At what 
point does pressure from an arms buildup force the United Nations out? The West 
could either declare defeat and go home early in an orderly fashion or late, 
pushed out in disorder. Before this winter, the United Nations could depart 
relatively smoothly; during a winter of civilian hardship, withdrawal would be 
a huge public embarrassment. Spring puts the United Nations in a heavy 
cross-fire. Withdrawal then risks turning into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 If the West is honest about its limitations, the reasonable remaining policy 
questions have to do with institutions. A salvage priority with an eye to 
serious future institutional reform -- we don't want to repeat this experience, 
but somewhere we will want to intervene again -- argues for pullout sooner than 
later. From the ex-Yugoslav's perspective -- no matter how hard -- Muslims and 
Croats will have to accept that Serb interests, despite repugnant Serb 
behavior, must be considered. And vice versa. Someday, accommodation will take 
place.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JUST PLAIN GOOD IS ENOUGH FOR STEVE WARINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's try to think up a gimmick for Steve Wariner, shall we? 
</P>
<P>
 The country singer doesn't wear a hat, neither does he make a big deal out of 
not wearing a hat. He doesn't show up at his gigs stinking drunk, nor does he 
wear shirts so loud that the audience thinks they're drunk. He hasn't been in 
prison. He doesn't blather on about his pickup truck. He's not an outlaw, or 
neo-new traditionalist. 
</P>
<P>
 What he is is just plain good, and Wariner doesn't seem to get much attention 
for that. He certainly has had hits, including 17 that have reached No. 1 in 
his 16-year chart career, but his name generally is far from the first that 
comes up when people are discussing prominent country artists. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe to get a higher profile he'll need to start wearing a belt buckle the 
size of a mailbox or eat corn on the cob while he sings or something. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, it seemed to be enough for his fans at first of four shows 
Monday and Tuesday at the Crazy Horse Steak House that Wariner has an angelic 
voice, some solid songs and a staggering facility on the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Indiana native first made his mark as a guitarist and bass 
player in the bands of Dottie West, Bob Luman and Chet Atkins. It was guitar 
wizard Atkins, who also is one of the most influential men in Nashville, who 
signed Wariner to a recording contract. But even if Wariner never picked up a 
guitar, he'd be a respectable country act with his singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like fellow double threat singer-guitarist Vince Gill, Wariner has a warm, 
expressive tenor voice, not quite possessed of the keening ache Gill's has, but 
a plaintive tool nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly every song in the generous 21-song early show was a pleasure to 
hear, there were only a couple that brought out the emotional range of 
Wariner's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the show with the title song from his most recent album, 1993's 
"Drive." Though he has a large catalogue of hits, most of the set was drawn 
from his more recent albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his older hits were dispensed with in truncated medley form, including 
"Lonely Women Make Good Lovers," "What I Didn't Do," "Why Goodbye" and "Heart 
Trouble." That approach never does justice to the song or singer; who can work 
up much emotional steam in just one verse of a song? 
</P>
<P>
 That did, however, leave more room for his impressive recent material. The 
ballad "Drivin' and Cryin' " elicited emotional vocals and guitar work from 
Wariner. 
</P>
<P>
 He has an Atkins-derived finger-picking style that may be complex and 
technically baffling -- particularly when he brought the pedal-steel-emulating 
B-bender on his Telecaster into play -- but it never seemed frilly or less than 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With that musicianship and an obvious zeal for playing, Wariner was able to 
elevate standard pop fare like "If I Didn't Love You" from the "Drive" album 
into an exuberant celebration. Wariner also proved a capable, if not especially 
gritty, blues player on Muddy Waters' "I'm Ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable moments in the show were the ballads. His self-penned 1991 
"Like a River to the Sea" was a touching affirmation of his love for his wife, 
though he explained that when he first played it for her she told him to come 
back when "Designing Women" was over. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout song of the evening was Wariner's rendition of Bill Anderson's 
1960 hit "The Tips of My Fingers." It's a mournful ballad about a love that has 
slipped away, and in voicing it, Wariner reached that special time-freezing 
mood that Vince Gill does in his best moments. 
</P>
<P>
 He was backed by a capable six-piece band that featured his brother Terry on 
guitar and harmony vocals. As brothers' voices often do, theirs blended 
beautifully. Terry also was given the lead vocal on Eric Clapton's "Wonderful 
Tonight," a song the band has been doing in concert for the past year.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; STEVIE NICKS, TWIRLING THROUGH THE PAST, FALLS FLAT; THE

<P>
 Can you believe it's been nearly 20 years since Stevie Nicks joined Fleetwood 
Mac and helped turn the fading blues-rock band into a pop powerhouse? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently plenty of people can't -- or won't -- accept that passage of 
time.At the Greek Theatre on Thursday, for the first of two Nicks shows there, 
a full house of fans clung to every word and note she sang as if hers was the 
voice of an oracular priestess. But no one seemed in deeper denial than the 
star herself, who continues to play a role that was charming (if fey) when she 
was a lithe young woman in her 20s but should be rather embarrassing for 
someone approaching middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicks -- who will be at Irvine Meadows tonight -- is still dramatically 
running off stage to change shawls every other song or so (six different 
outfits on Thursday). She's still twirling (albeit more slowly these days) to 
accent the unicorns-and-rainbows-ish imagery she often favors. And still 
relying on songs from the first two albums she made with the Mac as the 
foundation of her show (because, let's face it, her more recent material 
doesn't measure up). 
</P>
<P>
 And when she did the old songs -- "Dreams," "Rhiannon" and "Gold Dust Woman," 
accounting for a quarter of Thursday's set list -- she and her band made them 
virtual carbon copies of the mid-tempo Mac originals, save for Nicks' 
now-limited vocal range. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the highlight of the show was, in fact, a blast from the past but 
a borrowed one: an encore of Tom Petty's "I Need to Know," done with an 
energetic, no-frills approach that finally blew her out of her time warp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stevie Nicks sings tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine 
Center Drive, Irvine. 8 p.m. $26 to $47.50. (714) 855-4515.

TV REVIEW; POORMAN'S 'LOVE CHANNEL' NEEDS TO CENSOR THE SPONSOR-KISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an anecdote from the early days of television: A breathless champion 
of the new medium is explaining its virtues to a lifelong radio enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like radio with pictures!" the TV person says. 
</P>
<P>
 To which the radio person replies: "Pictures of what?" 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference between "The Love Channel," a new TV show hosted (on 
leased time) by former deejay Jim (Poorman) Trenton, and "Loveline," the radio 
call-in advice program that Trenton hosted for more than 10 years on KROQ-FM, 
is that now Trenton can be seen as well as heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is decidedly a mixed blessing. If Dick Clark remains "America's 
teen-ager," Trenton has pretty much of a lock on the dubious distinction of 
being "America's juvenile." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Love Channel" premiered live Monday at midnight on Anaheim's KDOC Channel 
56, where it will continue weeknights until (a) Trenton really does become the 
Poorman paying for the air time and calls it quits, or until (b), saints 
preserve us, the show catches on, in which case KDOC or another commercial 
station might decide to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its radio counterpart that continues on KROQ minus Trenton (who has filed 
a $22.5-million lawsuit claiming ownership of the "Loveline" show), "The Love 
Channel" invites those at home to call in with their love, sex and/or legal 
problems. All three kinds came into play with the first caller: a 17-year-old 
girl from Hollywood who said her boyfriend is pressuring her to have anal sex, 
which has her worried that he might be gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dick Cavett Show" it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Callers patient enough to tolerate Trenton's lowbrow sex jokes can get medical 
advice from "Dr. Danielle" Ardolino, a UCLA Medical School graduate who is 
completing her residency at the UC Irvine Medical Center, or legal tips from 
Dan Hustwit and Carlos Spiga, partners in a Century City law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardolino, the new show's answer to "Loveline's" Dr. Drew Pinsky, has the 
thankless task of playing straight woman to Trenton's signature brand of 
raunchy retorts and one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing her at the outset of the show, Trenton said: "Pretty cute for a 
doctor, huh? I'd like to have an exam." 
</P>
<P>
 Groucho Marx he's not.  
</P>
<P>
 Like her "Loveline" predecessor, Dr. Danielle, as she is referred to on the 
show, constantly voiced her frustration with Trenton's infantile behavior, 
which he has parlayed into a career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late-night talk-show wars, Trenton trumpets himself as the only genuine 
alternative to Leno-Letterman-O'Brien and on that count, he's right. 
Technically, "Beavis and Butt-head" isn't a talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 The live format caught up with Trenton a couple of times Monday night, first 
with a Howard Stern fan who apparently called only to mention Stern's name on 
the air, then with a curmudgeon whose problem was that he'd "never been so 
bored -- I have to hang up." Which he did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From a production standpoint, the show actually looks better than most 
self-produced paid programming, suggesting that Newport Beach resident Trenton, 
who also is executive producer of "The Love Channel," has enough smarts to 
surround himself with a competent crew. 
</P>
<P>
 What they actually capture with their cameras is another story. Leased air 
time means that Trenton pays the station for a block of time, then lines up his 
own sponsors in the hope of recouping his outlay. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every aspect of the show contained a plug for one of his sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Trenton wasn't gushing about how delicious a particular micro-brewery's 
beer is, how well-stocked a certain music store is, or how tasty a certain 
burger joint's food is, taped commercials by the same establishments were 
hammering the points home. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those commercials, coincidentally enough, was for the law firm of 
Hustwit & Spiga. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Newport Beach-based house musicians managed to work in plugs for 
their album, an upcoming gig and their information hot line. The only thing 
they didn't tell viewers was who makes their guitar picks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the program's few genuinely humorous bits came about 40 minutes in, 
when Trenton began earnestly begging the crew to locate even more commercial 
spots that he was afraid hadn't aired yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the advertisers, he interrupted the plugfest as few times as 
possible with actual programming. Consequently, just three callers and one 
in-studio guest, who wore a bag over his head to conceal his identity, asked 
for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong show included several taped features that appeared to be regular 
segments -- each with its own sponsor, natch -- including "Nadia's Hollywood 
Trash Report," which jumped abruptly to -- imagine this -- a commercial just as 
Nadia was voicing her unsubstantiated opinion that the star of several hit 
action films has mob ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who tune in strictly to bask in Trenton's loopy, Beaver 
Cleaver-on-testosterone personality may have a hard time wading through all the 
sponsor-kissing on "The Love Channel," which might more accurately be called 
"The Plug Channel." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the disadvantage of TV became blatantly clear: Now when Poorman 
becomes unbearable, you have to turn the sound and the picture down. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Love Channel" airs Monday through Friday at midnight on KDOC Channel 
56.

 GETTING MAULED: Tuesday was a great day to watch TV for family and friends of 
Anne Mall, a 1991 graduate of Dana Hills High School in Dana Point. The former 
regional tennis champion was front and center on the USA cable network for her 
U.S. Open first-round match in New York (C3). . . . But her opponent might have 
had something to do with the TV time -- she was up against top-seed Steffi 
Graf. Bad back and all, Graf won handily, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL BOOST: One problem facing the U.S. attorney's office in Orange County: 
Not enough prosecutors to handle the growing caseload. But that's changing: 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has authorized the hiring of 18 new federal prosecutors 
in the Los Angeles jurisdiction -- with five of them heading to its Santa Ana 
office. . . . That will bring the total of federal prosecutors here up to 17. 
U.S. Atty. Nora M. Manella in Los Angeles calls the move "long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 BATHROOM NOTE: TV's irreverent comic Paula Poundstone pounds all political 
sides on occasion. In the latest issue of Mother Jones magazine, she reports on 
her visit to the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. She found 
it a kick that the library plays "patriotic marching band music in the ladies' 
room." . . . Later she took in the 28-minute movie on Nixon's career, where the 
late President gives a rousing speech about never giving up. Noted Poundstone: 
"I hadn't felt that uplifted since I was in the ladies' room." 
</P>
<P>
 TOO MUCH TV? TV minister Paul Crouch has been feuding with the Federal 
Communications Commission for years. Now the FCC staff has given him something 
to really get angry about: It wants to levy a $500,000 fine against Crouch's 
Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network -- second highest in FCC history -- 
claiming Crouch bent the rules to buy more TV stations than permitted. . . . 
Trinity's response: It will heatedly contest the recommendation.

VICTIMS OF CON MAN WILL SHARE IN HIS JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Sutera won $9.9 million in the Massachusetts lottery at a time when he 
also was swindling hundreds of people out of their retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the bulk of his legal windfall will go to the victims of his illegal 
scheme.A federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday sold the 20-year annuity contract 
the lottery jackpot was based on so the victims can get some money back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutera, 58, of Waterford, is serving a five-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Mass Millions lottery in October, 1990, but only received a single 
installment of his winnings before victims of his real estate scam forced him 
into bankruptcy. Three subsequent annual installments were collected by the 
bankruptcy trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sale approved by Judge Robert L. Krechevsky, Enhance Reinsurance Co. 
pays $4.17 million for the annuity, from which it will collect $7.9 million in 
the remaining installments. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 800 claims totalling $7.8 million. After taxes, lawyers' fees 
and other administrative expenses are deducted, the victims will recover about 
35 cents on the dollar.

TEXAS POLL SHOWS GOV. RICHARDS, BUSH SON IN CLOSE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. Ann Richards and Republican challenger George W. Bush, a son 
of the former President, are locked in a tight race, the latest Texas Poll 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards has a slight lead, 47% to 43%, in the poll conducted Aug. 18-27, but 
the poll director calls it a dead heat because each candidate's figure is 
subject to a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent are undecided, and less than 1% say they plan to vote for someone 
else, the media-sponsored poll of 757 likely voters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's climb over the past 10 months from 39% support to 43% support could be 
insignificant considering the margin of error. But Candace Windel, the poll 
director, said, "Clearly the gap has narrowed," based on findings that Bush was 
becoming better known and closing in on the last days of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is Nov. 8.

JURY CONVICTS SACRAMENTO TEEN-AGER FOR SEVERAL RACIALLY MOTIVATED FIREBOMBINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Sacramento man described by his attorney as a racist has been 
convicted on five of 12 felony charges involving a series of racially motivated 
firebombings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Campos showed no emotion when the jury returned its verdict Monday 
after four days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The conviction on five counts carries a maximum of 14 years in prison, 
authorities said. Superior Court Judge James Ford declared a mistrial on the 
remaining seven counts and dismissed the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did not say whether they would seek a retrial on the remaining 
charges, which include one count of attempted murder against Sacramento City 
Councilman Jimmie Yee. Campos was convicted of firebombing the Asian American 
councilman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked on arson and related charges involving bombings of the 
Temple B'Nai Israel and the offices of the Sacramento National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People and the Japanese American Citizens League. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos was found guilty on two counts involving the firebombing of a state 
Department of Fair Employment and Housing office and on two counts of 
possession of destructive devices. Sentencing is Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called 50 witnesses in the case, but Campos' attorney, Michael 
Brady, rested without calling any witnesses. He contended that prosecutors did 
not prove their case and that "even racists are entitled to justice."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CENTENNIAL FARM DOCENTS NEEDED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Docents are needed to conduct educational tours of the Centennial Farm at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 This miniature working farm is designed to give local schoolchildren hands-on 
experiences tending crops and caring for farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Training sessions will be held for new docents, who do not need a background 
in agriculture. Volunteers will lead the tours from 9 to 11 a.m. Tuesdays 
through Fridays from Oct. 4 to May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, more than 125,000 schoolchildren have visited the one-acre farm, 
which is planted with beans, beets, corn, watermelon and other crops. Farm 
animals include horses, sheep, pigs, goats and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Persons interested in being docents may call Ginny Smith at (714) 708-1517. 
School field trips can be arranged by calling JoAnn Robinson at (714) 
708-1566.ALAN EYERLY

<P>
 There will also be a '50s costume contest and two bands performing music from 
the same era: "Captain Cardiac and the Coronaries" and "Li'l Elmo and the

 People who want to help Orange County children lead better lives are invited 
to a countywide meeting on youth welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the second Summit for Children will bring together people from 
universities, health care agencies and other groups in late September in Costa 
Mesa.Neighborhood, businesses and government leaders will suggest goals for 
improving living conditions for youths.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has experienced a 42% increase in child poverty in the past 10 
years, organizers said. They also noted that less than half of the county's 
2-year-old children have been immunized against disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing community members together for a summit could help find solutions for 
children's hardships, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors include the United Way of Orange County, Children's Hospital of 
Orange County and several county government agencies. The program will be held 
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 24, at the Robert B. Moore Theatre at Orange Coast 
College.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; ONE MAN'S BATTLE AGAINST CALIFORNIA'S POLITICS OF 
WATER; THE RIVER STOPS HERE: HOW ONE MAN'S BATTLE TO SAVE HIS VALLEY CHANGED 
THE FATE OF CALIFORNIA BY TED SIMON ; RANDOM HOUSE $23, 400 PAGES 
</P>

 The story of why the Dos Rios Dam was never built is one of the 
less-celebrated incidents in the vast saga of California water politics, but -- 
to hear Ted Simon tell it in "The River Stops Here" -- it's a tale of epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon styles the campaign to save the Eel River from the dam-builders of the 
State Water Project as nothing less than an insurrection by a tiny band of 
guerrillas against an imperial power. And the unlikely hero of the war on the 
Dos Rios Dam is a man named Richard Wilson, a wealthy rancher, a registered 
Republican, and the son of a socially prominent Los Angeles physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Richard, and any other allies he might bring to the cause, were to fight 
this war," Simon writes, "they might as well think of themselves as the victims 
of a land grab by a colonial power, with Los Angeles at the heart of the 
empire." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon rounds up the usual gang of suspects in describing the manifest destiny 
of California water policy -- the Army Corps of Engineers, the Metropolitan 
Water District, agribusiness interests, land developers and land speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains how a series of disastrous floods in Northern California in the 
'50s and early '60s helped to create a constituency for the State Water Project 
-- but he points out that flood control was only one of the reasons for damming 
the wild rivers and sending their water somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the '64 flood more water poured out of the Eel River in eight days 
than it took to irrigate the entire cotton crop of California for a year," 
Simon writes. "Liberated by this new sense of urgency, the engineers emerged 
from the closet as knights errant, flying the banner of flood control, and once 
again the area was beset by dam fever." 
</P>
<P>
 The little hamlet of Dos Rios and nearby Round Valley in Mendocino County had 
long been considered as a site for a dam and a reservoir on the Eel River, but 
not until 1967 did the Dos Rios Dam project loom as a real threat. The dam 
would be 700 feet high, the reservoir would be 300 feet deep, and Wilson's land 
would be at the bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, had an ulterior motive when it came to the Dos Rios Dam. 
Not only were the thirsty suburbs of Southern California and the farm districts 
of the San Joaquin Valley interested in the Eel, so were more northerly 
counties that wanted the water for agriculture, tourism and subdevelopment.  
</P>
<P>
 Even within Round Valley, the locals were motivated by their own self-interest 
-- one embittered householder, for example, favored the dam because her home in 
Round Valley was next to a lumber mill and she would have been happy to take 
the money and run. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Simon tells it, Richard Wilson was unsullied by such mean motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Envisioning the valley ravaged by bulldozers, an infernal scene adrift with 
fire, smoke and ash, it was not even so much the loss of the houses and barns 
but the fate of the trees that haunted him," Simon writes. "He simply could not 
bear the thought of those trees going down. It went beyond self-interest, 
beyond property and ambition, to more elemental and selfless emotions. It was 
as far as sacrilege." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wilson went to war against the Dos Rios Dam, and he literally invented 
himself as a one-man-band of environmental activism. He signed up a press 
agent; he lobbied the local board of supervisors and the state legislature; he 
courted the Native American leadership of a nearby reservation, and, in the 
end, his efforts were instrumental in the passage of California's Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped them from taking all our rivers," Wilson declares. "What more do 
you want?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then, as he describes Wilson's war on the Dos Rios project, Simon 
pauses to invoke the Wilson family history and reprise some of the 
now-legendary moments in California water politics. 
</P>
<P>
 As he follows Wilson through the political labyrinth of the campaign against 
the Dos Rios Dam, Simon almost inadvertently raises the very hardest questions 
of environmental politics in his story of the skirmish over a single dam. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the proper balance between economic development and environmental 
preservation? How do we weigh the value of preserving the natural beauty of a 
backwater community against the value of slaking the thirst of the nation's 
most populous state? Is it ever OK to dam a wild river and flood a valley? And, 
if so, whose river and whose valley? 
</P>
<P>
 As a "journalist and farmer" -- and a self-described "true friend" of Wilson 
-- Simon seems to take it for granted that we have enough dams in California, 
and anyone who prevents the building of another one is a hero. He may be right, 
especially in the case of the Eel, but the larger questions go unanswered in 
"The River Stops Here."

 CLOSING HOUSE: Buffeted by losses, Sherman Oaks-based House of Fabrics has 
targeted more than 200 of its cloth and sewing supply shops for closure by 
year's end. The figure is double the number previously announced and includes 
all mall outlets (D1). . . . Started in 1946 by brothers David and Charles 
Sofro, the company began a rapid expansion after going public in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 BURBANK BOUND: Now for some good business news. . . . It might seem like 
companies are only moving out of the Valley these days, but a Utah-based firm 
announced Tuesday that it's coming here. Battery Automated Transportation, 
which converts cars to electric power, said it is relocating to the Burbank 
facility of Calstart -- a nonprofit group of companies developing new 
transportation technology. . . . The company will hire 15 to 20 people, 
Calstart said. 
</P>
<P>
 ALIAS BILL: Democrats protesting a speech by state Sen. Don Rogers (above) to 
a group accused of racism found an unusual weapon against him -- pushing his 
name off an unrelated Antelope Valley flood control bill he authored and giving 
it someone else's name (B1). . . . Speaker Willie Brown said the bill was 
doomed as long as it was credited to Rogers, another lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 MEMORIES: It's been a busy week for the Northridge Little Leaguers -- limo 
rides, parades and a meeting with the mayor (B3). Their triumphs have also 
released warm memories for members of the 1967 and '75 Northridge teams who 
made it to the World Series (C8). . . . "The greatest thrill I ever had was 
playing in Williamsport," recalled Craig Stevenson, 31, a pitcher for the '75 
team.

 FAN CLUB: Timon, the fast-talking meerkat of Disney's "The Lion King," has 
been a hit with moviegoers. But according to the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith 
Park, crowds haven't exactly materialized to see a live one. Still, they do 
have their fans. . . . "They're fabulous to watch," zoo spokeswoman Deborah 
Pollack said. David E. Brady

VENTURA COUNCIL REJECTS LAND SWAP; DEVELOPMENT: BUILDER IS THWARTED IN PLAN TO 
TRADE PARCELS WITH THE CITY AND THEN BUILD 437 HOMES ON WHAT IS NOW A 
CITY-OWNED LEMON GROVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After an eastside Ventura park swap proposal was defeated in an acrimonious 
City Council meeting, some developers and greenbelt preservationists said 
Tuesday that they see new opportunities amid the project's ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole city should be pleased with the vote," said builder Jaime Santana, 
who for weeks had tried to get the council to open up the regional park deal to 
all developers. 
</P>
<P>
 And greenbelt activist Sheri Vincent said that the council rejection of 
developer Ron Hertel's plan to swap parcels with the city -- and then build 437 
homes on what is now a city-owned lemon grove -- is at least a temporary 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stoked," said Vincent, a homeowner who is leading a drive to halt 
construction on Ventura farmland without voters' permission. "Last night really 
helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 During a five-hour hearing Monday evening, council members also rejected a 
controversial proposal by the Neel family to build 120 homes on 22 acres in the 
old Ventura Avenue oil-field area, because neighboring business owners said the 
project does not fit with heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The council did, however, approve Ventura's first new housing projects in four 
years, allocated 413 housing units to four developers in mid- and eastern 
Ventura. Allocations had been stalled first by a drought-induced moratorium and 
then by council indecision last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members -- in distributing 40% of the 1,018 units to be allocated over 
the next five years -- approved: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 227-house project by Beazer Homes on 42 acres at Telegraph and Kimball 
roads; 
</P>
<P>
 * A 105-home community planned by Wittenberg-Livingston for 19 acres east of 
Saticoy and north of North Bank Drive; 
</P>
<P>
 * A 60-unit apartment house and small shopping center by Ventura resident Bill 
Martin at Darling Road and Saticoy Avenue; 
</P>
<P>
 * A 21-unit addition to a 180-home Weston Co. project at Telephone Road and 
Clay Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While those four projects survived, Hertel said he may abandon his years-long 
effort to gain council support for his new upscale community near Telegraph 
Road at Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel said he has not decided whether to drop his project or compete with 
other developers in an open-bidding process now planned by the City Council. 
The council reserved 400 housing units to award to the developer who comes up 
with the best eastside park deal for its 87 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're just going to sit and listen for awhile," a resigned Hertel 
said Tuesday. The Hertel proposal died when a motion of support by Councilman 
Jack Tingstrom failed to get a second Monday evening. Councilman Jim Monahan 
had supported Hertel in the past, but said later that he did not want to go on 
record in support of the measure because it had apparently failed. The two 
other council members who participated in the debate -- Steve Bennett and Mayor 
Tom Buford -- opposed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Rosa Lee Measures, Gregory L. Carson and Gary Tuttle abstained 
because they own property nearby and had a legal conflict of interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said Tuesday that he is worried that Hertel -- who had also offered 
$2 million to help the city build its regional park -- might now turn his back 
on the land swap and look for new deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we went a long way toward closing a door on a park," Tingstrom said. 
He said that other developers, unlike Hertel, do not have a large, flat parcel 
to offer the city as a park. "That was the key to the whole deal."  
</P>
<P>
 In a second major debate, the council rebuffed the Neel family's Ventura 
Avenue project that had once enjoyed enthusiastic support from the council. The 
project still has the backing of Kinko's, one of the city's largest employers, 
whose national headquarters is next door. 
</P>
<P>
 But opposition from small-business owners whose lands line the edges of the 
Kinko's and Neel properties persuaded council members to delay granting 
allocations until the new homes' compatibility with nearby industry can be 
fully discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner Bill Neel said he is baffled by the council action, but will 
continue to pursue his project.

SUPERVISORS JOIN THE DEFENSE OF LOCAL BASES; MILITARY: BOARD DONATES $10,000 
AND OFFICE SPACE TO THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP TWO NAVY INSTALLATIONS OFF THE FEDERAL 
CLOSURE LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The campaign to keep Ventura County's military installations off the next base 
closure list received a $10,000 boost and free office space Tuesday from the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the Pentagon could target Point Mugu and Port Hueneme Navy 
bases -- along with the 20,000 jobs and the $1.5 billion they pump into the 
county economy -- supervisors agreed to help a local task force raise $350,000 
to mount a defensive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We not only need to be working together as a community, but we need to make 
sure that the people in Washington know how important these bases are to the 
economy in this county," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials agreed to administer a contract that the task force is 
drawing up with Washington consultants, who will monitor the base closing 
process and analyze data. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lobbying firm that the Ventura group is considering -- Thicksten, 
Grimm & Burgum -- has received mixed reviews from past clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like them," said Mayor Gloria Webb from Portsmouth, Va., who worked 
with the firm to spare the Norfolk Naval Shipyard last year. "I'll give them 
the fair shake; they came in at the tail end. But the people they sent down 
here were real young." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went to give testimony, it just fell apart because we were not 
prepared," she added. The first speaker barely made it through an elaborate 
slide show before time ran out before the President's Base Closure and 
Realignment Commission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shipyard, added to the base closure list halfway through the process, was 
eventually spared from closing. And Thicksten, Grimm & Burgum applied this year 
to represent the entire Norfolk region in the next round of base closings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were problems" with the firm, said Arthur Collins, who screened the 
consultants as head of Hampton Roads Planning District Commission. "We're 
working with another group this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the lobbying firm could not be reached for comment. But Cal 
Carrera, who heads the local task force, said the firm has received positive 
references from other clients, including the cities of Long Beach and Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added that the contract is under discussion and could be adjusted to 
address any concerns. "The BRAC task force consists of people who do contracts 
for a living," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the 1995 list is still six months away, but communities across 
the country are mustering funds, analysts and lobbyists to spare their local 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three rounds of base closures, military base supporters and nearby 
civic leaders found it was too late to start lobbying when the local military 
installation appeared on the Pentagon's list of recommended closures. This 
year, they're hoping to shape or control the data that the Pentagon uses to 
prepare the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Every base across the country has received Pentagon requests for information 
detailing the base's military significance and its efforts to be 
cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Committees of military officers feed the information into computer formulas 
and use it to rank bases on various factors. These rankings help determine 
which bases end up on the Pentagon's recommended hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 The list then goes to the commission appointed by the President for a final 
decision. President Clinton and Congress must accept or reject the entire list. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera said the first task is to determine how Ventura County's bases stack 
up against other similar facilities in the Pentagon's analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get data, but it's behind closed doors," Carrera said. "We have to 
go in there and subversively get it. It's going to take a lot of time, money 
and human resources for this defense." 
</P>
<P>
 With the donation from the county, the Ventura task force has now raised about 
$30,000 toward its fund-raising goal, he said. The group of engineers and 
economists hopes to raise $190,000 from city governments and $150,000 from 
private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag is low, he said, for what could be the "largest economic threat 
to the county in years." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn pointed out that the $1.5 billion the military bases 
pump into the county's economy each year far exceeds the $900 million from 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of the bases were to close, Carrera said the job loss would extend 
beyond the military and civilian jobs on base. It would also affect local 
defense contractors and other spinoff businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really cannot sustain such a job loss," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. 
"We've had floods, we've had earthquakes. Our economy is still reeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the lobbying effort and fund-raising campaigns, the local task force 
cannot guarantee its efforts will keep the two Navy bases off the list, which 
will be released March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey recalled watching communities plead for their bases at 
last year's hearings, which were televised on C-SPAN. She saw the commission 
soften to the pleas, but then close the bases anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real thing I learned is: Don't get on the list!" she said. "On March 2, 
we want to be talking about tulips or something other than base closings."

LOCKHEED MERGER DEALS YET ANOTHER BLOW TO COUNTY; DEFENSE: ABOUT ONE-FOURTH OF 
250 JOBS AT CALABASAS HEADQUARTERS ARE HELD BY EMPLOYEES WHO LIVE HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 60 Ventura County residents could lose their jobs as a result of the 
planned merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta, the latest in a string of 
layoffs that have crippled the area's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed spokesman Pete Haney said Tuesday that closure of the company's 
Calabasas headquarters puts the 250 jobs there in jeopardy. About one-fourth of 
those jobs are held by employees who live in Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the threatened positions are high-paying jobs held by Lockheed 
managers and executives, as well as secretaries and other support staff, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger must get anti-trust clearance before any action is taken, Haney 
said. But that could happen as early as December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be status quo until then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed announced Monday that it intended to merge with Marietta Martin, 
creating new aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to be based near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to be close to our principal customers -- the Pentagon, NASA and 
the Department of Energy," Haney said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to employees Tuesday, Lockheed Chairman Daniel E. Tellep said 
executives are in the process of determining what positions will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The merged firm will maintain a "residual corporate office" in the Los Angeles 
area, but not in its current Calabasas building, Tellep said. The decision to 
lay off people will be done in a "fair and equitable" manner, Tellep's memo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his reassuring tone, nerves were frayed Tuesday among some Lockheed 
employees concerned about losing their jobs, said Keith Mordoff, an Oak Park 
resident who works in the company's public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see people in the halls and trying to work it out," he said. "At the same 
time, they're trying to do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Mordoff, who moved to Oak Park from San Mateo less than two years ago, is 
among those who do not know if they will be employed after Christmas. But 
Mordoff said he is trying to stay upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have skills that I can market if Lockheed Martin decides they don't need 
me," Mordoff said. "But on the flip side, you do have anxieties about losing 
your job and having to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's proposed pullout from California is only the latest setback for 
Ventura County residents working in the aerospace industry. The nation's 
shrinking defense budget has triggered the loss of at least 3,000 county jobs 
over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon Co. closed its Oxnard plant manufacturing missile-tracking equipment 
in May, 1990, laying off 400 people. Later that year, Northrop Corp. closed its 
Newbury Park plant, cutting 1,800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1992, Abex Aerospace shut down its Oxnard manufacturing plant, which 
employed 880 people at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of 60 more jobs may not sound like much, but taken with the other 
layoffs it is significant, said Carolyn Leavens, president of the Ventura 
County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the human body," she said. "You can prick an artery or bruise a 
limb. But when you start hemorrhaging, you've really got trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Other community leaders were also distressed about the prospective job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, that's all we need to hear," said Madeleine Brockwell, who 
coordinates a job club for white-collar workers -- many displaced by defense 
cutbacks -- at Simi Valley's Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The job club already has 125 members actively scouring help-wanted ads and 
telephoning friends for job tips, Brockwell said. Many of those who left the 
club took temporary jobs or contract work after trying for months to find a new 
permanent position, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the job club is always ready to take new members. Participants 
attend a weekly meeting to share job leads and exchange interviewing tips, she 
said. Computers and fax machines are also available to help job hunters update 
their resumes and submit them to companies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's Mordoff said he and his wife prefer to stay in Ventura County and 
begin a family. But he knows that may not be possible with the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, you like to put your roots down and Oak Park is a great place 
to live," he said. "But if I get lucky and get an offer to move with Lockheed 
to Bethesda, Md., then I would do that."

BOARD OKS NEW LEVIES ON BUILDERS; GROWTH: SUPERVISORS VOTE TO COLLECT TRAFFIC 
IMPACT FEES ON ALL DEVELOPMENT IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Millions of dollars in traffic impact fees will be levied on new construction 
projects in Ventura County to help keep freeways and county roads working, the 
Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from developers during a two-hour public hearing, the board 
voted 3 to 2 to begin collecting the fees on all development in the 
unincorporated county area. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders said they hope the policy will pave the way for a plan to 
collect fees on every project built not only in the unincorporated area, but 
also in each of the county's 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessments could raise nearly $100 million to pay for 30 projects over 
the next 16 years, including improvements to county roads, state highways and 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is there isn't any new funding for transportation," Deputy 
Public Works Director Butch Britt told the board. "These fees are a reasonable 
way to pay for road projects in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, which range from $1,351 for a single-family house to $20,486 for 
a fast-food restaurant, are less than half the amount initially recommended by 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The board agreed to lower the fees after developers complained during the 
hearing that the charges would drive builders away from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen speakers -- mostly developers and residents of the 
unincorporated county area -- addressed the board. City officials and 
environmentalists, who have criticized the fees, were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Philip R. Bronner told the board that charging high fees would 
hinder his plans to build a strip mall on property he owns on the Oxnard plain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our development gets hit with (fees at the originally proposed level) we 
may have difficulty getting financing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision is the first step in lifting a six-year ban on any 
construction in the unincorporated county area that would increase traffic in 
areas that suffer from traffic jams and deteriorating roads. 
</P>
<P>
 West county residents Gilbert and Kathy Richardson said they would gladly pay 
the fee if it means they will be allowed to divide the beachfront property 
where they live and build a second house. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson told the board he spent $19,000 on permits and planning before 
discovering that he and his wife were barred from building on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to build hundreds of homes, just one for our family," 
Richardson said. "We feel we have been more than patient with the system, and 
we would like to get on with our plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who voted in favor of the fee, said she sympathized 
with the Richardsons' plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are not able to move forward with their plans," Kildee said. "It 
seems right and fair to me that we work out this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Vicky Howard and Susan Lacey also voted in favor of the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors John K. Flynn and Maria VanderKolk voted against the fee. Flynn 
said he opposed the charge because he believes the funding already exists in 
government coffers to pay for transportation projects, but is being spent on 
excessive administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a philosophical problem with fees," Flynn said. "I think I'm looking 
at a deep problem about how this county and this state and this county are 
governed."

FLORICULTURE STUDENTS BLOSSOM; EDUCATION: AGRICULTURE TEACHER GIVES BUDDING 
FLORISTS CHANCE TO BE CREATIVE AND SOMETIMES TO MAKE A LITTLE MONEY WHEN THEIR 
WORK IS SOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After wedging a white chrysanthemum into the middle of her large bouquet of 
purple, burgundy and white blossoms, Kristy Lepore stepped back to admire her 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly admire it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm, like, ruining this," the 16-year-old wailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing this, Kristy's classmate, Stacie Koch, smiled. "She's way too 
critical," the 17-year-old Stacie said as she assembled a bouquet at a nearby 
table. "You can't be critical of yourself when you're doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Building students' confidence is one goal of the floriculture class at 
Camarillo High School where Kristy and Stacie are students, agriculture teacher 
Bruce Ritchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all students, the budding florists in Ritchey's courses are able to get 
positive strokes by earning good grades or winning their teacher's praise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students in Camarillo High floriculture classes also have their work 
affirmed in a manner typically reserved for professionals: They see their 
flower arrangements sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes they even get paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the school year and into the summer, students in Ritchey's advanced 
floriculture classes arrange flowers for real-life events. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful hand-held bouquets for weddings, leafy table settings for school 
banquets and festive floor arrangements for companies' Christmas parties -- the 
array of floral decorations produced by Ritchey's students rivals the work of 
many professional florists. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students do it for far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchey estimates that floral arrangements created by his classes sell for 
one-half to two-thirds of what professionals charge. He is careful to point 
out, however, that his program does not compete with local flower shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchey sells his students' floral decorations not to make a profit but to 
give the students experience that may help them get work with a florist, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way they can say, 'Well, I've done these,' " Ritchey said. "They can 
have a working knowledge of how floristry works." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the money earned through the sales goes toward supporting the 
program, including buying flowers from local growers. 
</P>
<P>
 A small percentage goes to students who come in to work during the summer. 
Some students also market items on their own, such as selling Christmas wreaths 
to teachers or prom corsages to classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The money helps boost the students' confidence, Ritchey said. "You shouldn't 
give away all your talents." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ritchey does not advertise, most of the floriculture program's orders 
come from Camarillo High teachers, graduates and others familiar with the 
students' work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the youths in Ritchey's classes are, after all, students -- not 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the floriculture students' creations are popular enough to draw many 
repeat customers, some of their work has been less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 At one wedding last spring, a bridal bouquet the students had made fell apart 
as the bride walked down the aisle, students said. The flowers fell out of the 
small plastic-foam base where they had been fastened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't stick the flowers in far enough," Stacie said. "We were pretty 
bummed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchey's students arrange flowers for five to 10 weddings per year, most 
during the school year. But sometimes Ritchey accepts jobs during the summer 
because he knows he can count on some students to come to school even during 
their vacations to work with the colorful blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 One day last week, Stacie, Kristy and three other students spent an afternoon 
preparing bridal bouquets, table settings and floor arrangements for two 
weekend weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchey paid each of the students $30 for about five hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 But some students said they came less for the money than for the fun of seeing 
classmates and working with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Perez said she took a day off from her summer job in an Oxnard 
carpet store to help prepare for the weddings. "For me, it's just fun," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacie, a senior who has been taking floriculture since she was a freshman, 
got a job arranging flowers with a local florist this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she came in to work at the school last week partly because she 
loves to prepare flowers for weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a part of someone's life that is going to be there forever in 
pictures," she said. "Flowers really make everyone happy. That's why I like 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Dalto, who will be a junior this year, said she enjoys taking advanced 
floriculture because the class, which is always scheduled just before lunch, 
provides a break from a grueling schedule of academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of relaxing in the middle of the day," Nicole said. "You get to 
come here and not have tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kristy, who said she finds floristry frustrating because she is a 
perfectionist, said the effort at making bouquets is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love flowers," she said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; SPENDING TO IMPROVE HIGH SCHOOL OKD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park High School students will have a new cafeteria and multipurpose room 
in the next two years as a result of the Oak Park Unified School District's 
decision to spend $3.5 million on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will also fund improvements to the school's gymnasium and athletic 
stadium, which have no permanent bleachers or restrooms, district officials 
said.That portion of the work should be completed by September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects are the second phase of a two-part, $5.1-million plan to improve 
facilities at Oak Park High School. In June, the board approved construction of 
a new classroom building, new tennis court and a science lab renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Stanley Mantooth said the improvements are needed because Oak 
Park High is expected to grow beyond its current capacity over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect that by the year 2003, we would have about 1,160 students," he 
said. "We want to provide for that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 690 students are now enrolled at Oak Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating growth in the community and subsequently the schools, Oak Park 
voters have passed six bond issues to pay for school construction and 
improvements. Those bonds will also pay for the high school additions and 
renovations, district officials said. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Ventura County's top law enforcement officers have endorsed Simi Valley 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Sheriff Larry Carpenter and representatives 
of the Deputy Sheriff's Assn. formally announced their endorsements of Mikels' 
candidacy at a news conference Tuesday at the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels is running against Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery for the 
seat being vacated by Supervisor Vicky Howard. The 4th District supervisorial 
seat represents Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judy Mikels has substantial experience in government and business, is well 
known for her strong support of law enforcement and, most importantly, is a 
person of integrity," Bradbury said of his decision to back Mikels. "When she 
makes a commitment to the people of this county, we can rest assured she will 
keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels welcomed the support, which she said will provide a big boost to her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't give their endorsement lightly," Mikels said, "and I don't take it 
lightly." CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PAIR JAILED ON DRUG CHARGES FOLLOWING 
RAID

<P>
 Narcotics detectives arrested a Thousand Oaks couple on felony drug charges 
Tuesday and dismantled what they said was one of the largest home marijuana 
farms discovered in the city this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested Rudolf Bohlmeyer, 34, and his 
wife, Carol Bohlmeyer, 42, after a raid at the couple's house in the 100 block 
of Galsworthy Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives obtained a search warrant after neighbors complained that drug 
deals were made at the house, said Sgt. Gary Pentis, head of the sheriff's east 
county narcotics squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bohlmeyers were raising marijuana seedlings in hydroponic setups in two 
bedrooms, then moving the plants out to a makeshift greenhouse in the back yard 
to mature, he said. With only half the crop fully grown, the plants still could 
have brought $50,000 on the street, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows what he's doing," Pentis said, picking through the thicket of 
marijuana beneath the plastic-sheet roof of the greenhouse. "This was going to 
be good smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the plants and about $1,500 worth of growing equipment, 
authorities seized two loaded handguns and ammunition, which Rudolf Bohlmeyer 
was forbidden to own because he has a burglary conviction on his record, Pentis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentis said the Bohlmeyers were to be charged with one count each of 
possessing marijuana for sale and cultivation of marijuana, Pentis said. Rudolf 
Bohlmeyer would also probably face a charge of being a felon in possession of a 
handgun, he said. MACK REED

<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved AIDS education 
contracts for two agencies, focusing on Latinas of childbearing age and young 
gay men. 
</P>
<P>
 El Concilio Del Condado De Ventura, a local Latino organization, was granted 
$31,900 to provide AIDS education services to the Latino community, focusing on 
young women.Robert Collins, an AIDS educator at the Gay and Lesbian Community 
Center, was awarded $41,000 to provide AIDS prevention services to gay and 
bisexual men, primarily those who are young. 
</P>
<P>
 Both contracts are part of a master funding plan for state-supported AIDS 
education, testing and case management approved by the board last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan combines four separate programs under one $423,000 grant from the 
state Department of Health Services. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RESIDENTS' COMMENTS URGED ON FARM ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the U. S. Department of Agriculture are urging Ventura County 
residents to submit written comments on agricultural issues that will be 
addressed when Congress begins debate on the 1995 farm bill early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly vital to county growers are the federal conservation programs 
that prevent erosion and low-interest loans to beekeepers that ultimately 
benefit citrus growers, said Frank Van Brocklin, county executive director for 
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The period for comments ends Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The current 1990 farm bill, which is soon to expire, allows for federal 
subsidies to farmers for erosion-prevention measures, such as pipelines in 
irrigation ditches, that help keep drinking water supplies free of soil 
sediments and chemicals, Van Brocklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For beekeepers, the bill provides low-interest loans that enable them to hold 
onto their honey until they can receive higher prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeepers' welfare is important to Ventura County citrus growers because bees 
help pollinate their crops, Van Brocklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doubly important for California growers (to give input) because the 
legislation usually reflects a Midwest slant," Van Brocklin said, referring to 
the political clout of the farm states in the nation's breadbasket. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the public to submit written comments to the Ventura County ASCS 
Committee at 254 E. Highway 246, Suite D, Buellton, CA 93427. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, respondents could address whether they think that current 
programs should continue, be revised or be curtailed, particularly in light of 
the possibility of budget cuts, Van Brocklin said. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COOUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; JUDGE REFUSES TO SCRAP 'VIEW TAX' 
SUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A petition to throw out a lawsuit challenging Port Hueneme's so-called view 
tax has been rejected by a Ventura County Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling allows the lawsuit over annual assessments by the city's Beach 
Maintenance Assessment District to proceed to trial on Oct. 17, said an 
attorney for a coalition of homeowners associations that brought the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the motion had prevailed today, we would not have been able to carry out 
our suit," said Dorothy Blake, chairwoman of the coalition. "So we've won one 
round." 
</P>
<P>
 The residents filed suit against the city of Port Hueneme in 1991, alleging 
the assessments on 1,252 parcels near the beach are unfair and that residents 
citywide should share the cost to maintain the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessments, which range from $79 to $206 per year, will continue while 
the city and homeowners battle in court. Assessments are based on the 
condominiums' size and proximity to the beach, City Manager Richard Velthoen 
said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COOUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOLS TO EXPAND MORALS CURRICULUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding that their first-year experiment with teaching moral values was a 
success, Ventura school officials have expanded the program to all schools in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make the new curriculum more effective, the district has settled upon a 
districtwide lesson plan to teach the same character trait in every school each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in September, all schools in the Ventura Unified School District 
will teach students about the value of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the district's schools began last year to incorporate lessons on moral 
values into their classroom instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the schools were on different schedules. While one school was 
teaching about the importance of good sportsmanship, another was focusing on 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope that setting a uniform lesson plan will encourage 
parents and community groups to work with the district in teaching moral 
values, Assistant Supt. Pat Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who have students at different schools will find it easier to focus on 
discussing moral values with their children if each school teaches the same 
values at the same time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has also asked a local ministers' group to integrate the 
moral-values curriculum into their lessons, through sermons or religious 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that kind of focus will have more of an impact than doing whatever 
strikes our fancy every month," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson plan is as follows: September, responsibility; October, courtesy; 
November, cooperation; December, kindness; January, honesty; February, respect; 
March, sportsmanship; April, punctuality; May, self-control. 
</P>
<P>
 The five schools on a year-round calendar will focus on punctuality during 
August instead of April, when those schools are on vacation. MAIA DAVIS

 A masked gunman who raped a clerk and sexually assaulted another after a 
holdup at a Camarillo yogurt shop remained at large Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, ages 19 and 17 and both of Camarillo, were ordered into the 
restroom and assaulted Monday night at the yogurt shop, said Detective Cheryl 
Basset of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack started about 10:15, when one of the clerks propped the front door 
open while mopping the floor after closing, Basset said. When the man first 
entered, neither of the clerks was concerned, the detective said, because each 
incorrectly assumed the other knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 He then put on a mask. 
</P>
<P>
 After displaying a handgun, he collected about $100 from the cash register and 
ordered the clerks into the back of the store, where he assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were treated and released from Ventura County Medical Center. GREG RIPPEE

 Two Oak View men and a juvenile were in custody Tuesday in connection with a 
brawl between them and youths who had been playing football in an Oak View 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Terrazas and Vincent Dealba, both 18, were arrested on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Maureen 
Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail for each was $5,000, and their arraignment was scheduled today, Sgt. 
Bruce Macedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third suspect, a 17-year-old, was taken to Ventura County Juvenile Hall, 
Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hookstra said the incident began about 4:50 p.m. Monday when the three, who 
were in a vehicle, confronted five youths who were playing football on Bundren 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the players, 18-year-old Michael York of Oak View, was struck in the 
head by a flashlight during the ensuing scuffle, Hookstra said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said deputies, who were called by a neighbor, apprehended the three 
suspects a short time later in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 York, who lives on Bundren Street, declined to be treated at the scene, she 
added. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COOUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; EX-OFFICER CLEARED OF BRUTALITY CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Tuesday cleared a former Santa Paula police officer of brutality in 
connection with a March, 1991, altercation that left a suspect with a broken 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Rios Navarette, 24, filed the lawsuit in Ventura County Municipal 
Court, contending that Officer Greg Guilin broke his left tibia and used racial 
slurs during an arrest on East Ventura Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred after Guilin, now a deputy in the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department, responded to a domestic-disturbance call involving 
Navarette and the father of Navarette's girlfriend, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contended that Navarette had been drinking and broke the bone in 
his leg while resisting arrest. Guilin denied using racial slurs, testifying 
that he is Latino, like Navarette. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navarette said Guilin assaulted him without provocation after arriving on 
the scene. Attorney Douglas L. Stenzel said Guilin placed his client in a 
chokehold for 30 seconds, until his client's face became ashen. He then dragged 
a subdued Navarette about 20 feet and slammed him to the ground, breaking the 
leg bone, Stenzel told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for about an hour, the jury voted 11 to 1 to reject 
Navarette's charge of unnecessary force. It voted 12 to 0 against the 
plaintiff's claim that Guilin violated his civil rights by directing racial 
slurs at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The case went to trial after the city of Santa Paula rejected an arbitrator's 
award of $10,000 to Navarette, Stenzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guilin's attorney, Terrence J. Bonham, said his client followed departmental 
policy. Guilin, who is in his late 20s, now works as an officer at the Ventura 
County Jail. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COOUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HOMEMADE BOMB EXPLODES IN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A homemade bomb exploded in an Oxnard alley Tuesday afternoon, sending a spray 
of acid across the ground and a nearby wall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small explosion, caused when chemicals were mixed in a two-liter bottle, 
startled residents on the 1400 block of Juniper Street in south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so loud it made us jump," said Rod Grant, a longtime resident. "I 
assumed it was kids playing around, but when I went to pick up the bottle, my 
hands started to sting." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant did not seek treatment for his exposure to the chemicals, and no one 
else was believed injured in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard fire officials dispatched a hazardous materials squad to the scene to 
dispose of the acid. Officials took samples of the chemicals and later 
identified the substance as nitric acid.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was the type of thing someone probably read about in a book," Fire Capt. 
Robin Miller said. "This is pretty dangerous stuff though. If it goes off at 
the wrong time, you could get serious burns or lose your vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they have heard similar explosions in the past few days but had 
not reported them to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep hearing this, 'Boom! Boom!' but when we look to see what it is, 
nobody's around," Juniper Street resident Reina Weight said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're telling our kids to stay out of the alley," Weight added. "Whatever it 
is, it looks like it's dangerous." MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COOUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai Unified School District is seeking adults and teen-agers to help with 
tutoring and other student activities, said Supt. Andrew Smidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will serve as role models and academic tutors, lead small-group 
homework clubs, work as lunchtime supervisors, and drive students to outside 
services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called "The OK'S" (Ojai Kids' Supporters), will start as a pilot 
project in October at Meiners Oaks Elementary School. Volunteers will be asked 
to spend two hours a week or more and will receive six hours of training at 
Meiners Oaks Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 After three consecutive years of no increases in state funding, Smidt said, 
the Ojai school district needs volunteers more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The condition of school finance doesn't allow us to offer all of the programs 
we consider important unless there is volunteer support from the community," 
Smidt said. "All of the research indicates that schools are more effective when 
there is a strong involvement of both parents and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers don't have to have school-age children, Smidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done this before," he said. "The difference here is that we are 
inviting more community members who may not have kids in school to 
participate." JASON GRANT

COUNSELORS SEEK TO AVERT NEW DECLINE IN SERVICES; EDUCATION: CONEJO VALLEY 
UNIFIED DISTRICT EMPLOYEES SAY STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING IN THE WAKE OF STAFF 
REDUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks school counselors, who are negotiating a new contract with 
school district officials, said Tuesday they are willing to take a pay cut and 
work longer hours to ensure that student-to-counselor ratios are not increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing contract, the ratio of students to counselors is 
recommended at 400-to-1. But that number has swelled to more than 600-to-1 in 
recent years as counseling positions have been eliminated, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, counselors say, is fewer opportunities for students to meet with 
their advisers at a time when counseling is critical for many youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The services to kids are suffering -- that's the bottom line," said Richard 
Intlekofer, a counselor at Newbury Park High School. "Because the ratio is so 
large, we don't get to see the kids as often." 
</P>
<P>
 Student-to-counselor ratios at other Ventura County school districts vary. In 
Ventura Unified, for example, the ratio is about 400-to-1, while in Oak Park it 
is 680-to-1, school officials said. In neighboring Simi Valley Unified, the 
ratio is 576-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the Conejo Valley Unified School District has cut four counseling 
positions, leaving 14 counselors at the junior high and high school levels, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those counselors, and the district's nine school psychologists, want the 
district to guarantee that no more positions will be cut or 
student-to-counselor ratios increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for money, we aren't asking for fringe benefits, we're not 
asking for extra pay," said David Holmboe, a counselor at Los Cerritos 
Intermediate School. "We want a guarantee not to cut back services." 
</P>
<P>
 But because Conejo Valley Unified's financial future is uncertain, district 
officials said they are wary of making promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district is not willing to guarantee anything," Assistant Supt. Leean 
Nemeroff said. "We have lost 40 to 60 teaching positions. . . . Everyone is 
feeling the burden. There isn't an area that hasn't been hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But counselors contend that they have already fallen victim to the budget ax 
and are afraid of what could happen if their services are not protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a lot of violence because we can't nip things in the bud like 
we used to," said Carole Krieger, a part-time counselor at Newbury Park High. 
"There are just too many people to deal with and we are spreading ourselves too 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, two Westlake High School students received minor injuries when they 
were shot during an after-school melee at a nearby park. The brawl resulted 
from an ongoing dispute involving two other Westlake High students. 
</P>
<P>
 High school students said they have noticed changes in counseling services, 
such as fewer opportunities to see counselors and more mishaps in school 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's slower and there are lots more mistakes," said Theresa Nguyen, 16, a 
senior at Newbury Park High. "But they are doing the best they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Jayme Berlin said she wishes the district would recognize the 
important role counselors play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to wake up and realize that the students need counseling," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the most visible task counselors perform is registering new students 
and providing college and career counseling, they also perform a host of 
services behind closed doors, such as helping with personal or family problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take care of our students in every way," Intlekofer said. 
"Sometimes, they're just looking for someone to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 But because of increasing student-to-counselor ratios, counselors at Newbury 
Park High have limited student conferences to 15 minutes, Intlekofer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not going to tell a student who is in crisis that you have to stop 
because he's out of time," Intlekofer said. Consequently, counselors often work 
longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Their heavy workload has not gone unnoticed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have way too much to do," Jayme said. "They must all be having nervous 
breakdowns. But no matter what, they always try to help."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; ADAMS FINALLY INJURY FREE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan Adams dates his physical status by quarterbacks. The last time he was 
completely without injury "was when Tommy Maddox was here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Adams was a freshman, and his first touchdown came on a Maddox pass against 
Stanford in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is back now, free of the hamstring pulls and sprained ankles that have 
dogged his last three seasons -- one of which he spent as a redshirt -- and is 
playing behind J.J. Stokes and Kevin Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much time has passed," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so much knowledge. "I've learned patience," he said. "I've learned my body 
and that there are things you just can't rush." 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is rehabilitation, a difficult lesson when others have supplanted 
you in the UCLA plans. After a freshman season of averaging 22 yards on three 
catches and getting plenty of playing time, there were big career plans that 
virtually vanished while he spent time hobbling around the field in a red 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I couldn't play, it made me moody and hard to get along with," he said. 
"That's when I learned about close friends and family. They helped get me 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 They also helped get him ready for the season. Adams spent the summer with his 
father, Lee, in Bakersfield, working to find out whether his 4.37-second speed 
in the 40-yard dash is intact. 
</P>
<P>
 It is. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I have speed, I can still play," he said. 
</P>
<P>

 Injury report: Freshman tailback Shaun Williams practiced at full speed 
Tuesday, as did No. 1 tailback Sharmon Shah. . . . Tennessee is 5-3-1 against 
UCLA, having won the last two in a row, 24-6 in the 1989 opener at the Rose 
Bowl and 30-16 in 1991 at Knoxville. UCLA last beat the Volunteers in 1978. . .

preseason polls. JIM HODGES

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; MAIN TASK IN OPENER: STOP KAUFMAN

<P>
 There's no question that USC's primary challenge Saturday in its opener 
against Washington is containing Napoleon Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 185-pound running back from Lompoc rushed for 1,299 yards last 
season and accounted for 1,851 all-purpose yards.He ran for 119 yards during 
the Huskies' 22-17 loss to the Trojans at Seattle but was unable to make a big 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman has 3,832 career all-purpose yards and should pass the Huskies above 
him, Joe Steele (4,004) and Hugh McElhenny (4,234), early this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman considered making himself available for the NFL draft a year early, 
but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted he stayed for his senior year," Washington Coach Jim 
Lambright said. "The NFL people told him if he wanted to come into the league 
as an all-around small back, they wanted to see him do other things, like 
return kicks, and we'll let him do that this year."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he has received a letter of apology from Stanford Coach Bill 
Walsh for remarks published in Lowell Cohn's book, "Rough Magic." Cohn had 
access to all Stanford coaches' meetings during the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was quoted as saying of USC: "This team we're playing is yesterday. . . 
. a team of the '60s, trying to hold onto the past. . . . We beat Yesterday U." 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: GAMES END BUT SONG GOES ON AND ON . . . .

 We interrupt the baseball strike for a not-so-brief musical interlude: "Take 
Me Out to the Ballgame," on radio station WJMP in Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 All the time. Seriously. Over . . . and . . . over . . . and . . . over. "Take 
Me Out to the Ballgame" is played non-stop on the temporarily former all-sports 
station during the baseball strike, one version with a twangy country 
instrumental, another with a Bruce Springsteen sound-alike, 72 times an hour 
for the 14 hours a day that the 1,000-watt station is broadcasting in the 
Cleveland-Akron area. The counter was at 16,359 as of 4:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do provide air sickness bags for our audience," said Bob Klaus, vice 
president of WJMP, who is responsible for the idea, for better or worse. "If it 
overcomes them, they are free to use the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what this is doing to the station's ratings is not known because they 
are not released until September. But Klaus, noting that the feedback from 
listeners who applaud the air raid as a protest against the strike has been 
positive, said WJMP will stick with "TMOTTB" until the owners and players reach 
an agreement, be that tomorrow or next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed," he said. "Or about to be committed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add WJMP: "We're beginning to ask our audience to send in their own audio 
cassette of 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame' and we will put that into our play 
rotation," Klaus said. "We are hoping to get a semi-truckload from around the 
country, and if we do, we hope to drive to Major League Baseball in New York 
and dump it on their doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
 The station's address is P.O. Box 2170, Akron, Ohio, 44309. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blame me or credit me," he says. "It was either a brainstorm or a brain 
drizzle."

 Trivia time: The 10th-leading active rusher in the NFL did not gain one yard 
as a running back in college. Who is he?

</P>
<P>
 Long-term planning: Organizers of the Vermont Sports Council realize they have 
little or no chance of getting the Winter Olympic Games before 2006 at the 
earliest, but they are serious about a bid for sometime after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Their vision is that Burlington, Vt., would be the host city and the site of 
opening and closing ceremonies and some events. The half-dozen ski resorts 
within two hours would also serve as venues. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the most recent Winter Olympics in the relatively small 
community of Lillehammer, Norway, and at the far-flung venues that comprised 
the games in Albertville, France, and Calgary, Canada, convinced the Burlington 
group that it could stage a successful Olympics. 
</P>

<P>
 Trivia answer: Randall Cunningham, the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback, who 
has rushed for 4,096 yards.

Gelzheiser, who led the Lions in tackles last season, injured a knee two weeks 
ago and might also sit out a Sept. 10 game against USC. Nelson, a backup 
linebacker, has a broken fibula, while Kroell sustained a concussion last 
Tuesday. . . . Mississippi State's football program is being investigated for 
three possible NCAA violations, school officials confirmed.

U.S. OPEN / OTHER MATCHES; MARTIN, ROSSET, KRAJICEK HAPPY JUST TO SLIP THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wise men Todd Martin, Marc Rosset and Richard Krajicek, fearing to tread 
foolishly where colleagues Goran Ivanisevic and Boris Becker did Monday on 
opening day of the U.S. Open, eased into the second round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day at the U.S. Tennis Center when only No. 13 Lori McNeil lost among the 
seeded players, Martin, Rosset and Krajicek made escapes reminiscent of 
Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, seeded No. 9 and considered by many a player with the tools needed to 
beat Pete Sampras, lost the first two sets and survived three match points in 
the fifth before slipping past Guillaume Raoux of France, 6-7 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3, 
6-4, 7-6 (7-1). 
</P>
<P>
 On the first match point, with Martin serving at 4-5 of the fifth, Raoux 
approached deep to Martin's backhand and got in close to the net. Martin 
responded by cranking an incredible cross-court passing shot into Raoux's deep 
backhand corner, just inches inside the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosset, the big-serving Swiss star who won the Barcelona Olympics and is 
seeded 15th, dropped his first two sets to Mark Woodforde, 6-4 and 6-1, before 
getting on track to win the next three, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3. Rosset served 27 
aces, three in a row at the end of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 The strangest match of all, however, might have been Krajicek's 7-6 (7-2), 
6-4, 6-7 (7-2), 6-7 (10-8), 6-4 victory over Jan Siemerink, like Krajicek a 
Dutch player. Instead of trailing by two sets, Krajicek, unseeded but a threat 
to go all the way, won the first two, then hit four easy passing shots into the 
net to lose the fourth-set tiebreaker. Next, he took a 6-0 lead in the 
fourth-set tiebreaker before losing that, too, 10-8. In the fifth set, Krajicek 
also had to fight through one love-40 service game before finally prevailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other seeded players among the men -- No. 4 Michael Stich, No. 5 Stefan Edberg 
and No. 11 Jim Courier -- won in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil went out quickly to a woman with clearly the best name in tennis today, 
Anna Smashnova of Russia. Smashnova, who won, 6-2, 6-4, is ranked 54th. McNeil, 
who is 35 and a former U.S. semifinalist, upset Steffi Graf at Wimbledon, but 
couldn't handle the 18-year-old Russian Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Graf ran past wild-card entry Anne Marie Mall, formerly of UCLA and 
Dana Hills High, 6-2, 6-1.

then gave up his final year of eligibility to make himself available for the

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER BRACES FOR CARDINAL ONSLAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller will start only his 11th regular-season game in three 
years Sunday against an Arizona defense designed specifically to neutralize 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Buddy Ryan has brought with him the "46 defense," complete with 
free-agent imports Clyde Simmons and Seth Joyner from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 So how concerned is Miller, who is coming off two knee operations, about the 
Cardinals' heavy pass rush? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to get hit more than normal against this defense," he said. "You 
have to take those hits because you're going to have an opportunity to make 
some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Offenses have struggled for years against the "46 defense," named after the 
jersey number of Doug Plank, who played for Ryan in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 It's designed to put heavy pressure on the quarterback without sacrificing run 
defense by placing as many as eight defenders within five yards of the line of 
scrimmage. There's one flaw: It's sometimes vulnerable to deep passing plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes this defense makes you look real bad, but sometimes you'll go three 
downs and out, three downs and out and then throw a 78-yard touchdown pass," 
Miller said. "You have to be patient against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had success against it in Atlanta. With our four wideouts, it was hard for 
them to bring that type of pressure and heat all the time." 
</P>

 Wide receiver Patrick Rowe, formerly with the Cleveland Browns, will undergo a 
physical exam by team doctors today. Rowe, 6-feet-1 and 195 pounds, is a

caught only three passes for 37 yards in five games last season. . . . Safety 
Cliff Hicks, cut by the Rams, was picked up by the New York Jets, his former 
team. The Jets plan to use him as a punt returner. MIKE REILLEY

 Washington Redskin Coach Norv Turner ended weeks of speculation Tuesday and 
named John Friesz the starting quarterback for Sunday's regular-season opener 
against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz, a four-year veteran who signed as a free agent during the off-season, 
got the nod over No. 3 overall draft pick Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I think that Heath can't handle it. He'd handle it fine," 
Turner said. "I think in terms of this football team . . . . I just feel more 
comfortable with John in that role, early in the game."

 Kicker David Treadwell, waived by the New York Giants in April after finishing 
last season as their leading scorer, was re-signed by the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell, 29, has spent all five of his pro seasons kicking for Giants Coach 
Dan Reeves, the first four with the Denver Broncos. Contract terms were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent training camp with Kansas City and Pittsburgh before being waived by 
the Steelers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daluiso was given the Giants' kicking job in the off-season after 
Treadwell was waived in a salary cap move. However, Daluiso made just two of 
five field goals in exhibition games. Daluiso will continue to handle kickoff 
chores, Reeves said.

 Rookie linebacker Marty Moore, the 222nd and final player chosen in the draft, 
will start at right inside linebacker for the New England Patriots in Sunday's 
regular-season opener at Miami. He will replace veteran Todd Collins, who 
injured his right knee in the Patriots' exhibition finale at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, quarterback Drew Bledsoe was hospitalized briefly for what Coach 
Bill Parcells called a "gastric disorder." The illness did not appear to be 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Sharpe, Green Bay's All-Pro wide receiver, might leave the Packers if 
the team does not readjust his contract before Sunday's game against Minnesota, 
the Milwaukee Sentinel reported. Sharpe's agent, William Black, said the 
Packers and Sharpe have held intense discussions over Sharpe's 10-year contract 
and that a resolution did not appear close.

 Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse was remembered at his funeral 
Tuesday for contributions to the NFL that were unassuming yet essential to the 
growth of pro football. . . . Former Pro Bowl running back John Stephens, 
released last week by the Kansas City Chiefs, was arrested on a charge of 
carrying a concealed weapon in a suburb of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. . . . The 
Vikings cut Bryan Barker, whom they had signed as a free agent in the 
off-season, and replaced him by signing Mike Saxon, formerly of the New England 
Patriots and Dallas Cowboys.

OUTDOOR NOTES / RICH ROBERTS: DOVES TO BE PLENTIFUL IF WEATHER HOLDS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The last forecast California's dove hunters want to hear as they head out for 
their favorite sites today is that it will be a dark and stormy night. The 
first part of the split season opens Thursday, a half-hour before sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent surveys of the state's most popular game bird by California Department 
of Fish and Game personnel indicate that it could be the best shooting in years 
. . . if storms don't scatter the birds or cooling weather doesn't drive them 
south into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, John Massie, a DFG senior wildlife biologist for the southern 
counties, said that if anything, the picture has been getting brighter over the 
last few days. "We're getting reports of new birds coming in from the north," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Blankenship, a DFG biologist specializing in game birds, said ample 
rainfall the last two years has boosted the birds' nesting habitat and 
increased reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This good reproduction rate translates into high concentrations of birds in 
traditional dove hunting areas," he said. "To the hunter, it's probably going 
to mean a great 1994 season." 
</P>
<P>
 The season runs Sept. 1-15 and Nov. 12-Dec. 26. The best areas are usually 
Imperial and Riverside counties and the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters with licenses ($24.40 plus $5.50 for an upland game stamp) may take 10 
birds daily and have 20 in possession. Shooting closes at sundown each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The limit includes white-winged doves, which may be hunted in Imperial, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, along with mourning, Chinese-spotted and 
ringed-turtleneck doves hunted elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Each dove must retain one fully feathered wing for identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Migrating doves are attracted to open agricultural fields, especially those 
with safflower and cereal grains. They avoid forests, swamps and high 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A key to desert dove hunting is to locate aerial pathways that the birds 
follow between feed locations and watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good dove-hunting sites generally overlooked are tribal lands along the 
Colorado River. For information in the Parker Valley, telephone (602) 669-9286; 
for the Chemehuevi Valley Indian Reservation, telephone (619) 858-5322.

 Entering the last big boating weekend of the summer, Texas leads the nation in 
recreational boating fatalities this year with 42. There have been 24 deaths in 
California.

 More than 500 people have died in boating accidents nationwide this year, 
according to the Boat Owners Assn. of the United States (BOAT/U.S.). One reason 
is false security. Normally, a boat isn't going to sink at sea -- most sink at 
the dock -- but that doesn't mean a boater can get away with stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the fatal incidents this year, half involved the use of alcohol by the 
driver or passengers. Still, they might have survived if they hadn't been in an 
overloaded boat, but 30% were. And they still might have made it if they had 
been wearing lifejackets, but 80% were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important is keeping an alert lookout for swimmers, fishermen, water 
skiers, buoys and other objects in the water, but especially other boats, 
because those on board might not be looking out for you. Most accidents are 
collisions. 
</P>

 MEXICAN FISHING -- San Diego long-range: Boats, with full loads of passengers, 
continued to find bluefin tuna, but the counts dropped off a bit. Some boats 
are seeking only the bluefin, which are still from 80 to 100 miles south, while 
others go farther south after yellowtail, bonito or dorado and check out the 
bluefin grounds going and coming. That strategy worked well for the Red Rooster 
III, which found 395 yellowtail, 215 yellowfin tuna and 110 dorado for 31 
passengers at San Benito Island 280 miles south, then hit 15 bluefin at the 
100-mile mark coming home -- "a good way to finish off the (four-day) trip," 
said Victor Rilling of Lee Palm Sportfishers. He expects the bluefin bite to 
continue until the water cools. Jackpot bluefin have been consistently larger 
than 100 pounds, topped by a 149-pounder taken by Bob DeRobbio of Newport Beach 
on the Vagabond last week. Cabo San Lucas: A 790-pound black marlin, one of the 
largest landed in the area, was taken by Greg Wolf of Huntington Beach aboard 
the Tyon II. Wolf, who was trolling a small tuna on a downrigger, fought the 
fish for two hours. Jeff Kirkpatrick, Riverside, had a 320-pound blue marlin. 
The Whitey's Blue Marlin tournament was canceled for lack of entries, but the 
nine teams that showed up staged their own contest, topped by a 440-pound black 
marlin taken by Bruce Clark of Phoenix aboard the Yayo. Overall, billfish 
counts were down but dorado and tuna up, averaging a season high of nine fish a 
boat.

 Trout, catfish or largemouth bass -- take your pick for the last big 
freshwater fishing weekend of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 All should be available at various sites throughout Southern California and 
the Eastern Sierra, but anglers will have to decide what they want because only 
one species is biting at a given spot.

<P>
 For those who can take the heat, Irvine Lake and Corona Lake have been loaded 
with catfish. Eastern Sierra lakes will receive special plants of oversize

 In an expected move, the NBA disapproved the new contract that center Chris 
Dudley signed with the Portland Trail Blazers, on the grounds that it violates 
league salary-cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Dudley signed a seven-year contract with Portland with a first-year 
salary of $790,400, the most the team could pay under the salary cap. The NBA 
argued in federal court that a one-year opt-out clause in that contract was a 
circumvention of its salary cap, but lost. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Trail Blazers said Dudley had opted out of the seven-year, 
$11-million deal and had signed a new six-year deal with an average annual 
salary of $4 million.

 Third-year coach Takkinen said the Raiders will have good speed on offense and 
defense, but he's counting on his defense to put Sonora in gear until the 
offense catches up. Experience is the key for the Raiders, whose defensive line 
returns intact. Only Grain is back as the offensive line rebuilds. However, the 
saving grace appears to be junior quarterback and all-league selection Kevin 
Rodriguez, who last season threw for 1,100 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Raiders 
will employ three receivers who played a lot toward the end of last season.

</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by Fullerton's dismal record last year. The Indians are in the 
enviable position of returning 14 starters--including six who play both ways. 
However, before the band starts to play the school's victory song too loudly, 
Smilowitz is realistic about his team's chances and admits there may be 
potential problems for the Indians. Like a declining school enrollment--a 
problem, he says, which in the long run will have a negative impact on the 
school's athletic program. Fullerton also has a lackluster kicking game and 
lacks experience in what he called "important areas" of the game. While this 
may sound like mere doom and gloom from a second-year coach, Smilowitz truly 
believes his team might be able to win enough league games to qualify for 
postseason play. No doubt Smilowitz's hopes are pinned on the performance of 
the 1991 freshman team, which had a 10-0 record and has many of those players 
starting for the Indians this year. Smilowitz said if he can get some stellar 
performances from tight end Schatz, a potential all-county player, miracles 
could indeed happen. Of course, if he could get those former freshmen team 
members to turn in a repeat performance. . . .

 Milhizer, in his second season, sees his team as a two-edged sword. While he 
believes his offense is strong in the skilled positions, he fears the offensive 
line could be hampered by inexperience. Milhizer's sights are on league and 
Southern Section championships. And with second-team all-league quarterback 
Berg, first-teamer Yoo at tailback and free safety, and second-team wide 
receiver McIntosh leading the way, Milhizer's goals might be attainable. In 
addition, the Highlanders are counting on six returning starters and 10 
returning lettermen to keep things rolling. Milhizer said there also seems to 
be a lot of motivation going on between his players. Yoo has told him that he 
wants to be the most inspirational player on the team. "Not MVP, but 
inspirational," Milhizer said. The Highlanders expect tough competition from 
Sonora and Troy, "but don't count out Sunny Hills," Milhizer said. "You can't 
discount the three (Southern Section) championships under (Coach) Tim Devaney."

 When league champion Troy met Rancho Alamitos in the first round of the 
Southern Section Division VI playoffs Nov. 20, little did the Warriors know 
they would be facing what Rancho quarterback John Frank called a man 
"possessed." Kevin Allen, with 21 carries for 211 yards, almost single-handedly 
eliminated the Warriors, 24-14. And though Troy, under the guidance of Coach 
John Turek (86-77-5), was eliminated early, the Warriors had five players make 
the all-league first team on offense and four players on defense. Sonora, 
finishing as the runner-up in league, lost a hard-fought playoff game to 
Lompoc, 27-15, on a 16-yard touchdown pass on the game's final play. Running 
backs Adam Chez and Cubby Kelly were the Raiders' standouts and earned 
all-league first-team honors. While La Habra, the third-place qualifier, was 
overwhelmed by Montclair Prep, 49-14, in the playoffs, the Highlanders still 
improved on their 1992 finish and placed four players on the first-team 
all-league team. Buena Park, in its first year under veteran Coach Bob Rau, 
just missed a playoff berth. The Coyotes' 3-7 record was hardly indicative of 
their talent as six players were selected to the all-league first team. Sunny 
Hills went through a rebuilding year but still managed to win four games under 
Coach Tim Devaney, whose career record is an impressive 122-41-1. Fullerton 
lost all its league games, as it did the previous season, but it did manage to 
win three nonleague games under first-year Coach Julian Smilowitz. Standings

<P>
 With a strong offensive line led by first-team all-league selection Fewel at 
guard and a good running back in Montgomery, Turek believes the Warriors have a 
good chance to repeat their league-winning performance of last year. And though 
he acknowledges his defensive secondary will need some work, he does return 
all-league defensive end Heaton and linebacker Vasquez, who plan to vex 
opponents and cause general mayhem. Overall, Turek said the team is fired up 
and can't wait for the season to begin. "They really want Rancho (Alamitos) 
again," Turek said. "They knocked us out in the first round (of playoffs) and 
you can understand we would like another shot at them." In comparison to other 
Freeway League teams, Troy has some good depth with 21 returning lettermen and 
nine starters from last year. And whether or not senior Kevin Gray will be able 
to fill the gap left by All-League quarterback Brian Logan, it is still too 
early to see if the 6 foot-1 Gray can pull it off.

 Devaney is calling this a transition year for the Lancers despite returning 41 
lettermen. Sure, only four were starters, but the overall experience should 
help reassure Devaney, whose teams have won eight league titles and appeared in 
postseason play 11 times in his 14 years at the school. Devaney is hoping 
Higgins and Giesen can deliver on their size, though neither has much playing 
experience. With both 6 feet 7 and 275 and 290 pounds respectively, they 
provide the Lancers with a sizable presence on both sides of the line. Devaney 
is cautiously optimistic. However, as La Habra Coach Rick Milhizer explains it, 
you can't count out the Lancers as long as Devaney is at the helm.

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes have been plagued by injuries, including one to first team 
all-league quarterback Cabral, who helped get Buena Park get to the playoffs 
last season. The senior is hoping to return to play in October. Until then, the 
Coyotes will have to rely on Hudson, who also plays defensive back. 
Additionally, Ray, the tight end/linebacker who was an all-league second-team 
selection as a sophomore, is coming off an injury that kept him out of the 
entire 1993 season. But Buena Park and Rau seem to be able to make things 
happen, and there's still Jones, an all-league running back. With the 
graduation of Wali Sibrie, the 6-foot-3, 270-pound offensive lineman who is now 
at Arizona State, the Coyotes are definitely not a huge team. Only one starter 
weighs more than 200 pounds. But what they don't have in size, they make up for 
in quickness. But factors like whether Ray can duplicate his '92 season and 
when Cabral returns might be the difference between a winning and losing 
campaign.

IT'S ALL THE RAGE, BULLFROGS LOSE; ROLLER HOCKEY: PORTLAND'S POWER-PLAY GOALS 
KEEP ANAHEIM FROM ADVANCING TO DEFEND ITS LEAGUE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Bullfrogs looked like a desperate and frustrated team against Portland in 
Game 2 of the Roller Hockey International Western Conference finals Tuesday 
night at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was all the Rage as Portland converted on four of five power plays in 
an 11-7 victory over the Bullfrogs before a crowd of 10,241. With the victory, 
Portland won the series, two games to none, and advanced to the RHI 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Downey had four goals and an assist and Chris Valicevic had two goals 
and three assists for the Rage, which finished fourth in the Northwest 
Division. Portland will be host to Eastern Conference-champion Buffalo in Game 
1 of the championship series tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't seem prepared for what they threw at us tonight," Bullfrog Coach 
Grant Sonier said. "They really used their team speed. When they get a step on 
you, it's an instant two-on-one. When they can do that, they dominate." 
</P>
<P>
 Portland's speed and skill dominated the game as they broke free for numerous 
odd-man rushes on Bullfrog goalie Rob Laurie. Laurie, who had 44 saves in 
Monday's loss, had 26 Tuesday in helping to keep the Bullfrogs withing striking 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Portland Coach John Black some sense of redemption. Black 
coached the Blades last season to the league semifinals, where the Bullfrogs 
eliminated them and went on to win the championship. This season, the Blades 
brought in Bobby Hull Jr. to coach and Black found a new home in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get to the finals," Black said. "I built the type of team 
that has players with strong offensive skills. The challenge is to get them to 
play defense." 
</P>
<P>
 And Portland's defense clamped down on the Bullfrogs, holding them to 32 
shots. Rage goalie Lance Carlsen had 75 saves in the two victories, anchoring a 
defense that held Bullfrog forward Victor Gervais without a shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais, who had 12 playoff goals before Tuesday, culminated his frustration 
by drawing a 10-minute misconduct penalty with seven minutes remaining and the 
Bullfrogs trailing by two. Gervais finished with four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad McCaughey had three goals and Darren Perkins also had four assists for 
the Bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland scored on nine of 12 power plays in the series, helping thwart any 
Bullfrog comeback attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kerr scored midway through the third quarter to draw the Bullfrogs even, 
5-5, but the Rage responded with three goals, two by Gerry St. Cyr, in a 2 
1/2-minute span to push the lead to three.

<P>
 La Quinta football player Aron Lenaerts is in good condition and resting 
comfortably at UCI Medical Center four days after suffering a head injury 
during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Tuesday that Lenaerts was still in the 
intensive care unit and that he was conscious and comfortable.Lenaerts, a 
junior lineman, was hit in the temple during tackling drills on Friday. He 
lapsed into a coma that afternoon and came out of it Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Thomas, La Quinta principal, said the school is doing its best to deal 
with Lenaerts' injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are concerned, the coaches are concerned," Thomas said. "We're still 
dealing with that. The mood is still shock. It hit the kids right in the gut. 
It was a tough thing to go through. It left (the coaches) with a hollow feeling 
in their stomach."

 The Kennedy High water polo team will practice and play games this season at 
Cypress High because the Kennedy pool has been declared unsafe by the county, 
Kennedy Athletic Director Tom Wallace said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said county inspectors making a regular check of the pool this summer 
found cracks in the deck. The pool was built in 1963, mostly above the ground 
because of the high water table in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool per se is fine but when you build 17 feet above ground and the 
decking is a problem, you can't get to the pool," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish water polo team plans to have its first practice Thursday 
at Cypress. MARTIN BECK

O'NEIL ISN'T ONE TO DUCK WORK; FOOTBALL: FORMER MATER DEI QUARTERBACK HAS TAKEN 
CHARGE AT OREGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late summer and, if he were at home in Newport Beach, Danny O'Neil could 
be shark fishing off the coast of Orange County. That has been one of his 
favorite pastimes for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But time and distance have prevented him from posting the "gone fishing" sign 
more than once this summer. He has been too busy preparing himself, mentally 
and physically, for his final season as Oregon's starting quarterback. The 
start of practice was near, and O'Neil, formerly of Mater Dei, wanted there to 
be no mistake about it: His commitment is clearly, unquestionably to football. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the summer in Eugene, working out and hoping to be in the best 
possible shape for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon he will be back in shark-infested territory. This time, though, the 
sharks will be those massive but thunderbolt-quick pass rushers, who will have 
O'Neil as their prey. But they'd better be fighting sharks if they want his 
respect. He can quickly tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're fishing, there are a lot of blue sharks that come around," O'Neil 
said. "They're big, but those aren't the ones you want to catch. They just lay 
around. They're not good fighters. They just get in the way. . . . There are 
some football players like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones you want are the makos. When one of them strikes, you know it. When 
they grab your line, it really starts jumping. The makos are quick, and they'll 
fight non-stop until they die. And you know when it's all over, you've had a 
real fight. If I were a shark, I'd want to be a mako." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know O'Neil best as an athlete say he is mako all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, however, will be an important test for him. It's not so much a 
matter of putting eye-popping statistics on the board. He did that a year ago 
when he passed for 3,224 yards. He threw for more than 300 yards six times, and 
became one of only four Pac-10 quarterbacks to pass for more than 3,000 in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem from a recognition standpoint was that two other former Orange 
County high school players, Steve Stenstrom of Stanford and Rob Johnson of USC, 
also did it in the same season, and both their passing numbers were slightly 
better. O'Neil, however, finished ahead of Stenstrom in passing efficiency and 
edged Johnson in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's more a question of whether O'Neil can dramatically turn Oregon into a 
winner. The Ducks were close last year, finishing with a 5-6 record, but were 
left out of the postseason bowl lineup after ending the season with three 
consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 That has gnawed at O'Neil since the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good numbers just weren't translating into wins," he said. "I'd give up a 
ton of personal stats for a few more victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm trying not to think about last season now, even though it was 
disappointing to me. It was really disappointing after we get off to a 3-0 
start, and then have a 30-point lead in the fourth game to be 4-0 for the SC 
game the following weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though O'Neil threw three touchdown passes in the first quarter and 
finished with 313 yards in that game at Cal, the wheels fell off in the second 
half when the Bears scored 35 points and won, 42-41. The Ducks weren't quite 
the same team again in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The year before, O'Neil passed for more than 2,000 yards. That immediately 
allowed him to be mentioned in the same breath with such former Oregon 
quarterback stars as Bill Musgrave, Chris Miller and Dan Fouts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, O'Neil had suffered a dislocated thumb on his passing hand that 
ended his season in the fifth game, but he still wound up throwing for 703 
yards. His three-year passing total stands at 6,089 yards, third among the 
school's career leaders, trailing only Musgrave (8,343 yards) and Miller 
(6,681). 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon Coach Rich Brooks is confident O'Neil is as good as any quarterback in 
the conference, and will be among the nation's best this year. "He probably 
would have gotten more recognition last season if we had made it to a bowl 
game," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Neil doesn't have any ego-inflated ideas that he can do it alone, 
regardless of how many yards he gets. One of his frustrations has been the fact 
that the team is no better than .500 (14-14) in games he has started in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon also hasn't been a come-from-behind team during that time. The Ducks 
are 0-14 during that span in games in which they've trailed at halftime or 
fallen behind in the second half. O'Neil hopes that image will change this 
season, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a strong desire by everyone," O'Neil said. "It's not going 
to be just how well the coaches call the game. The players are going to have to 
step up and make a great block, or a great catch, or some great play. Great 
players do that. That's what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've been missing is a winning attitude. Last year we were in some 
situations where we could have won games, but nobody seemed to know exactly 
what to do. You have to really want to win . . . above being nervous, or 
scared, or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the reasons O'Neil was so diligent about his off-season 
training. "If people are just hanging out in the summer, not thinking about 
football and not improving their strength or their speed, they don't want it 
badly enough," he said. "If you don't put much into it, it doesn't become as 
important to you." 
</P>
<P>
 That searing will to win has been a part of O'Neil's makeup since he first 
played sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Marumoto of Newport Beach, a personal coach to O'Neil since he was in the 
fourth grade, said O'Neil's competitive drive is special. "I've worked with a 
lot of athletes who have been successful, but Danny has the ability to make 
people believe in him." he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marumoto worked with O'Neil primarily as a shooting coach in basketball. 
"People don't realize how hard he works," Marumoto said. "I remember especially 
the time right before Mater Dei was going to the State tournament his senior 
year. He called me and wanted to work out three extra nights that week to be 
sure he was ready for the tournament. That's the way he is." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil said Marumoto "has been a big influence on my life" because of his 
emphasis on "the team concept and the work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Rollinson was the first-year coach at Mater Dei for O'Neil's senior 
season. "I was very fortunate to have someone like him," Rollinson said. "He 
had a burning desire to excel at whatever he did. He can't stand to deal with 
anything that's not successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 0-3 at the start of the season, and Danny came up to me after 
practice one day the next week and told me that he also could play positions if 
I thought that would help the team win. So we decided to also have him play 
free safety the next game, although we told him to be careful. All he did was 
intercept two passes, cause one fumble and recover another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did O'Neil star in football and do well in basketball at Mater Dei, 
he also played on the varsity golf and volleyball teams. The double practice 
sessions kept him constantly on the run in volleyball season. "The main reason 
I was able to do it was because the volleyball coach was a walk-on and they 
didn't start practice until around 6:30 each evening," he said. "It was a lot 
to do, but I had a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil had no doubt that football was going to be his sport in college. The 
question was where he was going to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my brothers went to USC, and they wanted me to go there," O'Neil said. 
"In fact, my whole family did. I grew up as a USC fan and went to every one of 
their home games my senior year. USC recruited me, then backed off for a while. 
Then when their first choice backed out, they got back on me strong after that. 
It really came down to the fact that I wanted to go where I could play right 
away. I didn't want to sit behind Todd Marinovich for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil said he's been happy at Oregon. "There is life beyond the traffic and 
the smog," O'Neil said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil will enjoy Oregon even more if this season goes as he hopes. "I think 
we'll be fine," he said. "I'm very happy with the receiving corps. Cristin 
McLemore had a great season last year, and there are other good receivers as 
well." McLemore, who played at Marina, caught 50 passes for 791 yards in 1993 
as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 How well he and the Ducks do this season could have an impact on his chances 
to play pro football. Some so-called experts already have their doubts. Pro 
Football Weekly draft analyst Joel Buchsbaum says O'Neil probably won't be 
taken in the seven-round draft next year and will likely have to catch on as a 
free agent. "He's a decent college quarterback," Buchsbaum said. "I don't want 
to say anything bad about the kid, but he's no Chris Miller, or Bill Musgrave 
for that matter." Others still are reserving judgment, and some of those who 
have been closer to O'Neil than Buchsbaum are betting that O'Neil will find a 
way if he sets his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went to Oregon, I told people there that he was the kind of player 
who would set all the passing records, and I think he'll find a way to play pro 
football, too, if that's what he wants," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks also thinks he can play on the pro level, even though at 6-2 and 178 
pounds he doesn't have the physique of the prototypical pro quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Miller is only 6-2 and he's done well," Brooks said. "Danny has a lot 
of skills. He has real good anticipation, and he throws a real catchable ball. 
He has that knack of putting the ball where it needs to be." But hopes for a 
pro career don't consume him. In fact, O'Neil said he might go into the 
ministry, sooner or later. He's a born-again Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a Christian home, but in high school I got into the whole party 
thing . . . alcohol . . . a messed-up lifestyle," he said. "I've been a 
Christian for 2 1/2 years. I've played football with Jesus and without him, and 
I can tell you it's a lot better with him." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil said he's more at peace with his life now. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a pro football viewpoint, I sort of feel as though it's out of my 
control," O'Neil said. "If someone thinks I'm good enough, then I'll try out 
for their team. But I'm very relaxed about what might happen. The idea pushes 
me to me to work hard, but I don't look at it as an ultimate goal. Right now, I 
just want to do the best I can for this team, and try to win games." Danny 
O'Neil

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; NFC; TITLE WILL BE DECIDED BETWEEN 49ERS, 
COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before buying Ken Norton Jr., Richard Dent, Rickey Jackson and the hopes of 
Northern California, the president of the San Francisco 49ers bought some 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Policy knew his quiet organization would be dizzied by sweeping 
off-season changes. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew if he was going to reshape a team that could defeat the Dallas Cowboys 
after consecutive NFC championship game losses, he would step on some toes. 
</P>
<P>
 So he bought these signs, hanging one copy in his office, one in his vice 
president's office, even one in the weight room: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Take It Personal.  
</P>
<P>
 One problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He forgot to hang a sign in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 And guess who is taking it personal? 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell the 49ers not to be bringing that . . . on the field," Cowboy guard 
Nate Newton said. "They can talk all they want about how they've gotten better, 
but they best not bring that half-cocked junk out there against us, because we 
don't want to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Michael Irvin added: "How do I respond to all the changes on the 
49ers? I say, 'So? So? So?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the NFL's 75th-anniversary theme, the NFC will be dominated 
this season by that ageless institution known as the grudge match. 
</P>
<P>
 The only things that distinguish the 49ers and Cowboys from the Frankford 
Yellow Jackets and Pottsville Maroons are facemasks and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, with a new coach who hasn't walked the sidelines in this decade, 
are attempting to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think about that every time we step on the field," Irvin said. "We have a 
chance to be part of one of those NFL films where they are talking about the 
greatest teams ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, with potentially eight new starters -- including Pro Bowl defenders 
Norton, Dent and Jackson -- are trying to end their longest Super Bowl drought 
in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't played in the big one since after the 1989 season, their longest 
slump since they made their first Super Bowl appearance after the 1981 season. 
They reached the NFC championship game in three of the last four years, only to 
lose to the New York Giants once and to the Cowboys twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have gone to the Super Bowl at least once, if not twice, during 
that time," Policy said. "You bet there is a sense of urgency. The Cowboys 
provided us with a sense of vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a fight for history versus a fight for reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstarts versus traditionalists. 
</P>
<P>
 A blond quarterback named Troy Aikman who owns movie credits . . . versus a 
dark-haired quarterback named Steve Young who doesn't own a comb. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide receiver named Irvin who has dreamed of being like Jerry Rice versus . 
. . well, Jerry Rice, who will become the league's all-time touchdown leader 
with his third score this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A young, fast, cocky defense versus a defense old enough to know better. 
</P>
<P>
 A clash as basic as blue versus red. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like Dallas, as the best team the last two years, is the team we must 
beat to get over the edge," 49er tackle Steve Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 49ers believe that if there was ever a time to dethrone the Cowboys, 
it is now. . . with Jimmy Johnson gone as coach, Norv Turner gone as offensive 
coordinator and middle linebacker Norton having been stolen away by the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea whether the Cowboys have been disrupted down there or not," 
Policy said. "But do we respect Jimmy Johnson? Absolutely. Is Norv Turner a 
great coach? Yes. Were some of their players who signed with other teams a 
factor? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 17 weeks, their paths will cross only once, on Nov. 13 in San 
Francisco, in what promises to be the regular season's most important game. 
</P>
<P>
 They could -- and should -- meet one more time in a third consecutive NFC 
championship showdown on Jan. 15, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only three other NFC teams capable of getting underfoot and breaking 
up this classic rematch, but all have their problems: ONE REGGIE SHORT 
</P>
<P>
 Our first of many meaningless awards this season goes to the Green Bay 
Packers, voted Most Likely to Succeed in Beating the Cowboys or 49ers, but Only 
If Aikman or Young Suffers a Pregame Fall in the Shower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers thought they would be good enough after adding Steve McMichael and 
Sean Jones to an impressive defense led by slimmed-down Reggie White. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also thought Reggie Cobb, signed from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, could 
still run the ball. For some reason, he can't, averaging fewer than three yards 
a carry during an exhibition season in which he needed to show more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers would win the weaker AFC, but can't win the NFC without somebody 
to haul them downfield on 10-minute drives. Left to his own devices, 
quarterback Brett Favre's drives last about 20 seconds. THESE ARE THE GOOD OLD 
DAYS . . . THEY HOPE 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings say they have a quarterback who can lead them back to 
the big game for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why do they look like a modern dance company that has just hired John 
Travolta? 
</P>
<P>
 Their man is Warren Moon, and they are betting that his best years are not 
behind him. They are gamblers indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Super Bowl Era began in 1966, only one quarterback as old as Moon 
(37) has been the starter for a team that won a Super Bowl championship. And 
Moon is not quite Johnny Unitas. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, the Vikings can offer Moon a couple of things he never had with the 
Houston Oilers -- a legitimate power runner in Terry Allen, who has recovered 
from knee surgery, and a consistently stingy defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but the Cowboys and the 49ers have each of those things, and more of 
them. RANDALL'S LAST STAND 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to trade perhaps the most entertaining quarterback of this 
generation, the Philadelphia Eagles are once more entrusting their hopes to 
Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials are giving him one more season to prove he belongs. It would 
only be typical if he rewarded them with a Super Bowl. And then left town 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham has not only fully recovered from the broken leg that cost him the 
final 12 games last season, he is playing with so much enthusiasm, he is 
scaring people. 
</P>
<P>
 In training camp, he showed up wearing a T-shirt that read, "Dangerously 
Committed." Then later he talked about winning games through . . . love? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's, like, a thing going on -- I don't know if it's an inner-city thing," 
Cunningham told reporters. "It's a saying, 'Give me some love.' It's like 
saying, 'Hey, I need you there with me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "(Running back) Herschel (Walker) walks into the huddle sometimes and says, 
'C'mon, I need a little love.' And some of us, we, like, hold hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham admitted that, well, not every offensive player has agreed to hold 
hands. What a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Cunningham in what is probably his last season with the Eagles is 
a revamped defense in which William Fuller, Bill Romanowski and Burt Grossman 
could perform close to the level of defectors Clyde Simmons and Seth Joyner, 
minus the constant contract distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have no steady running back -- no, Herschel doesn't count anymore -- 
and a killer schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, at least they will be fun to watch, particularly on the new 
conversion plays, with Cunningham expected to lead the league in two-yard 
dives. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of everybody we haven't mentioned? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's do this quick, so we can get back to watching our two championship game 
tapes of the Cowboys' Alvin Harper scoring on long touchdown passes against 
confused 49er defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 In order of how everyone else will finish: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Arizona Cardinals are not going to learn Buddy Ryan's defense until 
Week 10, and by then Buddy will already have done something to warrant a 
seven-week suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Chicago Bears don't have anybody who can catch the ball, unless one of 
you USC boosters can convince Curtis Conway to start doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New York Giants will suffer a late-season slide when it is discovered 
that quarterback Dave Brown, as suspected, has been playing under an assumed 
name. Unfortunately, his real name is not Phil Simms.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The Atlanta Falcons can't win without Deion Sanders, and we aren't sure new 
quarterback Jeff George knows how to win with anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Detroit Lions have the league's second-most difficult schedule and a 
starting quarterback, Scott Mitchell, with more money than calluses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams won't make the playoffs because, well, if we said they could, you 
would think us complete idiots. But they will win their final three games to go 
7-9 as season-ticket sales in St. Louis soar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers recently sidelined several players who were 
suffering from the chicken pox. Nobody has ever gone to the Super Bowl the same 
year they contracted the chicken pox. Same goes for the mumps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The New Orleans Saints, sensing that Coach Jim Mora is in trouble, will go 
into their traditional late-season slide by Week 4. We like Jim Everett to 
perform better in a new environment, but better can still mean average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Washington Redskins, with a rookie coach named Norv and a rookie 
quarterback named Shuler, will plain stink. Opposing defensive linemen will be 
pounding Shuler's brains into so much toffee, announcers will begin referring 
to their sacks as Heath Bars.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; RAMS; ON PAPER AT LEAST, THEY SHOULD BE 
BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sifting through the debris in what has become an annual ritual of despair, the 
Rams decided to play on this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A close vote, no doubt, but a month ago -- before four lackluster exhibition 
defeats and a bellyflop by the offensive line -- they had the look of a winner, 
or at the very least, a chance to be the most improved team in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller had been hired to play quarterback, and with sound legs beneath 
him, he has proven to be both accurate and effective. Jimmie Jones, recruited 
heavily by a number of teams, took the Rams' money to play alongside defensive 
tackle Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of linebacker Joe Kelly, safety Marquez Pope, running back Johnny 
Bailey and wide receiver Jessie Hester provided depth, which the Rams had 
sorely lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 And the team already had Jerome Bettis, Flipper Anderson, Todd Lyght, Robert 
Young, Bern Brostek, Shane Conlan, Roman Phifer and Steve Israel on the 
payroll, and that's not exactly the Tampa Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, it's a better team," said Bettis, who was the NFL's No. 2 rusher as 
a rookie last season. "But after what's happened in the preseason, the team 
doesn't have an enormous amount of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, the team's No. 1 draft pick, failed to beat out Clarence Jones at 
left tackle. And the coaching staff named Bill Schultz as starting left guard, 
played him there for the second half of the exhibition season, then cut him as 
preparations began for Sunday's opener. So, Keith Loneker, previously known 
mainly for having a Jayhawk tattoo on his lower leg, is now protecting Miller 
at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows who will start opposite Anderson at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still early yet," Coach Chuck Knox said after the final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams scored three touchdowns in four exhibitions, and their opponents 
completed 66% of their passes, nine for touchdowns. In the first half, when 
most teams match starting units, the Rams were outscored, 65-19. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to play the games that count, and history suggests it will be 
business as usual: The Rams have lost four consecutive openers, including the 
past two by a combined score of 76-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they get Buddy Ryan's blitzing defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about opening at home against the Arizona Cardinals and Buddy 
Ryan, it's a dream come true for this football team," said Joe Vitt, Ram 
assistant head coach. "Everybody thinks we're terrible -- the coaches can't 
coach, the players can't play, the administration doesn't know how to 
administer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't ask for a better scenario than to have Buddy Ryan and his football 
team come in here for the opener. We will line up and play this game the way 
it's supposed to be played. The Cardinals are going to know they have been in a 
football game, and we fully expect to win this football game." 
</P>
<P>
 We fully expect to win this football game?  
</P>
<P>
 After winning only 19 of their last 64 games, how can anyone employed by the 
Rams say such a thing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely no doubts," Vitt said. "Let me tell you something, I feel as good 
about this football team right now as I did six weeks ago when we went to 
training camp fully expecting to be a playoff team. We still believe we're a 
playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to correct our mistakes, play with more poise and more confidence, 
and we will be. Nobody believes that. Everybody is off the bandwagon now except 
for these 10 coaches and the players, but that's fine. We have upgraded our 
personnel, we've worked hard and now it's time to step up and show it." 
QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams might have the best threesome in the NFL in Miller, Chris Chandler 
and Tommy Maddox, and it's a good thing, looking at the offensive line they 
have assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has had a history of knee problems, should complete a high 
percentage of his passes, and has the arm to beat defenses when they creep 
forward to stop Bettis. Chandler has starting experience, and Maddox is the 
Rams' future. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the over-and-under on how many games Miller will start? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Note to T-shirt entrepreneurs in Baltimore or St. Louis -- your 
future quarterback wears No. 8. RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried the ball only 20 times in the exhibition season because of 
Knox's paranoia about getting him hurt, but Bettis hinted that wasn't enough 
work to prepare him for the season.The Rams can't afford a slow start by The 
Franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis wants 2,000 yards and a chance to top the Dallas Cowboys' Emmitt Smith, 
but this year defenses will be gunning for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The team relies so much on Bettis that it made no sense to release Cleveland 
Gary. Who steps in for Bettis if he gets nicked? Howard Griffith and James 
Bostic? Wave the white flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey provides pep on third downs much like Ronnie Harmon does with the San 
Diego Chargers, but someone is going to have to issue super-glue to David Lang 
if they try to put the ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Does Bettis get a chance to top Eric Dickerson's record of 404 
rushing attempts in 1986? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Smith plays for a winner, Bettis doesn't. Smith gets the ball to run 
out the clock, Bettis watches from the sidelines as the Rams throw to catch up. 
RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
 At season's end, everyone will know: Was it Jim Everett? Or was it Anderson's 
fault? Anderson has had three consecutive forgettable seasons, and the Rams 
contend that it's because Everett struggled when throwing the deep ball. 
Miller's strength is the long ball, so Anderson is getting his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the opposition might elect not to cover the Rams' other 
starting wide receiver and to concentrate on Anderson. Best thing that can be 
said about Anderson's running mate is that it will be a warm body. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis no longer wanted Jessie Hester and the Colts do not figure to 
challenge the Buffalo Bills for Super Bowl consideration. Hester, however, 
competes for starting time with Isaac Bruce, the team's No. 2 draft choice, who 
doesn't always run to the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton has shown an ability to save the day, but Ram 
quarterbacks ignored the big target in exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How much of a difference to this team would Haywood Jefferies or 
Alvin Harper have meant? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Don't be surprised if Drayton leads the Rams in receptions. OFFENSIVE 
LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 What do these guys have against Miller? You'd think they were conspiring to 
make Chandler the starting quarterback, but that's Chandler holding his sore 
ribs because these guys can't stop oncoming defenders for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used their first-round pick on Gandy. Why? The tackle looks like a 
guard, plays like an undrafted free agent and is sitting on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Ashmore gets his 117th chance to replace senior citizen Jackie Slater 
at right tackle, and surprise, surprise, Knox says such a move is not etched in 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about scary: Loneker starts at left guard right next to Clarence Jones at 
left tackle, and these two will be responsible for protecting Miller's 
blindside. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the name, rank and serial number of the genius who allowed 
Gerald Perry to defect to the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Tom Newberry has started 114 games for this team and is now deemed 
not good enough to play? DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries sabotaged their performance in exhibition games, but if this group 
fails to unite in fearsome fashion, the Ram defense will collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, Young, Jones and Fred Stokes look like a mighty fine line, but Young, 
coming off knee surgery, had no impact in exhibition play, and Stokes is trying 
to overcome a sore knee. Gilbert suffered an ankle injury, Jones a wrist 
injury. It's time for a visit to Lourdes, because there's nobody on the bench 
to throw a scare into the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: If Knox was so concerned about getting people hurt before the 
season, why was Gilbert, who suffered ankle and knee injuries on the play, 
rushing the quarterback with less than a minute to play in the first half 
against the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: The defense has a chance to keep the Rams in every game, but Young's 
return is essential to that plan. LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer and Conlan should be dependable and successful. Phifer is ready to 
emerge as one of the game's top linebackers, and Conlan still has the speed and 
grit to shut down an opponent's running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly gets the edge on Henry Rolling for left outside linebacker at present, 
but can the Rams afford to keep two veteran outside linebackers -- Rolling and 
Chris Martin -- on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Does anyone really realize just how good Conlan still is? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Rookie Ernest Jones' knee injury leaves the Rams devoid of talented 
youngsters at all three linebacker positions. DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Starting cornerbacks Lyght and Israel have produced expectations of an 0-16 
season. Lyght, who played like a Pro Bowl performer before being hurt last 
year, had no clue in exhibition play. Israel, who has good speed, looked like 
he was in a different area code when covering a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams chose to keep Wymon Henderson and Dexter Davis instead of Darryl 
Henley, which is the plot for a new "Death Wish" sequel. Steve Young passed for 
482 yards against the likes of Henderson and Davis, and Young comes to town 
later in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong safety will be played by committee: Pope and Toby Wright. Anthony 
Newman anchors the defense at free safety, and Keith Lyle offers promise down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: After watching the Rams in exhibition games, do the coaches think 
the opposition might come looking for Lyght? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: One would think these guys were all former soccer players with 
instructions not to use their hands; no one on this team had more than two 
interceptions last season. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey and Lang provide speed on kickoff returns, and Bailey is also a threat 
on punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of Wayne Sevier, one of football's most respected special teams 
coaches, is a positive sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Tony Zendejas, otherwise known as the Ram offense, remains consistent, 
and punter Sean Landeta is a proven contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the NFL record for most penalties called on special teams in 
a given season? 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Whatever it is, the Rams probably won't be denied.

IT'S TRULY HOME AWAY FROM HOME

 WANTED: Stadium on the Westside, 55-60K seats, state-of-the-art amenities, 
ample parking and access. Tenant available. Call Peter Dalis, UCLA, 9 a.m.-5 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 If you build it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't, they will keep going back to the Rose Bowl because it's the only 
place in town for UCLA -- even if it's out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 It's UCLA's own, after a fashion, and 12 years ago it offered a friendly 
alternative to playing third-fiddle at the Coliseum. UCLA offered revenue, 
which Pasadena quickly became accustomed to, turning the most famous stadium in 
the United States from a monument to a profit center. 
</P>
<P>
 The sticking point in the UCLA-Rose Bowl relationship is something no one can 
do anything about: Pasadena likes the stadium right where it is. UCLA would 
prefer to have it located in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, Peter Dalis, the school's athletic director, has talked 
to two groups with designs on a stadium near LAX, but no ground has been 
broken, no paper has been signed and no real hope has arisen for finding a 
place to play football closer to the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Coliseum is closer. No, UCLA doesn't want to play there, but it 
bothers Dalis that every other year, the Bruins play a road game against USC 
that is 10 miles closer to Westwood than UCLA's home stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 25 miles from campus," he said of the Rose Bowl. "We're the only 
university in the United States that has to drive 25 miles to play a home 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Ventura Freeway, Dalis figures, UCLA loses attendance, season 
tickets and anything resembling a home-field advantage for its football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is theirs. The Bruins have played in Pasadena since 1982, after yet 
another bout with the Coliseum Commission convinced them of permanent stepchild 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was increasingly difficult to play Division I-A football there with two 
schools," Dalis said. "When I was a student, one of them sometimes had to play 
on Friday night. People forget that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, I consider the Coliseum on the USC campus." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Rams moved to Anaheim Stadium, UCLA officials figured that the 
Bruins had at least moved up to No. 2, knowing USC would always be No. 1 in the 
hearts, minds and wallets of the Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Raiders moved in, and it was back to No. 3 for UCLA in getting 
Coliseum dates. That served to hasten the Bruins' departure for Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first year, we increased season-ticket sales from 17,000 to 22,000," 
Dalis said. "The advantages to playing in the Rose Bowl are not sharing it with 
anyone else, and it has a grand tradition. It's got very good sight lines. But 
there are disadvantages." 
</P>
<P>
 One is that it has more than 100,000 seats, which makes UCLA football the 
easiest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no incentive to get a ticket early," Dalis said. "Supply and demand 
related to a 100,000-seat stadium is different than with a smaller facility." 
</P>
<P>
 To stimulate ticket demand, UCLA has to supply victories, and when the Bruins 
didn't do so earlier in this decade, demand for tickets waned. Season-ticket 
sales are up 2,000 after a championship season, to about 28,000. Dalis figures 
that an on-campus or a Westside stadium would add thousands to that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave Jacobs isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Southern California are well programmed to travel much greater 
distances than 25 miles for entertainment," the Rose Bowl's general manager 
said. "What we hear is that one of the things UCLA alumni like about our 
facility is that they can come here and tailgate in an area that's as serene 
and beautiful as the Arroyo Seco -- and as safe as the Arroyo Seco." 
</P>
<P>
 The implication that it's safer than South Central Los Angeles and the 
Coliseum is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 After eating off their tailgates in the Arroyo Seco, apparently the alumni 
call Dalis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of complaints from our ticket-holders about getting in and out 
of the place, the restrooms and concession stands," he said. "It's an old 
stadium. The press box is good, but there is no theater-type seating, and 
concession areas and restrooms aren't state of the art." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a 72-year-old stadium, but Pasadena is enjoying a new gold strike. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA moved to the Rose Bowl, the City Council passed the Arroyo Seco 
Ordinance to assure homeowners that their neighborhood stadium wouldn't be 
overused after decades of a New Year's Day bowl game, Thanksgiving Day high 
school game between Pasadena and Muir, the odd Super Bowl and regular swap 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires approval of the homeowners for the Rose Bowl to operate more 
than 12 days a year when attendance at an event will be greater than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, that approval is frequently given. This year, there will be 25 
events, including seven World Cup games, two Rolling Stones concerts, two days 
of Pink Floyd and one of the Eagles. And six UCLA games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, for the first time, revenues were taken from the Rose Bowl account 
to offset expenses city-wide," Jacobs said. "As an example, of the $2 million 
we received for the World Cup, more than $1 million was taken to pay for new 
costs of law enforcement. In the past, we just had to pay for operating 
expenses. Now, we're being looked at as a profit center." 
</P>
<P>
 The profit from UCLA football pales next to that from Pink Floyd and other 
such events. UCLA pays 8% of ticket revenue and 8% of live television, plus a 
fixed sum for expenses, and Dalis estimates that Pasadena will receive between 
$400,000 and $500,000 this season from the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jacobs, the city will realize about $200,000 from UCLA after 
expenses. The net will be $1.5 million to $2 million from the five rock 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pasadena and its still-in-development Rose Bowl Operating Co., a nonprofit 
firm set up to generate a profit for the city, likes the idea of UCLA playing 
in the Rose Bowl. It adds prestige and a consistent source of revenue, and its 
fans rarely cause trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we feel we have an enormous economic impact on the city of Pasadena," 
Dalis said. "Look at the restaurants after a game. It's really difficult to get 
into a restaurant or a bar." 
</P>
<P>
 So, they need each other. Two attempts to get an on-campus stadium failed -- 
in the 1960s and '70s -- and now the cost is prohibitive. Also, homeowners in 
Bel-Air and adjacent affluent communities probably are too powerful to allow 
UCLA to play football in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis' talks with the two Westside stadium groups have gone nowhere, and he 
acknowledges that without an NFL team as its No. 1 tenant, a stadium is 
unlikely to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's contract with the Rose Bowl runs through the 1996 season, and in about 
a year negotiations will begin to extend it. Those talks will probably take on 
a harder line, concerning the profit demands of the city, a more businesslike 
approach to its facility and a new issue: paid parking at the Arroyo Seco. Free 
parking has always been part of the allure of the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis describes UCLA's relationship with Pasadena as increasingly tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I wonder if they really want us there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that the university's demands are increasing, but calls them 
reasonable and said Jacobs works hard to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent move by the Rose Bowl to put a sign on a tarpaulin covering seats 
behind the UCLA bench, making it visible to television cameras, hasn't helped. 
UCLA figures it is due money from the advertising, but the city and the school 
can't agree on the split. Lawyers have been called in to review the contract, 
and Jacobs points out that UCLA displays a sign touting an airline at its 
games, which helps it obtain a discount on charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs describes the relationship with UCLA as good and adds that the Rose 
Bowl is working to meet those increasing demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the bottom line is cutting the best deal for Pasadena," he said. "We 
really have a partnership with UCLA where we try to look out for their needs, 
keeping in mind the responsibility of making the best deal possible for the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis would prefer a partnership with somebody like the Raiders' Al Davis for 
a stadium on the Westside. Until then, he, like others, will pack for the drive 
to Pasadena.

LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL; SWITZER CLAIMS HIS GUN IS LOADED FOR HIS FIRST SEASON 
COACHING THE COWBOYS, BUT WINNING IN NFL MIGHT NOT BE AS EASY AS HE THINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First thing you should understand about this town's newest Cowboy: 
</P>
<P>
 "My gun is loaded," Barry Switzer says, squinting across a cluttered desk. 
"Don't care what you say about me, long as you understand one thing: My gun is 
loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 And the trigger finger twitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you people think it is so daggone hard to learn a pro offense, you people 
drive me crazy," he says, suddenly rising from his chair, his voice hardening 
with every syllable. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goodness, an eighth-grader could learn our plays in just a few days," he 
shouts, stalking around the side of the desk. "Heck, I could teach you our 
offense in three minutes! Three minutes!" 
</P>
<P>
 You rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit down," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 You sit. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now bouncing around a white board that hangs from a wall, filling it 
with X's and O's, scrawling them in blue, speaking as if he is calling signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got the 20 counter . . . the 30 belly . . . the pitch right . . . the 
toss left," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is cradling an imaginary ball one moment. He is juking past an imaginary 
defender the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Time out. He searches for an eraser. Can't find one. Grabs a T-shirt off his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipes out one formation with the shirt. Draws another formation. Calls more 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got the slant right . . . the I-right, tight-end left . . . This is 
mental gymnastics? This is hard?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabs a big blue binder, throws it down on the desk, jerks it open, points 
to a typewritten page listing titles such as Toss Split and Pitch Right. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the revered Cowboy playbook, handed to Switzer this spring after the most 
shocking NFL coaching development in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, architect of consecutive Super Bowl championships, was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, 56, a former college coach who had not set foot on a sideline in five 
years, was in. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, entrusted with leading the Cowboys to a record third consecutive 
Super Bowl title although he had never been closer to the NFL than his living 
room; Switzer, entrusted with America's most popular sports franchise although 
he was ankle-deep in controversy when he left the University of Oklahoma after 
16 raucous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, entrusted with a playbook that he is now promising he can absorb 
simply because, well, anybody can absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that!" he says. "Look down there!" 
</P>
<P>
 You glance at the open page. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Switzer's impossible job really is written in understandable English. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback start. Fullback drive. Fullback belly. Fullback jab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you see what I mean?" he says, softer now, smiling. "Do I make my point?" 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall at the Cowboy training facility, quarterback Troy Aikman is 
asked if he sees what Switzer means. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman sighs. You have heard that sigh before, from a parent who has watched 
his child jump into a puddle of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman has been his new coach's most important advocate in the locker room. 
But at this moment, his eyes are wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's not easy," Aikman says. "And if Barry doesn't know that yet, he'll 
find out soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can believe them both. 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent that despite being out of his league, Barry Switzer is not out 
of his element. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is some question as to how many fourth-and-longs he can handle 
before he goes out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from what has happened since his hiring on March 30, Switzer can 
certainly handle America's most celebrated group of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 If not as coach, then as curator. 
</P>
<P>
 He has wooed the players, charmed the fans, disarmed the media with bluntness, 
and most of all, he has not changed one single thing on the football field . 
</P>
<P>
 Same coaching staff, except for the pre-Switzer substitution of offensive 
coordinator Ernie Zampese for departed Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Same plays. Even the same routines. 
</P>
<P>
 When Switzer scheduled practice in the afternoon of the last day of mini-camp 
this spring, Aikman gently told him that Johnson always ended mini-camp in the 
morning. That way, the rookies still in college could return to their campuses 
for Monday classes. 
</P>
<P>
 So Switzer changed the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the time we meet at the hotel before home games has not changed," 
linebacker Darrin Smith said. "He has told us that it's not his team, it's our 
team, and our team has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, one reason Switzer is succeeding as a head coach is because 
the Cowboys do not yet need a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens when they do? 
</P>
<P>
 What happens when a shy defensive lineman mistakenly touches a blocked field 
goal in the snow on Thanksgiving and this mistake costs the Cowboys a victory 
over the Miami Dolphins? 
</P>
<P>
 Every season has its flash point. This incident marked the Cowboys' crisis of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 How Jimmy Johnson handled it, by publicly supporting Leon Lett while 
challenging the rest of his team to work even harder, will not soon be 
forgotten by the players. They did not lose again. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens when Switzer realizes, as Aikman warned, that these days are 
coming, that it really isn't this easy? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say we know everything is going to be fine all the time, but 
that's not true," Aikman said. "Every season, you reach a tough time. And the 
season hinges on how you deal with that tough time. 
</P>
<P>
 "During those times, Jimmy was always good with knowing what to do and what to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 And under Switzer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not being skeptical here, but when those times hit this year, we're not 
sure what will happen," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Switzer is about as happy as your average middle-aged businessman 
who discovered football's best team in his mailbox one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly unconcerned with his image, on the first day of practice he didn't 
even wear a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 After a month, he was still mispronouncing some of his player's names. 
</P>
<P>
 By the team's fourth exhibition, he was still referring to his days with the 
Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, I challenged my team to give me one more good Wishbone drive," he 
shouted at the news conference after the Cowboys' 34-10 victory over the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 When talking about the Cowboys, Switzer is openly emotional, often raising his 
voice at the most unexpected times. That's not Jimmy Johnson standing back 
there working the volume, is it? 
</P>
<P>
 This emotion also reveals itself in playful slaps and shoves. These have 
included a whomp on the back of owner Jerry Jones last spring that left Jones 
pale and breathless. 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Switzer was trying to knock local TV announcer Dale Hansen to the 
floor during a recent on-air argument. But Switzer, by repeated shoulder slaps, 
says he was just making another point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am who I am," Switzer said. "I don't give a damn what people think about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The average Dallas fan loves it. Except for the cursing, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in here sort of backwood, and talked to us like we haven't been 
talked to before," said Barry McCoy, a professional photographer and lifelong 
Cowboy fan from nearby Duncanville. "But he's losing the rough edges. He only 
cusses one out of every 10 words now. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we don't think he'll have any problem coaching, not with this talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The players like him for a different reason. Unlike Johnson, he doesn't yell 
at them. Doesn't threaten them. Doesn't really do much more than hug them, ask 
about their families, and make them laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Cowboys, used to working more with assistant coaches anyway, think 
Switzer has found a nice home outside the sideline huddles. They hope he stays 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Right now, it doesn't look like Barry will make much of a difference," said 
Michael Irvin, one of Switzer's fiercest critics last spring. "He says, 'I know 
you guys can play, so just play. My assistant coaches will coach. And you just 
play.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Irvin said any fears evaporated when the first team stepped into the same 
huddle for the first time in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked around the huddle and said, 'Hey, I know that guy. And that guy. And 
that guy,' " Irvin said. "I realized that whatever happens on the sidelines, on 
the field it's still most of the same guys who won it the last two years. You 
take comfort in that." 
</P>
<P>
 So, despite last spring's uproar, nothing has changed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say that," Irvin warned. "When's the Super Bowl? On the day after the 
Super Bowl, you come ask me if nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only if we have won again will I say nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, as hard as Switzer works, not until February will he be able 
to claim victory. And even then . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Barry is in a no-win situation," said Don Shula, the Miami Dolphin coach. "If 
the Cowboys win again, it was Jimmy's team. If the Cowboy's lose, it was 
Barry's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 But Switzer will survive, as this bootlegger's son has always survived, by 
being himself and hoping nobody shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not afraid to call female reporters "darlin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He was not afraid to let Irvin, still upset over the loss of Johnson, angrily 
stalk out of their first team meeting last spring. Didn't chase him, didn't 
discipline him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood why he was mad," Switzer said. "I do know players." 
</P>
<P>
 He also was not afraid to acknowledge recently that he had no idea how one of 
his players, linebacker Godfrey Myles, performed in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everyone else, I was watching the ball, not him," Switzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not afraid to defer to his assistant coaches on almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him to evaluate a running back, and he will tell how running backs coach 
Joe Brodsky evaluated the player. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Jimmy never once told me how to coach, Jimmy had a tight grip on 
everything around him," Brodsky said. "Barry is a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer recently stood in front of one of the most football-wise media groups 
in the country -- the Cowboy beat reporters -- and casually mentioned something 
that had been bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me," he said, "does anybody here know whether Texas Stadium runs 
East-West, or North-South?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The question has poked at Cowboy fans since that stunning news conference last 
March when Jerry Jones handed this universe's best football coach $2 million 
and told Jimmy Johnson to hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Why break up a team on the verge of history? 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was asked the question again one recent afternoon. But by then, he 
needed to say nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another speech in the voice of a ringmaster, Switzer had already 
provided the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer had been speaking of the first off-field incident of the season, in 
which Cowboy players complained about the size of their plane during a trip to 
an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 While the opposing Houston Oilers were flown to Mexico City in a 350-seat 
Airbus, the Cowboys were cramped into an undersized 727. 
</P>
<P>
 The players claimed that Jones was being cheap. Switzer discussed it with 
Jones, then claimed that Jones made a simple mistake by not checking the 
aircraft before chartering it. 
</P>
<P>
 He then publicly backed his owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to loyal . . . and I am loyal," Switzer said. "If I need to 
chew out Jerry to protect the players, I'll do that in private. But I will not 
stand up on that airplane and say, 'That damn Jerry! That cheap son of a gun!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't throw the sort of tirade Johnson used to throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do that would have been disloyal, vindictive and irresponsible," Switzer 
said. "And that is exactly why (Johnson) is not here. Not because of all those 
other things you read about, but because he was disloyal." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but players say those tirades against Jones and other "outside" forces 
are what unified the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, some of us thought, this problem with the planes would never happen if 
Jimmy was here," guard Nate Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, of course, was not exactly fired. About the same time Jones was going 
to dump him, he was going to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember those infamous quotes from Jones late one March evening in an Orlando 
bar? Those statements that 500 other coaches could have won the Super Bowl and 
that Johnson should be fired and Switzer hired? 
</P>
<P>
 "That had nothing to do with our decision that we part ways. . . . I had 
already made up my mind to do something," Jones said. "I'd been thinking about 
doing something for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't had our annual meeting yet, when I could discuss it with him. But I 
was making a change." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he heard those barroom words, Johnson had also made up his mind. 
He said he could never coach for a man who gave him such little respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week, five years of sniping and backbiting finally ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson became free to coach for an owner who didn't want to receive at least 
half of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jones became free to seek a coach who would give him some. 
</P>
<P>
 But Switzer? 
</P>
<P>
 After winning three national championships in 16 seasons at Oklahoma, he 
resigned in June of 1989 when it was obvious that his program had collapsed 
into chaos and lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, there was a shooting and a gang rape in the athletic 
dormitory, and starting quarterback Charles Thompson was heading to jail on a 
cocaine rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer separated himself from the program while working at several businesses 
in Oklahoma, but the memories remained. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other reasons the entire NFL gasped at his hiring was the fact that, 
according to court documents, Switzer admitted he had had an affair with the 
former wife of respected Cowboy scouting director Larry Lacewell. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, didn't stop Jones from picking up the phone and calling his 
former coach at Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Jones tells it, Switzer was not merely the best choice, he was the 
only choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike candidates such as Lou Holtz and Mike Ditka, Switzer came without a 
staff, without an entourage and without a chance in the world of ever coaching 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In Switzer, for $1 million a season, he purchased instant loyalty, affection 
and continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 In these turbulent NFL times, it was a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the perfect man for the job," Jones said. "The only man." 
</P>
<P>
 And of his inexperience with the pro game? 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a coach who never thought he would have this chance again, giving him 
a two-time defending Super Bowl champion . . . I think the way Barry has gone 
after this offsets any inexperience," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 His players did not initially agree. Irvin even publicly swore he would never 
play for the new man. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I was saying was, no matter how bad things are between a coach and an 
owner, for the sake of back-to-back championships, you deal with it," Irvin 
said. "We should have been savoring this moment forever!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves were calmed by Aikman, who played briefly for Switzer at Oklahoma 
before suffering a broken leg and transferring to UCLA in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to reports, Switzer did not run him out of town by reneging on a 
promise to change the Wishbone offense to a pro set. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not lie to me," Aikman said. "I knew what kind of coach he was, and I 
was comfortable with him being here." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Jones, as cameras have already caught him and Switzer standing together 
on the sideline late in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 You can guess who was doing all the talking -- the one with all the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this didn't happen with Johnson. In fact, players say Johnson was 
sometimes not much more involved in the actual play-calling than Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet Jimmy couldn't name you five pass plays," Aikman said. "But there was 
nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, until Switzer wins a few games, image is everything.  
</P>
<P>
 That is why Switzer publicly derided Hansen after hearing the sportscaster's 
report, based on unidentified sources, of a power struggle among assistant 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hansen's radio partner, Brad Sham, stood up for Hansen, Sham was fired by 
Jones from his job as the host of Jones' television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what anybody says about me, just don't do it on my time and 
money," Jones said. "What's different about this organization is that it's 
unified." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Johnson watches all of this from his home in the Florida Keys and 
chuckles. This fall, that laugh will be heard by nearly everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will be commenting not only on Fox and HBO television this fall but 
also in a syndicated column in a Dallas newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he simply tells reporters, "With that team he has, Switzer should do 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what the Cowboys' first-string offense produced the first time it 
played together this summer -- a game-opening touchdown drive against Denver 
lasting 10 minutes 26 seconds -- it appears Johnson is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin acknowledged later that he and some teammates were inspired by a pep 
talk before the Bronco game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told that hey, for a lot of us, this could be our last year 
together," Irvin said. "We were reminded that this could be our last chance to 
be really great. It was a great talk, really made you think." 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a speech by . . . Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 What the heck. It's early, and the newest Cowboy still has several rounds on 
his hip.

DISNEYLAND SHUTS DOOR ON PIGSKIN RIDE; FOOTBALL: WITH CONTRACT EXPIRED, COMPANY 
SAYS IT WILL NOT RENEW ITS SPONSORSHIP OF THE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The end has been expected for several weeks, and Disneyland made it official 
Tuesday, announcing it will not renew its sponsorship of the Pigskin Classic at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's five-year, $5-million sponsorship contract expired after Monday 
night's game, in which Ohio State beat Fresno State, 34-10. The attendance of 
28,513 was the lowest in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disneyland has been proud to have created and presented five years of 
outstanding college football to fans in Southern California and to a national 
television audience," Jack Lindquist, retired president of Disneyland and 
creator of the event, said in a prepared statement. "Our decision to no longer 
present the Disneyland Pigskin Classic is in no way an indication by Disney to 
withdraw from collegiate athletics, but, rather, a change in strategic 
direction. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the Pigskin Classic can find new sponsorship, and can remain in 
Anaheim Stadium and continue to build on the tradition that has been 
established." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., said he 
was disappointed by the decision, but it wasn't a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "But from their (Disney's) standpoint, you can understand it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindquist said the company is planning a week-long event that would be called 
the Disneyland Classic, a festival that would "celebrate excellence in 
academics, arts and athletics" in colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement, he said the company is hopeful of starting the event in 
Orange County in December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's announcement indicated that the National Assn. of Collegiate 
Directors of Athletics and the American Football Coaches Assn. will attempt to 
keep the game alive. Mike Cleary, executive director of the athletic directors 
group, said in the announcement that his group will seek to continue the game 
"at a new venue with a new sponsor next August." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen believes that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't talked to anyone about it, but if it has not succeeded to the 
point that was satisfactory to Disney, it's doubtful that another sponsor will 
step forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event has been known for some attractive matchups, but the top attendance 
was 49,309 in 1993 for the North Carolina-USC game. The Florida State-Brigham 
Young game in 1991 drew the next biggest crowd at 38,363. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to create a good event," Andersen said, "and it's just 
unfortunate that it didn't catch on."

A NATION PINS ITS TITLE HOPES ON DAVENPORT; TENNIS: HIGHEST-SEEDED AMERICAN 
WOMAN IS 6-1, 6-1 FIRST-ROUND WINNER OVER MARIA GROSSI OF ITALY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the moment, the future of women's tennis in the United States is an 
18-year-old who stands 6 foot 2, hits tennis balls like Babe Ruth used to hit 
baseballs and is feeling a bit out of sorts because some of her recently 
graduated high school friends have just headed off to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Lindsay Davenport of Murrieta, Calif., the highest-seeded American woman 
in this year's U.S. Open draw at No. 6, and the possible heir to all the fame, 
fortune and foolishness that comes with that territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Davenport is today there once was: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Martina Navratilova, currently ranked No. 4 but not even playing in the 
U.S. Open this year and within months of ending her masterful 21-year singles 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Monica Seles, No. 1 until the stabbing incident in April 1993 that has 
placed her career in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jennifer Capriati, a Wimbledon semifinalist at 15, an Olympic gold medalist 
at 16 and a possible burnout victim at 18. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Others such as Mary Joe Fernandez, Zina Garrison Jackson and Lori McNeil, 
each never quite sustaining the success it takes to be this country's 
fair-haired girl. 
</P>
<P>
 While age and defections have played a huge role in the quick emergence of 
Davenport, her physically imposing game might have been enough to get there, 
anyway. In her first-round match, she handled Italian Maria Grossi, a 
low-ranking player and a first-time entrant in the U.S. Open. The score was 
6-1, 6-1, and the match was so one-sided that Davenport hit 23 winners to four 
for Grossi and converted all six of her break-point opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport's first serve hovered in the 100-m.p.h. range, and her ground 
strokes, struck with the power of many of her male counterparts on the pro 
tour, landed consistently deep in her opponent's court. If the WTA kept a 
slugging percentage category as in baseball, Davenport would lead it. 
</P>
<P>
 After dispatching Grossi in 44 minutes, Davenport said she was happy to get 
the first match behind her because it is always a nervous moment in Grand Slam 
tournaments, and she showed that she has a sense for where she is, even though 
it happens to be only two years removed from her high school tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the highest American seed, so it is a little bit more pressure than 
before, because last year, I wasn't even seeded here," she said. "So I don't 
think the public necessarily expects me to win because I'm still pretty new." 
</P>
<P>
 Public patience for sports heroes is not always a safe bet. There are always 
those who look ahead on the draw sheet, and a peek at Davenport's path shows a 
quarterfinal meeting with Steffi Graf. Davenport peeked, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing well right now," she said, "and if I keep going through the 
rounds, then, obviously, I'd love to play Graf." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport remains somewhat amazed at even being able to talk and think about 
things such as showdowns with the likes of Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy how far I've come in a year or two," Davenport said. "I 
never thought I'd break the top 10, and then all the way to No. 6 so fast. So I 
don't know what to say where I want to be next year, because this is a great 
position to be in now." 
</P>
<P>
 The fast rise doesn't mean she doesn't occasionally look back at what she gave 
up. A June graduate of Murrieta Valley High, she regrets that life as a tennis 
pro means no life as a college student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fine with (turning pro) for two years," she said, "but then, this past 
summer all my friends are entering college and three of my friends moved in 
this week, so, now it's like, kind of, I'm here and they're there, and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 For American tennis boosters, heartened last year when Davenport made it to 
the fourth round, the question is whether she will be at the U.S. Open long 
enough to contend for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the women have three or four good bets that are probably going to be 
there," she said, "plus a couple of floaters. I consider myself a floater." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, U.S. tennis fans consider her Miss America.

ANOTHER RAM FAILURE: COMMUNICATION; GARY IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN CUT FOR MAKING 
EARLY EXIT -- BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ram decision to release running back Cleveland Gary on Sunday was affected 
by his halftime departure from Thursday night's exhibition against the San 
Diego Chargers, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently unbeknown to the Rams, however, Gary was ill Thursday evening, and, 
after suffering for four days, he underwent an emergency appendectomy Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, who remains hospitalized in Miami, chose not to tell Ram coaches about 
his illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox, through a spokesman, said the early departure had nothing to 
do with the decision to cut Gary. However, the subject did come up during 
Gary's exit interview. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rams' surprise announcement that Gary had been cut, the Dallas 
Cowboys immediately expressed interest and offered him a contract. They were 
unaware of his condition Monday night until advised by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm bummed out," said Gary, who is expected to be sidelined for 
four to six weeks. "Without a doubt, had this not happened, I would have worked 
something out with Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had never mentioned any displeasure with Gary's performance before 
his release, and had talked about his value as a reliable backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened, at the very least now there's an understanding why 
Cleveland had to leave the game early," said Steve Feldman, Gary's agent. "He 
told me he was in excruciating pain Thursday night, and he was already out of 
uniform because of a shoulder injury. He just wanted to get to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox had ordered the team's injured players to attend Thursday's game in San 
Diego. On the ride to San Diego, Gary said he became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary," Gary said. "The pain was horrible. I just wanted to go home. . 
. . I'm a team player all the way, and I wouldn't walk out on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to make cuts Sunday, Gary's departure became a factor, 
sources said. The coaches decided they had to crack down, and with so much 
criticism surrounding the team, they wanted to make the point that they were 
all in this together -- with the exception of one player who had chosen to 
leave early. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams cut Gary, and said publicly they were doing so because of economics 
-- his $500,000 salary -- and because of his inability to contribute on special 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams kept rookie James Bostic in place of Gary, and the coaches had 
talked freely about Bostic's poor play. They also kept seldom-used Howard 
Griffith, and indicated that if Bettis became injured, they would begin a 
search elsewhere for his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a horrible weekend," Feldman said. "It's fortunate he went to 
the doctor Monday . . . his doctor said if he had waited one more day, his 
appendix would have burst."

PREP FOOTBALL '94: FREEWAY LEAGUE; TROY'S HEATON HAS THAT KILLER INSTINCT; 
FOOTBALL: THE THRILL OF THE HIT IS THE FUN PART FOR DEFENSIVE END, WHO HOPES TO 
LEAD TEAM TO ANOTHER LEAGUE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After talking with Troy defensive end Willie Heaton, one would think he was 
fresh off the set of the latest Oliver Stone film, "Natural Born Killers." But 
don't be alarmed. The 6-foot-2, 240-pounder saves his killing instincts for the 
playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to hit people," Heaton said. "Playing football, especially defense, is 
a completely different mentality than other sports. It's a team effort, but to 
go one-on-one and make a good hit, that's the fun part." 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton, 17, a senior who was a first-team All-Freeway League selection last 
year, is counting the hours before he can start the mayhem and chaos. During 
the off-season he has been busy preparing. Like working on his speed -- he was 
clocked last spring at 5.0 in the 40-yard dash -- and lifting weights. Heaton 
is bench-pressing 315 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing a lot of stuff for my speed, and I've put on weight, which I 
think will help me at the position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Turek called Heaton one of his key players on defense and thinks he 
will have a great year. "Willie has set his goals high and he wants to continue 
to play in college," Turek said. "He's put on 25 to 30 pounds during the 
off-season and he has increased his strength tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Turek added that Heaton worked out with sprinters on the track team last 
spring to help increase his speed. "He was out there every day working with the 
sprinters. He is very motivated to have a good year and he has worked hard.3 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Heaton played linebacker and had a lot of fun at the position. 
But he's having the time of his life since becoming a defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of freedom at this position. And I get to go head-to-head with 
someone every game and battle it out," he said. "At the end of the game we 
shake hands and we're friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton said football helps him release his energy and aggression. And after a 
hard day at school, he said there is no better way to relieve the tension than 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 3.4 grade-point average and courses in honors physics and trigonometry, 
it's easy to see why Heaton becomes frustrated with those who may stereotype 
him as a "dumb football player." 
</P>
<P>
 "Academics have always been on top; sports is secondary," he said. "I don't 
understand people like that (who stereotype). They make judgments about all 
football players. It bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the moment, he has no time to bother with what people think of him. For 
Heaton, his focus is on the upcoming season. He thinks the Warriors have a good 
group of guys, a lot of returning players and lots of drive and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton has the interest of Colorado and Arizona State. Those are great 
schools, he said, but if he had his druthers, he would go to West Point. 
"That's where I would like to go, and I'm preparing now to see if I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton, who lives with his father, Bill, said his dad's attitude about 
football has been a big factor in his love of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen fathers . . . who make their sons dread playing the game," Heaton 
said. "My dad is not like that. He doesn't pressure me. He tells me if you 
don't play football that's OK. And that has been my philosophy pretty much 
throughout my playing career." 
</P>
<P>
 While Heaton loves the game and is looking forward to playing in college if he 
gets the chance, he has no illusions about making it to the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really have a lot of fun playing the game," Heaton said. "But when it's 
time to move on, I won't have a problem with that."

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; NATIONAL FOOTBALL CONFERENCE

<P>
 New faces, new systems, new hopes ... and still the same old question: How is 
anybody gong to keep the Cowboys or 49ers out of the Big One? EASTERN DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS COWBOYS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 12-4, Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 12-4, lose to Green Bay Packers in conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: The offense, like everything else on the team, has remained 
untouched by Barry Switzer. With the replacement of guard Kevin Gogan by Derek 
Kennard, the offensive line is even better. The first time the first-team 
offense was together this summer, they drove the ball for more than 10 minutes 
to score against the Denver Broncos. That was no fluke--Troy and Emmitt and 
Michael and Alvin will be household names once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: How about them linebackers? Dixon Edwards, Godfrey Myles and 
Darrin Smith, all young and fast, could be out of control during crunch time 
without the leadership of Ken Norton Jr. The defensive line will also miss the 
depth provided by Jimmie Jones and Tony Casillas. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Emmitt Smith averaged 4.1 yards a carry in the first quarter last 
year . . . and 6.3 yards a carry in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA EAGLES 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 10-6, lose to Minnesota Vikings in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Randall Cunningham promises to be as unpredictable as ever, 
which, if he stays sound, should make him better than ever. Few quarterbacks 
have an offensive line this big--four of the five are 295 pounds or more--and 
two receivers as accomplished as Fred Barnett and Calvin Williams. The Eagles 
tried to trade Cunningham in the off-season. He responded by showing up this 
summer wearing a T-shirt reading, "Dangerously Committed.' Officials hope that 
for once, he practices what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Herschel Walker scored a career-low four touchdowns last season 
despite 1,356 total yards. Is it really possible he is 32? 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Last season, the defense recorded just 36 sacks, the Eagles' 
lowest total in 14 years. What is 36 minus Seth Joyner and Clyde Simmons? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ARIZONA CARDINALS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 10-6, lose to Packers in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: It may take them six games to hone Coach Buddy Ryan's defense--a 
loss to the Rams in the opener should not surprise--but then watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner, Simmons and Wilber Marshall--all Buddy disciples--will help make an 
All-Pro out of Eric Swann, and an all-rookie out of Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Ryan will lead the league in all-mouth. Is there anybody in this 
league he hasn't yet referred to as 'stupid?' 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Quarterback Steve Beuerlein has survived the pressure of Dallas 
and the wrath of Al Davis. None of that can prepare him for the glare of Jim 
McMahon, the only backup quarterback in the league who holds his own weekly 
news conferences. Ryan likes McMahon, which means Beuerlein has about six weeks 
to become the league's leading passer before he is benched. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: The Cardinals attempted to trade for Joe Montana before signing 
Beuerlein last year, but guess who ended up playing better in critical 
situations? Beuerlein threw for five fourth-quarter touchdowns and completed 
60.2% of his fourth-quarter throws. Montana did not throw for a fourth-quarter 
score and completed 54.3% of his passes in that period.

 NEW YORK GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 11-5, lost to San Francisco 49ers in conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: We like running back Rodney Hampton, the first player in 
franchise history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in three consecutive years 
despite playing a full season just once during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 We like receiver Mike Sherrard if he stays sound for 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 And we like that Lawrence Taylor is no longer moping around, talking about his 
golf game. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: The first pass thrown by opening-day starter Dave Brown will be 
the eighth of his three-year career. His first touchdown pass will be the first 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe Phil Simms would not have been strong enough to start the season. It 
sure would have been nice to have him standing over there while Brown learns on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: On the strong back of Hampton, the Giants held the ball an average 
of 32:18 each game last season, best in the league. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON REDSKINS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: With Pro Bowl-tackle Jim Lachey returning after missing all of 
last season because of a knee injury, life is even better for Reggie Brooks, 
who stunned the league as a rookie with 1,063 yards and a 4.8-yard average. 
Linebacker Ken Harvey, formerly a Cardinal, makes an aging and average defense 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Rookie quarterback Heath Shuler, the third pick in this spring's 
draft, is in for a royal beating. Not only will he have to face the furious 
pass rushes of NFC East teams in half of his games, but his choice of receivers 
is between Heisman flop Desmond Howard (26 catches in two years) and Ram 
refugee Henry Ellard (eight touchdown catches in the last three years). 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: The Redskins completed just five of 63 passes longer than 20 yards 
last season, a league-low 7.9%. The league average was 28.5%. WESTERN DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 
</P>
<P>
 Last year: 10-6, lost to Cowboys in NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 This year: 14-2, defeat Vikings in conference semifinals, defeat Cowboys in 
conference championship game, defeat Raiders in Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Everything. Everybody. From Steve Young, whose has lead the 
league in quarterback rating for a record three consecutive seasons, to Doug 
Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brien? He's the kid kicker drafted in the third round from California, 
and the only guy we saw during the preseason--and this inludes all of those 
Morten Andersen clones--who could consistently kickoff into the end zone while 
remaining accurate on field goals. With two exceptions, the entire offense is 
back. The newcomers are one of the smartest centers in league history, lawyer 
Bart Oates, and the new Tom Rathman, a rookie fullback named William Floyd. You 
know about all the changes on defense, except for perhaps the most important 
one--defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who returns from the Packers after 
coaching with the 49ers during their glory decade of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: They have a distracting schedule and a potentially disruptive 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 On that schedule is a season-opening Monday night game against the Raiders and 
a game the next week in Kansas City against Joe Montana. By the time they visit 
the Rams on Sept. 18, they could already be emotionally wiped out. The locker 
room is also strange. So many leaders, so many big mouths, from Ken Norton Jr. 
to Gary Plummer to Tim McDonald. What happens when they start yelling at each 
other? And that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Opponents blitzed Young six or more times in four games last 
season. The 49ers lost three of those games. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 LOS ANGELES RAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: The last three franchises to change cities--the Raiders, the 
Cardinals and the Colts--each won seven games in the final season at its former 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA FALCONS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Well, it's nice to listen to a Falcon coach who doesn't sound 
like a former cast member of Hee Haw. We wish June Jones well, and wonder how 
long it will take for Jerry Glanville to start ripping him on Fox. And even 
though new quarterback Jeff George loosely compared himself to Jesus during his 
first news conference as a Falcon, we think his selfishness is finally eroding 
in a new enviroment. Few in the league have a better arm and better vision. 
After just two weeks, he will have shown why the Indianapolis Colts tried so 
desparately to keep him happy. On the defensive line, Chris Doleman joins a 
more comfortable Pierce Holt and one of the league's most underrated 
run-stoppers, Moe Gardner. In the secondary, Kevin Ross (formerly with the 
Kansas City Chiefs) and D.J. Johnson (formerly with the Pittsburgh Steelers) 
add to the rising star of safety Roger Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: We don't believe running back Erric Pegram, 5-feet-9 and 188 
pounds, will be able to repeat last season's 1,185-yard heroics. With no 
Michael Haynes, receiver Andre Rison will not be able to repeat his 
15-touchdown heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Seventeen running backs scored more rushing touchdowns last season 
than the entire Falcon team, which scored four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Jim Everett in something other than blue and gold. Rookie 
running back Mario Bates in an NFL backfield. Michael Haynes going deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: The news conference will take place at the Saints' office sometime 
in late December. Owner Tom Benson will openly weep, saying he feels like he is 
losing a son. But he will fire Jim Mora anyway. Previously a victim of teams 
that quit during crunch time, Mora's nine-year tenure will finally end under a 
rush of players running out the door before the season starts. Free agency and 
the salary cap have stripped him of a solid defensive nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Mora will unfortunately not be remembered for leading the Saints 
into the playoffs in four of eight years . . . but for never winning a playoff 
game. CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN BAY PACKERS. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 9-7, lost to Cowboys in conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 12-4, defeat Cardinals in wild-card playoff, defeat Cowboys in 
conference semifinals, lose to 49ers in conference championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Most of the team's best players are in their prime. Quarterback 
Brett Favre, despite his mistakes, has thrown for more touchdowns and yardage 
in each of the last two years. Receiver Sterling Sharpe has caught more than 
100 passes for a league-record two consecutive years--and 24 touchdown passes 
in the last two seasons after catching 24 in his first four seasons. Reggie 
White and newcomers Steve McMichael and Sean Jones form one of the league's 
best defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Where have you gone, Terdell Middleton? The Packers have not had a 
1,000-yard rusher in 16 years. They signed Reggie Cobb from the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers this spring, hoping he would end that drought, but leg injuries last 
year have apparently cost him a step. They drafted Notre Dame guard Aaron 
Taylor in hopes that he could open the holes, but Taylor has already suffered a 
season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: In the last two years, when Brett Favre has committed fewer than 
two turnovers a game, the Packers are 12-3. In his mistake-filled games, they 
are 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MINNESOTA VIKINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year:: 9-7, lost to Giants in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 9-7, defeat Eagles in wild-card playoff, lose to 49ers in 
conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: After missing a year because of his second major knee surgery, 
Terry Allen has stormed back, rushing for 68 yards in 11 carries against the 
Miami Dolphins in the final exhibition game. With an improved offensive line 
led by a Chris Hinton, a Pro Bowler with the Atlanta Falcons, and steady 
Randall McDaniel, the holes should be bigger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: How well can aging Warren Moon adjust to a new offense and new 
conference distinctly lacking any team that resembles the Cincinnati Bengals? 
Pro Bowl receiver Cris Carter will need to be even more spectacular. And the 
brutal rushing defense that allowed the fewest passing touchdowns in the NFL 
last season suddenly looks beatable. There was the trade of Pro Bowl lineman 
Chris Doleman to the Falcons, which will hurt no matter what fans of John 
Randle and Henry Thomas say. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: A Viking booster club kickoff luncheon was held this summer amid 
falling ticket sales and growing skepticism. As either a tribute to Warren 
Moon, or an omen for everyone else, the affair was sponsored by Advil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO BEARS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Yes, we know that 26 quarterbacks threw more passes last season 
than quarterback Erik Kramer has thrown in the last two seasons combined. No, 
that doesn't sound like a proper resume for a guy who was paid millions to make 
the Bears care about January again. But Kramer has proven, by leading two 
late-season charges in the last three seasons for the Detroit Lions, that he 
knows how to win when it counts. And yes, we know that Richard Dent and Steve 
McMichael have skipped town. But any defense of Coach Dave Wannstedt's is good 
enough for us, especially with two of the game's unknown stars, defensive end 
Trace Armstrong and cornerback Donnell Woolford. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: How bad are the receivers, who contributed to a passing game that 
was ranked last in the league last season? The Bears attempted to upgrade it 
with acquisitions from the Pittsburgh Steelers (Merril Hoge and Jeff Graham), 
New England Patriots (Marv Cook) and Rams (Nate Lewis and Greg McMurtry). Last 
year, none of those teams ranked higher than 12th in passing. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: Last year's Bear defense scored 24 points, two more than the 
franchise's record-setting defense scored during the Super Bowl championship 
season of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS 
</P>
<P>
 Last Year: 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 This Year: 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: Fantasy league players would have a late-round steal in Jackie 
Harris, the former Packer tight end who used free agency to join a coach who 
likes tight ends like no other. Harris could catch 70 passes this season. It 
would nicely complement one of the game's top young wide receivers, Horace 
Copeland, who averaged 21.1 yards a catch last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both could be an even nicer complement to rookie running back Errict Rhett, 
who might run hard enough to make those hot September afternoons at Tampa 
Stadium bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Forget even those 3,054 yards and 18 touchdown passes. The 
Buccaneers cannot win with Craig Erickson at quarterback. He was the league's 
lowest-rated veteran quarterback (66.4 last year) to keep his starting job. If 
only rookie quarterback Trent Dilfer had bothered to show up at training camp 
on time. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: The Buccaneers have thrown more interceptions than any other team 
in four of the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT LIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Last year: 10-6, lost to Packers in wild-card playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 This year: 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: The last time we saw Barry Sanders, he was rushing for 169 yards 
in a 28-24 loss to the Packers in the wild-card game on Jan. 8. Not bad, 
considering it was his first game since Thanksgiving. Knee injuries, like 
tacklers, can only slow Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Look: Facing the league's second-toughest schedule, this is the year the 
Lions are finally exposed for what they are: Nice guys who can finish last. We 
like Coach Wayne Fontes, but he may not last until December. We like the idea 
of quarterback Scott Mitchell taking advantage of free agency to emerge from 
Miami, but we don't like him under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It Figures: The best middle linebacker in football? Playing the middle in a 
4-3 defense last season, Chris Spielman recorded more than half of his 149 
tackles away from the center of the field. This includes 39 tackles on passing 
plays in other defenders' zones.

RISING ABOVE IT ALL; GREEN VALLEY LAKE OFFERS CIVILIZED OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE 
THANKS IN PART TO THE "ADMIRAL" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Allison interrupts himself in mid-sentence to exclaim, "Oh, my gosh, we've 
got a swimmer in the lake!" 
</P>
<P>
 He picks up a megaphone and aims it across the lake. "Sorry, no swimming in 
that part of the lake," he barks. 
</P>
<P>
 The swimmer meekly leaves the water. Allison runs a tight ship, which might be 
why the locals nicknamed him "Admiral" when he took over the rental-boat 
concession in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison's domain lies before him: a tiny jewel of an alpine lake set in a pine 
forest, where the standards are trophy-size trout and a civilized outdoor 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no trash, no graffiti, no swearing, no loud radios, no rowdy 
behavior," Allison says, "and if anyone doesn't like the rules, we tell 'em how 
to get to Big Bear." 
</P>
<P>
 The Admiral's code of conduct is meant to make fishing at Green Valley Lake a 
pleasant experience. On the lake there are no conflicts among fishermen, water 
skiers and jet skiers because no motors are allowed. Nobody seems in a hurry. 
Even when you troll, you row. Noise and other annoyances are left in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6,800 feet, Green Valley Lake is above all that, situated four miles off 
California 18, which reaches Big Bear Lake 17 miles farther along in the San 
Bernardino Mountains. There's home cooking at a couple of small restaurants and 
a large U.S. Forest Service campground a mile past the lake, but the nearest 
motels are in Running Springs -- although about half of the several hundred 
private cabins hidden back from the lake seem to be for rent or for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only about 300 year-round residents. Most visitors come for the 
fishing, which Allison has enhanced the last three years by augmenting 
California Department of Fish and Game plants with stocks of larger trout from 
a private hatchery. The lake record is 13.52 pounds, caught on July 8 by Tom 
Herrera of San Fernando, using green Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from fishing, the highlight of the year is coming up this Labor Day 
weekend: the three-day, 56th annual Water Carnival, featuring "fun for the 
whole family," according to a flier. Activities will include a volleyball 
tournament and rowboat, paddleboard, sailboat and swimming races -- the latter 
all the way from the dam to the swim raft near the opposite end . . . about 300 
yards. Green Valley Lake isn't very big. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's part of the beauty of it. In the crisp, still mountain air, you can 
carry on a conversation with someone on the other side. Shore fishermen cast 
halfway across in places. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison, who is single, moved to the lake in 1976 from Inglewood, where he 
worked at a treatment center for emotionally disturbed children, seven days on 
and seven days off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved the mountains," he says. "I came here looking for a place (to live), 
figuringI could live here on my weeks off." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he heard that the lake concession was for sale and he bought it, with the 
approval of the 1,500 shareholders of the Green Valley Mutual Water Co. The dam 
was built in 1928 to create the lake solely for recreation. No water is taken 
for irrigation or domestic use, and most of the loss by evaporation is 
replenished by springs on the bottom, so the water level normally doesn't vary 
more than a couple of feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the drought, it was low, but this is such a small lake that the runoff 
from about a three-foot snowfall in the winter will darn near fill it," Allison 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Valley Lake's surface covers 10 acres. Jerry Eaker figures it's about a 
mile around. He knows because he walks it three or four times a day collecting 
daily fishing fees from shore anglers: $4 each, $2 for those younger than 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only the lake but life at Green Valley is so compact that sometimes it 
feels like a sitcom. Eaker -- tall, lanky, amiable and earnest -- could be 
George Utley, Bob Newhart's handyman at the Stratford Inn, ambling along the 
shore with his change apron, greeting anglers and stamping wrists with the 
color of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry's my right-hand man," says Allison. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a teen-age interest: local resident Susan Casner, 16, who 
followed an older sister into her summertime job renting boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaker came to Green Valley Lake in 1985 after 17 years as a civilian employee 
at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, where he specialized in military electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good job, but I was getting too sick," Eaker says. "I think it was 
the exposure to the sidestream tobacco smoke. There was a lot of smoking in all 
of the buildings. So I left there, came up here, and have felt a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison adds: "If we could get away with it, I would make this a no-smoking 
lake too." 
</P>
<P>
 When Allison bought the operation, it consisted of a few rowboats and 
paddleboards. He replaced all the wooden boats with aluminum ones and added 
kayaks, canoes and pedal boats. Fishing was $1. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Allison checked into the economics of a trout augmentation program. 
The fish cost slightly more than $2 a pound, but he thought it might work if 
the traffic would bear a fee hike to $4. The attraction of fish larger than the 
half-pounders provided by the DFG seems to work. Anglers line the shore daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison buys the oversize fish from the Whitewater hatchery near Palm Springs. 
At first, the problem was that the hatchery would deliver only a minimum of 
1,000 pounds per trip -- too many fish for the small lake to accommodate at one 
time. So Allison and Eaker built their own fish tank on a trailer, and every 
week or two, they hitch it to Allison's pickup truck and go down the hill to 
get several hundred pounds of trout. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish run from two to three pounds, with a few 10 pounds or larger. Allison 
and Eaker seem to be able to distinguish them from the DFG planters. 
</P>
<P>
 "State stocker," Eaker sniffs as an angler nets a pan-sized catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison's permit from the DFG requires him to match the state plants, pound 
for pound, but he exceeded that last year, as he will this year, with perhaps 
11,000 pounds. The DFG also demands a quality environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to provide so many bathroom facilities, do a trash pickup, keep the 
roads graded and the parking areas in decent shape," Allison says. "You have to 
keep the lake somewhat free of algae and weeds . . . keep the clarity there. 
The money that comes in from those (extra) fees helps to offset those costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The anglers don't complain about the $4 fee. Much. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaker says: "I get a fair number of people telling me, 'Oh, I didn't know 
that' -- and most of 'em really do. It's posted all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a perfect world, even at Green Valley Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a big pain in the butt over there . . . the (swim) beach," Allison 
said, nodding toward the upper end to his right. "A lot of parents just bring 
their kids down and dump 'em out the door, and they're the ones that give the 
lifeguards the biggest headaches." 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he also has to hire lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making this place go is a heck of a lot of work," Eaker says. "Jim works 
seven days a week during the season, and he's working 10 or 12 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaker works six days. The season opens when the ice thaws, usually in April. 
After Labor Day and through the end of the season, it will usually be only 
Allison and Eaker staying on to take care of the hard-core anglers who pursue 
the big trout until, as Allison says, "the first snow flies. There's so much 
labor cost in the summer that you have a better chance to make a buck after the 
beach closes and the kids go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they stayed open until Dec. 5, when they had to close fishing only 
because the lake started to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 As fall approaches, Allison says: "It's been a wonderful 18 years," but with 
the lack of free time and the aggravations that go with any business, he is 
thinking about selling out.

NORTHRIDGE PREDECESSORS RELIVE THEIR HALCYON DAYS

 Ten years removed from the Little League World Series, Craig Stevenson was in 
uniform and jogging in the outfield of a minor-league ballpark in 1985 when he 
noticed that a player from the other team was giving him a funny look. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson didn't think much of it initially but when their paths again crossed 
near the warning track, the player began an unsolicited question-and-answer 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "You Craig Stevenson?" asked the player, who received an answer in the 
affirmative. "From Northridge Little League?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-huh. Why?" Stevenson said, cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Dion Lowe," the player said, extending a hand. "We played against each 
other in the (Little League World) Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe low-bridged Stevenson with a blast from the past. This sort of 
reminiscence hasn't exactly been rare over the past couple of weeks, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson and many of his mates from the 1975 Northridge Series entry, as well 
as the members of the 1967 team that advanced to Williamsport, Pa., have 
experienced a flood of nostalgia as the 1994 Northridge all-stars won the 
national championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like every five or six years there's something to stir up the 
memories," said Stevenson, 31, an air-traffic controller who lives in Saugus. 
"But nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
 As players on the '94 team embark this week on a victory tour that will 
include limousine rides, parades, mayoral proclamations and a television blitz, 
their Northridge predecessors are reliving their own moment in the sun. 
Vicariously and, generally, in private. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 team is the third from Northridge to advance to the World Series, a 
first for any league in the Western Region. While the pomp and circumstance 
associated with the first two series teams wasn't as great -- there were no 
earthquakes of significance or major league strikes in 1967 or '75 -- in many 
respects the ride was just as wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no household has been affected by the 1994 run to glory as the Wold 
abode in Northridge. Steve Wold was the team's top pitcher in 1967 and his 
father, Glen, was manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve coached the Northridge all-stars last summer, a team that included 1994 
standouts Justin Gentile, Nathaniel Dunlap, Matt Fisher and Matt Cunningham. As 
this year's team climbed the series ladder, the memories came flooding back to 
Steve. The entire Wold household heard of Steve's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "He remembers every pitch (from the '67 Series)," said Greg Wold, a sophomore 
at Chatsworth High and Steve's son. "He remembers every hit. It's all he's 
talked about for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my Little League coach and he told us all about it then. " 
</P>
<P>
 Way back when, the die was cast. Northridge lost in its '67 Series opener -- a 
feat matched by the two teams to follow. In 1967 and '75, however, the Series 
was a single-elimination affair, which meant that championship aspirations were 
history, consolation-bracket games notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 With Steve Wold on the hill, Northridge '67 lost in the series opener to 
Mexico, 1-0. Mexico scored a run with two out in the top of the sixth and final 
inning. Northridge couldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico used a pitcher who was old enough to shave, team members recalled. The 
pitcher looked 17, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal. A few Northridge guys were 100 -- at least in terms of body 
temperature. A handful of players, including stars Wold and future major 
leaguer Bobby Mitchell, went to the facility's infirmary for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 All through the playoffs, Manager Glen Wold had forbidden his players from 
going swimming. After winning the regional in Inglewood, he relented and kids 
hopped into the hotel pool. A few hours later, at midnight, players boarded a 
plane to Pennsylvania and the air conditioning gave many the sniffles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," said Coach Bob Mitchell, Bobby's father. "It was awfully 
muggy and damp there. Having (the flu) only made it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Mexican pitcher in '67 seemed tough, Lowe was even nastier on the mound 
eight years later. Lowe, pitching for Lakewood, N.J., hooked up in a memorable 
duel with Stevenson that went into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge shortstop and leadoff man Eric Davis -- an appropriate name for a 
player on a team nicknamed the Little Red Machine -- watched three Lowe 
fastballs fly past for a strikeout. His teammates pumped him for information 
when he trudged back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's he throwing?" they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 " Reeeal hard," Davis said, breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, who struck out 15 and later played at USC, sensed he was in trouble 
right away. Realizing he couldn't overpower the New Jersey hitters, Stevenson 
switched to off-speed stuff to survive. He compared his plan of attack to the 
one chosen by the crafty Gentile in the 4-3 loss to Venezuela in Saturday's 
World Series final. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals characterized the Northridge-New Jersey opener as one of the best in 
Series history. The high-anxiety game was scoreless after six innings. Each 
team waited for the other to blink. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey, which later won the World Series title, finally broke through with 
a pair of unearned runs in the seventh to win, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Before thousands of boisterous fans, many rooting for New Jersey, Northridge 
never got its offense in gear. Players were distracted by the raucous crowd, 
Coach Barry Breen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breen, who this week thumbed through a team yearbook issued after the World 
Series, recounted the fateful play-by-play account of the New Jersey rally, 
which was aided by a couple of defensive lapses. There was palpable pain in his 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reliving it," said Breen, 49, who lives in Tehachapi. "I never thought 
I'd have to go through it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Breen is as gung-ho as it gets. He attended the '94 World Series by 
somehow finagling a press credential through a Tehachapi newspaper. He works at 
Edwards Air Force Base as an Air Force civilian employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Breen wished the New Jersey game had ended the way the postseason run started 
for the '75 team. Northridge was losing its first district playoff game when 
reserve outfielder Lance Phifer, nicknamed Fat Man, came off the bench to hit a 
game-winning homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That started the whole thing," Breen said. "I don't remember him getting 
another hit the whole rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, dozens of folks with ties to the 1967 and '75 teams turned out to 
watch the playoff run of the "Earthquake Kids." In fact, Breen and E.J. 
McClave, the manager of the '75 entry, convinced Stevenson to give a rah-rah 
speech to the '94 team during the San Bernardino regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stevenson, who played in the minors for three seasons: "I played baseball 
at some pretty high levels and I can honestly say that the greatest thrill I 
ever had was playing in Williamsport. It's more important than you can ever 
imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Mitchell of the '67 team no doubt would have given a similar speech. 
Mitchell, 38, is a roving minor-league coach for the Montreal Expos. He played 
in the College World Series at USC and in 1981 played briefly for a Dodger team 
that won the World Series. Yet he once told his mother that "nothing was more 
exciting" than his Williamsport experience. 
</P>
<P>
 When the '67 team returned home, there were no television cameras at the 
airport. There was a parade preceding the homecoming, however. In Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 After the World Series, players from each team were taken to Expo '67 in 
Montreal, where they were placed in convertibles and driven through . . . the 
suburbs? 
</P>
<P>
 "We went right through a residential section," said Steve Wold, a realtor who 
played at Cal State Northridge from 1974-76. "There was nobody outside except 
for a couple of people in their underwear wondering what the heck was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was a joke. We were waving to imaginary people." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1-0 loss to Mexico in '67, disconsolate parents filed back to the 
hotel, which is situated atop a knoll that overlooks the Williamsport ball 
field. Plenty of hanging heads, plenty of long faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, we looked down below and the kids were all out playing Whiffle 
ball, like they didn't have a care in the world," said Lucille Mitchell, 
Bobby's mother. "We were all in our rooms crying. Isn't it something how kids 
handle stuff like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Parents had plenty of trouble battling their nerves. Moms and dads of the '67 
team were practically paralyzed by superstition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was out of control," Bob Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell wore the same pants and plaid shirt for every tournament game but the 
World Series opener -- when coaches had to wear clothing supplied by Little 
League officials. Kiss of death. 
</P>
<P>
 One Northridge father sat only to the right of a particular dad at games. A 
handful of team moms wore the same clothing for days at a time as the team 
entered the World Series with an 11-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was superstitious about being superstitious," Steve Wold said. "I wore 
different clothes all the time. It's the kids, not somebody's orange pants." 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither of the first two Northridge teams matched the success of the 
1994 all-stars, merely making it to the championship dance was a notable 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Breen was practically orbiting Earth when the '75 team downed Hawaii in the 
regional final at San Bernardino to earn a World Series berth. He also was in 
attendance this year when Northridge again beat Hawaii in the regional final, 
again at San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never forget that high," Breen said. "You couldn't feel the ground. I 
never thought I'd see it again. It was a dream then, it was a dream now. I take 
my hat off to these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The same cap that Breen wore as coach 19 years ago. "It's pretty tattered," he 
said. "After this, I think I may have to retire it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until next time, that is.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; FORMULA FOR SUCCESS IS MOST DEFINITELY UP IN THE 
AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Used to be, if there was anything in the air over an Agoura High football 
game, it had a pilot. A football in the air meant it was third and long or 
someone had broken into Charger Coach Frank Greminger's office and stolen his 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, spend five hours watching Agoura practice and you will see Agoura 
passing the football for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit the change to a new coach, Charlie Wegher, who took over this year 
after Greminger retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegher is just bringing Agoura up to speed with the rest of the Marmonte 
League, which has become increasingly pass-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think more people have a better understanding of the passing game now than 
before," said Simi Valley Coach Roger McCamy, whose team again will use the 
run-and-shoot offense this season.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before everyone said, 'When you throw the ball three things can happen and 
two are bad.' That's the old coach. I think now they are realizing that it can 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Marmonte League teams passed for an average of 1,733 yards last season. The 
other 55 teams in the region passed for an average of 1,189 yards. Of course, 
much of the Marmonte's total can be attributed to Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Panther quarterback Keith Smith passed for 4,244 yards and 40 touchdowns, 
leading Newbury Park to a 14-0 record and a Southern Section Division III 
title. Newbury Park called only two running plays in the championship game, 
"and they went for minus-two (yards)," Coach George Hurley joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the run-and-shoot kind of thing and more wide-open offenses have 
become more attractive to high school teams, not just because of us, because it 
is effective," Hurley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got four receivers out there and they are good athletes, you've got 
a chance to beat somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one catch to the continuation of Pass-O-Rama in the league this year: 
Only two of the eight quarterbacks likely to start for Marmonte teams threw 
more than 50 passes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's Wes Lagatta, who completed 85 of 170 passes for 882 yards, is the most 
experienced of the group. Simi Valley's Tim Bennett completed 48 of 105 passes 
for 502 yards filling in for injured Jeremie Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the others were either taking snaps on the sophomore team or holding a 
clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams in the league don't have the dominant quarterbacks they had last 
year," McCamy said, "but they have talented, young, athletic quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 A brief roll call: Agoura's Eric Fitzgerald, the younger brother of University 
of Pittsburgh starting quarterback and Agoura alumnus Sean Fitzgerald, 
attempted only 28 passes because he missed part of the season because of back 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Joe Borchard passed for nearly 1,000 yards on the sophomore team, 
Coach Carl Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands' Chris Heffernan was a defensive back and played some 
quarterback, throwing 47 passes. Newbury Park's Justin Vint was the sophomore 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Thousand Oaks and Westlake, coaches had three-pronged quarterback races 
going as practice began.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' three candidates were all on the sophomore or freshman teams last 
year. Of Westlake's quarterbacks, only Steve Spruill, who completed two of six 
passes, was on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Aylsworth was on the sophomore team and Brian Shubin was at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake Coach Jim Benkert isn't about to let a little inexperience keep 
him from calling as many pass plays as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, he has to get the ball to blue-chip receiver Billy Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 33 passing league games," he said. "We work hard at throwing the 
football. It would be a shame to work that hard and not throw during the 
season."

RHOADES RETURNS TO MALIBU; BASEBALL: MOORPARK HIGH COACH NAMED ASSISTANT AT 
PEPPERDINE, HIS ALMA MATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 10 years since he played baseball at Pepperdine, David Rhoades dreamed 
of returning to the Malibu campus. He got his wish this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it an early birthday present. Rhoades, who turns 33 today, was hired as 
an assistant on Monday by Coach Pat Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with (Pepperdine) as a student," said Rhoades, who played 
infield for the Waves in 1982 and '83. "It's still the same type of feeling 
there 10 years later. It's a special thing for me. I'm excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoades leaves his post as coach at Moorpark High, where he led the Musketeers 
to a 69-41-1 record in five seasons. Last season, Moorpark won its third 
consecutive league championship. The Musketeers finished 20-5, winning the 
Frontier League before losing to South Pasadena, 1-0, in the second round of 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoades' most memorable victory came on April 16, when Moorpark beat perennial 
power Simi Valley, 9-5, in the championship game of the Camarillo tournament. 
The victory dramatically demonstrated that Rhoades had turned around a program 
that once endured a 40-year playoff drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I thought after accepting this job (at Pepperdine) was the 
parent support, the administrative support and the coaches I had at Moorpark," 
Rhoades said Tuesday. "They've helped me grow and develop to the point where 
I'm ready to make this step." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoades said he applied for the Pepperdine head coaching job after Andy Lopez, 
who led the Waves to the 1992 NCAA title, resigned on June 20 to become coach 
at Florida. Harrison, former head coach at The Master's College and an 
assistant at USC, Oral Roberts, Washington State and Oklahoma, offered Rhoades 
the assistant job last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoades said he would accept only if he could find a part-time, morning 
teaching job. Hours later, Rhoades was hired by Oak View High, a continuation 
school in Agoura. Previously, he taught fifth grade at Arroyo West Middle 
School in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoades, a native of Hayden, Ariz., batted .289 for the Waves in 1982, his 
best season. He will coach outfielders and catchers on a staff that includes 
former Dodger and Angel pitcher Geoff Zahn. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great opportunity it's going to be for me to develop under Pat and 
Geoff Zahn," Rhoades said. "Great things have happened here. And I know great 
things are going to happen in the future."

SEPARATE TALKS WITH MEDIATOR TODAY; BASEBALL: BEHIND THE SCENES, COLORADO, 
TORONTO OWNERS ARE SAID TO BE IN TOUCH WITH UNION OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid behind-the-scenes activity involving club and union officials, 
negotiators for major league baseball owners and striking players will meet 
separately today with federal mediators in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, acting commissioner Bud Selig said Tuesday, have no plans to 
change the salary-cap proposal that has polarized the sides through 19 days of 
the strike, and there is no indication that a last-ditch attempt by some 
high-revenue owners and executives to save the season through informal 
communication with union officials has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Rockie owner Jerry McMorris and Toronto Blue Jay president Paul 
Beeston, with the knowledge of Selig and chief negotiator Richard Ravitch, 
according to a source, have been the primary architects of an unpublicized 
effort to keep the process alive. 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris said he had no comment on his private talks with the union but added 
that it is critical a settlement be reached in the next 10 days if the season 
is to be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a theory that we can go directly to the playoffs from the position 
the clubs are in now, but I'd hate to see that happen," he said. "I'd like to 
see at least two weeks of play before the playoffs start." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington and Philadelphia Phillie 
Executive Vice President David Montgomery will join Ravitch and his staff in 
today's meeting with mediators. No players are expected to attend the 
mediator's later session with the union, and Donald Fehr, the union's executive 
director, said he did not anticipate any meaningful results. 
</P>
<P>
 In two developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Selig said a quarterly owners meeting scheduled for Detroit next week has 
been canceled but denied that it was an attempt to stifle possible dissent 
among the owners regarding the stalemated talks or the ongoing attempt to sell 
the players on a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said a conference call with his executive council and other owners 
Tuesday failed to produce any opposition to the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one time I was willing to let the minority rule if a fair number of 
clubs wanted a meeting, but there was frankly no desire," he said. "As long as 
the players are on strike, the clubs felt there was no useful purpose spending 
a couple of days in meetings and diverting attention from the effort to resolve 
the dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 -- While the 25-man postseason rosters would normally have had to be set by 
midnight tonight, the union agreed to a management suggestion that teams will 
have until 48 hours after a settlement to submit postseason rosters. However, 
teams will still have only until midnight tonight to trade for a player who 
would be eligible for postseason competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement allows the Dodgers, for example, to keep Jose Offerman, who 
might otherwise have been recalled to be eligible for the playoffs, in uniform 
at Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps us a great deal," Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire 
said. "We've been sitting here for the last 48 hours working on the postseason 
roster, but now we don't have to disrupt the Albuquerque team (as it prepares 
for the Pacific Coast League playoffs) or take any young players out of the 
developmental arena."

AUCTION HOUSE BANKRUPTCY FILING IS LATEST OF MCNALL'S PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Stamp & Coin Co., Inc., an international auction house of which Bruce 
McNall was majority owner, became the latest enterprise to fail the Kings' 
president when it filed for bankruptcy in federal court last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came as the firm's debts exceeded assets by about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Goodman, an Encino tax attorney representing Superior, said the 
company's failure was not a result of McNall's financial and legal problems.  
</P>
<P>
 McNall was sole owner of the Kings until May, when he sold 72% of the 
franchise for $60 million as part of a plan to pay off a $92-million business 
loan. Shortly thereafter, he filed for bankruptcy. He recently reached a plea 
agreement in a federal investigation into bank fraud involving his chief 
holding company, McNall Sports and Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Superior has) suffered operating losses due to downturn in the collectible 
business," Goodman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors in the demise of the 64-year old Beverly Hills company that 
handled rare stamps, coins and other collectibles were its debt load and 
mounting lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like every other industry in this economy, it's just not what it used to 
be," Goodman said.  
</P>

EX-USC COACH SAYS HE WAS PUSHED ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one had to spell it out for Jim Bush. He knew he wasn't wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, shortly after Ron Allice was hired as director of USC's recently 
consolidated men's and women's track program in June, Bush resigned after four 
years as coach of the Trojan men's track team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to be the head coach and they hired another man and made him 
the head coach -- and there's no way you can have two head coaches with two 
different philosophies," said Bush, whose resignation was announced last week. 
"I felt in fairness to Ron Allice that it would be best if I just resigned. I'm 
not happy about it, but that's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't have two head coaches. I've never heard of anything like that. 
I think I was being shoved down to assistant." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, 67, was absent for three weeks of practice last season after undergoing 
surgery for prostate cancer in February, but said the health problems he has 
experienced played no part in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody says that, they're not telling the truth," he said. "If I could do 
the job I did last year, when I was really beat up, then I can certainly do it 
when I'm in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in better shape now than I've been in 15 years. I made up my mind if I 
couldn't coach, I was going to get in the best shape possible and I was going 
to match my age for pushups, and I've done 67 pushups." 
</P>
<P>
 In all probability, though, Bush's coaching days are past. He was credited 
with reviving USC's program, guiding the Trojans to third place in the 1992 
NCAA meet and 10th place this year. He enjoyed his greatest success at UCLA, 
where his teams won five NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this pretty well sealed it for me," said Bush, a 1987 inductee into 
the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the way I wanted it to end, but I don't think I'll ever coach 
again."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; VILLAGE CHRISTIAN LYING IN WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Village Christian High football Coach Mike Plaisance thinks he's pulling a 
fast one on his rival Alpha League coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every coach in the league picks L.A. Baptist -- a team that was 13-0 
and won the Southern Section Division X title last season -- as the team to 
beat. Guess who started the campaign? "They went undefeated last year and won 
it all. They have to be the favorite," said Plaisance, punctuating his 
statement with a hearty laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Divert the attention, that's his game plan. Let no one know that 14 starters 
return for his team, including kicker Ignacio Brache who booted a 54-yard field 
goal last season. Keep the spotlight on L.A. Baptist. So what if only three 
starters return for the Knights? 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't become the heavyweight champion until you knock out the (reigning 
champion)," Plaisance said, laughing once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by Plaisance, the league's dean of coaches, who begins his 
15th season with the Crusaders. Village Christian is poised to laugh all the 
way to the league championship and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist Coach Mark Bates, who once played for Plaisance at Village 
Christian, sees right through his mentor's ploy. He laughs at the suggestion 
that the Knights are favored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Bates said. "(Village Christian) is loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Crusader returnees are tailback Jake Funk (1,394 yards rushing, 13 
touchdowns) and fullback Enrique Borja (581 yards), who formed the league's 
most productive backfield last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if Funk and Borja can drive the Crusaders only as far as midfield, 
expect to see Brache jogging out with tee in hand to put a few points on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Brache has made 61 of 65 extra points in two seasons and kicked nine field 
goals last year, five of which traveled 40 yards or more. Several Pacific 10 
Conference colleges already have expressed interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian has a solid team, and Plaisance knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 But with three new coaches and a new team in the league, he relishes playing a 
shell game. He's a self-confessed sneak. "My wife says that too," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaisance's sneakiness might pay off against new coaches Gil Crook of Marshall 
Fundamental and Keith Patefield of Maranatha. But the league's other three 
coaches -- including Glenn Bell of league newcomer Kilpatrick -- aren't buying 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the league balloons from four teams to six this year, it is no secret 
who is holding the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Village is always good," said Bell, who has coached against the Crusaders 
four times in the past three years in nonleague and playoff games. Kilpatrick 
is a Los Angeles County-funded school for juvenile offenders in Malibu that has 
been a free-lance team the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs never have returning players, which makes Bell's job the toughest 
in the league. Western Christian Coach Reese Mitchell also refuses to play into 
Plaisance's hand. He knows better.  
</P>
<P>
 Western Christian bowed out of the league last season because of a lack of 
players, but the Fighting Lancers return after a one-year absence -- with about 
20 players. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, in his 11th season at Western Christian and third as head coach, 
knows Village Christian and L.A. Baptist set the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working against Mike and Mark the past few years, I missed (playing them)," 
Mitchell said. "They've had some outstanding teams. I missed that last year."

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: FAMILIES IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Julie Smith heard her oldest son read on his own was a very 
special moment. Although all parents are proud of this accomplishment, Smith 
was especially pleased because she's responsible. She had been his sole teacher 
since he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrill of being there for such important educational moments is one reason 
Smith, 35, and her husband, Craig, 34, decided to teach all of their children 
in their Orange home. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Smith's oldest son is 9, and they have just started teaching their 
second son, who is 5 1/2. Their 2-year-old son and baby-on-the-way will one day 
join the Smith school. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Smiths and a growing number of parents, the benefits of schools in the 
home include one-on-one, individualized instruction, increased family 
closeness, enhanced communication between age groups, development of 
independent thinking, fostering a love of learning, flexible scheduling, 
training in all areas of life and academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the parents are home schooling because they feel it's in the best 
interest of their children, the one-on-one training can be ideal," says home 
educational and clinical psychologist Don Smith, whose offices are in Orange. 
"Home schooling can establish a positive relationship between the kids and 
parents, enables the children to immediately get feedback and gives young 
people an opportunity to work at their own pace and level." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems arise when parents keep children at home because of some need of 
their own, Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 Home schooling also isn't for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few parents are suited to home school their children because it takes a 
major commitment on the part of the parents," he says. "The parents must also 
be educated enough to be able to understand and relay concepts to their 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, home schools fall under the private school section of the 
education code, which means that lessons must be taught by someone capable of 
teaching between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. in the English language. 
The home school must also be affiliated with a private school, or the parent 
must file an affidavit to become an independent school. California has the most 
lenient laws of any other state regarding home schools. 
</P>
<P>
 All home-school educators must keep thorough records that document education 
is taking place, including attendance and the teaching performed. No testing is 
required for home-schooled children, although many parents gauge progress with 
regular achievement tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Home schooling has become popular in recent years, says Susan Beatty, 
co-founder and communications director for Norwalk-based Christian Home 
Educators Assn. of California, which is the largest home-schooling organization 
in California. CHEA offers assistance and information to anyone interested in 
home schooling their children, regardless of religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I began home-schooling 12 years ago, there were just a handful of other 
people educating their children in the home," she says. "Now a rough estimate 
says that there are 40,000 to 50,000 home-schoolers in California and a 
half-million to a million in the United States. Home schooling is also 
increasing in other parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty says "studies have shown that home-schooled children test at or above 
the 80th percentile on national norms for standardized achievement tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many people feel that a lack of socialization for home-schooled 
children is a problem, it doesn't have to be, says psychologist Smith. "If kids 
are involved in other activities outside of the home with other children, they 
will socialize just fine," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie and Craig Smith began considering home schooling when Julie was pregnant 
with their first child. At the time, they worried about socialization, until 
they watched some friends' home-schooled children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children had respect for each other and others, a great deal of maturity 
for their age and a total lack of selfishness, which their parents attributed 
to home schooling," Julie Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although initially we worried about socialization, we also began to see the 
disadvantage of too much peer interaction," Smith says. "It's better to learn 
manners and morals from Mom and Dad, rather than other children their age. Our 
children are learning to cooperate with children and adults." 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith children participate in many social activities with other children. 
Every Friday afternoon during the school year they get together with a group of 
home-schooled children for field trips that coincide with what they are 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have community action days when they do things such as glean corn 
from fields for the homeless. They've also made a quilt and dinner for an AIDS 
hospice and regularly visit senior citizens at a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Smith teaches her children during the traditional school year and keeps 
to a set schedule. After dressing and eating, at 9 a.m. they go to the dining 
room, which serves as a schoolroom. 
</P>
<P>
 They start with a prayer, Pledge of Allegiance and a Bible lesson until 9:30, 
which is taught by their father, who then leaves for work. They have social 
studies or science until 10:30; spelling until 10:45, and math, language arts, 
writing and penmanship to 12:30. Then they have lunch and physical education, 
including playing outside, taking a walk or riding bikes. In the afternoon they 
have art lessons and read for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith's direct teaching is usually completed by 2:30, she says she's 
never really done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about teaching at home is that everything becomes a 
learning experience," she says. "You tend to take advantage of all 
opportunities to teach your children. For instance, the kids will make dinner 
with me, and we'll use our math to measure out ingredients. The youngest one 
can count how many forks are on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Home schooling has also enabled Smith to teach her children according to their 
learning styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My older boy is very visual, and the younger one is more hands-on," she says. 
"So I've matched them each with the appropriate textbooks and learning 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith admits that teaching her children is a lot of work and takes a good deal 
of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a lot easier for me to send my kids to school," she says. "It 
takes a lot of organization and effort on my and my husband's part to teach our 
children. Things around the house tend to pile up because school takes 
priority. Home schooling is something you have to believe in your heart is the 
best thing for your children." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also spends time researching curriculum for her children and educating 
herself on the information. "Instead of reading magazines, I read textbooks," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith was initially worried about understanding what she needed to 
teach, she says she has found that she is relearning as she goes, and that it 
has been a broadening experience. When she reaches any areas that she doesn't 
feel comfortable teaching, her husband will help if possible, or she will get 
together with other moms who have expertise in certain areas, and they will 
teach the children as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smiths say the home-schooling arrangement has positively affected the 
entire family's relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children get along very well as friends, and I feel in tune with them on 
a daily basis," Smith says. "I know how their day went, and I can deal with any 
problems at that moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Dan Marton of Anaheim decided to home school their three children six 
years ago because they say it is ultimately their responsibility to educate 
their children, especially when they are young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt they needed constant care, regulation and more attention than a large 
class of children could possibly provide," says Mary Marton, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to raise our children to be morally responsible and motivated by 
love of virtue, rather than fear of correction. Because I am their mother, I 
felt I was the most qualified person to teach them that." 
</P>
<P>
 When Marton tired of tripping over school supplies in their home, the couple 
built a schoolroom in their garage, which is equipped with about 500 books, a 
computer, room to hang art projects, a large dry-erase board and a long table 
where the children sit facing Marton during teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the Martons have decided to put their two oldest daughters, who will 
soon be 10 and 8, into private school, and Marton will teach her youngest girl, 
who is almost 5, kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is a very good one, and I need a break for awhile," Marton says. 
She's says she also has a desire to put her teaching to the test and see how 
the girls do in a school setting. They did well on their entrance exams, she 
says. For the Martons it was important that their children know how to think, 
rather than what to think, and to regard education as a means, not an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the kids to have a desire for mastering a skill or idea, rather 
than focus on getting a grade," she says. "We wanted them to not only ask 
questions, but know where to look for answers, and to understand different 
points of view, even when they don't agree with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's takes a 100% commitment to teach your children, because it's a full-time 
job," Marton says. "Although we have set classroom hours, our whole life is 
really school. We make a practical application to what the girls are learning 
whenever possible."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: HERO OF THOSE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The air was perfumed with . . . well, miraculously, excitement, considering 
that nearly 70 dogs were bounding about. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostess, bless her, had the foresight this year to hire an official party 
pooper-scooper. So everything was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for one poor man who was sitting on the lawn. His head and shoulders -- 
boing! -- were nothing but a springboard for an out-of-control party animal 
trying mightily to take a bite out of a helium-filled balloon floating nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of bad behavior occurs each year when scores of Boston terriers and 
their owners converge in Santa Monica at the Boston Tea Party hosted by Lise 
Allard Selznick, whose Darla is a star of TV ("L.A. Law") and motion pictures 
("The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag"). 
</P>
<P>
 Selznick seems perfectly normal. She holds a respectable job as director of 
contracts syndication at Orion Pictures. But she is rather attached to her dog 
-- so much so, in fact, that Darla preceded her mistress down the aisle at 
Selznick's Malibu wedding last June, sporting a white satin harness with a ring 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 I happen to have a soft spot for Darla, who is the mother of my own first-born 
daughter, Perry Violet. It is a deep and shameful family secret, revealed here 
for the first time, that Perry Violet is the product of accidental incest 
between Darla and her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry doesn't know this, of course, but we bought her at a slight discount 
because of her less-than-fresh gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Darla was quite testy with her daughter at the party. First, she pretended she 
didn't know her, then she tried to bite her head off. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Show me a mother and daughter who never snap at each other and I'll show you a 
world without therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I know what you retriever people are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 People like you have only two words for Boston terriers: "Uh-gly!" The less 
verbal of you tend to point and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 But we who own them see only beauty in black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the pooches possible, we have chosen (or in my case, been forced by a 
spouse) to consort with a canine that is not only thought by much of the rest 
of the world to be unattractive, but clearly ranks at the top of the list for 
annoying personal habits. 
</P>
<P>
 (A typical Boston Tea Party conversation goes like this: " My dog snores 
louder than a chain saw." "Oh yeah? My dog can get her tongue down your throat 
before you even have time to open your mouth!" "Really? Well, my dog can clear 
out a room in five seconds flat.") 
</P>
<P>
 No breed can top the Boston for demonstrations of affection. And therein, as 
long as you don't mind tongue kisses or flatulence, lies its extraordinary 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great dogs," one guest said. "Just keep them away from open flames." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of Saturday's fifth annual party was the presentation of a medal 
to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Larry Kagele, whose only apparent 
shortcoming is that he owns a German shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatness was thrust upon Kagele last January, when he was alerted to the 
snatching of a little Boston beauty named Maude from the Woodland Hills back 
yard of Henri and Sandy Kemp. The dognaper demanded $450. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen cops, four plain cars and a couple of black-and-whites, naturellement 
, moved in to make the bust, aided by a police helicopter in case the perp got 
loose. He didn't; they put the collar on the creep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hero" reads Kagele's medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, Kagele has been involved in bigger busts. In 1988, he smashed a theft 
ring at Los Angeles International Airport as its 20 members prepared to board a 
plane to Chicago. He helped snare notorious child killer Theodore Frank. And of 
course, there was his own well-publicized run-in with the law, when security 
guards at a Granada Hills grocery store handcuffed him for passing out campaign 
literature during his unsuccessful race against Councilman Hal Bernsen in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But here is what makes the man a hero: Kagele coordinated the rescue of the 
hapless Maude in spite of what he knew he would face. From colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 They call him Ace Kagele, Pet Detective. They gave him a furry doggy mascot. 
They yap and woof at him when he walks into the West Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy that must hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," said the handsome 51-year-old law enforcement veteran. "I'm a big boy. 
I can take it. I get my hair permed and they call me Brillo Pad too." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the party, Kagele said he was thinking of adopting a Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 We might have known. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the man is drawn to the scent of danger.

AMERICA'S BABY DOCTOR IS BACK IN BUSINESS; PARENTING: AT 91, DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK 
SHOULD BE BASKING IN RETIREMENT. BUT HE'S TOO WORRIED ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Benjamin Spock is 91 and worried. Not about the usual things, like health 
-- "I don't feel great, but until two years ago I didn't even feel old"; or 
love -- he's happily married to a woman 40 years his junior, or money -- his 
famous child-care book still sells half a million copies each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Spock's big problem, he says, is the realization that he'll leave America's 
children in a worse situation than he found them -- a fact the activist says he 
wants to fight with each remaining breath. 
</P>
<P>
 So between the macrobiotic meals his wife, Mary Morgan, prepares for him; the 
daily massages she gives him while they recite together from the Book of 
Psalms; the yoga exercises, meditation, group psychotherapy sessions, swimming 
and nature walks they enjoy at their summer house on Penobscot Bay in Maine -- 
Spock has written yet another book. 
</P>
<P>
 This one, he says, has nothing to do with the daily care and feeding of 
America's youth. "A Better World for Our Children" (National Press, 1994) is 
about the educational, ethical and spiritual poverty in which we are raising 
them, and the awful legacy he thinks we are creating. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask and he'll reel off his list of atrocities: "Instability of marriage 
and the family; cruel competitiveness in business, sports and education; racial 
and ethnic divisiveness; materialism running rampant, with no spiritual or 
ethical values to offset it; increasing violence; a coarsening of our attitudes 
toward sex; lack of high-quality day care; an educational system that spews out 
children with no skills, no goals, and no preparation for productive, 
satisfying lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tote it up," he says, "and you have a picture of a society speeding 
downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, Spock says, is that we can reverse it all, if we start now to 
agree on a new set of . . . uh, "excuse the buzzword, but I have to say it . . 
. values ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spock is ultra-cautious here because he's been burned before. In the 1960s, 20 
years after his first child-care book was published, conservative clergyman Dr. 
Norman Vincent Peale vilified Spock from his New York pulpit for the baby 
doctor's anti-Vietnam War activities, his "permissive" attitude toward raising 
children, and for an entire generation of unpatriotic and undisciplined young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 This was just a few weeks after Spock, the chaplain of Yale University and two 
others were convicted of "conspiracy to abet resistance to the military draft." 
(The conviction was overturned on appeal and Spock never went to jail.) 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Spock says, he hasn't totally shaken the "permissive" label among 
people who never read his books. "Those who know my work realize that I was 
never permissive and always advocated total respect between children and 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his friendly competitors agree that it was an inaccurate and undeserved 
slur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spock's been my hero all along, he's a wonderful man," says child-care expert 
Dr. T. Berry Brazelton. "He's been vital to family life and children, has kept 
the pressure on our society to pay attention to those issues. We are the least 
family-oriented society in the world, and all who care about children are 
frightened about the future if this continues. Spock's new book is one more 
sign of how much he cares." 
</P>
<P>
 At this late stage of his career, Spock says, he doesn't want to be 
misunderstood once again, or erroneously linked to what he considers regressive 
"family values folks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not some old geezer advocating a return to the good old days," Spock 
rasps by phone from his seaside retreat. "I like and embrace the progress I've 
seen during my lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 He's just not so sure about the attitudes that go with it. What we have lost 
while moving forward, he says, is our sense of the dignity of each individual; 
our desire to treat others as we want to be treated; our goal of raising 
children with the ideals of helpfulness, kindliness, and service to others. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he says, we teach children only to want to "get ahead." We include 
nothing spiritual to sustain them while getting there, nothing so simple and 
profound as the fact that we are in this world to love and help each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because there are no such interior beacons to guide young people as 
they try to "get ahead" in school or work, because we offer no sense of the 
dignity and importance of each individual person, rich or poor, Spock says we 
are seeing an increase in teen-age suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 If these spiritual values were brought back, he believes, America could move 
forward faster than ever. Our children would feel valued, educated and 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Spock doesn't pretend to know the answers to the question of how to insert 
spiritual values -- or better day care and education -- into our society. He 
hopes only that his book will "open up dialogue," and perhaps start some 
movement in what he considers the right direction. "Pediatrics is politics," he 
has said. If parents want better day care, health care and schools, they'll 
have to organize and demand it from the government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the then-shocking first words of Spock's "Baby and Child Care," 
first published in 1945. It has now sold more copies than any other book except 
the Bible. It has been translated into 39 languages and is updated every eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Spock, baby books were condescending, assumed parents knew nothing, and 
urged them to ignore their natural instincts in favor of rigid schedules and 
punishing regimes. And they were warned not to hug and kiss their kids at 
random -- only in specified instances. 
</P>
<P>
 Spock was a struggling pediatrician in New York City when a publisher asked 
him to write his thoughts on the subject. He already had a wife, Jane, one baby 
and one on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd spent years studying: Yale College, Columbia University Medical School, 
five years at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. He took this latter course 
of study, he says, to learn why people behave as they do -- so he could better 
help parents to understand themselves and their children. As a result, he 
became the first pediatrician to write with behavioral insight and with a 
comforting, explanatory tone. For the next few decades, he remained the world's 
baby-care guru and a father figure extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
 His own fathering qualities were somewhat lacking, he laments in his upcoming 
book. On the phone from Maine, he says that if he could do it over again, he 
would devote more time to his sons and less to moving around to further his 
career. And he'd show more physical affection to his kids too. "When they were 
grown, they told me I hadn't shown enough affection, hadn't given them enough 
hugs and kisses. That hurt their feelings, made them feel unworthy of my 
affection." 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys grew up to be "wonderful people," Spock says. And both decided long 
ago not to answer reporters' questions about life with father. 
</P>
<P>
 John, a Los Angeles architect, is pleasant but firm in his refusal to talk. 
Michael, a Chicago museum director, says he's had a lifetime of such questions. 
"I'm 61 years old. At a certain point, you just don't want to do that any more. 
I will say he's given us a tremendous amount. He spends his time on things he 
believes in deeply. That puts his life exactly where his heart is." 
</P>
<P>
 Spock ran for President in 1972, on the People's Party ticket. "I had no 
desire to be President," he says, but thousands of young idealists were 
disillusioned with both major parties, as Spock was, and he decided to help 
give them an alternate voice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spock's new book rails against divorce, he walked out on his wife of 
48 years to marry an ardent feminist he'd met while on the lecture circuit. 
That was almost 20 years ago. She was in her 30s, with a young daughter. He was 
in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could do things over," Spock says, "I'd write more about step-parenting. 
It's one of the most difficult things I've ever encountered. Mary's daughter, 
Ginger, literally ignored me for the first five years we were married. It was 
horrible, although we finally got it all straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, he says, life with his pampering Mrs. is nearly perfect. A 
slight stroke and a pacemaker have slowed him down of late, forcing the 
lovebirds to abandon their life at sea. For the past few years, he says, they 
had lived in tight quarters on a sailboat in the Virgin Islands during winter, 
and on another sailboat off Maine during summer. Two years ago they came 
ashore.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit I'm getting old," Spock says. "But nobody says I have to like 
it."

WHERE THE BOYS ARE; THE PLA-BOYS OF THE POSTAL LEAGUE TAKE BALL PLAYING 
SERIOUSLY. NOTHING STOPS THEM -- NOT WIND, HEAT OR FAMILY COMMITMENTS.

<P>
 They arrive at the park by 4 p.m. and flop down on the cool grass of a shaded 
area near the curb. They change into their softball shoes and examine their 
leather gloves, most of them faded and worn soft by seasons of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players lie wilted from the heat, a couple of them sigh deeply as 
they finish cigarettes before flicking them into St. Andrews Street. Slowly 
they stand and walk toward the ballpark to jog their mandatory two laps across 
the outfield grass. Damn, it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one are U.S. Postal Service employees. It is good, steady work. They 
live throughout the Los Angeles area, but the roots of their team, the 
Pla-Boys, coalesce here in South L.A., where twice a week they sharpen their 
skills at a dying game. 
</P>
<P>
 There were once 24 men's fast-pitch teams in the Postal League, but now there 
are only 14, as more players are attracted to the slow-pitch version of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, like few others, partners the young and old. The Pla-Boys range in 
age from 23-year-old shortstop Eric Perry, whose gold earrings dangle from both 
sides of a shaved head, to Billie Small, the 62-year-old pitcher whose cap 
covers a head of graying hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys take the game more seriously than most. Other teams may practice 
once a week or not at all in preparation for the Saturday games, but the 
Pla-Boys are here every Tuesday and Thursday, even on days like today, when the 
temperature is in the mid-90s and the heat reflects wickedly off the dirt 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 20 years, they practiced at a nearby playground but decided to move 
on when gunfire came to play. Here at St. Andrews, seniors walk laps around the 
park and young people gather innocently in the shade. There is distant laughter 
and a peaceful calm, but it is veiled by a sixth-sense caution that comes with 
living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys come to life slowly. It is their last practice before their 
league championship playoffs. Some of them have just gotten off work, others 
are working late shifts and their days are just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 There is history and tradition to the Pla-Boys, not all of it principled. Some 
of the players have been together for more than 20 years, bonded by their love 
for the game and all that comes with it -- the competition and glory and 
trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 The older players remember when they played 10 games a week for numerous 
teams. After games, they would socialize around a cooler of beer. In softball, 
this is known as camaraderie. Or they would go to the bars that sponsored teams 
and eat and drink for free until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I couldn't keep my first wife," Small says. "I was never home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the players begin playing catch, the balls gather velocity and begin 
slapping hard into their gloves. The chatter begins to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say the Pla-Boys have "the big head," and mouths to match. Players 
from other teams may laugh with them and drink their beer, but deep down inside 
they love to see the Pla-Boys lose. They have always, perhaps undeservedly, 
been cast as the villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Through fund-raisers and members' dues, the club helps players who face 
financial hardship. They recently made a donation when a member's house caught 
on fire and they do the same whenever there's a death in a player's family. 
Each year at Christmas, the club delivers food baskets to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the early 1960s, the Pla-Boys now sponsor men's and women's 
slow-pitch teams as well as a youth team that plays here at St. Andrews. The 
Pla-Boy Club, made up primarily of the old-timers, raises money for team 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been glorious moments. In the last 20 years, they have won 13 
league playoff titles. They once won 68 straight games and seven consecutive 
championships. But it is not the victories one remembers, says Clay Williams, 
54, a coach and 29-year Pla-Boy veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses -- especially the important ones -- seem to run over and over in 
his mind, he says, like a loop of film. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's playoffs have haunted him for a year now -- the missed 
opportunities and uncharacteristic errors. Fast-pitch is a game played in a 
flurry, and the slightest bobble or hesitation can be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Williams can practically give a play-by-play of last year's 
disheartening semifinal loss to their rivals, the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four errors," he says, shaking his head. "Four double plays." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take three wins for the Pla-Boys to claim the Postal League crown, but 
one loss would put them out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace picks up as the team begins batting practice. Each player puts down a 
couple of bunts and takes 10 swings. It ends with fielding practice. Williams 
hits to players one at a time and has them chasing down balls until their legs 
are weak and their chests are heaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the two-hour workout, they repair to the shade and the trunks of 
their cars, where Coleman coolers await. The Pla-Boys also are celebrating a 
birthday, so half a gallon of gin makes the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players, like Small, prefer soft drinks or water as they share softball 
lore, past victories and defeats, the certainty of upcoming conquests. They 
talk strategy, women, work. By the time the last beer is gone and the final 
players leave the park, it is well past dark. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Billie Small arrives at Westchester Park an hour early on Game Day. It's the 
same ritual every Saturday throughout the season. He finds a seat in the 
bleachers, reaches into his bag and pulls out a jar of liniment, which he rubs 
vigorously into his knees and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't mind being called an old man and says it only makes him feel 
blessed to still be playing the game. But being an old man requires more time, 
effort and liniment to prepare for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been playing fast-pitch since he was a youngster. Back then, he 
couldn't get enough of the game. One summer, he, Clay Williams and L.T. 
Tillman, the team's manager, played on seven championship teams. He remains one 
of the league's top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were truly dedicated to the team," he says. "Our families knew come 
Saturday, we gonna play ball. Don't ask us to do nothing else. Don't ask us to 
go to no weddings or nothing like that. We playing ball. I been to funerals on 
Saturdays and took my uniform with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Small worked 39 years and 29 days for the Postal Service before retiring in 
1992. He now works part time for his church on South Vermont Avenue. While the 
game may have caused problems at home, he says with pride that he never allowed 
it to interfere with his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules now have been the rules forever, Small says. Players are expected to 
be at practice and are excused only for reasons of work or family emergency. 
They must wear full uniforms for games. Some younger players have complained 
about that one, preferring to wear shorts or something other than traditional 
Pla-Boy red and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them say they don't want to be wearing red because they afraid they 
might be identified with gangs," Small says. "They want to wear black. As soon 
as the game's over they change clothes, but I wear my uniform to the ballpark 
and leave it on until I go home and shower. I'm proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completing his pregame warm-ups, Small takes a seat in the bleachers to 
await the start of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still got that adrenaline flowing when I play," he says. "All games to me 
is important. On the night before a game, I start going through in my mind who 
the batters are going to be. I start getting a little loosey-goosey in my 
stomach and I feel that way until after the first pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The game begins, and the Pla-Boys go easily in the top of the first inning, 
three up, three down. Then Small takes the mound, tosses a few warm-up pitches. 
The first batter steps in, and the old man rears back, triggers his windmill 
motion and fires off a heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each team is allowed one player on its roster who doesn't work for the U.S. 
Postal Service. For the Pla-Boys, that player is Timothy Mitchell, 24, a 
powerful lefty who played in the Boston Red Sox organization until 1992, when 
he injured a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pla-Boys leading 3-0 in the second inning, Mitchell digs in deep in 
the box, a thick wad of Red Man puffing out his right cheek, a runner on 
second. He is all business when he has a bat in his hands. His eyes are serious 
as he leans his weight on his back foot and steadily awaits the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 After injuring his knee two years ago, he was given his release from the Class 
AA Lynchburg, Va., team. Earlier this year, Mitchell was also released from a 
warehouse job, so now he is doing painting and odd jobs. He's good with his 
hands. A fifth-round pick in 1989, after graduating from Culver City High 
School, he still hopes to return to professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching silently from the fence near the Pla-Boy dugout is another big man. 
Around this ballpark, Henry (Hammerin' Hank) Strawberry is a legend. The father 
of San Francisco Giant Darryl Strawberry, Henry still stops by on Saturdays to 
visit his friends. When he was on the mound, he threw only one pitch -- no 
fancy curve or drop or rise or knuckleball -- only the fastball, and that was 
all he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew what was coming," he says in a soft voice. Then, with the hint 
of a smile, he adds: "But they still had to hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 People say his pitching was overshadowed by his hitting. Hammerin' Hank could 
hit the ball a ton, like Mitchell -- and like Darryl. 
</P>
<P>
 With the count full, Mitchell steadies his gaze. The pitch comes in just above 
the knees, and he unloads with a loud grunt, making solid contact. Neither 
fielder can catch up to it. There are no outfield fences, so by the time they 
run the ball down, Mitchell is rounding second base. The frustrations, the 
disappointment of the past two years are nowhere to be seen. There is a smile 
on his face as he is greeted at home plate with high fives. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester Park is a long way from Fenway, but a home run translates beyond 
the lines that separate levels of the game -- baseball from softball, Little 
League from the American League. For Mitchell, the moment is sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys go on to win, 14-0, and advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.T. Tillman sits in a folding chair next to the dugout at Holly Park in 
Hawthorne, where the Pla-Boys are playing the Athletics -- the only team to 
beat them during the regular season. The winner will advance to the finals to 
play the Heat, last year's league and state champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks earlier, he had surgery for an ulcer. The incision is 
still tender, so he is careful to rise slowly and is ordered by his wife to not 
get overly excited. By the bottom of the first inning, however, he is out on 
the field in the home plate umpire's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman started playing ball in Borger, Texas. One of 15 children, it wasn't 
hard to get a game together. He would yank the head off one of his sisters' 
dolls to use as a ball, remove the handle from his mother's mop for a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to be a controversial game, and the first confrontation arises in the 
first inning, when the Pla-Boys complain about a change in their opponents' 
lineup. They lose the argument but go on to win the game, 8-4, advancing to the 
championship round. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Small begins his drive home to Fontana, he is thinking about the 
Heat, the batters he will face and how he will pitch to them in three days. He 
is thinking about the state tournament in Stockton last year, when the Heat 
beat them twice in the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
 The butterflies in his stomach are beginning to flutter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the day of the game finally comes, Small is up by 5:20 a.m., anxious -- 
like a kid -- to get to the ballpark for the 4 p.m. game. The players gather in 
a circle before taking the field. Each player gets a chance to say a few words. 
</P>
<P>
 "125 percent," says Greg Harris, the team's speedy center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just win," says Perry, the young shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, the team," says Tillman, the last person to speak. "They gotta come get 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 They pile their hands in the center of the huddle. "One, two, three." 
</P>
<P>
 "PLA-BOYS WIN!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat take a 1-0 lead in the first inning, and Tillman is already out on 
the field, challenging the umpires. His wife, Vera, steps down from the 
bleachers, pleading with him to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, the Pla-Boys have said they must play strong defense to win. Turns 
out they were right. The defense breaks down. The Heat capitalize, winning 4-3 
in the bottom of the last inning to claim the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet in the center of the infield to shake hands. Both teams are, 
for the most part, gracious. Small walks to the dugout and throws his glove on 
the ground. The Pla-Boys gather in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a few errors," Williams says. "We made some mistakes, but all in all, 
we played a good game. We didn't give up when we got behind. We had a good 
season. They had a good game. Let's drink some beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, the young center fielder, walks off to be alone, tears forming in his 
eyes. Tillman walks over and places an arm around his shoulder. They stand 
together, young and old. He tells Harris to hold his head high. On the bench, 
Greg Crowley, the first-year left fielder, sits silent and alone, staring down, 
giving anything to have another chance at a couple of those fly balls that 
could have made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 It hurts and it's cruel. When you expect so much, it's not the victories you 
remember.

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; ADOPTION CASES SPUR CHILDREN'S WELFARE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the Baby Jessica and Baby Richard cases moved through the courts and the 
tabloids, a group of judges and lawyers crafted a model law they hope will 
prevent similarly agonizing adoption cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The act is radical. It places the welfare of children at its center," said 
Joan Heifetz Hollinger, the act's drafter and a law professor at the UC 
Berkeley. Provisions of the Uniform Adoption Act, approved earlier this month 
by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A biological father would have 30 days to make a parental claim after the 
proposed adoption of his child. 
</P>
<P>
 * A birth mother would have eight days to change her mind after giving up a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adoptions could not be denied on the basis of the race or ethnicity of the 
adoptive parents or children. 
</P>
<P>
 The act goes to the American Bar Assn. for review, then will be sent to each 
state with a recommendation that it be considered for enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Baby Richard case, the now 3 1/2-year-old Chicago child's biological 
father is attempting to gain custody. The child's mother put him up for 
adoption and told the father that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do everything which is reasonably possible to notify and obtain the 
consent of that biological parent, that's all we can ask of the system. The 
child's interest in secure and permanent placement becomes at a certain point 
the most important issue," said Rhoda Billings, a law professor at Wake Forest 
University and a member of the group that drafted the act. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jon Ryan, president of the National Organization for Birth Fathers and 
Adoption Reform in Punta Gorda, Fla., said the act "does not in any way protect 
the rights of mothers and fathers and children." Early Puberty Can Mean 
Cigarettes, Alcohol 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescent girls who go through puberty earlier than their peers tend to take 
up cigarettes and alcohol earlier than their peers, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least 80% of all smokers start during childhood or adolescence and the age 
of initial use has decreased over time, particularly among girls," researchers 
led by Dr. Darrell M. Wilson of Stanford University said in the August issue of 
the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. 800 Number Available for 
Gay-Life Questions 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to help Americans deal with the emotions and questions that arise 
when a relative or friend reveals his or her homosexuality, P-FLAG -- Parents, 
Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays -- will open a one-day national 
telephone hot line on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Callers to (800) 95-P-FLAG ((800) 957-3524) will receive information about 
support groups and counseling. The line will be staffed from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
PDT.

'90S FAMILY; THE FRIEND TREND; IN THE TOO-BUSY LIVES OF TODAY'S FAMILY, MANY 
PARENTS TRY TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BY BEING SOMETHING EXPERTS SAY THEY 
SHOULDN'T -- PALS TO THEIR KIDS.

<P>
 Jenna invited her 16-year-old son to use her home for sex with his girlfriend, 
but eventually the sounds of her "baby's" passion started grating on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Did I raise a rabbit?' " recalled the 36-year-old mother of one. 
But "better that than in some car or cheap motel. I know they're going to do 
it. I'm not jumping with joy, but I figure if I'm open -- if I'm my son's 
friend -- he'll be open with me. I want to be able to protect my son." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also a friend to her son because her mother wasn't one to her. "My 
mother was a tyrant," she said. "A large, looming and distant figure. We spent 
all our time together fighting. I don't want to ruin my quality time with (my 
son) fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say reasons such as these are causing more adults who head the 
nation's 36.1 million families with children to be friendly parents rather than 
disciplining elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now stylish to be a buddy with your child," said Richard M. Eyre, 
co-author of "3 Steps to a Strong Family" (Simon & Schuster, 1994) and the 
bestseller "Teaching Your Children Values" (Simon & Schuster, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most parents want to get along with their children, Eyre 
acknowledged. An informal and gregarious relationship with a child is fine, 
even healthy, if it fosters respect and allows them to savor time together. 
</P>
<P>
 But such relationships become detrimental when parents feel reluctant to teach 
their children morals and manners or to devise -- and enforce -- family rules. 
"A lot of parents are afraid their children won't like them if they 
discipline," said Eyre, a Salt Lake City father of nine. "But in their hearts, 
they know the last thing a child needs or wants is a true friendship with a 
parent. It's unfortunate, though, because I'm noticing parents aren't listening 
to their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Eyre and other experts attribute the friend trend to longer work hours by 
parents, meaning less supervision; an increase in single parents who are too 
overwhelmed to discipline, and more babies being raised by teen parents, with 
both generations needing discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where the recession has lingered longer than in other 
regions, parents are at their friendliest, experts say. They often work 16-hour 
days at two part-time jobs. Or they may toil until exhaustion, hoping that they 
will not receive a pink slip after their company downsizes. All of which cuts 
away time with their children, explained Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the 
Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Parents) will slip into the just-friends technique because they feel guilty 
about being at work all the time," said Galinsky, noting a 1993 institute study 
that found 66% of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide wanted more time with 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year ago, the study reflected Robert Hendricks' struggle between 
work and family. The 37-year-old Inglewood resident said he devoted too much 
time to helping others as a minister and social worker and not enough time with 
his sons -- Adam and Tyler, now 11 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would come home too tired to be a parent," recalled Hendricks, who has 
since dropped his ministry job. "It was much easier to leave the disciplining 
up to Colleen and just be friends with my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids saw me as the mean person and Robert as the fun teddy bear," added 
Hendricks' wife, Colleen, 36.  
</P>
<P>
 Hendricks has since experienced "a recent awakening." His oldest, nearing 
adolescence, would smart-mouth his father, even after Hendricks repeatedly 
ordered him to quit.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I asked myself why I needed to be Adam's friend. I recognize so 
strongly now that it's because, as a child, I could never talk to my alcoholic 
father. I wanted so bad to tell him that I had been sexually abused, but I 
never could. I wanted to make sure my sons could tell me anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He is now a disciplinarian. "As a social worker, I know that kids want 
discipline even if they don't know it," said Hendricks, who works at Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center. "They need structure and stability. Otherwise, 
children will feel neglected and grow up with low self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 They could grow up like Becca, a Northern California 13-year-old depicted in 
Peggy Orenstein's "Schoolgirls: Young Women, Self-Esteem and the Confidence 
Gap," to be published by Doubleday in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Becca's mother treated her daughter like a best friend. She told Becca that 
she feared her husband -- Becca's father -- and that sex with him was "like 
rape for her every night." She told Becca her deepest secret: putting the child 
she had as a teen-ager up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're two eyes of a hurricane," Becca told the author, explaining 
her relationship to her mother. ("Becca" is a pseudonym Orenstein created to 
ensure the girl's privacy.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Becca's mother inappropriately confided in her daughter, contributing to 
Becca's low self-esteem," said Orenstein, describing Becca's distorted body 
image, erratic eating patterns and plummeting grades. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 study in the Journal of Research on Adolescence revealed that mothers 
are apt to confide in their daughters, like a friend, about family problems. 
Consequently, such a distressful divulgence makes daughters prone to 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 American parents falsely believe that they can be complete friends with their 
children before age 18, said Yannick Sable, who observed family relationships 
when she lived in Africa and Europe. The single mother found parents in other 
countries almost always act as superiors to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Those parents "guide children into maturity before being their true friend. 
This makes for a stronger (adult) friendship," said Sable, 50, who shares a 
condo in Studio City with her 29-year-old daughter and 4-year-old 
granddaughter. "My daughter and I like living together as best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Cancel, a 33-year-old mail carrier from Torrance, said she sometimes has 
to resist acting like a friend to Christina, the 9-year-old daughter she and 
her husband adopted two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Christina to feel confident that I won't beat or abandon her. And, of 
course, I want her to like us and her new home," said Cancel, who also has a 
17-year-old son. "But my main job is to care for (Christina) as a mother. I 
can't be a friend to her when she's this young." 
</P>
<P>
 Christina giggled at the possibility. "Parents are supposed to be parents. 
Friends are younger than parents," she explained. "But (parents) can be -- they 
are -- my favorite people in the whole world."

'90S FAMILY; BALANCED BEHAVIOR FOR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA SAUERWEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't know if you're too friendly or unfriendly with your child? Parenting 
experts offer some guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 TOO STRICT 
</P>
<P>
 * A mother who yells at her 8-year-old daughter for putting on lipstick and 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
 * A father who swears and then severely punishes his 12-year-old son for 
swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents who prohibit their 17-year-old daughter from dating. 
</P>
<P>
 TOO FRIENDLY 
</P>
<P>
 * A mother who routinely permits her 8-year-old daughter to wear makeup, 
figuring she's going through a harmless phase. 
</P>
<P>
 * A father who swears and allows -- even encourages -- his 12-year-old son to 
swear too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents who set no dating rules -- not even a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 JUST RIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 * A mother who gently explains to her 8-year-old daughter that she's not 
allowed to wear lipstick and blush because she is too young. 
</P>
<P>
 It's natural for a child to want to do inappropriate things, said Ellen 
Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research 
group in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, parents shouldn't be angry. They also shouldn't worry about 
aggravating a situation with discipline. If parents act like true friends, 
their children will push and push and push for whatever it is they want. (The 
child) will never be satisfied. Kids need parents to set limits like they need 
safety rails." 
</P>
<P>
 * A father who refrains from uttering bad words and holds his son to a 
no-swearing rule. The first time he hears an obscenity from the child, he 
explains why it's not allowed, firmly tells him not to do it again and warns 
him that he'll have to face a consequence if he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned the hard way that you have to stop (the misbehavior) right away," 
said Robert Hendricks, a social worker at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center 
and a father of two. "One of my sons would talk back to me. I'd warn him not to 
do it again. He'd do it again, and nothing would happen. Slowly, I learned that 
discipline earns their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents who allow their teen-age daughter to date, provided she obeys all 
household rules. Rules might pertain to curfew, completing homework, 
introducing her date to parents or washing the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of discipline teaches them structure," said Richard M. Eyre, author 
of several parenting books. "Children are grateful for it even if they don't 
know it. It's the classic case of the conscious versus the subconscious. For 
example, (teen-agers) may brag about having no curfew, but inside they're 
crying out. It gives them an unstable feeling. They feel like their parents 
don't care about them enough to protect them and teach them right from wrong. 
Be friendly, but don't forget the discipline." KRISTINA SAUERWEIN

SHERIFF URGES O.C. TO HURRY JAIL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates urged Orange County officials to move forward immediately 
on expanding Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange and adding more beds to James A. 
Musick Branch Jail in Irvine to ease an "impossible" overcrowding situation 
that has forced early release of nearly 55,000 inmates in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current overcrowding of our existing jail facilities forces me to release 
early tens of thousands of criminals from jail," Gates wrote in a seven-page 
letter that county planners received Monday. "Our current inability to provide 
enough beds for the number of inmates booked continues to be our most 
frustrating problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also suggested that the county reconsider building a jail on a site next 
to The Pond of Anaheim -- a plan that has been virtually abandoned since the 
new arena was constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail overcrowding has been a vexing problem in Orange County for a decade, but 
the troubles have been compounded in recent weeks by inmate disturbances and 
concerns that the new "three strikes and you're out" law is further cramming 
county lockups. 
</P>
<P>
 To make his case for more beds, the sheriff loosed a barrage of statistics on 
the toll of chronic crowding -- and urged the controversial expansion of the 
Orange branch jail without delay for an environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said Tuesday that expanding existing jails would 
be a better solution than taking yet another stab at building a new jail in the 
county. He said the Central Men's Jail and Intake Release Center in Santa Ana 
should be added to the list of possible expansion sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Theo Lacy expansion is simply buying some time, but it is not solving the 
bigger problem of meeting the need of jail space over the long haul," Steiner 
said. "It is appropriate to look at these sites. It's easier to expand an 
existing site than site a new jail. From my perspective, Theo Lacy, Santa Ana 
and James Musick offer the most practical expansion opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The county is studying the environmental impact of a three-phase expansion of 
Theo Lacy that would include nine additional housing units with up to 4,480 
jail beds. City of Orange officials and residents have sued the county in an 
effort to block the housing of maximum-security inmates at Theo Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to the county's Environmental Management Agency, Gates stated 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county is about 3,200 jail beds short of its current needs, and by the 
year 2006 will be in need of nearly 7,100 new beds. "What that means," Gates 
wrote, "is that unless we get more jail beds, tens of thousands of increasingly 
more dangerous criminals will be released back into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1993, a total of more than 94,800 days were cut from the sentences of 
3,398 inmates who on average saw 20% of their sentences slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 * A total of 826 inmates -- an average of 2.3 per day -- who were released 
early from jail in 1993 were arrested on new charges during the time they would 
have been in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly 60% of the people who were cited and released for misdemeanor 
offenses have failed to appear in court on their citations. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state's new "three strikes and you're out" law is translating into 
longer stays in jail and increased demands for beds. Currently, there are 
nearly 60 inmates who qualify for permanent incarceration under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the sheriff has been under federal court order to limit the 
overcrowded conditions in his jails. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Gates has turned to early releases and a cite-and-release 
program. Since 1986, Gates said, he has stopped booking into jail most 
misdemeanor arrestees or people with arrest warrants with bail under $5,000 
because of limited bed space. Furthermore, he said he does not accept federal 
or state parole violators at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gates is legally responsible for remedying the overcrowding 
situation, he has no authority to build or acquire new jail beds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, his lobbying efforts for more space have been thwarted. 
County officials have been unable to find either the money or a politically 
acceptable location for a new jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many county officials say the Theo Lacy expansion is the most viable 
short-term solution to the overcrowding problem. A recent report by the county 
administrative office also concluded that the most "cost effective" way to 
bring new jail beds into the system is expand existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Gates has pinned his hopes on the Theo Lacy expansion, which he wants 
to happen as soon as possible. In his letter to county planners, Gates said he 
thinks an environmental impact study would be costly and is unnecessary under 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Orange officials have also written to the county planners about the 
expansion, asking them to consider additions at other jail facilities instead. 
They also raise the possibility of building a jail at sites such as the Marine 
Corps air stations at Tustin and El Toro, which are scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is extremely concerned about the negative economic impact of the 
proposed expansion of the Theo Lacy on the city in general and surrounding 
businesses in particular," City Manager David F. Dixon wrote to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange lawsuit against the county over placing maximum-security inmates in 
Theo Lacy was filed earlier this year. Theo Lacy was intended for only a 
minimum- to medium-security inmates. City and county officials are trying to 
reach an out-of-court settlement, which may cover jail expansion as well. Early 
Criminal Release 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 3,398 sentenced criminals were released from Orange County jails 
after serving an average of 80% of their time. A sample of serious crimes and 
the number of prisoners who had time shaved off their sentences: 04,28,10,16,16

BUS-SIGNAL BILL FRUSTRATES STILL-GRIEVING O.C. FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Lanni is nothing short of bewildered after his first brush with the 
business of making laws in California. 
</P>
<P>
 When his 7-year-old son was struck and killed by a pickup truck while getting 
off a school bus in Laguna Niguel in April, Lanni decided to salvage something 
positive from the family tragedy. He began pushing for a state law making it a 
mandatory requirement that bus drivers flash warning lights to get traffic to 
stop whenever children are disembarking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni, an electrical engineer, figured the law was just plain common sense and 
would be a legislative slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 But not in Sacramento. Despite the best efforts of Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), one of the Legislature's veteran lawmakers, the bill was 
watered down in committee because of fears that the flashing lights could cause 
traffic accidents and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's measure, which won final approval Tuesday in the Senate on a 38-0 
vote, gives school districts broad discretion to pick and choose the bus stops 
where drivers should flash the warning lights. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lanni, that's simply not good enough. "They've emasculated the bill," he 
said. "In it's present form, this bill is tantamount to no change at all. I 
don't know what the underlying motivations are, but it's apparent the people in 
Sacramento are out of touch with reality." 
</P>
<P>
 With the measure now headed to the desk of Gov. Pete Wilson, who has not taken 
a stance on the issue, Lanni said he might write a letter asking the governor 
to veto it. "My fear is passage of this bill will lead people to believe 
something has been done, when in reality nothing has been done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she understands Lanni's frustrations with the ways and wiles of 
the state Legislature, but emphasized that her measure is a good first step and 
does make some changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pushed as hard as we could," Bergeson said. "I think we came out with the 
best we could. It will be a benefit, and lives will be saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing law requires all cars to stop and wait when the warning lights on a 
school bus are activated, but the driver is required to flash the lights only 
when students are going to cross the street. In addition, the driver must 
escort all pupils in preschool through the eighth grade and carry a hand-held 
"STOP" sign to alert approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's bill would leave it up to school districts to decide if the warning 
lights should be used at certain dangerous stops, even those where no children 
are expected to cross a street. But a district would have to get permission 
from the California Highway Patrol and the local traffic engineering department 
before designating such a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was extensively altered during a Senate Transportation Committee 
hearing after lawmakers grew fearful that use of the warning lights at every 
stop would do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Mehdi Morshed, a committee consultant, said mandatory flashing lights would 
have had "serious ramifications," giving children a false sense of security, 
causing traffic congestion and increasing the likelihood of accidents. The 
problems would be particularly amplified at bus stops along busy, multilane 
thoroughfares where traffic speeds often approach 50 m.p.h., Morshed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface it looks like a wonderful idea," Morshed said. "But when you 
apply it to major arterials, it just simply doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have also found that when people are faced with too many impediments 
during the daily drive -- be it a stop sign, a red traffic light or an 
ambulance siren -- they eventually begin to disregard them. The same, Morshed 
said, could happen with the flashing warning lights of a school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni doesn't accept such justifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk about driver inconvenience," he said. "I suggest someone talk to 
the fellow who hit my son and ask him how much of an inconvenience it would 
have been to stop. I think he'd say he would have been glad to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni's son, Tommy, was killed after only his second day at school in Orange 
County, where the family had moved from New York. The boy was riding the school 
bus for the first time and, apparently by mistake, got off one stop too early. 
He was hit as he tried to cross to a gated housing complex that he probably 
believed was his neighborhood. Neither the driver of the car that struck Tommy 
nor the driver of the school bus was charged in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents filed a lawsuit against the Capistrano Unified School District but 
have not specified how much they are seeking. An earlier damage claim filed 
with the district sought $10 million to compensate for the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni notes that mandatory flashing lights are the law in numerous states, 
among them New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia, Texas and Nevada. 
Some states also require that school buses be equipped with flip-out stop 
signs, which are deployed when the bus stops to let off children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm baffled," Lanni said. "Why does California feel there's no need for a 
change when all these other states did something about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 He also argues that current California law fails to take into account the 
unpredictable nature of schoolchildren as they disembark from a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we're dealing with 5-year-olds and up," Lanni said. "You 
cannot predict what they're going to do. It can be something as simple as a 
dropped piece of paper that blows into the street and the kid goes after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni promised to be back next year to push for mandatory use of the warning 
lights. In the meantime, the family continues to grapple with the loss of their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day-by-day thing," he said. "We spend our Sunday mornings at the 
cemetery now. We're still trying to come to grips with what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty tough to think about what happened, the senselessness of it, then 
go listen to these politicians with their bureaucratic baloney, knowing that if 
they had done what other states have done, my son would probably be alive 
today. It's hard to swallow that."

PAROLE REVOKED FOR GANG LEADER TURNED PEACEMAKER; LEGAL SYSTEM: PASSIONATE 
SUPPORTERS CALL TOMMY ELAM A HERO. BUT HEARING OFFICER SAYS FACTS REQUIRE 
INCARCERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the end it did not matter that Tommy Elam's 78-year-old grandmother said 
the marijuana was not his. It did not matter that singer Harry Belafonte had 
flown in from New York to lend his support, that dozens of youngsters rallied 
outside his parole hearing Tuesday afternoon, or that an impressive array of 
community leaders called Elam a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 What mattered to the hearing officer was that some marijuana, a set of scales 
and some bullets had been found in Elam's bedroom, that Elam had gone to Las 
Vegas with a community drill team without permission from his parole officer 
and that two years ago, Elam had admitted smoking marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 So Elam, a former gang leader who community leaders say was transformed during 
the last two years into a soft-spoken and charismatic peacemaker, is once again 
locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 To his angry and passionate advocates, Elam is a bitter symbol of a mindless 
criminal justice bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case says it doesn't matter what you do, it doesn't matter who you 
help," said Constance Rice, an NAACP attorney who says she has seen Elam take 
guns out of people's hands, nurture small children and quiet moody crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy is a symbol for so many young black men in Watts," said Margery 
Tabankin, director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee. "If the system 
doesn't recognize what Tommy has accomplished and done, it gives a signal to 
those kids . . . that there's no hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Released on parole in 1992 after serving time in a youth facility for a 
robbery conviction, Elam went to work for the Watts-based Common Ground 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works with young people. Mentored by 
the group's director, Fred Williams, Elam helped maintain a tenuous gang truce 
in the tough Watts public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Elam's backers say the 22-year-old is neither a grandstander nor a taker, but 
rather a young man with an intuitive gift for steering people away from 
violence, whether they be girls in a fistfight or gang members with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a diamond in the rough," said Williams, who made Elam assistant 
director of Common Ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph Castro, the hearing representative for the state Youthful Offender 
Parole Board who decided Elam's case Tuesday, said he was impressed by the 
testimony of the character witnesses called on Elam's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe what they were saying," Castro said after announcing that 
Elam had been found in violation of his parole and was being sent to the Youth 
Training School in Chino for a year, where he will enter a drug treatment 
program. "However, they were not privy to the history of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to claims by Elam's supporters that he has been a model parolee, 
Castro said Elam admitted to marijuana use twice shortly after his release, and 
later in 1992 also resisted arrest. His parole was continued at that time, and 
it was recommended that he enroll in a community-based drug treatment program, 
but he did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were not even interested in Elam when on Aug. 16 they searched the room 
he shared with his brother Tony at his grandmother's South Gorman Avenue house. 
They were investigating a murder and wanted to question Tony. They searched the 
house -- citing, according to Williams, an incomplete search warrant -- and 
found in the brothers' room a canvas bag with about 1 1/3 ounces of marijuana, 
$358, a scale, five bullets and 157 small plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers, who said the marijuana was not theirs, were taken into custody. 
Tony, also on parole, was cleared of any involvement in the murder, but both 
were booked for possession of marijuana for the purpose of sale. The Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office did not find enough evidence to file 
charges, police said, but the parole office was notified and requested that the 
brothers be detained pending parole board violation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony's hearing has yet to be scheduled. The parole office, picketed by Common 
Ground youngsters for two days after the brothers were jailed, moved up Tommy's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Belafonte, who knew Tommy through the entertainer's work with Common Ground, 
flew in from New York for the closed hearing at the Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the rest of this city, the rest of this state, the rest of this country 
treated that community with enormous indifference, (Tommy and Tony) have worked 
. . . to pull together a cohesive, and a very meaningful program that has put 
the lives of hundreds of people on the right track," Belafonte said before the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the case against Elam "weak and meaningless," Belafonte warned that it 
will have ramifications. "The presence of myself and others here is to serve 
notice that from this day on, what goes on in South-Central, what goes on with 
Common Ground, will not be just the private business of that community. It has 
a national constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Belafonte in calling for the release of the Elam brothers were actor 
Danny Glover, religious and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy is a critical voice, a critical presence on the streets of South Los 
Angeles helping to keep peace," said Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Elam's grandmother, Edna Brooks, who raised the brothers, and her 
husband, George, were also on hand. Brooks, who had 18 children and has more 
than 100 grandchildren, says the marijuana belonged to a third grandson who had 
stayed in the same room a few weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of waiting in a courtyard outside the hearing room, the 
crowd greeted Elam's parole revocation glumly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they think this community is going to stand and watch this happen . . . 
they got another thing coming," said an angry Williams. "We're saying that the 
parole board, the Police Department, this criminal justice system has too much 
latitude to lock up black and Latino young men in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Complained the Rev. Jim Lawson Jr.: "Why isn't the parole board excited that a 
youngster (who had been engaged) in juvenile misbehavior and criminal behavior 
for 2 1/2 years is doing productive, creative work in the community?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the California Youth Authority Parole agency there was disagreement. 
Although Elam's parole officer recommended to the board that parole be revoked, 
the regional administrator recommended that it be continued, with a sanction, 
such as electronic monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at the two years (of) what I consider average to above average 
parole," Levan Bell said in an interview before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro decided otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he (made) some very big mistakes in the way he conducted himself," 
Castro said.

IN CHINA, BROWN CITES SUCCESS ON TRADE, RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown asserted Tuesday that a new U.S. emphasis 
on "commercial diplomacy" toward China is not only producing big trade deals 
but also progress on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal U.S.-China dialogue on human rights issues, suspended in the spring, 
will resume in late September when Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visits the 
United States, Brown announced at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 While resumption of talks will not automatically benefit Chinese dissidents, 
Brown treated renewal of the dialogue as a significant step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commercial engagement has had a greater impact than the threat of commercial 
disengagement," he said, adding that he was "exhilarated by the results of our 
first 2 1/2 days in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Brown's arrival Saturday, executives of leading U.S. corporations 
traveling with him have "already signed agreements with a total value of almost 
$5 billion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came with high expectations about our ability to have a profoundly 
positive impact on the bilateral relationship between China and the United 
States," he said. "We have already met and surpassed those expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The overall tone of Brown's remarks Tuesday, both at the news conference and 
in a business lunch speech, was the warmest here by any top U.S. official since 
the 1989 crackdown on the Tian An Men Square pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton severed the link between human rights and trade issues in 
May. But Brown went further in his comments Tuesday, stressing that while the 
United States wants to see human rights progress here, threats are of no use. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can adopt a 'feel-good' policy, which causes you to have the ability to 
make strong statements and achieve no results from those statements," Brown 
said. "Or you can adopt a pragmatic, common-sense policy, which helps you 
achieve your goals." 
</P>
<P>
 In a lunch speech to U.S. and Chinese business representatives, Brown outlined 
a vision of "commercial diplomacy" that he said can bring greater shared 
prosperity to the two nations and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has sent substantive signals that we regard China as a 
commercial ally and a partner -- that China's long history is deserving of 
respect and even deference that she has not always received," Brown said to the 
business group. "Once divided by ideology, we are now drawn together by shared 
economic interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown brushed off a threat made Monday by his counterpart, Foreign Trade 
Minister Wu Yi, that if China's effort to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) by the year's end is unsuccessful, Beijing will no longer be 
bound by previous trade and economic commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at his news conference whether Wu's comments cast any cloud over the 
generally upbeat tone of his visit, Brown said: "You have to be a pretty 
negative person to be looking for a cloud today, with the incredible progress 
that we've made in just 2 1/2 days. I don't see any cloud. I think we continue 
to make progress in our discussions with the Chinese" about GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of exhilarated optimism, reminiscent of attitudes often shown by 
high-level U.S. delegations to China in the 1970s and 1980s, was also evident 
among the 24 executives of leading U.S. corporations traveling with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been extremely pleased with the dialogue, with the opening up," said 
Leslie McCraw, chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corp. "The 
attitude of the Chinese has been exceptionally positive. . . . We view China as 
clearly one of the great emerging market opportunities for a company like 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's visit marks a shift of the main focus in U.S.-China relations "to 
business issues, commercial issues, rather than philosophical issues," McCraw 
said. "I think these other agendas can be addressed if we are engaged 
commercially." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of most of the agreements cited by Brown were not immediately 
released. While the sums involved totaled more than $4.7 billion, not all of 
this amount represents U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Entergy Corp. said Tuesday it signed a memorandum of understanding, in 
partnership with the Lippo Group in Hong Kong, for a Chinese power plant deal 
it valued at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown presided at a signing ceremony for the Wing Group to build a 
$2.2-billion liquefied-natural-gas turbine. AES China Generating Co., a joint 
venture with Virginia-based AES Corp., signed a $1.5-billion contract to 
upgrade a power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW Inc. announced that with a Chinese partner, Suman Group Ltd., it signed an 
agreement with Beijing Cable TV Network to supply 1 million de-scrambler units 
for household delivery of television programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint Communications Corp. announced a pact to expand China's connections to 
the global Internet service, which links an estimated 2 million computers in 
154 countries.

STATE BRACES FOR IMPACT OF LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From factories in Palmdale and Sunnyvale to a supplier's plant in El Monte to 
the Downtown Los Angeles offices of leading charities, Californians were 
bracing Tuesday for the fallout from Lockheed Corp.'s plans to merge with 
Martin Marietta Corp., creating the nation's largest defense firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In formally announcing the $10-billion deal, the chief executives of the two 
companies predicted that some jobs will be lost as they streamline their 
operations. No figures on job cuts were disclosed, nor were any specific sites 
identified for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a minimum, Lockheed -- founded in Santa Barbara in 1916 and a 
cornerstone of the Southland's aerospace industry for decades -- will abandon 
its headquarters building in Calabasas, where 250 people work. The new Lockheed 
Martin Corp. will be based in Bethesda, Md., home of Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure eastward of Lockheed's top managers will be a "psychological 
blow" to the state's already reeling aerospace business, said Richard A. 
Bitzinger, an analyst with the Defense Budget Project in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Lockheed still employs 20,000 in California -- mostly in the 
Silicon Valley, Palmdale and Ontario -- and Martin Marietta has about 7,500 
workers in the state. Together, those figures make California the largest job 
center for the new Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which requires the approval of federal antitrust regulators and the 
two firms' shareholders, will create a defense giant with nearly $23 billion in 
annual sales. Lockheed makes jet fighters, ballistic missiles and satellites, 
while Martin Marietta is a leading producer of defense electronics, satellite 
gear and space launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep, who is slated to become chairman of the 
merged company, sought Tuesday to dispel the idea that California would again 
be the victim of job losses resulting from a defense industry marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an infrastructure there," Tellep said in an interview in New York, 
where the deal was announced. "I am optimistic that, other than the dislocation 
of the headquarters, the long-term outlook for California has to be positive as 
a result of this transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in California was decidedly mixed, however. Some Lockheed workers 
embraced the deal, saying it would help keep Lockheed strong as Pentagon 
spending slips further. Others worried about losing their jobs or being 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Agovino, a manager at Lockheed's 4,000-employee Skunk Works aircraft 
development plant in Palmdale, noted that mergers often create a duplication of 
effort, so "the possibility (of layoffs) always exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said the amalgamation of the two storied firms is a symptom 
of ongoing changes in the defense business that have wiped out more than 
300,000 aerospace-related jobs in California alone since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The root causes of those changes -- upheaval and contraction in defense 
spending with the end of the Cold War -- will further whittle California's 
aerospace payroll, regardless of whether Lockheed and Martin Marietta join 
forces, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 People directly in the path of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta deal, such as 
parts suppliers, are having to re-evaluate their sales potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent-Fletcher Co., an El Monte-based provider of fuel tanks and electronic 
products for Lockheed's F-16 fighters, fears that Lockheed will start using 
Martin Marietta's products instead, said Richard Simpson, the firm's director 
of business development. 
</P>
<P>
 Charitable groups fretted that the loss of Lockheed's California headquarters 
could slice into the largess of one of the state's top corporate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed contributed more than $3.5 million to arts, civic and education 
programs in California in 1992, and the company annually has donated about 
$500,000 to United Way in Los Angeles County, said John Moawad, senior vice 
president of resource development for the charity group's Los Angeles corporate 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate donors usually support United Way units nearest their headquarters, 
but Moawad said officials are hopeful Lockheed will continue supporting 
charities in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, small business operators who cater to Lockheed's facilities also 
expressed concern that the merger might damage their sales. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fresh Choice, a favorite noontime restaurant for Lockheed's Sunnyvale 
workers, manager Juan Mendivit said the company accounts for as much as 90% of 
his 450 or so customers each day. "If you lay off more," he said, "it will 
definitely hurt business." 
</P>
<P>
 But some aerospace analysts said the Sunnyvale operation -- home of Lockheed's 
missiles and spacecraft group, which employs 11,900 -- could realize a net gain 
in workers if the new Lockheed Martin decides to pare other, smaller spacecraft 
plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. (The company also would have a fourth 
major spacecraft site in Denver.) 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sunnyvale is a major employer of skilled engineers -- not just 
production workers -- its operations are less likely to be uprooted from 
California in pursuit of lower wage rates, said Paul Harbison, an aerospace 
analyst with the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects also appear slight for Lockheed Martin moving the top-secret Skunk 
Works research facility out of Palmdale -- at least for now. In recent years, 
Lockheed spent more than $200 million expanding its Palmdale facilities to 
accommodate the transfer of Skunk Works employees from Burbank. Martin Marietta 
has no similar group of workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Ralph Vartabedian in Washington, Martha Groves in 
Sunnyvale, Phil Sneiderman in Palmdale and Jill Leovy in Chatsworth contributed 
to this story.

SIMPSON CASE BOOSTS MICROBE CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A unique heat-loving microbe found in a 158-degree Yellowstone National Park 
hot spring 28 years ago has become an important player in the O.J. Simpson 
murder case, to the delight of conservationists who have suddenly been handed a 
provocative symbol for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The microbe, dubbed Thermus aquaticus, is a key ingredient in a DNA 
fingerprinting technique crucial to the prosecution's case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the Simpson case drawing global attention to the potential of DNA 
technology, environmentalists and others are attempting to capitalize on the 
publicity and raise public consciousness about the conservation issues 
surrounding the crucial microbes. They argue that Thermus aquaticus and its 
many uses make a compelling argument for taking better care of the habitats of 
a variety of microorganisms being found in springs and caverns around the 
country, as well as in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 National Park Service Director Roger Kennedy proposed in a recent interview 
that commercial microbe hunters -- "bio-prospectors," as they are called -- pay 
a royalty to the park service. He noted that miners, loggers and ranchers who 
make a living from federal lands are being pressed to contribute more to the 
conservation of those lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as teams of researchers probed Yellowstone and other national parks 
for the next golden microbe, Kennedy pointed out that Yellowstone never 
received a penny from the millions of dollars that industry has reaped from the 
commercial applications of Thermus aquaticus.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond revolutionizing police work, laboratory refinements of the microbe are 
helping in the diagnoses of the human immunodeficiency virus, Alzheimer's 
disease and sickle cell anemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists representing 39 schools, firms and research organizations currently 
have permits to prospect for microbes in Yellowstone's thermal waters. None of 
them pay for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the funds to properly study the impact it is having," Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he asked: Is the specter of the biotech industry "guzzling up pondsful of 
microbes" all that different from timber companies harvesting the national 
forests? "Doesn't the public, which pays for the upkeep of these places, have a 
right to expect some sort of contribution from those who are enriching 
themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 Few discoveries in nature have prompted conservationists to argue so strongly 
for promoting biodiversity, whether it involves subsidizing the national parks 
or paying private property owners to protect the habitats of rare plants and 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its value to criminology and medicine, Thermus aquaticus and similar 
microorganisms are showing promise as sweetening agents for the soft drink 
industry, as high-powered stain removers in detergents and as catalysts in the 
manufacture of clean-burning fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists studying the origins of the planet also are intrigued by the 
microbes, known as thermophiles. Their research has led beyond Yellowstone to 
deep-sea vents where kindred organisms are growing at temperatures above the 
boiling point of water. Because they thrive in a climate that may have 
prevailed when the earth was in its fiery infancy, these microorganisms could 
offer important clues to the nature of the earliest life forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "To date, Thermus aquaticus is the most spectacular example we have of the 
benefits of biodiversity," said Thomas Lovejoy, assistant secretary for 
external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution and a science adviser to the 
White House. "The thing to remember is that it (Thermus aquaticus) was 
accessible to science because its habitat had been protected for nearly a 
century," said Lovejoy. 
</P>
<P>
 But continued protection is not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 With 3 million people visiting Yellowstone each year, the costs of taking care 
of fragile resources can be enormous, said John Varley, the park's chief 
scientist. The park's annual $18-million budget, he says, is not always enough 
to keep the campgrounds open or the trails cleared, let alone baby-sit the 
36,000 geysers, steam vents, hot springs and mud pots where the biological 
treasures dwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaps in vigilance, sometimes because of staff shortages, have led to 
significant damage, some of it irreparable, Varley said. "People pitch things 
into a geyser. That plugs up the throat. It can dry up. Or there can be a 
change in temperature that wipes out a whole colony of microbial creatures." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation to enhance protection of Old Faithful and related phenomena has 
been languishing in Congress for three years. The legislation would prohibit 
any well-drilling on land adjacent to Yellowstone that might alter geothermal 
processes in the park. Opponents argue that the ban would interfere with 
private property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a growing number of federal agencies and U.S. firms that engage in 
international biological prospecting are entering into agreements with foreign 
governments, promising a share in the profits if discoveries in those countries 
lead to products. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cancer Institute, for example, has reached such agreements with 
the governments of Cameroon and Sarawak, where cancer institute researchers 
have isolated compounds from indigenous plants and vines that show promise in 
controlling HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the firm that has profited most from the microbe found in 
Yellowstone is a foreign company. The big Swiss pharmaceutical firm, 
Hoffmann-La Roche, acquired the patent on the polymerase chain reaction, or 
PCR, one of the processes at the heart of the Simpson investigation, which 
allows police to identify criminal suspects from tiny fragments of blood or 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The enzyme critical to the process was derived from Thermus aquaticus.  
</P>
<P>
 Government officials, including Park Service Director Kennedy and the 
Smithsonian's Lovejoy, believe that the same kind of agreements that govern 
international prospecting ought to be negotiated in the United States. Lovejoy 
would have them extend beyond the park so that private landowners could share 
in the profits of scientific discoveries made on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lovejoy's view, such a system of rewards is the most sensible way to 
encourage preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose the only hot spring left with Thermus aquaticus in it was on your 
property," Lovejoy said. "It makes sense for society to offer you some 
incentive to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Brewer, director of bio-products for the Monsanto-Searle Co., a 
major pharmaceutical and chemical company, contends that the government already 
has its hand deep in the industry's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes on our profits are high enough as it is," Brewer said, adding that the 
park service director's concerns about damage to resources are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go in there and take a teaspoonful of water. It's ludicrous to compare us 
to a mining company that tears up God knows how many acres of soil and rock." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the pharmaceutical industry's trade association, companies 
already pay royalties to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the government discovers a new drug, it turns to the industry to market 
(it)," said Steve Bircham, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America. "If the company makes money from it, the government 
asks for something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Some government experts say it would be difficult to craft a U.S. law on 
mandatory royalties that did not discourage scientific research. This might be 
especially true in national parks, where scientists already must contend with 
limitations on what they can take out of the parks, where they can work (out of 
sight of tourists) and how they must travel to remote areas (on foot or 
horseback). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nation's most prestigious biological prospecting organizations, the 
nonprofit Missouri Botanical Garden, which does research under contract with 
chemical companies, tries to avoid national parks because of the red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found we often can't get the access we need to the places in the 
parks where we want to go," said James S. Miller, a curator at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic to those concerns, Varley, the park's veteran senior scientist, 
has mixed feelings about imposing a royalty system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of straddle the fence on that issue," he said. "On the one hand, the 
parks don't have adequate budgets for resource protection. On the other hand, 
when I see something like Thermus aquaticus, which has turned out to be of such 
enormous benefit to humankind, I hesitate to raise a financial barrier to 
future research. The costs of bringing one drug to market, for example, are 
already so high." 
</P>
<P>
 Those matters were of little consequence to Thomas Brock in the fall of 1966 
as the Indiana University microbiologist sampled the hot waters of 
Yellowstone's Lower Geyser Basin in the woods about eight miles north of Old 
Faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock was doing basic research, studying how the environment affected certain 
microorganisms. Taking care not to burn himself and keeping an eye out for 
grizzly bears, Brock found something that wasn't supposed to exist: bacteria 
that thrived at temperatures above 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock, who has never profited from his discovery, admits he did not know what 
he had. "I had no reason to believe it would lead to something practical," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming his find Thermus aquaticus, he placed it in the public domain by 
donating it to the American Type Culture Collection, a sort of bank of 
microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade later, a scientist working with the microbe in a Cetus 
Corp. laboratory in Northern California isolated an enzyme that could survive 
repeated cycles of heating and cooling and thus was the ideal organism to drive 
the DNA copying process known as PCR. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Hoffmann-La Roche paid Cetus $300 million for the patents on the 
enzyme and on the PCR process. Last year, Kary Mullis, the Cetus scientist who 
perfected the PCR process, won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 For the National Park Service, becoming the proud progenitor of such a 
wondrous invention was a new experience and one reason government officials are 
scrambling to come up with a policy to protect its interests in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those issues we really hadn't thought about and it kind of got 
away from us," said Dennis Fenn, the park service's acting director for natural 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 With prospecting going on in at least three national parks, officials had 
better think fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Working at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky five years ago, Lawrence 
Mallory, a University of Massachusetts biochemist, found another microbe in a 
subterranean environment supposedly incapable of supporting life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we detected at about 150 to 170 feet below ground," Mallory said, "were 
diverse and active microbial communities surviving on very, very low nutrient 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the microbes produced a chemical that caught the eye of researchers at 
the University of Vermont's Regional Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary testing has shown Mallory's bacteria effective in killing leukemia 
cells harvested from laboratory mice. 
</P>
<P>
 While the researchers at the cancer center try to determine if Mallory's 
microbes are useful in treating cancer in humans, Mallory continues to look for 
hardy organisms deep underground. He has moved his work to Carlsbad Caverns 
National Park in New Mexico where, he said, he is continuing to find life forms 
where life is not supposed to exist.

ITO BARS DEFENSE FROM DETECTIVE'S MILITARY FILES; SIMPSON CASE: REQUEST FOR 
POLICE RECORDS NOT ADDRESSED. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, ACLU TO FIGHT GAG ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Tuesday denied the football great's 
attorneys the right to review a police detective's military records, saying 
there was nothing in the 20-year-old documents relevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, news organizations and the ACLU challenged a proposed gag order 
that could halt virtually all public discussion of the case by the parties 
closest to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order completed Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito said he had 
reviewed the military records of Detective Mark Fuhrman and found "no reports 
or other information relevant to the issues in this case." Among the records 
that Ito said he reviewed were Fuhrman's military personnel file, his medical 
records and his unit diary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's decision was a significant victory for the detective, who has been 
accused of racism by Simpson's attorneys but who has battled back, hiring his 
own lawyer and fighting defense requests for his personnel and military 
records. His attorney, Robert H. Tourtelot, argued in motions and in court that 
there was nothing embarrassing in Fuhrman's military files but that allowing 
Simpson's lawyers to review them was an invasion of the detective's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said in his order that he had balanced the detective's privacy rights 
against Simpson's right to gather evidence for his defense. After doing that, 
Ito said, he decided against releasing the military records. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he ordered them sealed and placed in the court file, to be used only 
in the event that Simpson's attorneys appeal his decision. Ito did not rule on 
the defense's request for Fuhrman's police personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also are seeking personnel records for three other 
detectives -- Tom Lange, Philip L. Vannatter and Ron Phillips -- all of whom 
played important roles in the Simpson case. Ito did not rule on those requests 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though defense attorneys want records for all four officers, they have 
launched their most aggressive attack on the integrity of Fuhrman, who said he 
found a bloody glove outside the Simpson mansion hours after the murders of 
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 A local television station reported Monday that Fuhrman had been reassigned to 
desk work and quoted his attorney as saying that Fuhrman was upset by the move. 
According to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David J. Gascon, however, that report is 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still working with the West L.A. homicide unit," Gascon said. "He is on 
vacation, and when he gets back he will still be a detective. He enjoys the 
full respect, support and admiration of the chief of police and the management 
staff of the Los Angeles Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon added that senior members of the department met with Fuhrman to discuss 
whether he would prefer to be moved to other duties until the furor surrounding 
the Simpson case subsides. If Fuhrman asks for such a move, his supervisors 
would be inclined to grant it, Gascon said, adding that there are no plans to 
transfer Fuhrman against his will. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, eight news organizations and the American Civil Liberties Union 
prepared to appear in court this morning to challenge a proposed protective 
order that the judge distributed to some attorneys in the case Monday but 
declined to release to reporters or lawyers representing news organizations. 
The media companies filed a brief Tuesday arguing that Ito's proposed 
protective order, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times, is too broad and 
unfairly denies the public access to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no sufficient justification for a blanket protective order in this 
case because release of the information sought to be restrained will not 
prevent the selection of an impartial jury in his case," states the motion on 
behalf of news organizations, including The Times. "Moreover, even assuming 
that some limited protective order was warranted, the proposed blanket 
protective order is impermissibly overbroad, in violation of the 1st Amendment 
to the United States Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 That motion, drafted by attorney Kelli L. Sager, adds that although the 
Simpson case has attracted unusual publicity, it is not the first to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there has been widespread media attention to this case, but it is 
hardly unprecedented," Sager said in her brief. "In numerous other cases, 
involving such high-profile defendants as Sirhan Sirhan, Charles Manson and the 
alleged Watergate conspirators, there has been widespread publicity -- even 
including disclosure of such potentially prejudicial information as one 
defendant's supposed intention to plead guilty, and a videotape of one 
defendant purportedly committing a criminal act -- yet the reviewing courts 
nonetheless found that an impartial jury was selected and a fair trial 
conducted." 
</P>
<P>
 ACLU attorneys did not file their motion Tuesday, but announced that they too 
intend to be in court today to object to Ito's proposed gag order. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his proposed order, the judge would bar virtually everyone associated 
with the case -- including police, prosecutors, defense lawyers, investigators, 
lab technicians and anyone working for either Simpson's camp or the government 
-- from discussing evidence, documents or exhibits in the case. His proposed 
gag would also seek to stop any of those people from making "any comment for 
public dissemination as to the weight, value or effect of any evidence as 
tending to establish or support guilt or innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ito has required that all documents, papers, letters or motions 
filed by any party in the case be submitted under seal. Those documents would 
only become publicly available when they were presented in open court, Ito said 
in his proposed order. 
</P>
<P>
 That provision was particularly upsetting to news organizations and civil 
libertarians, several of whom said they had never seen such a blanket order 
sealing motions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the motion on behalf of news organizations, Sager wrote that the court must 
make specific findings that there are "legitimate, compelling interests" that 
require motions to be sealed before doing so. "There is simply no adequate 
justification for entry of a blanket sealing order in this case," Sager said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of auto executive John Z. DeLorean, who was charged with cocaine 
smuggling in the mid-1980s, U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi, citing 
excessive pretrial publicity, ordered that all documents from lawyers be filed 
under seal -- the same move that Ito has proposed in the Simpson case. 
Associated Press fought the order in the DeLorean case, and won in a decision 
by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 That court advised Takasugi that he could not confer a blanket of secrecy on 
all court documents, but instead was required to consider each document 
separately and make sure each met the legal requirements for sealing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the prosecution of DeLorean has attracted a great deal of publicity, 
there are many other cases that generate significant public interest, yet 
documents in these other cases are routinely opened to the public without 
jeopardizing the fair trial guarantee," the 9th Circuit decision said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys were given until late Tuesday to file their 
arguments regarding Ito's proposed gag order. On Monday, Simpson lawyer Robert 
L. Shapiro said he agreed with Ito's suggestions, which he called "long 
overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did not comment on them during Monday's session. It was not clear 
whether either side filed a response to Ito's proposal Tuesday because the 
judge ordered that their responses, like all other documents in the case, be 
filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter is scheduled to be argued this morning as part of a session in 
which Ito also will address the exchange of evidence going on between defense 
attorneys and prosecutors. Among other things, Ito has indicated that he 
expects to disclose the contents of a sealed envelope first displayed during 
the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 That envelope has been widely reported to contain a knife, but so far, 
prosecutors have not been permitted to look inside.

PANAMA AND HONDURAS OFFER TO TAKE CUBANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Cuban refugees took to the seas again in large numbers Tuesday, the Clinton 
Administration won agreement from Panama, Honduras and another nation to accept 
up to 17,000 more Cuban migrants if detention camps at the Guantanamo Bay naval 
base fill up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said its cutters had picked up 1,234 migrants by 6 p.m. EDT, 
following the recovery of 112 on Monday. Early-warning planes reported the 
Florida Straits were loaded with rafts, with hundreds more about to be launched 
and still hundreds more reportedly being built on the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The resumption of the exodus came as officials disclosed that Panama has 
agreed to allow the United States to house up to 10,000 Cuban refugees at U.S. 
military bases near the Panama Canal. Officials also said that Honduras has 
agreed to take 5,000 more and Turks and Caicos Islands will accept 2,000 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Panama, to be announced formally by that country's new president, 
Ernesto Perez Balladares, when he takes office Thursday, is expected to provide 
a major boost to the Administration's new policy of sending refugees to 
detention camps rather than admitting them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama's outgoing president, Guillermo Endara, offered earlier this year to 
allow the United States to house Haitian refugees at the military bases, but he 
later backed off in the face of protests by Panamanians. The country's new 
administration has been more eager to cooperate with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements came as the U.S. and Cuban governments prepared to begin 
limited negotiations Thursday in New York on the migration problem, with hints 
that Washington may discuss broader economic and political issues if the talks 
go well. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of its own intense interest in the talks, Cuba announced that 
Ricardo Alarcon, former foreign minister and now president of the National 
Assembly, will head its negotiating team. The U.S. side will be led by Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State Michael Skol. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed deluge of refugees came as a disappointment to the Administration, 
which had been hoping its message that the rafters would no longer be granted 
immigrant status and should stay home had gotten through to ordinary Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said there still was a possibility that the refugee flow would abate 
over the next few days. "Anything's still possible, but there's just no way to 
tell this early in the game," one veteran Cuba-watcher said. "We're continuing 
to watch the situation closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pentagon reported Tuesday that the number of Cubans being 
detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay had risen to 15,471, with 
another 790 on Navy warships headed for the refugee camp. A total of 14,308 
Haitians are in separate facilities at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said they hope to expand the detention camps at Guantanamo 
Bay to accommodate almost 40,000 refugees this week, with hopes of enlarging 
them later this month to take up to 60,000. So far, military construction 
battalions have been barely keeping pace with the number of Haitian and Cuban 
refugees they need to house. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Col. Douglas Kennett, a Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. officials were 
doing what they could to make the detainees' experience there more pleasant, 
including providing education programs, religious services, and soccer and 
baseball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned that conditions there are still harsh. "I would not kid 
anyone -- it's not summer camp at Guantanamo." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, mid-level officials led by Deputy National Security 
Adviser Samuel (Sandy) Berger met Tuesday to write formal negotiating 
instructions for this week's U.S.-Cuban talks, prescribing a cautious course, 
at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructions being given to Skol will direct him to rebuff politely any 
attempt by the Cubans to broaden the talks to include other issues, such as the 
31-year-old trade embargo, a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials reiterated that if Cuba cooperates on the immigration issue, the 
Administration will be willing to discuss repealing the policy it imposed 
earlier this month that prohibits Cuban Americans from sending money to their 
relatives on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 And some officials have hinted at even broader talks if those work out. "We're 
waiting for (Cuban President Fidel) Castro to take positive steps on migration 
and other issues" before offering to broaden the talks to include other issues, 
one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration strategists reaffirmed Tuesday that the basic elements of the 
U.S. proposal remain unchanged: 
</P>
<P>
 First, Washington will offer to relax the standards that it has imposed for 
granting political asylum to Cubans, and will speed up processing of 
applications for immigration visas to accommodate close to the current ceiling 
of 27,845 legal entrants a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will offer to grant entry rights to cousins and grandparents of Cuban 
Americans, instead of just immediate family members. "But there are still some 
details to be worked out, and no final decisions have been made," one senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration plans to press Havana to accept 
repatriation of some of the dozens of convicted criminals whom Cuba sent over 
during the Mariel boat lift of 1980. They are now being held in U.S. jails. 
</P>
<P>
 And Washington also intends to bring up what some officials have called 
"credible evidence" that Cuba has sent at least 100 prisoners into the Florida 
Straits as "refugees" recently, as it did during Mariel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is deliberately downplaying the New York talks, to the 
point that one White House spokesman claimed that they were "regularly 
scheduled" -- although the Administration never sought to fix a date for them 
until the flood of refugees appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 And top Administration officials have deliberately stopped publicly discussing 
any possibility of further dealings with Cuba if a deal is reached on the 
immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the United States would 
consider political concessions if Castro enacts serious political and economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, a Christopher aide said: "We're trying to freeze the ball on 
that. We don't want Castro to get any signal that might encourage him . . . to 
come and stiff us (in the New York talks) as a way of trying to squeeze more 
out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Panama was by far the most significant offer of refugee aid 
from any country in the region. The Administration also has received pledges of 
cooperation from Venezuela, St. Lucia and Guyana, but none has said 
specifically how many Cuban refugees it would accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Wire service reports from Cuba told of large numbers of boat people putting 
the finishing touches on makeshift rafts on the beaches just east of Havana on 
Tuesday, after having stayed ashore during the weekend's squalls and heavy 
seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters reported that about 15 groups of rafters were gathered on Cojimar 
Beach, waiting for the evening cool. 
</P>
<P>
 At the shore below the modern suburb of Alamar, a young man called Joel said 
he planned on beating any change in policy coming from the U.S.-Cuba talks. "By 
Thursday, I'll be there." His boat, made of light wood, looked like a large 
packing case, Reuters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, the chief negotiator for Thursday's talks, was Cuba's U.N. ambassador 
for years and took part in negotiations that led to a 1984 U.S.-Cuban accord 
that set up the machinery for periodic consultations such as this one. Refugee 
Count 
</P>
<P>
 After dropping dramatically over the weekend, the number of Cuban rafters 
picked up by the Coast Guard is on the rise again.

FAMILY LEAVE LAW WORKING, DESPITE ARRAY OF PROBLEMS; LABOR: SOME EMPLOYERS ARE 
CONFUSED, SEE DISRUPTIONS. WORKERS TAKING UNPAID ABSENCE SOMETIMES FACE 
RETALIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When Mary Brennan's husband had heart surgery, she took advantage of the new 
federal family leave policy to take four weeks off from her job running the fax 
center at Millipore Corp. to care for him at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Labelle, public relations director at Stratus Computer in nearby 
Marlboro, Mass., and his wife also took four weeks of unpaid family medical 
leave to adopt a child from the former Soviet republic of Moldova. Now they are 
each working half time for three months so they can help 10-month-old Justin 
Nikolae adjust to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our paramount objective was to complete an adoption," Labelle said. "It was a 
sigh of relief to know that because a new federal law was on the books, our 
employers had to give us the time off and guarantee our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 But school secretary Debbie Pollio of New Castle, Pa., had a different 
experience. She was rebuffed when she asked for family medical leave to take 
her mother to Pittsburgh for cancer treatment. Although the leave eventually 
was granted after an appeal to the school board, her boss became so angry, she 
says, that he harassed her until she quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He royally reamed me out for going above his head," she said. Her husband had 
been right, she acknowledged, when he advised her not to expect the new family 
leave law to make a difference to her employer. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after Congress enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act, countless 
employees across the country have been able to take time off from work to 
respond to medical emergencies or family crises without fear of losing their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And many companies have found the law far less onerous than they believed it 
would be. For the most part, according to Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, the 
frivolous requests companies feared have not materialized and, because most 
workers can ill-afford unpaid time off, the overall number of requests has been 
smaller than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, companies have even improved on the federal law, crafting 
family leave policies more generous than required. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also clear that many employers are still confused about the law, and 
at least some are resisting it outright -- because of threatened disruptions to 
their businesses or simple personal pique. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been as hard as we thought it would be if not harder because the 
confusion over what an employer has to do to comply with the law is 
tremendous," said Peter Eide of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which for years 
lobbied against such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative burdens of the new mandate are especially acute for smaller 
companies without legal staffs and personnel resources, he added. And some 
employers say they resent the law because, they say, it gives the government an 
inappropriate right to meddle in their business. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9 to 5 National Assn. of Working Women said in a recent report on the 
law's first year that employees frequently have faced retaliation from 
employers for taking advantage of the leave.

<P>
 The organization is pressing for better enforcement and a more effective way 
of informing employees and employers about their rights under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sign of the problems, the Labor Department has processed almost 1,000 
complaints from employees who have charged their employers with illegally 
denying them leave, firing them for taking time off, or failing to cover their 
health benefits while they are out, as required by law. In most cases, the 
conflicts were resolved with a phone call, federal officials say. But about a 
tenth of the cases have required more attention, and the government recently 
filed the first two lawsuits against employers in connection with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich maintained that confusion and occasional resistance are to be expected 
in the first year of a new law and that compliance will improve as more and 
more companies become familiar with the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 With some exceptions, the family leave law specifies that companies employing 
more than 50 workers must grant employees who request it up to 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave annually to care for a new child or a seriously ill immediate 
family member, or to recover from an illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are required to continue medical benefits for employees on leave and 
reinstate them in the same or equivalent jobs when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the current law applies to only about 44% of women and 50% of men 
in the work force, employee and women's rights advocates say they hope that the 
law can be expanded to include employees of smaller companies and part-time 
workers and to provide paid leaves for low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton signed the legislation on Feb. 5, 1993 -- one of his first acts 
as President -- he said it would "promote national interests in preserving 
family integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 By enabling people to balance careers and families, he added, "it will provide 
Americans what they need most -- peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases that peace of mind has been elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months into her pregnancy with triplets, Carla Seale went into premature 
labor and her husband, Randy, rushed her to the hospital. Although doctors were 
able to interrupt labor, it was clear that the lives of the unborn triplets 
were in peril. Randy Seale asked his employer, Associated Milk Producers Inc. 
of Amarillo, Tex., for family medical leave so he could tend to his wife and 
soon-to-be-born children. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, he was fired without notice from his job as a truck driver 
delivering milk from a dairy to a cheese plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It put me under a lot of additional stress," Carla Seale said. "We had to 
worry about his job and where we were going to get money for the bills, on top 
of worrying if the babies would make it." 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to persuade the company to reinstate Seale, the Labor Department 
filed suit against Associated Milk Producers, charging it violated the law by 
firing Seale. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple and their triplets, who were born three months prematurely and have 
been hospitalized for most of their lives, had to move in with Carla Seale's 
parents because they ran out of money. Randy Seale earns about half his 
previous salary picking up work as a mechanic and truck driver and says he 
wants his old job back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Pride, assistant region manager for the company, said his firm was 
"flabbergasted" by the lawsuit because the firm already had agreed to reinstate 
Seale after being approached by Labor Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pride said Seale was terminated because he failed to keep the company informed 
of his intentions. The only remaining dispute between the department and the 
company, he said, was over whether the company owed Seale back wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left at a time when we were in desperate need of drivers, but we 
understood his position," Pride said. "We would have never terminated him if he 
had done the proper paper work or at least called to say he could not do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Rohnstock, who worked at the advertising department of a major 
women's clothing retailer in the Boston area, found herself locked in a testy 
debate with her employer when she developed pregnancy complications and sought 
family leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not think they were interpreting the law right," Rohnstock said. "The 
constant back-and-forth with my company was very frustrating and definitely 
contributed to a very stressful time." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials maintain, however, that such episodes are in the minority 
and based largely on misinformation and poor communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that 90% of the complaints were so easily resolved suggests to me 
that employers still have a long way to go to understand the law," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was initially proposed, some employers strongly opposed the 
legislation, fearing they would be overwhelmed with requests for leave time. A 
similar bill was vetoed in 1992 by President George Bush, largely because of 
the anticipated impact on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But "fears that employers had -- such as employees taking advantage of the law 
-- seem not to have been borne out at all," Reich said, adding that companies 
report only a tiny percentage of their employees are requesting the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people don't understand is that this is without pay," said Beverly 
Carothers, benefits manager of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid Corp. "Not 
that many people take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 300 personnel officers at a conference of the Society for Human 
Resource Management found that three-quarters complained about the 
administrative headaches in administering the law. About 35%, however, reported 
improvements in employee morale and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies, like Massachusetts-based Millipore Corp., have chosen to go 
several steps further than the federal law requires and are finding that the 
policy helps encourage employee loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Millipore offers to pay employees during the first four weeks of their leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first year, 137 of Millipore's 3,000 employees took family medical 
leaves averaging four weeks. Previously, the company, which manufactures 
purification devices in the upscale Boston suburb of Bedford, offered no 
paternity leave and other leaves were granted at the discretion of supervisors. 
Few people took them. 
</P>
<P>
 While supervisors sometimes grumble about staffing problems, the company has 
found its more liberal leave policy to be relatively inexpensive. A survey 
found that the company spent only about $20,000 for temporary employees and 
overtime in the first year, according to Gail Warner, the company's benefits 
manager. She says she believes that loss is made up in higher productivity when 
employees return. "I think we gain more than we've lost," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you give back so much more. They were committed to you in your time 
of need, so you're more committed to them," said Carol Melle, an executive 
secretary who took leave last year to be with her 2-year-old son while he was 
undergoing surgery. "People say you can separate your life from your work, but 
you can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dimento, 33, recalled being so worried about losing his job when his first 
child was hospitalized as a newborn that he spent his time shuttling from work 
to the hospital and could not give his wife or new son the proper attention. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no such dilemma when his second child was born, after he transferred 
to Millipore. He is already planning to take more leave to care for his father, 
who has terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's reassuring to know this is something you can depend on," Dimento, a 
systems design engineer, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It increases your loyalty to your company," said Deepak Kini, 29, a chemical 
engineer who recently took four weeks of paternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan, who took time to nurse her husband back to health after heart 
surgery, said the new policy made taking time off a lot less stressful. Answers 
to Questions About Family Leave Law 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Who is eligible for family leave? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Full-time employees working at companies with 50 or more workers who 
need time off to care for a sick immediate family member, spend time with a new 
child or to recover from an illness, may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who is specifically excluded? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Employers are not required to grant leaves to part-time employees or those 
who have worked less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can an employee take leave intermittently? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Under some circumstances employees may take leave in blocks of time or 
by reducing their normal work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is an employer permitted to require a worker to use up paid sick leave and 
vacation time before taking unpaid leave? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. But the employer is responsible for designating in advance that paid 
leave counts against the 12 weeks of family medical leave guaranteed by law to 
employees each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Must employers reinstate all employees who take leave to the same or an 
equivalent position? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. An employer may designate certain workers in the highest paid 10% of 
their staffs as "key" employees and not guarantee their jobs if they take 
leave. These employees, however, must be told in advance that their positions 
are in jeopardy and given a chance to decide not to take leave or return early 
from a leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can employees be required to submit to their employers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A 30-day notice, if leave is foreseeable, medical certification if the 
leave is because of illness or to care for a sick family member, and periodic 
reports during leave regarding the employee's status and intent to return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who has more information on the law? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of 
Labor.

 Josiah Andrew Alvarado is buried on a grassy slope in the Hollywood Hills, in 
the shadow of a stand of giant pine trees and pink-blooming oleanders. His is a 
simple grave, marked by a brass tablet bearing a quote from Psalms and figures 
befitting a child just shy of his eighth birthday: a goose and rabbit, a 
cherub, teddy bear and lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother doesn't come to the cemetery much. Visiting is too painful. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been five years since her only child, a hemophiliac, died of AIDS. 
Today, Joan Alvarado is brokenhearted, bitter and angry -- at the doctors she 
feels betrayed her, at the manufacturer of the blood concentrate that should 
have saved Josiah's life but infected him with the human immunodeficiency virus 
instead, and paradoxically at herself, for unknowingly administering the deadly 
infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggle with that every day of my life, even though intellectually I know 
it wasn't my fault," she said. "What makes you angry is you put your trust in 
these people. They did nothing but lie to me. Nobody told me death was a side 
effect of this concentrate. Yes, it was a wonderful product. Yes, he needed it. 
But they helped me murder my son." 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Josiah Alvarado speaks volumes about the tragic link between AIDS 
and hemophilia. Through tainted blood products distributed in the early 1980s, 
HIV has decimated the hemophiliac population in the United States and other 
developed nations that imported the U.S.-made concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, the death toll is mounting. Survivors, many of whom remained 
silent for fear that they would be stigmatized, are now going public and 
fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, officials estimate that half the 20,000 hemophiliacs are 
HIV-positive, and the infection rate is 80% in those with severe forms of the 
blood-clotting disorder. By the end of 1993, the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention had documented 3,342 AIDS cases among hemophiliacs. As a 
result of the epidemic, the median life expectancy of a person with hemophilia 
declined from 57 years in 1979 to 40 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Families are being wiped out. Wives of hemophiliacs (the disorder is genetic, 
passed from mother to son, and afflicts men almost exclusively) have contracted 
AIDS from their husbands, or passed HIV to their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations are disappearing. In San Bernardino County, a couple had four sons 
with hemophilia. Three are dead and the fourth is HIV-positive. AIDS has also 
claimed two of the wife's hemophiliac brothers, and her nephew is infected. 
Said the husband: "You're constantly worried about one and grieved about the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this "hemophiliac holocaust," as some have called it, there is a growing 
movement to avenge the deaths through lawsuits and legislation. It has been a 
time-consuming and emotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, it has not been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, lawyers for Joan Alvarado and her husband, Tim, spent five 
grueling weeks this summer trying to persuade a Superior Court jury that Baxter 
Hyland Therapeutics, one of four companies that manufactured the concentrate, 
was responsible for Josiah's death by failing to take adequate precautions to 
keep HIV out of its products. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case, like so many others brought by hemophiliacs, was extremely 
difficult to prove, and the couple lost -- as have the plaintiffs in all but 
one of 11 other cases that have gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, however, hemophiliacs recently scored a legal victory: This month, 
a judge ruled that there was enough evidence for a group called the Committee 
of Ten Thousand (COTT) -- named for the 10,000 infected -- to bring a 
class-action lawsuit against the manufacturers and, ironically, the nonprofit 
National Hemophilia Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the foundation, like the companies, knew the blood 
products were risky but failed to warn its members because it received funding 
from the manufacturers. While the foundation has declined comment, the 
manufacturers have denied wrongdoing, saying the infections occurred long 
before anyone knew that the blood supply was unsafe and thus could not have 
been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone understands what a terrible tragedy this is, what a horrible 
disaster this has been for the community," said Duncan Barr, attorney for Miles 
Inc., one of the pharmaceutical company defendants. "But the fact that 
something bad happened doesn't necessarily mean that it is someone's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Committee of Ten Thousand says fault abounds, not only with the 
companies, but with the federal government, for failing to protect the blood 
supply in the epidemic's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the committee's efforts have sparked an inquiry by the Institute of 
Medicine -- the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences -- into how 
the products became tainted; a hearing is set in Washington for Sept. 12. And 
the advocacy group is pressing Congress to make reparations to infected 
hemophiliacs, noting that most Western nations -- including Canada, Spain, the 
United Kingdom and France -- have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Its harshest criticism, however, is reserved for the manufacturers. Two 
companies, Baxter Hyland and Rhone Poulenc Rorer, together have offered to pay 
$30,000 to each infected person -- not to admit guilt but simply to settle the 
lawsuit. "An insult," is how one COTT board member described the offer. When 
the judge ruled that the lawsuit could go forward, the settlement collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was 100% avoidable," said Jonathan Wadleigh, a Massachusetts computer 
salesman who, angry over his own HIV infection, founded COTT in 1990. "I'm a 
business person, and I understand sales. But I also understand the value of 
human life and ethics. These companies put their profit before human lives. 
They should be held accountable for what they did, and we intend to hold them 
accountable." 
</P>

<P>
 No lawsuit, of course, will bring back Josiah Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the legal system done much to ease the pain of his parents, who have 
forced themselves to relive the details of their child's death through a trial 
that yielded little but sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Seared in their consciousness are terrible images of the fair-haired little 
boy with the impish grin, the boy they named after a faithful Old Testament 
king. There was Josiah, asking what it feels like to die. There was Josiah, 
telling his mother jokes so she wouldn't be so sad. There was Josiah, 
struggling to walk on the final day of his life, June 21, 1989, a Wednesday, 
the first day of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been like trying to heal but you can't," Tim Alvarado said, as the jury 
deliberated. "They (Baxter Hyland lawyers) are just trampling over our son's 
grave. You just want to stand up and scream and yell at them and say: 'Maybe 
this doesn't mean anything to you. You get to go home and play with your 
children and watch them grow. But what do we have? We have nothing. Our lives 
are destroyed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they know Joan Alvarado carries the hemophilia gene, the couple has 
decided against having other children. Although they sometimes talk about 
adoption, they feel they must first get Josiah's death behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stuck in the reliving," Joan Alvarado said. "I don't have a happy memory 
of my son. All I see is the pain, the suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, she hugged her own slender frame, wrapping her empty arms 
tightly around her waist. Since Josiah died, she explained, she does not know 
quite what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a bitter irony in the story of Josiah and the thousands of other 
hemophiliacs with HIV, it is this: The very product that has cut their lives 
short revolutionized the treatment for their age-old disorder, holding the 
promise that for the first time, hemophiliacs could live a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, people with hemophilia do not bleed faster, nor do 
they die from simple cuts or scrapes. They bleed longer, because their plasma, 
a blood component, is missing proteins -- called "factors" -- that facilitate 
clotting. Those with Hemophilia A, the most common form, lack Factor 8. Those 
with Hemophilia B, which afflicted Josiah, lack Factor 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal bleeding from bumps and bruises, especially head injuries, is the 
biggest danger. Nonetheless, as recently as four decades ago, many hemophiliacs 
made it past childhood. Those who lived longer often suffered crippling 
deformities in the knees, ankles and other joints where blood pooled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the image of the hemophiliac as a frail, homebound child is outdated 
because of dramatic advances in treatment since the 1950s, when blood 
transfusions were the only option. Transfusions were ineffective and dangerous; 
huge volumes of blood were required to get a small amount of clotting factor, 
and patients sometimes suffered heart failure as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came fresh frozen plasma, until the 1960s when -- after a freezer failure 
in which the plasma turned to slush -- scientists discovered that clotting 
factor could be separated from plasma. But the resulting "cryoprecipitate" was 
slow to administer and difficult to store, and patients often suffered severe 
bleeding by the time they got to the hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s came factor concentrate -- a freeze-dried form of Factor 8 and 
Factor 9, packaged in tiny vials of powder that were mixed with saline 
solution. It was convenient, stable and easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer would patients have to rush to the emergency room; they could be 
treated at home. Even better, the factor concentrates could be given 
prophylactically. A hemophiliac could play soccer or any other sport; he or his 
parents would infuse the factor in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a revolution in quality of life," said Dr. Peter Smith, a hemophilia 
expert at Brown University. "Once you had a portable, practical, easily stored 
factor, people could pop that in their car. They could go on vacations when 
they never dared to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fathers could move onto a different job because they knew how to treat their 
child. Mothers could get a job themselves because they didn't always have to 
worry, waiting for the call from school that something had happened to Johnny." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Factor concentrate so dramatically altered the outlook for hemophiliacs that 
in 1981, when the Alvarados learned their infant son suffered from the 
disorder, a nurse told them that if he had to pick a disease for his own child, 
he would choose hemophilia because it was so easy to treat. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Alvarados followed the medical mantra of the day: Treat early and 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a problem with the concentrate: Unlike cryoprecipitate, which 
was drawn from a single donor, Factor 8 and Factor 9 were drawn from the pooled 
plasma of up to 20,000 donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Most donors were paid; some were prisoners, others lived on Skid Row. Lawyers 
for the Alvarados say Baxter should have known that taking plasma from such 
high-risk groups was dangerous. Baxter attorney Rick Berkman counters: "Nobody 
ever said that poor people transmit AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 As important as who the plasma came from was that it came from so many people, 
any one of whom could taint the entire batch. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by the late 1970s it was clear that the concentrates were transmitting 
disease -- not AIDS, which no one knew about, but a new strain of hepatitis 
later known as Hepatitis C. The concentrate was so rife with hepatitis that, in 
experiments at the CDC, scientists used Factor 8 to infect chimps. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not yank the factor off the 
shelves; the prevailing sentiment was that the benefits outweighed the risk. 
This baffles Dr. Donald Francis, the former CDC official who has been lionized 
for his unsuccessful efforts to make the blood supply safe in the early days of 
the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you had this stuff that was filthy and yet was allowed to go through," 
Francis said. "We knew that this stuff infected every single person who used it 
(with hepatitis). I guess that was acceptable when you thought the disease was 
mild." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience with hepatitis looms large in the legal wrangling over whether 
the pharmaceutical companies did enough to keep their products clean. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981 -- three years before the AIDS virus was discovered -- a German firm 
patented a method of heat-treating the concentrate to rid the factor of 
hepatitis. But U.S. manufacturers did not employ the method. They argued that 
such treatments -- which involved heating the concentrate to at least 148 
degrees Fahrenheit for 24 to 144 hours -- altered the composition of the factor 
so that it could no longer be produced in large enough quantities to meet 
patient needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they done so, many hemophiliacs would have been spared. Heat-treating, the 
companies later learned, kills HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, hepatitis was prevalent among homosexuals, who were also at risk for 
AIDS. Although there was no AIDS test in the epidemic's early days, lawyers for 
the Alvarados say that if a donor had hepatitis, he probably carried the AIDS 
virus too. They say Baxter should have questioned donors more thoroughly about 
their sexual practices, and should have tested plasma for hepatitis antibodies 
as a "surrogate marker" for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baxter never used the surrogate test. Arthur Grebow, a lawyer for the 
Alvarados, says the company was too cheap to use it. "They knew they'd have to 
go out and replace the donors," he said, "and that was going to be costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Berkman, the Baxter attorney, counters with studies showing that hepatitis was 
not a good marker for AIDS. Moreover, he says, the antibodies served a useful 
purpose -- they helped kill off any active hepatitis virus that slipped into 
the concentrate. And, he says, the FDA never required the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get past the smears and go to the hard data," Berkman said, "there is 
no evidence that anything we did caused this boy to be infected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle of this lawyers' duel are the Alvarados. They are a quiet 
couple who live in an apartment not far from the Beverly Center. Joan, 42, 
recently took a job as a paralegal for Grebow's firm; Tim, 39, repairs home 
security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to Grebow a year after Josiah died, on the recommendation of a 
friend. Unlike Berkman, who works for a high-powered Philadelphia firm and 
recites medical terms with the fluency of a doctor, Grebow knew nothing of AIDS 
or hemophilia. He is a business lawyer, and his partner is a tax attorney. They 
knew only that the Alvarados had a tragic story, and so they agreed to take the 
case on contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning required convincing a jury of two points: that Baxter was negligent by 
accepting prison plasma, failing to use the hepatitis surrogate test and not 
screening donors effectively; and that Baxter's product -- and not one 
manufactured by another company -- infected Josiah. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this last point that tripped up the jury, according to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Alvarado kept a meticulous infusion log; each time she gave Josiah factor 
concentrate, she noted the date, the lot number of the product and the name of 
the manufacturer. The log for the first five months of 1984 -- when the 
Alvarados believe their son was infected -- lists only one product: Baxter 
Hyland Lot 2808 X018 AA. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, two top AIDS experts -- Dr. Michael Gottlieb, who identified 
the earliest AIDS cases, and Dr. Steven Miles of UCLA -- testified that Josiah 
was almost certainly infected between February and April, 1984. It was then, 
the doctors said, that Josiah exhibited the acute flu-like symptoms that appear 
when blood "seroconverts" -- becomes HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter countered with evidence that Josiah showed similar symptoms earlier, 
and the jury apparently could not agree on the date of infection. On Aug. 17, 
after four days of deliberations, they voted in favor of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alvarados and their lawyers were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," Joan Alvarado said, "it seems like they have gotten away with 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Few hemophiliacs have been infected with the AIDS virus since 1985, when the 
test to detect it was developed. There have been no seroconversions since 1987, 
according to the National Hemophilia Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, there has been another round of improvements in the manufacturing 
of factor concentrate: At the minimum, products are heat-treated and go through 
other purification processes. And there is an even safer way to make Factor 8, 
through genetic engineering. This new "recombinant" factor, available since 
December, 1992, is expensive -- infusions can cost $100,000 a year or more, 
depending on the patient. But it is risk-free because no plasma -- and hence, 
no donor -- is required to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 So amid the disappearance of one generation of hemophiliacs, the outlook for 
the next has never been brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very exciting time, actually," said Dr. Jonathon Goldsmith, who 
directs the Hemophilia Comprehensive Care Center at Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles. "Something good has come out of the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest excitement of all is gene therapy, which Goldsmith says could 
be available within the next decade. If experiments -- some of which are being 
conducted by Baxter Hyland -- bear fruit, there would be no more need for 
Factor 8 and Factor 9. 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade of death, there would be a cure. Hemophilia and AIDS 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS has taken a devastating toll on people with hemophilia; half of the 
estimated 20,000 hemophiliacs in the United States are infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus as a result of tainted blood products. By 1984, AIDS had 
been diagnosed in 103 people with hemophilia, and 98 of them had died. The 
following chart shows how many new AIDS cases were reported each year, and how 
many of those patients have since died. Hemophiliacs diagnosed with AIDS in a

CASE COULD WIDEN DNA ADMISSIBILITY; COURTS: STATE JUSTICES HEAR A BID TO 
BROADEN THE LATITUDE TRIAL JUDGES HAVE OVER SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. SIMPSON TRIAL 
COULD BE AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that could affect the admissibility of DNA evidence in the O.J. 
Simpson trial, the California Supreme Court began deliberating Tuesday whether 
to give trial judges greater flexibility to allow scientific evidence at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court, hearing arguments in a Huntington Beach drunk driving case, 
has been asked by California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to broaden the state's 
evidence rules to allow controversial DNA testing. Now, scientific evidence can 
be admitted if it is generally accepted by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the court provided little insight into their thinking on the DNA 
issue, dwelling largely on questions about a common field sobriety test in 
which police officers check the eye movements of suspected drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The drunk driving case comes before the court on the heels of a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision adopting the broad standard advocated by Lungren that would give 
trial judges more discretion in the kinds of scientific evidence they admit. 
</P>
<P>
 But some prosecutors -- as well as public defenders and corporate defense 
attorneys -- worry that such a standard would open the door for all kinds of 
"junk science" that could be difficult for trial judges to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no need to put trial judges in the position of being 
scientists," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brentford Ferreira, who 
joined Orange County prosecutors in arguing the Huntington Beach case before 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case before the court stems from the December, 1990, arrest of William 
Michael Leahy for allegedly speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol 
on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to evidence presented at his trial in Orange County Municipal Court, 
Leahy smelled of alcohol and spoke with a thick tongue when an officer pulled 
him over. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy passed some sobriety tests administered by the arresting officer, 
including walking in a straight line and standing on one leg. But he failed a 
test called the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, in which an officer observes 
whether the eye moves smoothly as it tracks an object, such as a pencil, to the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 A blood test 90 minutes later showed Leahy's blood alcohol to be 0.1%, which 
exceeds the legal limit, but his attorney argued that the level rose after the 
arrest because of a drink the motorist consumed five minutes before he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy was found guilty at trial but his conviction was overturned by the state 
Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. That court held that the vision test is 
scientific evidence and, under California rules, cannot be admitted until a 
hearing is held to determine whether the procedure is generally accepted in the 
scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to hear the case, the state Supreme Court asked attorneys to offer 
arguments on whether the new federal standard for scientific evidence -- known 
as Daubert, after the U.S. Supreme Court case -- should be adopted in place of 
the state standard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Daubert case, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the old standard of 
general acceptance by the scientific community and ruled that federal judges 
must only conclude whether scientific evidence is "relevant" and "reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Cappizzi and Orange County Public 
Defender Ronald Butler argued that the state's rules, known by the shorthand 
Kelly-Frye, should remain in place and attempted to focus the case on the field 
sobriety test. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a DNA case," Deputy Public Defender Alan J. Crivaro told the 
court during oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lungren and the California District Attorneys Assn. filed amicus 
briefs with the court seeking adoption of the Daubert standard, which would be 
more likely to allow DNA evidence in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 California appellate courts have issued mixed opinions on whether DNA tests 
are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent appellate ruling rejected the use of DNA evidence because 
techniques used by laboratories to come up with statistical estimates are not 
generally accepted by the scientific community. The state Supreme Court let 
that decision stand. 
</P>
<P>
 With the murder trial of O.J. Simpson scheduled to start in less than three 
weeks, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito will be called on to decide whether 
DNA tests on blood found at the murder scene will be accepted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has 90 days to rule in Leahy's case and any decision to 
broaden the rules for scientific evidence could come after Ito has ruled on the 
admissibility of the DNA tests, complicating appeals on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court's decision would be binding on state judges such as the 
one presiding over the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Admissibility of DNA evidence is crucial to the prosecution, which, lacking 
eyewitnesses, needs the testing to show that Simpson was at the scene of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not giving any indication whether they would tackle the DNA issue in 
their ruling in the Leahy case, some justices questioned the use of the 
30-year-old field sobriety vision test as evidence in drunk driving cases 
without expert scientific testimony required under state standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a lot of science here," said Justice Armand Arabian. "It 
might even be junk science. I guess that's something we have to decide. . . . 
This is a test administered by an officer without the scientific community 
determining whether it's worth a hill of beans."

ON CALIFORNIA: SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clear-eyed wisdom comes easier from a distance. Consider, for example, 
wildfires. Almost every summer a big fire will light up some California 
mountain or sea canyon. People in the fire's path grab what they can and bolt, 
stopping only to stammer into the microphones about the treasures left behind 
to burn. "That was my life in there," they moan, pointing for the camera as 
their house blazes away. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the fire is extinguished, the firetrucks roll out and the insurance 
adjusters roll in. The whole ritual can, to the detached, sage eye, seem almost 
silly. Why this fuss over one more fire? What did these people expect, living 
where they do? And, yes, it's sad to see these charred keepsakes, but are they 
truly worth the tears? Forget the old dishes and snapshots. Weep for the 
taxpayers who must underwrite that steak-devouring, gas-guzzling, firefighting 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 See. Easy wisdom. Except. 
</P>
<P>
 Except today the place in the fire's path is not some distant dateline but a 
mountain community where generations of my family have spent summers. That 
evacuee interviewed on the radio, faltering a bit as she describes the chaotic 
decisions over what to carry out -- she is my sister. And how could she have 
left behind the blurry snapshot on the kitchen wall, the one of me taking my 
daughter on her first canoe ride? And those fire crews pouring in from across 
the West -- today it seems they couldn't get here too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Lake sits high in the Sierra, about 50 miles east of Fresno. It is 
a man-made lake, created in the early 1900s to generate hydroelectric power for 
Los Angeles. There's not much here, a few rustic resorts and summer camps, some 
campgrounds and a few hundred cabins. Not too many Californians know about it, 
which does not exactly bother those who do. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad and I drove up here Monday, keeping watch all the way on thick columns 
of smoke that rose up from the mountains ahead. The fire had been burning for 
five days. It was started when a squirrel shorted a power line down below the 
dam, near the town of Big Creek. Now we weren't sure what to expect at the top. 
The deputies who evacuated my sister had told her to pack like she'd never be 
back. Other cabin owners had been calling my dad. Some grieved openly for what 
they assumed had been lost. All seemed shocked that this could happen here, to 
this mountain, their mountain. My dad had adopted the language of a stoic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it burns," he said as we wound around the lake toward our tract, "it 
burns. We will rebuild. Why get excited? It's just wood." 
</P>
<P>
 My father, the reader should know, is a terrific salesman. He's moved 
everything from DDT to adjustable-rate mortgages. And as he repeated his lines 
about staying calm, taking what fate delivers, wasting no tears on a pile of 
lumber, it occurred to me that, understandably enough, he was giving himself a 
sales job. Because the smoke was everywhere, and the wind was up, and the lake 
was abandoned, taken over by fire crews. Nothing looked good. We turned up the 
last road toward the cabin in silence, and I think a little smoke got in both 
our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," my dad said at last, "kind of eerie, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was Monday. By now, as I write on Tuesday, the suspense is over. Our 
cabin made it. All the cabins made it. Big Creek made it. The smoke has begun 
to thin. Nothing was burned but 5,000 acres of trees and brush, and they needed 
a thinning anyway. Still, this was a close one. It's easy to see. Right behind 
our cabin runs a crude fire line hacked by a bulldozer in the worst of the 
fight. Black cinders cover the porch and roof. If the wind had kept up . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the paper today, the cost of fighting this fire was reported to have 
exceeded $4.5 million. Money well spent, I'd say. And I'll say it again when it 
is spent, as it will be spent, on some other mountain, in some other canyon. 
Hallelujah. The boy's got religion. And so what if wiser heads call it silly, 
all this carrying on about some fire, some family cabin, some fuzzy snapshot? 
</P>
<P>
 I am looking again at the picture on the kitchen wall. It shows a man and a 
baby girl in a green canoe. He is paddling. She seems to be studying him, 
happy. Three years old, it was something new and wonderful to her then, at that 
moment in her life, on this lake. Someday it might mean something to her, as 
much as it means to me today. At any rate, it's still here.

STATEWIDE CRIME RATE IS DOWN IN FIRST HALF OF '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although crime may be the hottest issue as the election season shifts into 
high gear, figures released by the state attorney general's office Tuesday show 
that the number of reported crimes -- including homicides -- dropped 7.7% 
during the first six months of 1994 compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which shows a declining homicide rate for the first time since 
1987, echoes federal and local reports that show that although crime has seized 
the public's attention recently, crime rates are sinking in Los Angeles County 
and, to a lesser extent, nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The study compared the first six months of 1993 and 1994, and showed statewide 
decreases for this year in several crimes: homicide dropped 11.4%, forcible 
rape 7.8%, robbery 11.5%, aggravated assault 5.2%, burglary 8.1% and motor 
vehicle theft 6.9%. State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who is up for reelection this 
fall, attributed the drop to the deterrent effects of the "three strikes and 
you're out" law, adopted in March, and other tough provisions such as a focus 
on incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to fool anyone -- we still have a major crime problem in our 
state," Lungren said. "But this shows some things are working and we can't 
throw out those things." 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, a spokesman for Lungren's opponent, former federal prosecutor Tom 
Umberg, dismissed the report as an election-year gimmick. Pointing out that 
crime rose in Lungren's first year in office, Urch said: "I don't think 
anybody's buying it. Every time you pick up the paper there are crimes in your 
neighborhood that weren't there a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren and a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson -- who is in a heated race with 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- said the public's fear stems from the sense 
that crime recently has become more random. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the numbers are looking a little bit better, we've got a long way to 
go," said Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown and Umberg campaigns discounted the significance of the six-month 
study. Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst said that much of the drop in 
crime took place in Los Angeles County, and that other counties and cities 
across the state suffered increases. "If you took Los Angeles County out of the 
equation, crime would have gone way up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, preliminary calculations show that without the crime figures reported 
by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles Police Department 
and other city police departments in the county, California would have a 3% 
decrease in reported crimes. The study surveys the state's 67 largest law 
enforcement jurisdictions, containing two-thirds of California's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst repeated a refrain of the Brown campaign in challenging the crime 
statistics: "Do you feel safer now than you did four years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Schnur said things would look worse if Brown had been in 
charge over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has fought tooth and nail to convince the Democratic Legislature 
to pass a series of tough-on-crime measures that they wouldn't have otherwise," 
Schnur said. "It's hard to tell how much Kathleen Brown would have put into 
those efforts."

TEMPEST IN A LAVATORY; LAGUNA BEACH FESTIVAL DENIES FIRING WOMAN BECAUSE SHE 
DID NOT CLEAN MEN'S ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernice Harris considers herself a hard-working employee and a lady. But she 
has her limits. 
</P>
<P>
 For 45 summers, she cleaned the grounds of the Festival of Arts, a well-known 
art show that runs here every July and August. Then last year, she says, a 
supervisor gave her a task that she wanted to refuse: to clean the men's 
restroom while it was occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were too many men in there," said Harris, 65. "I was so embarrassed, I 
just cried. I didn't want to look at all those men; it wasn't nice for a lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris says she performed the job for two weeks. Then she used her own money 
to hire a male friend to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, she was told that her services would not be needed for the new 
season, an action she contends was retribution for her reticence to follow her 
supervisor's order. This week she filed a lawsuit accusing festival officials, 
among other things, of unfair termination and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that any woman should be exposed to men's genitals while on the 
job," Harris' attorney, Elaine Norton, said. "It's a little strange; any woman 
would be upset at the thought of having to go into a urinal." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival officials deny that Harris ever was required to clean an occupied 
bathroom. She was terminated, they say, for economic reasons unrelated to her 
job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a valued employee," said Tim Wilcox, the festival's media and 
marketing director. "There was a sense that she was part of the family. It 
would be unthinkable to me that she would be forced to clean the men's room 
with men in it. That would have been uncomfortable not only for her, but for 
the men who came into the restroom, and it's not our way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' job was eliminated, Wilcox said, because of the $500,000 damage at the 
festival site caused by a mudslide last year that followed a devastating 
wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of that, we were looking at tighter budgets," he said. After finding 
an outside vendor who would do the maintenance work for less, Wilcox said, the 
festival terminated Harris in what "really was a bottom-line consideration. It 
was not meant in any way to be a slap in the face directed at Bernice Harris." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' lawsuit, filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court, paints a 
different picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival officials refused her entreaties that the men's room be locked while 
she worked, Harris says. Instead, they suggested that she put up cones outside 
the door to discourage users. 
</P>
<P>
 But men ignored the cones, she said. The lawsuit alleges that Harris suffered 
humiliation and emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton declined to say how much money her client seeks in compensatory damages 
for the pain that she suffered. The point of the lawsuit, she said, is not 
money but morals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not right," the lawyer said. "It's more the injustice of the thing. 
I'm filing to gain the justice that should be rendered her so that she doesn't 
just go off into the sunset without anyone noticing what happened to her."

SENATOR'S NAME STRIPPED FROM BILL AFTER SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare move, the Assembly Tuesday stripped a bill by state Sen. Don Rogers 
of his name in an effort to overcome animosity over his appearance last weekend 
before a group of suspected racists. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rogers listed as its author, the otherwise mundane bill to create a flood 
control district in the Antelope Valley was headed nowhere, Assembly members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), who sponsored the amendment 
replacing Rogers as author with state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), said he was 
asked to do so by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said he was told by Brown that the bill stood no chance of winning 
Democratic votes as long as it bore Rogers' name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was suggested by the Speaker primarily because the leaders of the 
Democratic Party were concerned about the speech that Sen. Rogers gave in 
Bakersfield," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown refused comment. But in addressing the Assembly immediately after the 
unusual parliamentary move, he told members that making Maddy the author 
allowed it to "be taken up on its merits. . . . Clearly you removed the 
liability of Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was the featured speaker last Saturday night at the Fourth Annual 
Jubilation Celebration and Conference at a hotel in Bakersfield. The event was 
sponsored by a California-based newspaper called the Jubilee, which is the 
leading national publication for the Christian Identity movement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to watchdog groups that track extreme right-wing organizations, the 
movement promotes the belief that Northern European descendants are superior to 
people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 In answering criticism about his appearance, Rogers said he spoke to the 
group, whom he knew only to be "patriotic Americans," about the need to 
reaffirm states' rights. The Tehachapi Republican said he does not condone 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said he supported the move to take his name off the flood control 
district bill if that action was necessary to get his bill passed by the 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that some Democrats were disgruntled because of the Jubilee thing and 
I guess they thought they were going to chastise me," he said. "I'm elated. 
It's one less bill for me to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reaction is that it seemed rather childish, but no one has ever accused 
the Legislature of being mature." Meanwhile, members of the legislative Black 
Caucus were moving toward holding talks with Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to have conversations," said Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 As to whether Rogers has damaged his effectiveness as a legislator -- at least 
in the Assembly -- Moore said, "I think that clearly is the message that one 
hopes to send."

ASSEMBLY OKS NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING BAN; LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE EXTENDS 
PROHIBITION TO VENTURA COUNTY. ASSEMBLY ALSO REJECTS A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE 
BROADENED STATE'S ASSAULT WEAPON BAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly on Tuesday passed and sent to Gov. Pete Wilson legislation to ban 
indefinitely new offshore oil drilling in state waters from Imperial Beach to 
the Oregon border. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the state's coast is covered by a patchwork of prohibitions, 
this measure would extend the ban to Ventura County and remove provisions that 
would allow drilling to resume in some areas as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly, rushing toward tonight's scheduled adjournment, approved the 
bill on a 46-27 vote and sent it to Wilson, who has until the end of September 
to decide whether to sign or veto it. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Tuesday, the Senate passed a Democrat-backed campaign finance 
measure that probably faces a veto, while the Assembly approved another bill, 
also with doubtful prospects, that would overhaul a controversial school 
testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly also rejected a bill that would have broadened California's 
assault weapon ban so it would cover more of the high-powered firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The offshore oil drilling measure puts Wilson in something of an election-year 
bind. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has opposed offshore drilling since his days as mayor of San 
Diego, and as a U.S. senator he worked to persuade then President George Bush 
to limit development of oil wells in federal waters off California's coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The drilling ban is needed to provide a uniform policy along the state's 
1,000-mile coastline, according to Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), 
the bill's sponsor. O'Connell said that offshore drilling is a serious 
environmental hazard and that a major spill could devastate parts of the 
state's lucrative tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor of late has been crusading against measures that harm the 
state's image as a good place to do business. Oil companies, which have 
contributed significant sums to his campaigns, oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavin McHugh, a lobbyist for Texaco, said the bill would limit job growth in 
the oil industry and related fields that support the drilling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A permanent ban would block our development of new leases and eliminate the 
possibility of developing these resources for jobs, tax revenue and royalties 
to the state," McHugh said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has not taken a position on the bill, according to a spokesman for his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate adopted a Democratic version of campaign finance reform on a 21-16 
vote, the bare majority necessary. The measure, awaiting final passage in the 
Assembly, would limit contributions to legislative campaigns and provide for 
partial taxpayer financing of those races. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who voted for the bill, called it a "token" 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "But symbolically it is very important," Hayden said, because now there are no 
limits on contributions to legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the bill was flawed because 
it would not stop party leaders from funneling huge amounts of cash from 
special interest groups to their allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, Maddy said, "provides all the worst of the current system, plus 
public financing of campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 On another matter, the Assembly narrowly approved a bill to revamp the format 
for the controversial school performance tests known as the California 
Comprehensive Testing Program, formerly the California Learning Assessment 
System, and give parents a larger role in their development. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-28 party line vote, the minimum required for approval, sent the bill, 
authored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), back to the Senate for review 
of Assembly amendments. Democrats voted yes and Republicans voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to veto the bill because it does not provide for students 
to get individual test scores so they and their parents can measure progress 
against statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-San Diego), who handled the bill on the lower 
house floor, called it "truly a world class test, one that will really 
challenge our students, and determine if they are really prepared for the 
workday world." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpert said the new format expressly prohibits questions on the CLAS test that 
relate to the pupil's or parent's or guardian's personal beliefs or practices 
in sex, family life, morality or religion. She said parents also can choose to 
have their children not take the test. 
</P>
<P>
 An opponent, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), said the bill 
"doesn't meet the mark" because it does not meet three criteria: validity, 
reliability, and practicality. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault weapons bill rejected in the Assembly represented the last chance 
for state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) to clean up his 1989 ban, which 
listed forbidden guns by name but gave gun makers and sellers an opening to 
market renamed models. The bill got 33 votes in favor, eight short of the 
majority needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote followed an emotional exchange between Assemblyman Larry Bowler 
(R-Elk Grove) and Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), who pushed for 
the bill's passage. Suggesting that Speier was out of her league, Bowler 
demanded to know how much Speier knew about the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 She shot back: "Have you ever been shot by an automatic rifle? Well, I have 
and I can show you a lot of scars." Speier was seriously wounded in 1978 during 
the Jonestown massacre in Guyana while an aide to the late Rep. Leo Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said he was disappointed at the vote, but hoped to try to bring the 
bill up for another vote today. "Maybe those who voted it down have to realize 
people in their districts don't like to hear the rat-a-tat-tat of automatic 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly, on a 58-0 vote, also passed and placed on the November ballot a 
proposed constitutional amendment to overhaul the state's judicial discipline 
process. The measure would remove the cloak of secrecy that has surrounded the 
disciplinary actions of the Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly also voted 73-0 to approved an Orange County lawmaker's bill that 
would put first-time child molesters and violent rapists in prison for 25 years 
to life. The so-called "one-strike" bill carried by Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) now goes back to the Senate for a vote today.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; DEBATE SPONSORS SAY 'TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT'; 
BROADCASTERS' GROUP TIRES OF HAGGLING AND OUTLINES A THREE-PART FORMAT. BROWN'S 
CAMP ACCEPTS. WILSON'S SAYS THE 'CONCEPT' IS NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
 After six weeks of haggling with the two gubernatorial campaigns, the 
California Broadcasters Assn. has announced a format for an Oct. 16 debate 
between Gov. Pete Wilson and state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and told the 
candidates to take it or leave it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's debate negotiators immediately accepted the format, which splits the 
one-hour forum into three parts: a traditional question, answer and rebuttal 
segment with political reporters; an interactive segment with television 
viewers, and a segment during which Brown and Wilson will question each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, the Wilson campaign balked, calling the plan "a concept, not a 
format." Until the association spells out exactly how the debate will work -- 
how long each segment will last and how many questions will be asked, for 
example -- senior counsel Larry Thomas said Wilson will not make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The devil is always in the details," Thomas said, repeating his contention 
that Wilson cannot consider the four other debates Brown has proposed until 
this first one is settled. "To get to five, you have to get past one." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say Wilson is behaving as the classic incumbent, dragging 
his feet to minimize one-on-one contact with his opponent. "They're stalling," 
said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Claremont Graduate School. 
"If everybody really wanted to debate, they'd say, 'Let's do it.' It's not that 
difficult. It's not rocket science." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Wardlaw, a lawyer who is leading Brown's five-member debate negotiation 
team, agreed. "Their strategy is to delay, defer, deny, dodge," she said. "The 
fraud is they've refused to discuss any additional debates until they sign up 
this Oct. 16 debate -- and they refuse to sign up the Oct. 16 debate. . . . He 
doesn't want to debate Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns had accepted the broadcasters' invitation on the condition a 
format could be agreed upon. Brown then accepted four other debate invitations 
around the state, and her campaign has repeatedly called for Wilson to accept 
those as well. Wilson officials say he is unavailable to debate during 
September because he will be busy signing and vetoing more than 1,500 pieces of 
legislation. But they claim Wilson is eager to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not credible to suggest that we don't want one," said Thomas, 
noting that his team proposed that a panel of political reporters be the sole 
questioners for the association's debate. "If (Brown's camp) just accepted our 
format we put on the table initially . . . then we'd have an agreement today." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that once the association delivers a more specific debate outline, 
probably some time next week, Wilson's team will evaluate it and offer 
comments. "We will either communicate back to them in writing or sit down for a 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vic Biondi, executive director of the group, indicated that although he is 
eager to accommodate both campaigns, there is no longer time for bickering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it. . . . We're going to do what we're going to do," he said. "This 
is not negotiations. We just don't have time for that. We've got to move on."

BILL ON ASSAULT WEAPONS FAILS TO PASS ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. David A. Roberti's parting shot at gun rights advocates who have 
been his longtime bitter enemies fell short Tuesday when a bill to broaden 
California's ban on assault-style weapons failed to win Assembly passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was defeated 33-39 in the last leg of its long journey through a 
Legislature heavily lobbied by gun rights groups. It passed the Senate earlier, 
and had narrowly survived challenges in Assembly committees. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Democrats broke party ranks Tuesday and voted against the bill, 
leaving the ban's supporters to speculate that the bill's opponents may have 
made large campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got to fight against people who have a tremendous amount of 
money, it raises questions," said Sandy Cooney, spokesman for Handgun Control 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is a chance that the bill will be granted another vote today, 
Tuesday's action represents a disappointing setback for Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
It was his last major fight with gun owners and dealers who tried to drive him 
from office in a fierce recall battle in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti held onto his seat, but -- after exhausting most of his campaign money 
on that fight -- lost his subsequent bid to become the Democratic nominee for 
state treasurer. Because term limits prevent him from running for his Senate 
seat again, the gun groups claimed credit for ending his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in a battle like this, you can't figure on a victory every time. 
It's combat," Roberti said after the vote. "Casualties are taken. It's not 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have expanded the state's ban to include so-called "copycat" 
firearms, those similar to the weapons on the banned list, but with slightly 
different names or designs. The measure was drafted along the lines of the 
federal ban on assault-style guns adopted earlier this month. But Roberti's 
proposal differed from the federal measure in that it would have required 
current owners of such weapons to register their firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the bill said it would create headaches for law-abiding citizens 
who owned such guns for sport or protection purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the bill, Assemblyman Trice Harvey (R-Bakersfield) said its 
supporters would do better to target criminals, not guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think something like this will change a murderer, then you're nuts," 
Harvey said. "This is not going to work. If you would let us execute some of 
these criminals, something would be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said he hoped to persuade Democrats who rejected the measure to cast 
an affirmative vote if the bill comes up again today. Several Democrats from 
rural districts voted down the bill, in addition to a number of lawmakers 
representing crime-prone areas of Southern California.

IRA TRUCE REPORTEDLY NEAR, PUTTING PROTESTANTS ON EDGE; NORTHERN IRELAND: 
PRO-BRITISH MAJORITY FEARS UNION WITH SOUTH. BUT IRISH LEADER SEES 'NEW 
BEGINNING.'

<P>
 Reports that the IRA is about to call a cease-fire after a quarter-century of 
bloodshed put nerves on edge Tuesday in Northern Ireland's majority Protestant 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations of a breakthrough rose as the United States granted single-entry 
visas to veteran Irish Republican Army member Joseph Cahill and Patrick 
Treanor, a member of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in New York, Cahill said it was a private visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the visas were issued "to 
enable Sinn Fein officials to garner support in the United States for an end to 
the violence in Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds declared, "I believe we are 
poised for peace and in a very short time we will be able to make an entirely 
new beginning on this island." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Reynolds' most upbeat assessment of the conflict in Northern Ireland 
since he and British Prime Minister John Major unveiled their Downing Street 
Declaration peace blueprint Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 That enthusiasm was not shared in Protestant districts of Belfast, where any 
agreement acceptable to the IRA is automatically suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, the English want rid of us. They'll do a deal with the IRA if the 
loyalist people let them. But we won't let them," said Jimmy Creighton, a 
Protestant community worker in Belfast's pro-British Glencairn district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds sought to reassure anxious Protestant political leaders and wary 
extremist groups that the peace plan would not force them into a union with 
Ireland, the goal of the IRA and Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 In the December blueprint, the British and Irish governments agreed that there 
would be no change in Northern Ireland's status without the consent of a 
majority of its people. They also said Sinn Fein could not participate in peace 
talks unless the IRA permanently halted violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about an imminent truce became intense after Sinn Fein leader 
Gerry Adams said Monday that he had met with IRA leaders and told them the time 
was right to "break the political, constitutional and military stalemate and 
create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation had swirled that a truce was likely to be declared late Tuesday or 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Most commentators predicted a temporary or indefinite truce, but a growing 
minority said the IRA might take the plunge London and Dublin have demanded and 
declare its 25-year-old war over. 
</P>
<P>
 Preacher-politician Ian Paisley warned that any sellout of the pro-British 
community would propel Northern Ireland into civil war -- after a guerrilla 
conflict that has killed more than 3,200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA's last major truce, in 1975, was partly brought down by a campaign of 
killings by Protestants determined to end any British dialogue with 
Republicans.

HUTU SOLDIERS JOINING ARMY OF FORMER FOES

<P>
 Dozens of Rwandan soldiers who supported the former Hutu government army are 
defecting daily to the mainly Tutsi force now in power, the U.N. special envoy 
for Rwanda said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first sign the resolve of the old army is cracking, 400 soldiers have 
joined up with the former rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, Shaharyar Khan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the soldiers are coming from the former French "safe zone" in the 
southwest that RPF forces have not yet entered. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government unveiled a cautious plan Tuesday to take control of the 
former "safe zone," where more than 1 million frightened Hutus sought refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 French troops completed their withdrawal from the zone Aug. 22, handing over 
the region to U.N. peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan said Tuesday that the United Nations will help the government 
re-establish civilian authority in the area over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Government security and armed forces will then be phased in after civilian 
control is established, Khan said.

CONGRESS; ONCE USED SPARINGLY, FILIBUSTER BECOMES A COMMON OBSTACLE; GOP 
SENATORS RELY ON THE TACTIC TO TIE UP FOES IN THE MAJORITY. HOUSE DEMOCRATS, 
WHOSE 'CLOSED RULES' HANDCUFF REPUBLICANS, CALL FOR A CHANGE.

 "I find that if I yield only for a question or a point of order that I can 
hold this floor almost until doomsday," freshman lawmaker Jeff Smith told his 
Senate colleagues back in 1939. "In other words, I've got a piece to speak and, 
blow hot or cold, I'm going to speak it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Smith of course was only a cinematic creation, portrayed by actor James 
Stewart in the memorable 1939 film "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." But there is 
nothing make-believe about the practice of filibustering that the movie 
celebrated. In fact, as the Congress grinds down the pre-election home stretch, 
congressional Democrats claim that such delays are more of an obstacle to 
legislation than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study released by the Democratic Study Group, a research group for 
House members, suggested that senators, most of them Republican, staged more 
filibusters in the last Congress, the 102nd, than in the entire 19th Century. 
And evidence indicates that talkathons are being mounted in this current 
Congress nearly as rapidly, forcing 55 motions to limit debate so far, compared 
to 62 in all of the last two-year session. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past the filibuster was used sparingly," contends Oklahoma Rep. Mike 
Synar, chairman of the Study Group said. "Now not only is it used a lot, but 
just the threat of it being used has made it harder for us to deal with issues 
that are vital like the economic stimulus package and the crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 From the inception, senators have always considered their chamber the more 
deliberative body of Congress, and one of their most cherished rights is the 
ability of each member to speak almost endlessly on legislation. It is that 
right that gave birth to the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Senate rules, a filibuster can be halted only by passing a motion for 
cloture, requiring 60 votes. Since the Senate now has 44 Republicans and 56 
Democrats, the majority party often finds it difficult to get to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that often the objection of one member raises the threat of a 
filibuster and is enough to delay action. It has become the most common of an 
array of procedural maneuvers Senate Republicans have been employing to tie up 
Democrats trying to enact President Clinton's ambitious domestic agenda, 
including health care, crime and economic stimulus legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not a senator objecting to your bill, then it's a senator amending 
your bill so that other people will object," says Karl Gawell, a lobbyist for 
the Wilderness Society. "In the past few years we've seen a real explosion in 
both the willingness and desire of people on Capitol Hill to get in each 
other's faces." 
</P>
<P>
 All this contentiousness has led House Democrats to take the unusual step of 
agitating for change in the way the "other body," conducts its business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the luxury of not butting in," Synar said. The rise in 
filibustering "is having an impact on the House. It doesn't do the House any 
good to move legislation on a variety of fronts only to have it die in the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 For this increase in acrimony, some say the Democrats have mainly themselves 
to blame, particularly the way they have used the rules of the House to 
dominate that body where Republicans have been in a minority for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Democrats have come to rely heavily on "closed rules," which establish 
the procedure for debating legislation and often give the GOP little 
opportunity to make amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They squeeze out the Republicans," said Charles O. Jones of the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington think tank. "So Republicans would argue in defense of 
the filibuster: 'Look what the Democrats have done in the House. The Senate is 
a place where we can still maintain some rights for the minority party, and we 
damn well are not going to give it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Sen. William S. Cohen of Maine, who served in the House for six 
years before entering the Senate in 1979, thinks the influx of former House 
members to the Senate has made the atmosphere more partisan and less clubby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place has changed," he said. "You don't have the collegiality you used to 
have. You don't have members share time together socially. The club doesn't 
exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who has participated in such filibusters as last year's against the 
Clinton economic stimulus program, nevertheless thinks the practice is used too 
often. "I think we ought to be more selective," he said. "You ought to be 
involved in a filibuster only when you have major issues of great 
disagreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Filibustering has changed over the years. In the climactic scene of "Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington," a bleary-eyed Jimmy Stewart keeled over on the Senate 
floor after hours of nonstop orating. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not likely to happen to any of today's filibusterers because the Senate 
in the mid-1960s adopted a two-track system, which sets aside blocks of time 
for extended debate on the particular measure being filibustered without 
halting all other business before the Senate. The change effectively made 
filibusters less of an oratory endurance contest and more of a procedural 
tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics claim that by making filibusters more convenient, the Senate has 
encouraged their use. 
</P>
<P>
 But returning to the old ways "wouldn't solve the problem," argues Adam 
Glickman, deputy director of Action, Not Gridlock, a new bipartisan group whose 
members include ex-senators from both parties that is campaigning to build 
public concern about the increase in filibustering. "If you make them talk all 
the time, that would just cause more gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps fittingly, delaying tactics were first used in the Senate on 
legislation in 1789 setting forth the location of the new nation's capital. 
Opponents stalled rather than approving a site on the Susquehanna River. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Democratic Study Group report, the first genuine filibusters 
did not begin until the 1840s, and there were only 16 filibusters during the 
remainder of the century. By contrast in the 102nd Congress, the Democratic 
Study Group survey tallied 35 filibusters, exceeding the previous high of 24 in 
the 101st Congress and a total of 22 so far in this Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Filibuster critics concede that statistics for the distant past may understate 
the number of filibusters, because of the lack of records. But they also say 
that current figures underestimate the influence of filibusters because they 
don't measure the impact on legislation of threatened filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, prospects for reform are not bright, if only because 
rules changes must be approved by a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Says former Democratic Sen. Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, a member of Action, 
Not Gridlock: "I think this filibustering is going to make term limits look 
like a good idea to most people." 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Pat Welch in Washington contributed to this story. A 
Rhetorical Roadblock 
</P>
<P>
 Filibusters are used by both liberals and conservatives. In 1964, a group 
filibustered a civil rights bill for 74 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule: Under Senate rules, any senator can talk as long as he or she wants, 
unless 60 senators vote to stop it by putting a time limit on debate. The House 
does not have filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
 How filibuster is used: When a senator or a small group of senators object to 
legislation but don't have the votes to defeat it, they can hold the floor 
indefinitely, preventing a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategy: The tactic is especially effective at the end of a session when the 
Senate is eager to adjourn but wants to vote on a measure before it quits. The 
talkative minority can force the majority to accept a compromise or give up 
altogether.

'I'M A SIMPLE PERSON . . . A FAMILY MAN,' JAILED CARLOS PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>

 Carlos the Jackal says he's just a family man suffering "moral assassination" 
in captivity, a newspaper said Tuesday in a report that prompted an 
investigation of how it got the imprisoned terrorist's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, a native Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also 
denied he is an alcoholic or planned to have liposuction to remove stomach fat, 
the French newspaper InfoMatin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I want to testify, because I can't stay like this without reacting to 
everything that is being said of me," Carlos was quoted as saying from his 
isolation cell at La Sante prison in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials, apparently viewing the report as a breach of security, said 
they are investigating how the paper got Carlos' comments. 
</P>
<P>
 InfoMatin told other news organizations it did not interview Carlos but 
obtained his comments "indirectly." Prison guards are forbidden to act as 
intermediaries for such things, French officials said. Carlos' lawyers denied 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be Carlos' first public comments since he was captured in Sudan and 
brought to France two weeks ago to stand trial in a string of bombings and 
killings in the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newspaper account, the 44-year-old Carlos portrays himself as 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are they trying to pass me off as an alcoholic?" he was quoted as saying. 
"All of that is false. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a simple person. I'm above all a family man. My wife and my daughter live 
as normally as anyone in Venezuela, with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos said he was caught after being "betrayed by friendly leaders who had 
received me very generously," an apparent reference to the Sudanese. "But now 
that they've neutralized me, instead of assassinating me physically, they are 
proceeding with a moral assassination."

WITH JAPAN'S RELENTLESS HEAT WAVE, IT'S BOOM OR BUST; ASIA: THE DROUGHT BOOSTS 
RICE YIELD BUT DAMAGES OTHER CROPS. SALES OF DISPOSABLE DINNERWARE SKYROCKET, 
BUT PARCHED FACTORIES FEEL THE PINCH. 
</P>

 Vegetables are withering on the vine, but rice is thriving. Sales are booming, 
but factories are beginning to cut back or halt production. It's all because of 
a heat wave that has been blessing and plaguing Japan all summer -- and which 
shows no signs of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic of the double-edged impact of the heat and its accompanying drought 
were two announcements from the Agriculture Ministry that Japan is likely to 
enjoy its best rice crop in eight years this fall -- 5% above normal -- even as 
overall agricultural losses from the drought already have reached an estimated 
$597 million as of Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sunlight that helped ripen rice grains in well-irrigated paddies has 
parched other crops, such as vegetables and fruit that are grown in 
non-irrigated fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit worst, the ministry said Monday, were growers of mikan (mandarin oranges), 
who feared that half of their annual earnings would be lost without rain by the 
middle of September. 
</P>
<P>
 And while supermarkets Monday reported their first year-to-year monthly 
increase in sales -- 4.6% -- in two years in July, manufacturers in 
drought-stricken areas faced more bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Imabari on the island of Shikoku closed valves at all 18 
factories throughout the city, shutting off the supply of industrial water to 
plants that produce 55% of Japan's domestic output of towels. The towel 
industry employs 30,000 workers -- half of the labor force and a quarter of the 
population of the city of 120,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 No indication was given about when water supplies might be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Shikoku, sales of items like wooden chopsticks, aluminum foil, 
paper cups and paper plates have soared as families try to curtail use of water 
for dishwashing. A hospital in Takamatsu that normally gives patients baths 
daily has cut back to one bath every three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in western Japan, oil refineries and petrochemical plants, both of 
which use industrial water as coolants, have been transforming oil tankers into 
water carriers since late July. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Japan Energy Co. oil refinery in Kurashiki on the main island of 
Honshu, a tanker arrived Monday from Vietnam bearing some of the 59,000 tons of 
water that the refinery has been forced to order to keep operations going at 
70% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever could be called water -- we have been reusing it since early July," 
said Yoshitomi Ebina, a spokesman for Japan Energy Co. "We have been gathering 
even steam for recycling." 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of facilities to load water into tankers at its other locations in 
Japan has forced the company to turn to imports from Hong Kong, China and South 
Korea in addition to Vietnam, Ebina said. "We have done all that is humanly 
possible. The rest is up to heaven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weather bureau has said that except for parts of the northern island 
of Hokkaido, sunshine is expected to prevail across the country for the rest of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Refineries and petrochemical plants in western Japan have mobilized more than 
150 tankers -- or about one in every five engaged in coastal shipping of 
refined petroleum products -- to transport water from sections of Japan where 
the drought has not been so severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoirs in both Imabari and Kurashiki are expected to hit bottom by 
mid-September unless rain falls before then. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, rice farmers find themselves facing the prospect of an oversupply 
after a year of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Japan was forced to lift its ban on rice imports after a cold, 
rainy summer left the country with a rice harvest that was 26% below normal, 
and by this summer it had imported more than 2 million tons from the United 
States, Australia, Thailand and China. Now, a surplus of 2.5 million tons looms 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop an expected harvest of 11 million tons -- 1 million tons more than 
ordinary consumption -- warehouses are filled with 1.1 million tons of excess 
imports this year. And under an international trade agreement, Japan will be 
obliged to import 400,000 tons, or 4% of its annual demand, next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Japanese baseball has been weather-stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, so many regular season games are rained out that a three-week period 
is set aside after the season to allow teams to complete their full schedule 
before the "Japan Series" begins in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, so few rain-outs have occurred that fans fear that the Central 
and Pacific league champions will go into the Series cold if they have no games 
to make up during the three-week layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in Tokyo hit 91 degrees Tuesday. An all-time high of 102 was 
recorded Aug. 3.

SUIT ENDS DENTAL PLAN THAT BARS FEE DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacking a practice described as widespread in the health care industry, the 
Justice Department and Arizona's attorney general moved Tuesday to end a dental 
plan agreement that prevents dentists from discounting their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Dental Plan of Arizona admitted no wrongdoing, but under a proposed 
consent decree filed in federal court in Phoenix, Delta will notify its 
participating dentists that the plan's "most-favored-nation" pricing provisions 
no longer apply. The dentists also will be told that they "are completely free 
to offer discounts." 
</P>
<P>
 The "most-favored-nation" provision requires member dentists to charge Delta 
their lowest fee. It had the effect of preventing dentists from reducing fees 
for other patients below those offered in the Delta plan, according to the 
Justice Department. It also deterred competing dental insurance plans from 
entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 85% of Arizona dentists are affiliated with Delta Dental, and 
Delta patients account for a significant part of the member dentists' income, 
the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne K. Bingaman, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said five similar 
pricing agreements involving a wide range of health care services are currently 
under Justice Department investigation. She declined to specify in what states 
the others operate but noted that two are nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case of nationwide importance because it involves a contract 
provision that is widely used in the health care industry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman, appearing at a joint press conference with Arizona Atty. Gen. Grant 
Woods, estimated the action will save Arizona dental patients between $6 
million and $10 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the pricing provisions could be read to encourage lower fees. 
But some participating dentists charged lower prices to non-Delta patients or 
to competing dental plans, and Delta began enforcing its pricing clause. As a 
consequence, most participating dentists refused to discount their fees to 
anyone, the suit alleged. Otherwise, they would have had to cut their Delta 
charges to the same level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because most participating dentists receive such a significant portion of 
their income from serving Delta patients, the costs of having to lower their 
Delta fees would have been too great," the Justice Department contended. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Ed Judd, president and chief executive officer of Delta Dental, defended 
the most-favored-nation provision as "a key component in our ability to control 
costs" and said it would have been upheld in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But Delta agreed to the settlement "primarily because of the financial impact 
of a prolonged litigation and the possible loss of many millions of dollars in 
state, municipality and federal business that pays for dental service provided 
to Arizonans," Judd said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, we had a multimillion-dollar hammer held over our heads," Judd 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they always say," Woods responded. "The PR spin is typical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We filed this case because we were hearing from a lot of people who were 
getting hurt, particularly people with not much income." Dentists in four 
competing plans that offered lower prices also complained about the Delta 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman said the most-favored-nation pricing clauses are not all illegal or 
anti-competitive. While she said the clauses would be scrutinized on "a 
case-by-case basis," she indicated that the suit against Delta was brought 
because most of Arizona's dentists belong to Delta and much of their income 
flows from that affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of dentists who had signed up with discount dental plans trying to 
compete with Delta were forced to resign from those plans because of the 
most-favored-nation clause, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bingaman urged the Pennsylvania Insurance Department to reject a 
similar pricing clause proposed by Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania on 
grounds that it would raise the costs of hospital services and health plans in 
the area. And in May, New York state insurance regulators cited Bingaman's 
letter in rejecting a similar Blue Cross pricing clause there.

MAN ANGERED BY CHANGES IN BILL INSPIRED BY SON'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Lanni is nothing short of bewildered after his first brush with the 
business of making laws in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After his 7-year-old son was hit and killed by a pickup truck while getting 
off a school bus in Laguna Niguel in April, Lanni decided to try to salvage 
something positive from the family tragedy. He began pushing for a state law 
making it mandatory for bus drivers to flash warning lights to get traffic to 
stop whenever children are disembarking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni, an electrical engineer, figured it was a legislative slam-dunk. But not 
in Sacramento. Despite the best efforts of Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach), the bill was watered down in committee because of fears that flashing 
lights could cause traffic accidents and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, expected to win approval this week, gives school districts wide 
discretion to select the bus stops where drivers should flash the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lanni, that's simply not good enough. "They've emasculated the bill," he 
said. "In its present form, this bill is tantamount to no change at all. I 
don't know what the underlying motivations are, but it's apparent the people in 
Sacramento are out of touch with reality." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bill eventually expected to reach the desk of Gov. Pete Wilson, who 
has not taken a stance on the issue, Lanni said he might write a letter asking 
the governor to veto it. "My fear is passage of this bill will lead people to 
believe something has been done, when in reality nothing has been done," Lanni 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said she understands Lanni's frustrations with the ways and wiles of 
the Capitol but emphasized that her measure is a good first step and makes 
changes that help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pushed as hard as we could," Bergeson said. "I think we came out with the 
best we could. It will be a benefit, and lives will be saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing law requires school bus drivers to flash the warning lights only when 
students are going to cross the street. Bergeson's bill would allow districts 
to designate the use of the lights at certain dangerous stops, even if students 
are not crossing the street. A district would have to get permission from the 
California Highway Patrol and the local traffic engineering department to give 
the stop that designation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was extensively altered during a Senate Transportation Committee 
hearing by legislators who feared that requiring school buses to use their 
warning lights at every stop would do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Mehdi Morshed, a committee consultant, said the change would have had 
"serious ramifications," giving children a false sense of security, causing 
traffic congestion and increasing the likelihood of accidents. The problems 
would be particularly increased at bus stops along busy, multilane 
thoroughfares where traffic speeds often approach 50 m.p.h., Morshed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface it looks like a wonderful idea," Morshed said. "But when you 
apply it to major arterials, it just simply doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni doesn't accept such reasoning. "They talk about driver inconvenience," 
he said. "I suggest someone talk to the fellow who hit my son and ask him how 
much of an inconvenience it would have been to stop. I think he'd say he would 
have been glad to stop."

MISSING MAN MAY BE VICTIM IN MULTI-STATE CRIME SPREE; VIOLENCE: ATTACKS STRETCH 
FROM MISSOURI TO HUNTINGTON BEACH. 
</P>

<P>
 Investigators believe a missing Excelsior Springs man was abducted by a 
teen-ager and two men linked to killings, auto thefts and other crimes, 
including a bungled purse snatching in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance last Wednesday of Richard L. Drummond, 47, in Kingdom City 
was reported to police by his family after he failed to phone home, attend 
business appointments or meet a co-worker for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 John McGovern, Excelsior Springs police chief, said investigators don't think 
Drummond, an AT&T supervisor, is still with his abductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers searched the Kingdom City area in central Missouri by air Monday, and 
about 25 AT&T employees have been searching on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 About the time Drummond vanished Aug. 24, a Blue Springs couple told police 
their 17-year-old son was missing with a car he'd borrowed a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 That car was found in Kingdom City near a house that had been burglarized. A 
handgun was among the items taken from the house. Police theorize Drummond 
stopped when he saw the disabled car, was abducted and his car stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, on Saturday, Drummond's car was found near Kingman, Ariz., 
where Joseph and Charlene Babcock were found shot to death near their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police think Babcock, who was shot in the head, went outside to help a car 
that had landed in a ditch late Friday or early Saturday, said Tonya Dowe of 
the Mohave County Sheriff's Department in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Babcock's body was found in the doorway of the house. Police think 
she might have witnessed her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The killers left behind Drummond's car and drove away in the Babcocks' pickup 
truck. A neighbor checking out the unfamiliar car found the Babcocks' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, two men in what police think was the Babcocks' pickup truck 
were involved in a bungled purse snatching at a supermarket in Huntington 
Beach. One of the men fired three shots at a witness who was chasing him, but 
no one was injured.

ROSA PARKS, 81, CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEER, ASSAULTED IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her bus seat to a white man sparked the 
modern civil rights movement, was assaulted by an intruder at her home Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, 81, was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where she was treated for 
swelling on the right side of her face and possible chest bruises. She was 
later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks was upstairs in her home when she heard a noise downstairs, said Police 
Chief Isaiah McKinnon. When she went down to investigate, a man was inside her 
house, reeking of alcohol, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her back door had been knocked off its hinges. The man told her someone else 
had knocked down the door and he was there to protect her, and then he hit her, 
McKinnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant fled on foot with about $50, McKinnon said. No arrest had been 
made by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 'You would hope that wouldn't happen to anyone," said Cliff Russell, a 
spokesman for Mayor Dennis Archer. "I don't know what to say about anyone who 
would do something like that to Rosa Parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks was 42 when she committed an act of defiance that was to earn her the 
title "Mother of the Civil Rights Movement." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Jim Crow laws enacted after the post-Civil War Reconstruction 
required separation of the races in buses, restaurants and public 
accommodations throughout the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montgomery, Ala., seamstress, an active member of the local chapter of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, was riding on a city bus 
Dec. 1, 1955, when a white man demanded her seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks refused, despite rules requiring blacks to yield their seats to whites, 
and was jailed. Her arrest triggered a 381-day boycott of the bus line, which 
resulted in the desegregation of the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montgomery bus boycott, which came one year after the U.S. Supreme Court's 
landmark declaration that separate schools for blacks and whites were 
inherently unequal, marked the start of the modern civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks moved to Detroit in 1957. She worked as an aide to Rep. John Conyers Jr. 
(D-Mich.) from 1965 until retiring in 1988.

THE EIGHT LIVES OF A SERIAL SERVICEMAN AND HIS ARMY-NAVY SHELL GAME; MILITARY: 
FOR MORE THAN 12 YEARS UNTIL HE WAS COURT-MARTIALED, A CHAMELEON-LIKE LONER 
ENLISTED OVER AND OVER USING MULTIPLE ALIASES.

<P>
 First there was Walter Banks Beacham Jr., and it was his real name. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Mark Richard Gerardi, the first of many aliases, followed by Cedrick 
Houston and Chris Villanueva and Zachary Pitt and George Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times he served in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times he served in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he was court-martialed. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a dozen years, he managed to foil recruiters by using fictitious 
names and fictitious credentials. And after serving just long enough to receive 
his signing bonus, he would hop a fence or hail a taxi and then slip unnoticed 
back into civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the things I've seen and done," he said the other day. "My life is a 
facade." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps his greatest accomplishment was beating the largest and most 
complex organization in the United States: the military. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did it at a time when the armed forces have been letting fewer people 
in, the Pentagon is downsizing and closing bases, and the Army and Navy have 
offered early retirements and buyouts in order to get people out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing. I'm intrigued. I'm appalled," said Kathleen M. Gilberd, a 
paralegal counselor who specializes in military administrative matters in San 
Diego, where Beacham went through several of his Navy boot camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight is a hell of a lot of enlistments, and I'm a little puzzled because 
you'd think the background checks would catch him." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bowers, a Fairfield, Calif., attorney who as an Army captain prosecuted 
Beacham at Ft. Ord, said that in the 500 courts-martial he has handled, nothing 
compares in scope to the revolving-door antics of Navy Petty 
Officer-turned-Army Pvt. Walter Banks Beacham Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew the system, he knew the right codes," Bowers said. "And that's all 
stuff that even most prosecutors and lawyers don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you have to consider that recruiters have certain quotas they have to 
make, and recruiting is difficult right now with the drawdown. There may be 
some oversight by recruiters who look the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 With phony birth certificates, fake driver's licenses and fraudulent Social 
Security cards, Beacham enlisted over and over again under multiple aliases. It 
was a pattern that turned his life into a double-entendre. 
</P>
<P>
 The product of a mixed marriage, he can easily pass as either white, African 
American, Cuban or Puerto Rican. He said he was raised in and out of juvenile 
halls in Chicago and California. He took the nickname "Sonny," and on his left 
shoulder is etched a tattoo of battling good and bad angels. "It reminds me I'm 
in conflict with myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at age 34, he lives in a $160-a-month room near Los Angeles City 
College, works as a private security guard but is still so restless that during 
an interview in a downtown office building he could not resist the urge to 
deceive others. After excusing himself to use the men's room, he returned with 
the distinct smell of cigarette smoke on his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I can only take it back to my childhood," he said. "I had the 
features of a white kid but the attitude of a black kid. I could pass for 
anything. I could be an innocent, cute, little kid or a troublemaker. I took 
chances and I got away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I observe things. I keep my eyes open. I see stuff. And I never want to 
be lost. I look for shortcuts. I see life differently. Basically it's just like 
I'm seeing for myself that I'm a loner. I like to take chances, and by being a 
loner, you're the leader of your gang because you're the only one in it." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother also tried to explain her son's psyche, recalling how he was made a 
ward of the state when he was 9 years old because "I couldn't control his 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "They said he had a double personality, and he was almost diagnosed 
schizophrenic," said Mary Ann Beacham of Oakland. "Sometimes he would act one 
way and sometimes another. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to get his life together," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Reassembling his life is now Beacham's greatest challenge. In the past, he 
joined the service for signing bonuses of up $4,000, for trips to exotic ports 
in Asia and Europe, and for his greatest love -- the chance to live someone 
else's life. 
</P>
<P>
 According to military records and Beacham's own recollections, he first joined 
the Navy in 1980 in Oakland. He had stopped in at a recruiting station at a 
local mini-mall, full of patriotic zeal to "defend my country and do the good 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a big Afro," he said. "It was out there. It looked like I was in one of 
those Snoop Doggy Dogg videos." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the recruiter later came to his home. "There were about eight of my 
friends and we were all sitting around and smoking and drinking and he 
recruited us all," Beacham said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Navy days ended in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 During boot camp at a San Diego training center, Beacham felt uncomfortable in 
what he called the "white man's Navy." After seven brief AWOL incidents, he 
left for good. "I put away my uniform, I got my money, I took a cab out of the 
front gate and then a Greyhound to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, he joined the Army. He added the "Jr." to his name. And when 
recruiting officials inquired, he answered "no" to every question -- no 
problems at school, no problems with police, no prior enlistments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you do drugs? Answer no," Beacham said. "Are you a homosexual? No. Have 
you been in the service before? No." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a soldier for six months when he was discharged after the Army got wise 
and realized his Social Security number matched that of the Beacham who'd been 
in the Navy. So he returned to Oakland, and within three months re-entered the 
Navy -- incredibly again using his real name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have made it through but five weeks into it, they found drugs in my 
urine and one of the company commanders was still there from the time before 
and he saw my name on a list," Beacham said. "I went AWOL." 
</P>
<P>
 His fourth enlistment was in the Army Reserve in 1984. He took the name of a 
high school friend, borrowed his diploma and his birth certificate and other 
identification records, and joined up as Mark Richard Gerardi. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed boot camp at Ft. Dix, N.J., was attached to a San Francisco unit 
and toured South Korea for three weeks. And then? 
</P>
<P>
 "I got this one female pregnant and I left her," he said. "She got pissed and 
was going to turn me in. So I had to be cool. I worked my job for a bit. But 
then I walked away and never heard again from them. I guess they just cut you 
loose after awhile. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Cedrick L. Houston joined the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got that name from a guy I met who was trying to be a dancer in Hollywood," 
Beacham said. "He was a struggling dancer or actor or something. I told him I 
could get him a job if I could use his credentials." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished basic training and then was sent to submarine school on the East 
Coast. "But I called some white guy a cracker and they all went crazy. I was 
selling doughnuts on the base there until classes started and I called this 
sailor a silly-ass cracker. And they put me out of the Navy for that." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 was in 1987, when he joined the Army in Glendale. The name this time was 
Chris Villanueva. ID taken from an out-of-work truck driver he met in the San 
Fernando Valley. Boot camp in Ft. Sill, Okla. Then posted to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 While there, he was interrogated about a large amount of cocaine found in some 
duffel bags. Fearing arrest, he snuck away, he said, eventually returning to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7. 1989. The Navy. Zachary Pitt. "I met him in the Bay Area. I don't even 
remember if he was white or Mexican," Beacham said. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to San Diego and worked as a mess management specialist. "I was a 
cook," he said. He walked out shortly before his ship was to leave for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8. 1992. The final enlistment. The Army. George Perez. Boot camp at Ft. 
Bliss, Tex. Advanced training at Ft. Sill. Assigned as a forward observer in a 
field artillery unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something happened. I couldn't stick around. Time was choking up on me. I was 
in trouble for staying out late, and I was afraid I'd be busted right then. I 
left before I got my bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 But like time, luck also was running out. He was arrested by police in 
December, 1992, after an argument with a Los Angeles bus driver. Turned over to 
military authorities, he was court-martialed at Ft. Ord on multiple charges of 
unlawful enlistment, being AWOL and desertion, as well as the old drug case in 
Germany. He served eight months and 25 days in an Army prison at Ft. Lewis, 
Wash. He was dishonorably discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 At his court-martial, he stood before the Army judge and pleaded guilty, and 
he tried to explain who Walter Banks Beacham Jr. is. "I have had a lot of 
problems in the past," he said. "A long time ago, these problems arose when I 
was merely trying to serve my country." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he added, as if in understatement: "I know that it is difficult to see 
the real me."

 Legislation to prohibit merchants from charging more money for goods or 
services based solely on a person's sex -- and also bar employers from 
preventing women employees from wearing slacks to work -- has been approved by 
the Assembly.

<P>
 A 45-29 vote sent the bill (SB 1288) by Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) 
back to the Senate for concurrence in Assembly amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the law is needed because women often are charged more than men 
for such things as clothes, new cars, haircuts, laundry and dry cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a no-brainer," Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) told her 
colleagues. "If you vote no on this bill, there's no reason for you to go back 
to your district and seek women's support." 
</P>
<P>
 But an opponent, Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) replied that 
businesses can't tolerate lowered profits. "Think about it," Boland said. 
"You're voting to raise some prices, not lower them." GOVERNOR

JUSTICES REFUSE TO OVERTURN BAN ON WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand a lower court order 
preventing the Wilson Administration from making a 2.3% cut in welfare benefits 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 State social services officials, acknowledging that court appeals had run out, 
said they would begin immediately notifying counties that welfare benefits 
would remain at their current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In some counties, such as Los Angeles, they said checks have already been 
mailed that reflect the 2.3% reduction in benefits as of Sept. 1. Recipients in 
those counties, they said, will be compensated when they receive their next 
check in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said the court action would cost the state an estimated $5.6 
million a month and blamed advocates for the poor who had challenged the cuts 
in court for worsening the state's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shameful that (a) self-appointed band of welfare advocates can 
substitute its distorted view of welfare reform and spending priorities for the 
fiscal policy decisions of two-thirds of both houses of the duly elected state 
Legislature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Melinda Bird, an attorney for the Western Center on Law & Poverty Inc., 
which provides legal representation for the poor, said the courts clearly had 
agreed with the advocates' position. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Superior Court Judge Stuart Pollak in San Francisco ruled that the 
state could not go ahead with the cuts because it had not obtained proper 
authorization from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts would have affected 2.7 million poor Californians, who are supported 
by Aid to Families With Dependent Children, a program financed primarily by the 
state and federal governments. For an average family of three, the cuts would 
have reduced monthly cash benefits from $607 to $593. 
</P>
<P>
 The state had obtained authorization for the cuts from the Bush Administration 
but that authorization was invalidated by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
in July. A three-judge panel on the court said federal officials had failed to 
consider the adverse impact the reductions in benefits would have on poor 
families.

DE LA VINA NAMED INS CHIEF IN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gustavo De La Vina, the chief agent of the Border Patrol's busy San Diego 
sector, has been promoted to western regional director of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment was announced Tuesday by Commissioner Doris Meissner of the 
INS, the patrol's parent agency. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina, a 55-year-old Texan who has worked 24 years in the Border Patrol, 
came to San Diego in 1990. He inherited the sensitive, high-profile command of 
an often-tense sector, where agents guarding a 15-mile strip make about half 
the million-plus yearly arrests on the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional director's post has been vacant for about a year, with various 
people acting as interim director. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Vina launched a program to fortify the border with the installation of 
10-foot fences, high-intensity lights and an increase in personnel and 
equipment. Those measures, along with improved cooperation with Mexican law 
enforcement, have been credited with decreasing crime and violent 
confrontations at the San Diego-Tijuana border during recent years.

2-INCOME WORKER LOSES 1, WINS 1 IN SUMMER OF LABOR DISPUTES; JOBS: BASEBALL 
STOPPAGE IDLES MORT ROSE, A DODGER STADIUM PEANUT VENDOR. BUT HE PROBABLY WON'T 
HAVE TO TAKE PART IN A TEACHERS STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For weeks Mort Rose had been afraid that it would only take two strikes to get 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
 He had lost the income from his job as a peanut vendor at Dodger Stadium 
because of the baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 And until last weekend, he had been afraid that a threatened strike by Los 
Angeles teachers would cost him the salary from his other job -- teaching sixth 
grade at Selma Street Elementary School in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 So he was relieved that a teachers strike was probably averted when the Board 
of Education approved a new contract offer that would restore 8% of the 10% 
salary cut that teachers have absorbed for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I don't have to think about that (a teachers strike) anymore," said 
Rose, sighing with relief. "It's been bad enough with the baseball strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally on a day like today Rose would be at work at Dodger Stadium, walking 
through the stands in his blue-and-white striped shirt and black pants, 
pitching peanuts into the hands of fans. Instead, he spends his time watching 
television, feeling depressed about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rely on selling peanuts. I'm one of the top guys," said Rose, 52, who has 
been working Dodger games for 35 years. The strike also has been a financial 
hardship for both his sons, who sell pizza and cotton candy at Dodger Stadium. 
His oldest attends UCLA, where tuition is $1,300 per quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For 27 years Rose has taught at Selma Elementary, a job that he loves as much 
as the one at Dodger Stadium. He rarely has to miss a game because most are 
played in the evenings and on weekends. "Plus, they travel a lot, so it's not 
like they're here all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose had feared that his shaky finances would force him to cross the picket 
line if teachers went on strike. "I've been out on every teachers strike, but 
with all the money I've lost from the Dodgers, I have a big decision," Rose 
said before the board made the new offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he hopes that the baseball strike will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why the owners and players can't get together," Rose said. 
"They're making millions." 
</P>
<P>
 He figures that if the strike continues to the end of the season, he will lose 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose moved to Los Angeles with his parents from Philadelphia when he was a 
teen-ager. He sold his first bag of peanuts at the Coliseum during a Dodger 
game in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first game I worked, they were honoring Roy Campanella," Rose said. "He 
had just had the auto accident that disabled him the year before. They lit 
matches, thousands of them, in his honor. I'll never forget that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he usually makes $140 a game, keeping a percentage of the profits. 
Because he is one of the top sellers, he said, he gets to pick what he wants to 
sell. Peanuts are the most popular items sold by vendors, Rose said, although 
on a really hot day he prefers to sell snow cones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most gratifying aspect of being a vendor, he said, is running into 
former students. "Many times, I get stopped during a game: 'Mr. Rose, do you 
remember me?' Then they'll introduce me to their children," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids knew I worked for the Dodgers, and when they see me, they say: 
'You're still here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Doris Dent came to Selma Avenue as the new principal last fall, she also 
recognized Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Dent searched through Rose's file and found a short article printed in a local 
magazine about a day in the life of a peanut vendor. "Then I realized why he 
looked so familiar," she said. "I go to Dodger games frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is the kind of teacher that children come back to visit years later, Dent 
said. "He remembers the kids and follows up on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers or staff who want to vent their complaints or frustrations seek out 
Rose, said teaching assistant Sandy Gagnier. "He's looked up to when people 
have problems, or they need an ear," said Gagnier, who has worked at Selma 
Avenue Elementary for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice High School teacher George Woods said he had spoken to Rose during the 
contract negotiations. "I knew Mort was frustrated, and I understood his 
concerns," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers want to have some peace in their life," said Woods, who is in charge 
of keeping Westside teachers abreast of developments in the negotiations. "They 
want a three-year contract, to be able to buy a car or house or pay for their 
kids' college education." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is convinced that most teachers agree with Rose and are satisfied 
with the compromise. "They're not happy, " said Woods, after attending a Monday 
morning meeting of teachers and union representatives, "but they're at least 
willing to accept this." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent teachers union strategy session, teachers bemoaned the fact that 
more media coverage was being given to the baseball strike than to their 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the teachers union accepted the district's one-year contract offer 
Saturday. Teachers will vote on the offer Sept. 12, the day most schools 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, whose teaching salary is $38,000 (he earned $41,000 before the pay cut), 
said it used to anger him that baseball players "make more during one game than 
I do in a year." It does not bother him anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that the value of teachers is not understood by the public," he 
said. "They don't realize the importance of the education profession. That's 
just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs when asked what made him pick teaching as a career. "It was so many 
years ago," Rose said. "But I always enjoyed working with children. I spent one 
summer as a camp counselor, and after that I decided to try teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of their new financial strain forced Rose and his wife, Kathy, who 
works at a Culver City preschool, to scrap plans to vacation at Lake Tahoe and 
San Francisco this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 With no money coming in since the beginning of the baseball strike, Rose said 
he is considering filing financial aid applications for his son at UCLA. 
Meanwhile, Rose is looking forward to the new school year, and that first 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 But he really misses baseball -- and not only because of the money. "Dodger 
Stadium is such a nice place to work, and they do a good job of keeping it a 
nice, family environment," Rose said. "And I'm a fan too."

TODDLER DIES AFTER BEING SHOT ON PORCH; TRAGEDY: THE GIRL'S MOTHER HAD STOPPED 
AT A HOUSE DURING A WALK IN SOUTH EL MONTE. GANG-RELATED GUNFIRE ALSO INJURES 
TWO MEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A family's evening stroll ended in death Monday when a mother and her three 
young children, who had stopped briefly at a house in South El Monte, were 
caught in gunfire from a gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shots ended, 16-month-old Maureen Ramirez sagged limp in her stroller 
on the front porch, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the head that later 
claimed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men who were also on the porch -- one of whom neighbors said had gang 
tattoos -- escaped with minor wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know the people at the house," said the slain baby's mother, Elaine 
Ramirez, as she was comforted Tuesday by friends at her home in El Monte. "I've 
never been there before. . . . I was at the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 9:30 p.m. when two men in their 20s walked up to 
the Sastre Street house, opened fire with semiautomatic weapons and fled on 
foot, authorities said. The shooting is believed to be gang-related because 
witnesses said the two suspects resembled gang members, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators identified the wounded men as Romero Castellanos, 31, 
and Jessie Medina, 23. Castellanos was hit in the back and Medina was wounded 
in the left leg. Both were treated at Greater El Monte Community Hospital and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, 30, said she and her 8-year-old son, 5-year-old daughter and toddler 
Maureen had stopped at the house purely by chance. A single mother and devout 
Christian, Ramirez said she and two other adults had decided to take her 
children for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 As they passed the Sastre Street house, she said, they were greeted by a man 
who attends their church in Montebello. The group paused to chat and Ramirez's 
5-year-old daughter asked to use the bathroom of the house. Ramirez said her 
daughter had just come out of the house and the group was preparing to leave 
when nine shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 As her children screamed, Ramirez realized to her horror that Maureen had been 
hit in the forehead. Instinctively, Ramirez said, she pulled her daughter out 
of the stroller and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I freaked out and ran into the hall with her to the bathroom to wash her up," 
Ramirez said. "But I knew she was gone. She was bleeding out of her mouth and 
nose and she was real limp." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Ramirez wept as she recalled her daughter's short life. Nicknamed 
Morty by family members, the girl was called the "praise and worship child" by 
church members because of her enthusiastic clapping during hymns and her 
joyful, happy-go-lucky personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's first word was amen , Ramirez said. Her daughter could barely talk 
but knelt with clasped hands every night beside her older brother and sister to 
pray at bedtime, the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As little as she was, she touched a lot of people's lives," Ramirez said, 
wiping away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel hatred toward (the gunmen)," she added. "Like it says in the 
Bible, the little children are the Lord's." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on Sastre Street said the shooting was not surprising in an area a 
street where parents call their children in after dark because of the dangers 
outside. Young men congregate on corners, music blares from passing cars and 
gang members routinely run up alleys and driveways fleeing assailants, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang graffiti is scribbled on sidewalks and utility poles. Rocks have been 
thrown through windows of some houses, and the damage remains unrepaired for 
weeks, residents complained. 
</P>
<P>
 One elderly couple, Paul and Lupe de la Rosa, said a "coyote," or immigrant 
smuggler, used to bring in carloads of immigrants who hid out in the 
neighborhood. The couple said children and cocaine users burned down four 
houses on the street earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Farias, 37, a 20-year resident of the street, said shots were fired at 
the house next door to hers last week. In July, a barbecue party in her yard 
ended quickly when a car cruised slowly past with its headlights off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was worse before," Farias said. "(Police) used to barricade the streets."

COUNTY OKS ASSESSMENT FOR LIBRARY SYSTEM; FINANCES: EFFORT TO INFUSE $16 
MILLION A YEAR INTO TROUBLED NETWORK FACES LEGAL CHALLENGES. MOLINA SAYS SHE 
MAY REVERSE HER APPROVAL OF PLAN, WHICH PASSED ON A 3-2 VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a vote that is certain to face legal challenges, the County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday approved a new property assessment that will infuse $16 
million a year into the county's troubled library system and bring nearly 60 
branches back to full service before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system was in a state of potential collapse," Supervisor Ed Edelman said. 
"But this finally gives the libraries a permanent funding base and the 
stability they need." 
</P>
<P>
 A near-capacity crowd of about 700 library supporters and tax foes cheered, 
booed, whistled at and even serenaded the supervisors in the course of a 
raucous one-hour debate on the unusual plan that was championed as the last 
hope for learning and vilified as an end run on the now mythic Proposition 13 
tax revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, property owners in unincorporated areas and 16 cities will be 
assessed a special fee on their November property tax bill to fund county 
libraries. The fees will range from $28.50 annually for single-family homes to 
several hundred dollars for most commercial properties. Larger commercial and 
industrial projects could face assessments of several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial matter was narrowly approved when a reluctant Supervisor 
Gloria Molina agreed to side with Edelman and Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke. Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana opposed the measure, saying 
that county residents and businesses are too heavily taxed and that ample 
county funds are available but are being misspent on costly health programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's endorsement was tempered by her request that the matter be scheduled 
for reconsideration in late September when county accountants will determine 
whether there are surplus funds from the fiscal year that just ended. Molina 
said she would prefer to use any surplus to fund the libraries, and said she 
may vote to repeal the assessment plan at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggestion landed like a wet blanket over the hundreds of cheering 
library supporters celebrating their victory and a hush quickly fell on the 
auditorium. Burke gaveled the meeting to a brief recess and the subdued crowd 
filed out of the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan faces other hurdles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Coupal, an attorney for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's Assn., said his 
organization will sue to block the assessment, which he labeled as "unwise and 
illegal . . . arbitrary and irrational." 
</P>
<P>
 The county is using a novel legal tactic to establish a so-called community 
facilities district, which allows local governments to levy fees on property 
owners for specific purposes. Most commonly these districts are used to build 
schools, sewers and other projects that benefit all property owners in new 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupal said it is ridiculous to represent that all property owners in the 
district would in fact benefit from the library assessment and he asked 
specifically how mortuaries and kennels would possibly benefit. Coupal also 
argued that the assessment is a thinly veiled property tax and therefore 
requires a two-thirds vote of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said he is confident the plan will withstand any 
legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the effervescent throng at the meeting was in support of the 
measure, it has found only thin support among elected officials around the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 52 cities that are part of the county library district, only 16 have 
voted to become part of the special assessment district. Twenty-five have voted 
to stay out and 11 others are undecided and therefore not a part of the plan at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those giving their wholehearted support to the plan was the mayor of El 
Monte, which voted to join the assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use the libraries, my children use the libraries . . . and I want the 
libraries to be there for my grandchildren," said Mayor Patricia Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 89-branch library system has lost 50% of its funding in the past 
two years as property taxes have been siphoned off for other state and local 
programs. The budget cuts have caused the permanent closure of 10 libraries, 
the layoff of 300 workers and a 60% cutback in library hours. More than half of 
the county's libraries are now open just two days a week and even the largest 
are open just four days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the new assessment fees, 51 additional branches would have to be 
closed and hours scaled back even further at the remaining branches, according 
to Sandra Reuben, county librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 With the assessment fees, Reuben said, all 57 branches in the unincorporated 
areas and the 16 cities that opted into the assessment district will be kept 
open and their hours restored to a six- or seven-day-a-week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities in the cities that rejected the assessment district plan must 
suffer the reduced hours and in the future could face closures, Reuben said. 
Library Support 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-two cities have county libraries within their boundaries, but only 16 
voted to participate in the new property assessment program that will generate 
money for libraries. They are:

 * Agoura Hills 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GRANADA HILLS; 
WESTBOUND SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY LANES TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the relief of many traffic-maddened motorists, all five westbound lanes of 
the Simi Valley Freeway -- the last major bottleneck from the Northridge quake 
-- will reopen this weekend, a top state transportation official confirmed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound lanes will follow next Wednesday, making all 10 lanes available 
to motorists at the San Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek overpasses, 
despite construction delays that once were expected to push the reopening date 
back to mid-September 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers, who have toiled around the clock for months, were 
putting the finishing touches Tuesday on the westbound side of the 
reconstructed spans, which sagged by as much as four feet in some spots after 
the quake. Repairs on the eastbound lanes, which now serve as a detour for 
traffic in both directions, wrapped up in May.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; MAN IS CHARGED 
IN CROSS BURNING NEAR APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted burglar who allegedly burned a cross outside a Pomona apartment 
complex where several black families live was named in a felony complaint 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Ward Garmon, 24, was charged with violating a California Penal Code 
section that makes it a crime to burn a religious symbol on private property 
"for the purpose of terrorizing the owner or occupant."  
</P>
<P>
 Garmon, who is on parole for residential burglary, was arrested early Sunday 
after a cross was burned just before midnight in front of the apartment complex 
on Karesh Avenue in Pomona where several African American families live, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Gary Hearnsberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents chased Garmon, who lives nearby, until police arrived and arrested 
him, the prosecutor said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 6 
MORE GUARDS DEPLOYED TO QUAKE 'GHOST TOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six additional security guards have been deployed to protect a North Hills 
"ghost town," a cluster of apartment buildings left vacant by quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City Councilman Richard Alarcon had the unarmed guards assigned to the 
area east of the San Diego Freeway between Roscoe and Nordhoff boulevards late 
last week in response to security concerns raised by a local group. 
</P>
<P>
 Two guards were previously on duty at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hills Task Force had complained that drug dealers, prostitutes and 
squatters were undeterred by the two unarmed security guards assigned there 
since shortly after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the guards is a stopgap measure designed to improve security while the 
city studies the possibility of arming the guards and assigning more police to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon has asked Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams to take a 
position by Sept. 13 on using federal disaster relief funds to hire armed 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards are unarmed because local police officials have warned that hiring 
guards with guns could lead to violent confrontations and subsequent lawsuits 
against the city.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
SUPERVISORS OK STUDY OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to have health 
officials study the feasibility of a countywide needle exchange program to help 
slow the spread of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote does not authorize any county agency to begin a needle exchange 
program or sanction exchange programs by private community agencies.But 
Supervisor Ed Edelman said: "We need an objective study (as to) whether a 
needle exchange program will help stop the spread of this disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Needle exchanges are illegal under state law. But several California cities 
and counties allow private groups to distribute clean needles to drug users to 
help prevent the spread of HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Los Angeles City Council took steps to protect needle exchange 
programs by asking Mayor Richard Riordan to declare the AIDS epidemic a local 
public health emergency.

 The Coast Guard plans to step up enforcement along the entire California coast 
this Labor Day weekend, which traditionally is one of the busiest boating 
weekends of the year.

 The idea is to get boaters who have had too much to drink off the water, a 
spokesman said. Accidents involving alcohol and boating have been on the rise 
in California, according to Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Hall.

 Coast Guard crews will stop boats and administer sobriety tests to occupants

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution. It can seek court-imposed fines against polluters of $25 to

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RAP STAR 
GETS 5 MONTHS IN DRUNK DRIVING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rap star Dr. Dre was sentenced Tuesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to five 
months in jail after pleading no contest to drunk driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old Grammy-winning rapper, whose real name is Andre Young, will 
enter jail on Jan. 10 under a work furlough arrangement allowing him to leave 
his cell on a daily basis to continue producing records in his home studio in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Young on Jan. 10 after he failed a sobriety test after an 
earlymorning high-speed chase through Beverly Hills and Westwood. In addition 
to the five-month jail term, West Los Angeles Municipal Judge Paula Adela 
Mabrey also ordered the entertainer to pay a $1,053 fine and attend an alcohol 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that Young had violated the terms of a three-year probated 
sentence stemming from a 1992 battery conviction in which he allegedly punched 
a Woodland Hills man in the face, breaking his jaw.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAYOR AND 
COUNCIL HONOR NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Earthquake Kids," who captured the U.S. title at the Little League World 
Series, were honored Tuesday by Mayor Richard Riordan and the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes Northridge, passed 
out honorary resolutions to each of the team's coaches and players. About 100 
people in the council chamber applauded as Coach Larry Baca introduced the 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, Bernson and other council members lauded the team as a symbol of the 
city's recovery from the Jan. 17 quake.  
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the team members had to leave their homes after the quake, and 
three were still living elsewhere as the team headed to Williamsport, Pa., for 
the playoffs.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; EPA TO TEST 
INDOOR AIR, WATER NEAR CHEMICAL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday began testing indoor air 
and tap water in a South Bay neighborhood where residents have complained of 
health problems that they fear are caused by two nearby toxic chemical sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests, to be completed in two to three weeks, are part of a $1.7-million 
program announced two months ago to search for possible contaminants in the 
neighborhood east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say the tests will determine if unusual levels of benzene, 
napthalene or DDT exist in neighborhood homes. Residents requested the tests 
after a federal cleanup project turned up chunks of DDT behind two homes this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoor air and tap water will be tested at the homes of 33 families who were 
relocated to hotels at federal expense after the DDT discovery. The homes are 
along West 204th Street east of Normandie Avenue and west of New Hampshire 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood sits near the former Montrose Chemical Corp., a former DDT 
manufacturer that is now a federal Superfund site. To the north of the street 
is a proposed Superfund site that was once a synthetic rubber factory operated 
by Shell Oil Co. and the Dow Chemical Co., among others. Portions of that site 
contain benzene and napthalene. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will discuss the testing and planned cleanup activities at a public 
meeting from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. today at the Gateway Ballroom of the Harbor 
Gateway Holiday Inn, 19800 S. Vermont Ave.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BRENTWOOD; CITY COUNCIL 
SEEKS TO STEM TRAFFIC NEAR SIMPSON ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council took measures Tuesday to ease traffic and parking 
problems caused by gawkers at O.J. Simpson's Brentwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized closures of North Rockingham Avenue to through traffic 
under certain conditions, and limited street parking in the area to residents 
who buy city-issued permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the affluent Westside community have complained about the gawkers 
since the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman made 
Brentwood a household name. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's direction, police will set up temporary barricades on 
Rockingham to regulate the flow of pedestrians and vehicles. The barriers will 
remain there for at least 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Department will establish a preferential parking district 
only if two-thirds of the residents sign petitions in support of the plan.

QUAKE-DAMAGED AREAS WIN AN ADDITIONAL $8 MILLION; HOUSING: A SPLIT BETWEEN 
VALLEY AND OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS BREAKS WIDE OPEN. COMPROMISE TO SPLIT THE 
MONEY EVENLY THROUGHOUT THE CITY FAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley and other quake-damaged areas won an additional $8 
million in housing funds Tuesday after a bitter struggle with central city 
lawmakers, who argued that the money should be distributed throughout Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the amount of money in question was relatively small, the debate over 
how to allocate it reignited the longstanding turf war between City Council 
members from the Valley and those from the rest of the city over the 
distribution of limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, after a compromise proposed by Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick to 
evenly divide the money throughout the city failed, the Los Angeles City 
Council voted 9 to 5, largely along geographical lines, to allocate $8.3 
million more to quake-damaged areas than it had appropriated last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday reallocated the $47 million the city amassed from the sale 
of bonds for affordable housing by setting aside $23 million for quake-damaged 
areas, $14 million for areas damaged in the 1992 riots and $10 million for 
citywide housing.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represents the city's Eastside, and 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents quake-damaged Hollywood, joined 
the seven lawmakers who represent the Valley in voting to give more money to 
that area.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole city won today, not just the Valley," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
said after the vote. "Let's not forget that what happened on Jan. 17 was the 
worst natural disaster in this nation's history. Housing was not just 
overcrowded or deteriorating, it was destroyed, and it has to be replaced."  
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who proposed allocating only $14.7 million 
to quake-damaged areas, denounced the vote, arguing that the money was sorely 
needed throughout the city because of the severe lack of affordable housing 
that predated the quake. His proposal, which the council approved last week, 
also allocated $14 million for riot-damaged areas, but earmarked far more -- 
$18 million -- for citywide housing at the expense of the quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many members from the Valley knew that the way I proposed dividing the money 
was way more reasonable and fair, but the way it was put, it would be like they 
were selling out their constituency," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak of hostilities began last week when Ridley-Thomas, with 
Yaroslavsky and two other Valley representatives absent, succeeded in getting 
the City Council to adopt his proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that it was a violation of protocol for Ridley-Thomas to bring up the 
matter without all the Valley representatives present, Yaroslavsky and 
Councilman Richard Alarcon successfully pressed for Tuesday's reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ridley-Thomas on Tuesday: "All this was an effort on Zev's part to teach 
me a lesson, that's how big his ego is" -- a contention Yaroslavsky vehemently 
denied.  
</P>
<P>
 Early in the contentious 2 1/2-hour debate, Chick broke ranks with her Valley 
colleagues and proposed dividing the $8.3 million between quake-damaged areas 
and citywide housing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to come together and fight for solutions to problems across the 
city," said Chick, a former social worker.  
</P>
<P>
 But she was roundly scolded for breaking ranks by Yaroslavsky, who argued that 
the entire council should support more money to the quake zones because Valley 
representatives had supported rebuilding efforts after the 1992 riots. Chick's 
motion failed to win by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick then joined the rest of the Valley coalition in voting to allocate all 
the money in question to the Valley and other areas hit by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city's political history, Valley politicians have complained 
that the region contributes a disproportionate amount of taxes compared to the 
services it receives.

PROSECUTION OF DRUG MONEY CASE CRITICIZED; COURTS: A JUDGE HAS FAULTED AN 
ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY'S ACTIONS. THE LAWYER SAYS HE HAS NO ANIMOSITY AGAINST 
THE DEFENDANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors have won 26 convictions of former sheriff's deputies for 
skimming of drug monies while serving in elite anti-narcotics units. But so far 
they have not succeeded in convicting a former Los Angeles police officer who 
worked with them, Stephen Polak, or his former wife, onetime Deputy Christina 
Townley. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is the prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office who have been 
thrown on the defensive while going after Townley and Polak. 
</P>
<P>
 First, in July, there was a caustically worded dismissal of an indictment 
against Townley by normally mild-mannered U.S. District Judge Robert M. 
Takasugi. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi did not mince words, calling the prosecutors "callous, coercive and 
vindictive," accusing them of going after Townley only because she would not 
cooperate with them, and saying the U.S. attorney's office "used threats, 
deceit and harassment techniques to compel her to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he said, he was granting a defense motion to dismiss the case for 
"vindictive prosecution." And he mentioned assistant U.S. Atty. Mark A. Byrne, 
chastising him for exhibiting personal anger toward the defendant or defense 
counsel in his conduct of the Townley case. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, prosecutors failed to secure a conviction against Polak, 
who was accused along with his former wife of failing to report illicit taking 
of drug monies on tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was deadlocked 9 to 3 for acquittal of Polak. After the verdict, 
several jurors chastised Byrne, the prosecutor who handled the case. They 
complained that his lead witness against Polak was a former deputy, Sgt. Robert 
R. Sobel, who alienated the jurors with his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, several of whom were black, said they were put off when Sobel 
testified -- in response to attorneys' questions -- that he had been involved 
frequently in the arrest of blacks who were simply walking the streets and were 
innocent of any crime, and that more than 100 times he had lied in court 
testimony. He also told of overtures he had made to Townley while she was 
married to Polak. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of the 
indictment of Townley, asserting that Byrne had failed to present compelling 
evidence and that the prosecution had not been vindictive. But Takasugi was 
unmoved, saying it was too late to present new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will reveal on Sept. 19 whether they intend to retry Polak. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy interview, Byrne, accompanied by George Newhouse, a supervisor in 
the U.S. attorney's office, insisted that his prosecutorial conduct in both 
cases had been proper. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to prosecute Townley was a collective one in which senior members 
of the U.S. attorney's office had concurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said Sobel was the only witness who could provide direct testimony that 
Polak "was a bad cop," and establish the foundation for the tax charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobel, he noted, had testified in eight of the drug money skimming cases, and 
had assisted in obtaining convictions in many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no personal animosity toward either of these defendants," Byrne added. 
"Our decision to prosecute is because there is evidence against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said he had been so shocked at Takasugi's July 18 language when he 
dismissed the Townley case that "I didn't remember what he said five minutes 
later. I blotted it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse said this explained to his satisfaction why Byrne told The Times that 
same afternoon that he did not recollect Takasugi using words such as callous 
and coercive about the prosecution, when Townley's defense attorney, Michael 
Nasatir, said he remembered those precise terms. 
</P>
<P>
 An official transcript later confirmed that Nasatir's recollection was 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 28, in testimony seeking reconsideration by Takasugi of the Townley 
indictment dismissal, Richard E. Drooyan, chief of the U.S. attorney's office's 
criminal division, was critical of Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 But Drooyan said Byrne "did exactly what was expected of him in analyzing the 
evidence and presenting the case (to his supervisors) on whether or not to seek 
an indictment." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Takasugi's strong language, Drooyan called it "a very important matter, 
not just to Mr. Byrne, but to the United States attorney's office."  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi responded later that he was "certainly not proud" of the language he 
had used, but he added: "The court made a ruling . . . based on the evidence 
presented to the court. Both sides had an opportunity to augment the record 
with additional facts, additional law. It was not done."

SALVADORANS' DREAMS END IN SLAYINGS; CRIME: THE BROTHERS CAME TO U.S. WITH THE 
HOPES OF SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILY AND BUYING A FARM BACK HOME. THEIR BODIES WERE 
FOUND ALONG A MALIBU TRAIL LAST WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 Mauricio Molina came to Northridge from El Salvador six years ago at the age 
of 17 with the same dreams as so many of his countrymen: to make enough money 
to send some home to his mother, seven younger brothers and a younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother Luis followed him with the same intentions more than a year ago. 
The two toiled as day laborers, hoping to eventually make enough money to 
return home and buy their family a farm. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, hikers in the Santa Monica Mountains stumbled upon bodies now 
known to be those of the brothers. They were sprawled in the brush along the 
Backbone Trail near a popular swimming hole. Mauricio Molina, 23, and Luis 
Molina, 19, were only wearing black swim trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police believe that the brothers knew their assailants, relatives 
said they have no clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Their single-minded goal of taking care of their family kept them from the 
distractions that often occupy the lives of other young men, relatives said. 
The two did not speak English and did not have many friends, preferring to 
spend time with relatives, especially their 13-year-old cousin, Eddie Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went everywhere together and weren't into drugs or anything," said 
Molina, speaking in the Spanish-style house on Aura Avenue where the brothers 
lived. "They only wanted to raise enough money to return to El Salvador so they 
could buy a farm and some crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousins were the kind of people, who, if they saw someone's car broken 
down, they would get out of their car to help push."  
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that the brothers were executed on the trail and dragged 10 
feet or so to the creek bed where the hikers found them at Malibu Creek State 
Park near Piuma and Malibu Canyon roads, said Lt. Ray Peavy of the sheriff's 
homicide bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had been shot once in the head at close range with a small-caliber 
handgun, Peavy said. One was also shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of a struggle," Peavy said. "It's almost like they were 
taken by surprise, almost like by someone they were with. That's the assumption 
we're going on now and that could be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, police released the victims' names after they were identified by 
Elsa Garcia, an aunt who recognized media descriptions of the jewelry found on 
the bodies, including a religious medallion and a silver scorpion-shaped ring. 
At first, Garcia had been convinced that the bodies could not be those of her 
missing relatives because police and the corner's office had estimated that the 
clean-cut, youthful-looking men were between the ages of 14 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the killer may still be driving the brothers' missing 
brown, 1981 two-door Chevrolet Chevette.  
</P>
<P>
 When the brothers came to this country, they lived with their uncle, Effreim 
Molina, a weekend gardener. But a falling out two months ago sent them to 
Garcia and her Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've treated them like my own children for as long as I've known them," 
Garcia said. "They always made me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, just after 8 a.m., the two brothers would drive to Fallbrook 
Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, where they waited for people in passing cars to 
stop and offer them a day's work, Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 On the same barren street corner Tuesday afternoon, a few men still waited for 
work underneath a Ventura Freeway overpass. Only one of them remembered the 
brothers, vaguely, but all knew much of the life they lived: standing on the 
street hoping for the good jobs, the ones that pay $6 to $8 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good corner for work," one said.

MAN ON PROBATION IN DENNY CASE IS JAILED; COURTS: ANTOINE MILLER PLEADS NOT 
GUILTY TO GUN POSSESSION. IN SEPARATE HEARING, A JUDGE ORDERS HIM LOCKED UP FOR 
VIOLATING TERMS OF HIS SENTENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 A man on probation for assaulting a motorist during the early hours of the Los 
Angeles riots pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a gun possession charge but was 
jailed when a judge found him in violation of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine Miller, 22, faces a maximum six-year prison sentence if convicted of 
the charge of being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm, a Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After pleading not guilty to the weapons charge Tuesday, Miller appeared 
before Superior Court Judge James Bascue, who revoked his probation in a 
separate hearing and ordered him held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police investigators said Miller was involved in an argument with 
two men who were in a car Aug. 21 near 71st Street and Normandie Avenue, just a 
block away from the intersection where trucker Reginald O. Denny and several 
other motorists were assaulted as rioting broke out two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During the argument last week, Miller ran into a house, armed himself with a 
chrome-plated pistol, pointed the gun at the driver and tried to fire it when 
it jammed, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller apparently had fired the gun several times before reaching the driver's 
side of the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was arrested Friday -- five days after the incident -- when police 
searched a home where he was staying and recovered a 9-millimeter, 
semiautomatic pistol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The case remains under investigation and Miller could face other charges, the 
district attorney's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miller was videotaped opening the door to Denny's truck as it stopped 
at Florence and Normandie avenues, he was charged with attempted murder under a 
prosecution theory that he aided and abetted those who brutally beat the 
trucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's case was separated from that of Damian Monroe Williams and Henry 
Keith Watson. They were acquitted on the most serious charges stemming from the 
Denny beating. Williams was convicted of mayhem for hitting Denny in the head 
with a brick, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was convicted of misdemeanor assault for placing his foot on Denny's 
neck, but he received no jail time because the 17 months he had spent in jail 
awaiting trial was greater than the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after verdicts were returned in Williams' and Watson's trial, 
Miller pleaded guilty to felonious assault and two misdemeanor charges in 
exchange for 27 months probation. He pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly 
weapon on Marisa Bejar for throwing a telephone book encased in metal at the 
car in which she was riding -- opening a gash in her head and showering her 
7-month-old child with shattered glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also pleaded guilty to receiving motorist Alicia Maldonado's stolen 
purse and to grand theft for taking a bag containing papers from Denny's truck 
-- both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was sentenced in November, Superior Court Judge Cecil J. Mills told 
him: "You will be carrying the key to the penitentiary around in your pocket, 
young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller received his first strike under California's "three-strike" law in the 
felonious assault on Bejar, said Mike Botula, a spokesman for the district 
attorney's office. If Miller is convicted on the weapons charge he faces, that 
would be his second strike, and the maximum penalty of three years would 
double, Botula said.

COURT HEARS CASE PIVOTAL TO DNA TESTS; CRIME: JUDGES WEIGH ARGUMENTS IN 
HUNTINGTON BEACH DRUNK-DRIVING ARREST. THEY CONSIDER USE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 
THAT COULD AFFECT SIMPSON TRIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 In a case that could affect the admissibility of DNA evidence in the O.J. 
Simpson trial, the California Supreme Court began deliberating Tuesday whether 
to give trial judges greater flexibility to allow scientific evidence at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court, hearing arguments in a Huntington Beach drunk-driving case, 
has been asked by California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to broaden the state's 
evidence rules to allow controversial DNA testing. Now, scientific evidence can 
be admitted if it is generally accepted by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the court provided little insight into their thinking on the DNA 
issue, dwelling largely on questions about a common field sobriety test in 
which police officers check the eye movements of suspected drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The drunk driving case comes before the court on the heels of a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision adopting the broad standard advocated by Lungren that would give 
trial judges more discretion in using scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But some prosecutors -- as well as public defenders and corporate defense 
attorneys -- worry that such a standard would open the door for all kinds of 
"junk science" that could be difficult for trial judges to sort out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no need to put trial judges in the position of being 
scientists," said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brentford Ferreira, who 
joined Orange County prosecutors in arguing the Huntington Beach case before 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case before the court stems from the December, 1990, arrest of William 
Michael Leahy for allegedly speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol 
on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to evidence presented at his trial in Orange County Municipal Court, 
Leahy smelled of alcohol and spoke with difficulty when pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy passed some sobriety tests administered by the arresting officer, 
including walking in a straight line and standing on one leg. But he failed a 
test called the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, in which an officer observes 
whether the eye moves smoothly as it tracks an object, such as a pencil.  
</P>
<P>
 A blood test 90 minutes later showed Leahy's blood alcohol to be 0.1%, which 
exceeds the legal limit, but his attorney argued that the level rose after the 
arrest because of a drink the motorist had five minutes before the arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy was found guilty at trial but his conviction was overturned by the state 
Court of Appeal in Santa Ana. That court held that the vision test is 
scientific evidence and, under California rules, cannot be admitted until a 
hearing is held to determine whether the procedure is generally accepted in the 
scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to hear the case, the state Supreme Court asked attorneys to offer 
arguments on whether the new federal standard for scientific evidence -- known 
as Daubert, after the U.S. Supreme Court case -- should be adopted in place of 
the state standard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Daubert case, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the old standard of 
general acceptance by the scientific community and ruled that federal judges 
must only conclude whether scientific evidence is "relevant" and "reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Orange County Public Defender 
Ronald Butler argued that the state's rules, known by the shorthand Kelly-Frye, 
should remain in place and attempted to focus the case on the field sobriety 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a DNA case," Deputy Public Defender Alan J. Crivaro told the 
court.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Lungren and the California District Attorneys Assn. filed amicus 
briefs with the court seeking adoption of the Daubert standard, which would be 
more likely to allow DNA evidence in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 California appellate courts have issued mixed opinions on whether DNA tests 
are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent appellate ruling rejected the use of DNA evidence because 
techniques used by laboratories to come up with statistical estimates are not 
generally accepted by the scientific community. The state Supreme Court let 
that decision stand. 
</P>
<P>
 With the murder trial of O.J. Simpson scheduled to start in less than three 
weeks, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito will be called on to decide whether 
DNA tests on blood found at the murder scene will be accepted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has 90 days to rule in Leahy's case, and any decision to 
broaden the rules for scientific evidence could come after Ito has ruled on the 
admissibility of the DNA tests, complicating appeals on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court's decision would be binding on state judges such as the 
one presiding over the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Admissibility of DNA evidence is crucial to the prosecution, which, lacking 
eyewitnesses, needs the testing to show that Simpson was at the scene of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer said he hopes that once the 
Supreme Court establishes a standard state courts will use to determine the 
admissibility of scientific evidence, that it will apply that standard to a 
case involving DNA. "We want them to get past this issue and get to DNA," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of conflicting state appellate decisions on DNA, he said, Orange 
County prosecutors and defense attorneys have put on extensive arguments, 
including testimony from scientific experts, in each instance DNA has been 
crucial to a suspect's identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said local prosecutors have had success at convincing judges of the 
value of DNA identifications -- but at great effort and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had 15 or 16 different cases in which we have had DNA admitted as 
evidence over the objection of the defense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not giving any indication whether they would tackle the DNA issue in 
their ruling in the Leahy case, some justices questioned the use of the 
30-year-old field sobriety vision test.  
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a lot of science here," said Justice Armand Arabian. "It 
might even be junk science."

EX-GIRLFRIEND DESCRIBES FAMALARO'S SECRETIVE WAYS; CRIME: SHE TELLS POLICE 
SUSPECT IN HUBER KILLING KEPT DOORS BOLTED, TRIED TO HIDE RELATIONSHIP FROM HIS 
MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman who had dated murder suspect John J. Famalaro told authorities he led 
a secretive life, keeping his bathroom door locked and only allowing her to 
visit at night to keep their relationship hidden from his mother, according to 
new evidence released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour interview that touched on numerous topics, the former girlfriend 
told investigators Famalaro, 37, enjoyed critiquing murder plots in movies and 
seemed obsessed about an old girlfriend from Orange County whose description is 
similar to that of Denise Huber, the Newport Beach woman he is charged with 
murdering. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlfriend was beautiful, with long dark hair and a perfect figure, and 
Famalaro said he spent most of his time at her home, Marla Tollett of Prescott 
recalled in a tape made shortly after Huber's body was found. She said she 
could not be sure of the woman's name but said "Denise" sounded familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like an obsession with her," Tollett recalled, adding that 
Famalaro enjoyed bragging that most men were jealous when they would see him 
with such a lovely woman. "It was just really odd." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tollett said the strangest part was Famalaro's reaction when she asked why 
the two broke up. She said Famalaro "disappeared," having no response 
whatsoever to the question. He later told her things just didn't work out 
between the two, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Arizona law enforcement source who declined to be identified said Famalaro 
may have "dreamed up" a fantasy relationship with Huber, but said there was no 
evidence to support the two ever dated or even met before the night she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollett said she ultimately broke up with Famalaro because he lied and 
defrauded customers who hired the house painter for home improvement projects. 
Arizona authorities revoked Famalaro's contracting license earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotaped interview conducted at the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department 
with Tollett is the latest piece of evidence that portrays Famalaro as a man 
with many secrets, who became agitated when anyone poked around his cluttered 
home. He kept most doors inside his Prescott Country Club home bolted, said 
Tollett, who said she even had to ask Famalaro for a key to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt free to roam about the house; he would keep all the doors 
locked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she never smelled unusual odors in the home but said Famalaro never 
used deodorant and rarely opened windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did get pretty rank in there from time to time," she said, adding that 
Famalaro was still "fun to be around," always "laughing, cutting up." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is expected to appear in Yavapai County Superior Court today to waive 
extradition to Orange County, where he potentially faces the death penalty if 
convicted of killing 23-year-old Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's nude, handcuffed body was found last month in a running freezer stowed 
inside a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro's driveway. Her clothes, purse 
and other items were found in a box marked "Christmas" in the home owned by 
Duane Thobe, Famalaro's former brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has lived there ever since moving from Orange County to Arizona in 
mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollett said she once asked Famalaro about the 15 to 20 boxes with holiday 
labels on a shelf in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Oh, that's just Duane's stuff that I'm keeping for Duane, because Duane 
doesn't have room to store it,"' Tollett recalled Famalaro saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they have ruled out Duane Thobe as a suspect. Tollett had 
dated Thobe, but the two broke up in late 1992 and she began seeing Famalaro in 
spring of 1993. Tollett recalled that Thobe always seemed "fascinated" by his 
former brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollett said Famalaro wanted to keep their relationship secret from his 
mother, who lived next door. Many have depicted Anna Famalaro as a domineering 
mother who tried to control all of her son's relationships, an accusation Anna 
Famalaro denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I thought kind of odd about my relationship with John was that he always 
wanted to keep it very secretive," she said. Famalaro feared his mother would 
accuse him of taking Tollett away from Thobe and "you just don't do that in a 
Catholic family," Tollett recalled Famalaro explaining. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Famalaro also avoided going out at night so his mother would not see 
him leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never left the house after he got there in the evenings," she said.

CRIME RATE IS DOWN IN '94; SURVEY: THE DECREASE IS DUE TO A SHARP DIP IN 
BURGLARIES AND CAR THEFTS. SANTA ANA, COSTA MESA POST THE BIGGEST DECLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County residents, who cited crime as a paramount concern in a recent 
Los Angeles Times poll, had some good news and bad news Tuesday: The state 
attorney general's office reported that property crime here decreased, but 
violent crime rose in the first six months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County's eight largest cities and unincorporated areas, which are 
included in the survey, reported crime overall dropped 7.6% during the period. 
However, that decline largely is due to a sharp dip in burglaries and car 
thefts. Violent crime -- murder, rape, robbery and assault -- increased almost 
4% in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll of county residents conducted recently by the Los Angeles Times found 
that 56% believe that crime, gangs, drugs, graffiti or inadequate police 
service are the most important problems facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The study compared the first six months of 1993 and 1994. Statewide, the 
figures show the number of reported crimes, including homicides, dropped by 
7.7% in the most populous cities. It is the first decline in the homicide rate 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the most dramatic changes were reported in Costa Mesa, where 
serious crime declined 12.5%, and Santa Ana, where crime was down 11.3%. The 
crime index is based on the reported numbers of homicides, rapes, robberies, 
aggravated assaults, burglaries and car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly very pleased with it," said Capt. Bruce R. Carlson, Santa 
Ana's acting police chief. "It follows up on a 9-plus percent decrease in 1993. 
We're seeing that downward trend continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said a combination of increased police activity, citizen involvement 
and participation of other city departments was responsible for the drop in 
reported crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus on gangs in Santa Ana has caused a reduction in some of the crime 
categories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gratifying to see that decrease has taken place," he said. "Some of that 
is attributable to some strong neighborhood associations we have in Santa Ana, 
to community-oriented policing. Citizens have been working very closely with 
the Police Department to get long-term strategy to prevent and solve crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 While property crimes in Santa Ana were down more than 15%, the number of 
murders increased from 34 in the first six months of 1993 to 39 during the same 
period in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all cities experienced the same sharp declines as Santa Ana and Costa Mesa 
in overall crime. Huntington Beach reported a 1.9% crime decrease; Irvine's was 
down 2%; the Sheriff's Department down 8.8%, and Orange down 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered in between were Anaheim, down 5.3%; Fullerton, down 8.4%, and Garden 
Grove, down 8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who is up for reelection this fall, attributed 
the drop to the deterrent effects of the "three strikes and you're out" law, 
adopted in March, and other tough provisions such as a focus on incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to fool anyone -- we still have a major crime problem in our 
state," Lungren said. "But this shows some things are working and we can't 
throw out those things." 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, a spokesman for Lungren's opponent, former federal prosecutor Tom 
Umberg, dismissed the report as an election-year gimmick. Pointing out that 
crime rose in Lungren's first year in office, Urch said: "I don't think 
anybody's buying it. Every time you pick up the paper there are crimes in your 
neighborhood that weren't there a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren and a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson -- who is in a heated race with 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- said the public's fear stems from the sense 
that crime recently has become more random. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the numbers are looking a little bit better, we've got a long way to 
go," said Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown and Umberg campaigns discounted the significance of the six-month 
study. Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst said that much of the drop in 
crime took place in Los Angeles County, and that other counties and cities 
across the state suffered increases. "If you took Los Angeles County out of the 
equation, crime would have gone way up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, preliminary calculations show that without the crime figures reported 
by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles Police Department 
and other city police departments in the county, California would have a 3% 
decrease in reported crimes. The study surveys the state's 67 largest law 
enforcement jurisdictions, containing two-thirds of California's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst repeated a refrain of the Brown campaign in challenging the crime 
statistics: "Do you feel safer now than you did four years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Schnur said things would look worse if Brown had been in 
charge over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has fought tooth and nail to convince the Democratic Legislature 
to pass a series of tough-on-crime measures that they wouldn't have otherwise," 
Schnur said. "It's hard to tell how much Kathleen Brown would have put into 
those efforts." Crime Decline Is Property Driven 
</P>
<P>
 Reported crime in Orange County's largest cities and unincorporated areas 
dropped 7.6% during the first six months of the year, fueled by a 10.9% decline 
in burglary and auto theft. The number of violent crimes actually increased 
3.7%. Here's a city-by-city look. Percent change for totals smaller than 50 not

SUSPECTS IN UCI STUDENT'S SLAYING IN LOCAL CUSTODY; CRIME: GARDEN GROVE POLICE 
ESCORT 2 TEEN-AGERS FROM BOSTON TO COUNTY JAILS. INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING 
OTHERS.

 Two suspects in the slaying of UC Irvine engineering student Robert Sapinoso 
were in custody in Orange County on Tuesday after being transferred from 
Boston, where they were arrested last week in the van Sapinoso helped identify 
by getting the license-plate number just before he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police investigators escorted Vinh Quoc Ta, 18, of Santa Ana and 
a 17-year-old resident of Orange on separate flights Monday night. Both were 
booked on suspicion of murder, Ta into Orange County Jail, and the youth into 
Juvenile Hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two suspects were arrested for probation violations by Boston police last 
Thursday in the silver Toyota minivan authorities say was used in Sapinoso's 
Aug. 17 slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities worked Tuesday to prepare formal murder charges for Ta's 
scheduled arraignment today and a separate hearing for the unidentified 
juvenile, police said Tuesday that they were seeking other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is still continuing," said Capt. Dave Abrecht, spokesman 
for the Garden Grove Police Department. "We believe there were other people in 
the van at the time of the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said police think four people were in the van, but they don't know for 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say how many were in the van," Abrecht said. He said police had 
the names of other suspects, thought to be members of a "loose," locally based 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso, a bashful computer whiz nicknamed "Zap" for his lightning-fast 
typing, would have been a junior at UCI this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fatally shot in Garden Grove after jumping into his Honda sports car 
with a friend to chase a passing van they believed was involved in neighborhood 
vandalism days earlier. The two managed to get all but one digit from the 
license plate before someone in the van jumped out, walked up to Sapinoso's car 
at a stoplight on Newland Street and opened fire, killing the 19-year-old 
Westminster resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's passenger, a 20-year-old student at Cypress College from Garden 
Grove, was unhurt and later provided police with a detailed description of the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger, who asked not to be identified by name out of fear of 
retribution, said Tuesday that he hopes to be called by police to try to 
identify the two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say I'm waiting for them to call me to tell me what's going on," he 
said. "I'm just waiting for the day when I can point . . . and say, 'That's the 
guy who did it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police said the van stopped by Boston police had the same license 
plate number and vehicle identification number as the one used in the killing. 
Boston police had been told to be on the lookout for the van with California 
registration after authorities in Garden Grove received information the 
suspects might be going there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta and the youth were arrested on fugitive warrants from California for 
violating probation, but waived extradition on Friday. A third person in the 
van in Boston was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Ta was sentenced to three years' probation June 8 after pleading guilty to 
charges that he burglarized a Santa Ana restaurant Feb. 1. He and three other 
youths, who also received probation, were caught shortly after they left the 
restaurant with the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials refused to describe the juvenile's previous conviction in Orange 
County.

JUDGE SAYS TWO SHOULD FACE HATE-CRIME CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling an attack on a black teen-ager "one of the most vicious beatings I've 
seen in a long time," Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles Tuesday urged the Orange 
County district attorney's office to charge two men with a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They attacked and beat this kid within an inch of his life," Iles said of the 
Aug. 5 beating of Ruben Charles Vaughan III, 15, of Tustin. "It seems like Mr. 
Vaughan was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he was the wrong color." 
</P>
<P>
 After originally considering a series of charges, the district attorney's 
office announced Aug. 25 that the attack that hospitalized Vaughan for four 
days would not be prosecuted as a hate crime, because the group of attackers 
was "looking to get someone from Santa Margarita High School" and had only 
"stumbled upon" Vaughan, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, after ordering two men to stand trial for assault with a 
deadly weapon and causing great bodily harm, Iles suggested that the district 
attorney's office reconsider that decision. An investigator testified that 
someone in the attacking crowd yelled "Get the nigger!" before beating Vaughan 
into unconsciousness, breaking his nose and jaw, and stabbing him in seven 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't say 'Get the Santa Margarita guy,' they said 'Get the nigger,"' 
Iles said. "There's nothing else to conclude." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Kralich, who attended Tuesday's preliminary 
hearing, declined comment, other than to say his office would study Iles' 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles ordered Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of Huntington Beach, and Russell T. 
Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest, to appear in Orange County Superior Court on Sept. 
12 to stand trial on the felony assault charges. Jones is accused of stabbing 
Vaughan with a foldable "buck knife" and Scarce allegedly hit him with a pry 
bar during the melee, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, who have been in custody in Orange County Jail for several weeks, 
have pleaded not guilty. Iles ordered their bail to remain at $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Lake Forest man and a 16-year-old Lake Forest juvenile also have been 
arrested in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who attended Santa Margarita High School last year as a freshman and 
played varsity football, testified in court that he and three schoolmates went 
to a "flyer party" at a home on Live Oak Canyon Road in Trabuco Canyon about 9 
p.m. that Friday night, only to find no one home. After circling around the 
neighborhood briefly and returning, they found a group of 25 to 30 youths in 
cars and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vaughan and his friends got out of their car, the group approached them 
and punched and knocked down one of the Santa Margarita High youths, Chris 
Collins, Vaughan said. Vaughan helped him up and three of the friends managed 
to get into the car and drive off, leaving Vaughan surrounded by the attackers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood there and looked at the car drive away and someone said, 'Where are 
your friends now?' " Vaughan said. "I was all by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan grabbed a metal and glass light fixture from a lawn, cutting his 
fingers in the process, and threw it at the crowd before he was attacked and 
knocked unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember getting hit and then I don't remember anything after that until 
someone from the house asked me if I was all right," Vaughan testified. "Then I 
heard the ambulance coming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James Sweeney, Scarce's attorney, said the fight was the result of an ongoing 
feud between youths from Santa Margarita High School and El Toro High School 
and not an attack aimed at Vaughan personally. He said he doubted hate crime 
charges would be filed, despite Iles' urgings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a turf war, and unfortunately Mr. Vaughan was the last one to get 
away," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' attorney, Michael B. McClellan, agreed, adding that there is not enough 
evidence to prove a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Iles is a very tough judge," McClellan said. "She has great sympathy 
for victims. She has always been a champion of victims' rights. I have a lot of 
respect for that. (But) in this case, there was only one statement, one vile 
statement yes, but only one in a crowd of 20 people."

WESTBOUND SIMI FREEWAY LANES TO REOPEN; ROADS: LAST MAJOR BOTTLENECK FROM 
TEMBLOR WILL BE REMOVED THIS WEEKEND. EASTBOUND TRAFFIC WILL BEGIN FLOWING 
SEPT. 7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the relief of many traffic-maddened motorists, all five westbound lanes of 
the Simi Valley Freeway -- the last major bottleneck from the Northridge quake 
-- will reopen this weekend, a top state transportation official confirmed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound lanes will follow Sept. 7, making all 10 lanes available to 
motorists at the San Fernando Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek overpasses, 
despite construction delays that once were expected to push the reopening date 
back to mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers, who have toiled around the clock for months, were 
putting the finishing touches Tuesday on the westbound side of the 
reconstructed spans, which sagged by as much as four feet in some spots after 
the quake. Repairs on the eastbound lanes, which now serve as a detour for 
traffic in both directions, wrapped up in May. 
</P>
<P>
 When work shifted to the westbound side, state transportation officials 
projected it would be completed this week. But a delay in starting and a 
last-minute tangle over permits to work in the Bull Creek flood-control channel 
forced the state Department of Transportation to kick back the projected 
reopening to Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last week, Caltrans officials held to Sept. 19 as their target 
date. Nonstop construction and "quite a bit of pressure" from the state, 
however, spurred the transportation agency and the contractor to try to finish 
before the heavy traffic loads of the Labor Day weekend, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is expected today to formally announce the reopening, which 
has been long awaited by many commuters on the northern San Fernando Valley's 
chief east-west artery. Since February, the 180,000 motorists who navigate that 
stretch of the freeway daily have had to squeeze onto a detour, three narrow 
lanes each way with sharp curves that slowed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jana Tanghal, office manager for a Granada Hills insurance agent, said she 
adjusted her work schedule to avoid the tie-ups that prolonged her drive to 
work from Thousand Oaks during peak morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way I don't sit in traffic. I'm tearing my hair out by the time I get 
here," said Tanghal, who plans to revert to her pre-earthquake schedule after 
the freeway is restored. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, work crews will open the new westbound bridges, with three lanes 
available in the early morning and then the full complement of five by noon, 
officials said. The Woodley Avenue on-ramp and the Hayvenhurst Avenue off-ramp 
will also reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, F.C.I. Constructors of San Diego, will then remove the detour 
from the eastbound side, re-stripe the pavement and open all five eastbound 
lanes Sept. 7. At that time, workers will reopen the on-ramps at Hayvenhurst 
Avenue and Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who live close to the Hayvenhurst exit, it'll be super," said 
Sherrill Houston, who lives with his wife just a block away. "It's going to 
mean a lot to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contractor is set to finish the $9.6-million project before the 
Sept. 19 deadline, the firm will not receive a bonus. Unlike the repair efforts 
on the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways, and also on the eastbound side 
of the Simi Valley Freeway bridges, the contract for the current project did 
not include a bonus for completing work early. 
</P>
<P>
 But as on the previous reconstruction projects, crews labored 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week, limited only by noise restrictions on the type of work they 
could do at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Around-the-clock activity helped make up some of the days lost to a late start 
and the need to develop new construction plans for Bull Creek after flood 
control officials decided not to allow scaffolding to be based in the channel. 
The project began late because the previous contractor for the eastbound 
portion of the freeway had not finished cleaning up in time, Caltrans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because those circumstances were beyond F.C.I.'s control, the company will not 
be penalized for the delay, officials said.

FARM FOR FAMILY WAS SLAIN BROTHERS' DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mauricio Molina came to Northridge from El Salvador six years ago, at age 17, 
with the same dreams as so many of his countrymen: to make enough money to send 
some home to his mother, seven younger brothers and a younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a little over a year ago, his brother Luis joined him with the same 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 The two toiled as day laborers, hoping to one day make enough money to return 
home and buy their family a farm. 
</P>
<P>
 They will never get there. On Friday, hikers in the Santa Monica Mountains 
stumbled upon bodies now known to be theirs, sprawled in the brush along the 
Backbone Trail near a popular swimming hole. Mauricio, 23, and Luis, 19, were 
wearing only black swim trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police believe the brothers knew their assailants, relatives said 
they had no clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Their single-minded goal of taking care of their family kept them from the 
sort of distractions that occupy the lives of other young men, relatives said. 
The two did not speak English and they did not have many friends, preferring 
instead to spend time with the family, especially with their 13-year-old 
cousin, Eddie Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went everywhere together and weren't into drugs or anything," Molina 
said evenly, speaking inside the Spanish-style house on Aura Avenue where the 
brothers lived their last days. "They only wanted to raise enough money to 
return to El Salvador so they could buy a farm and some crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousins were the kind of people, who, if they saw someone's car broken 
down, they would get out of their car to help push." 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that the brothers were executed on the trail, and then dragged 
10 feet or so to the creek bed where the hikers found them, at Malibu Creek 
State Park near Piuma and Malibu Canyon roads, said Lt. Ray Peavy of the 
Sheriff's Homicide Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had been shot once in the head at close range with a small-caliber 
handgun, Peavy said. One of the brothers was also shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evidence of a struggle," Peavy said. "It's almost like they were 
taken by surprise, almost like by someone they were with. That's the assumption 
we're going on now and that could be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Monday released the victims' names after they were identified by 
their aunt, Elsa Garcia, who recognized media descriptions of the jewelry found 
on the bodies, including a religious medallion and a silver scorpion-shaped 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Garcia had been convinced that the bodies could not be those of her 
missing relatives because police and the coroner's office had originally 
estimated that the clean-cut, youthful-looking men were between the ages of 14 
and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the killer may still be driving the brothers' missing brown, 
1981 two-door Chevrolet Chevette. But why someone would kill two men with no 
criminal record, no evidence of gang affiliation and no known enemies remains 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 When they first came to this country, the brothers lived with their uncle, 
Effreim Molina, a weekend gardener. But a falling-out two months ago sent them 
to Garcia and her Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've treated them like my own children for as long as I've known them," 
Garcia said. "They always made me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, just after 8 a.m., the two brothers would drive to the corner 
of Fallbrook Avenue and Ventura Boulevard where they waited for people in 
passing cars to stop and offer them a day's work, Garcia said. On weekends, the 
Molinas often had more steady work in landscaping and setting up for parties. 
</P>
<P>
 On that same barren street corner Tuesday afternoon, a few men waited for work 
underneath a Ventura Freeway overpass. Only one of them remembered the 
brothers, vaguely, but all knew much of the life they lived: standing on the 
street hoping for the good jobs, the ones that pay $6 to $8 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good corner for work," one said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; 500 PLANTS GIVEN TO PIERCE NATURE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sticky monkey flower, hoary-leaved ceanothus and other specimens of plants 
indigenous to the Santa Monica Mountains area have been donated to the Pierce 
College Nature Center by the Soka University Botanical Research Center and 
Nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 plants representing 25 species that were donated by the Calabasas 
research center will be planted and researched by Pierce's biology and resource 
management classes, said Soka University spokesman Jeff Ourvan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of extra plants for our demonstration garden. It propagated a 
surplus of plants because our garden did really well," Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills college lost much of its native plant population recently 
when some sheep were accidentally let into its garden center and ate them, said 
Keith Eobry, a botanist and a consultant to Soka University. 
</P>
<P>
 Eobry said one of the donated plants is the Malibu baccharis, a species that 
has only begun to be researched. Other specimens will help Pierce's garden 
attract native insects. For example, the false indigo is the plant food of the 
dogface butterfly, California's state insect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Botanical Research Center conducts research on native plant life and is 
trying to restore part of the Soka campus to its natural state. MAKI BECKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; A GROWTH INDUSTRY FOR FARMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ask anyone why they come to the weekly farmers market at Main Street and 
Orange Avenue and the answer is almost always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason to shop here is the quality and freshness," said James 
Bending of Laguna Beach, who offers passersby free ruby-flame seedless raisins 
grown on his family's farm near Fresno. "This stuff is brought in hours old. 
It's the quality that they're getting here." 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh taste of that produce is why Joan Brant and her husband, Robert, 
plan their meals around what they buy at the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The carrots. You can tell they just came out of the ground," said Brant, a 
Costa Mesa resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tomatoes here are fabulous," added Laura MacLellan of Westminster. "I 
shouldn't tell you, because people will come and buy them, and there won't be 
any for me," she mused. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 vendors sell at the outdoor market, said Mary Lou Lorenzini, who 
manages four area farmers markets sponsored by the Orange County Farm Bureau. 
They peddle produce, homemade jams, herbs, nuts, baked bread, honey, sprouts 
and fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach market is open every Friday from 2 to 6 p.m. Farmers 
markets also are held in Costa Mesa, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. each Thursday at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds; in Tustin, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each Wednesday at 
El Camino Real and Third Street; and in Orange, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. each 
Saturday in the rear lot of 230 E. Chapman Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange market will be preempted by the Orange International Street Fair 
this week, but will resume Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers markets are known for reasonable prices and bargains, but some items 
may be priced higher than they are in supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to educate yourself on how to shop at a farmers market," Lorenzini 
said. For instance, some produce is organically grown -- without the use of 
pesticides -- and the price will be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Peg Maxwellof Huntington Beach, a frequent farmers market shopper, bought 
fresh-picked white corn on a recent trip to the Huntington Beach market. "It 
may not cost any less than the (super) market, but it's going to taste better. 
When I need a supply of fruits and vegetables, I will come over here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a price-conscious person. I worry about the quality. I don't worry 
about the pennies." 
</P>
<P>
 With bouquets of flowers in their hands, a long line of buyers stood patiently 
to pay Maria Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a real good quality and wonderful prices," noted one of Aguilar's 
regular customers, Armando Ramirez of Huntington Beach. "You can't get any 
fresher." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, who grows flowers on her small farm near Escondido, sells large 
bunches of about 25 different varieties of fresh-picked flowers for $3 to $6 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sell very cheaply, so I sell everything at one time," she said. "And people 
are happy."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LEADERSHIP PROGRAM BOASTS 67 GRADUATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixty-seven students graduated Tuesday from a yearlong leadership development 
program sponsored by the Orange County chapter of a Latino community group. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's sponsor, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, or MALDEF, is a nonprofit organization that promotes and protects civil 
rights of Latinos at work, school and in political arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's graduates include people from throughout the county who are 
involved in projects they created to improve their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 They include Rose Espinoza, a volunteer who began a free, after-school 
tutoring program in her garage three years ago for children in her La Habra 
neighborhood. Espinoza, who is a La Habra City Council candidate, recently was 
recognized by President Clinton, who presented her with the Presidential 
Volunteer Action Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Also graduating were Patricia Lopez, who was honored this year by the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission for her efforts in finding housing for the 
poor, and Benny Hernandez, who is running for the Anaheim City School District 
board.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are examples of Latino leadership wanting to be part of the solution, 
wanting to be at the table to share the responsibility in providing solutions 
to quality of life issues," said John Palacio, the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Alumni created MALDEF's Hispanic Education Endowment Fund, which has raised 
about $140,000 for scholarships for Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 alumni of the 4-year-old program have become involved in local and 
state government agencies, including school boards and city councils, or have 
served on boards of well-known groups such as United Way, Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a week that goes by that one of the program's graduates or 
participants is not recognized or honored for their contributions to Orange 
County," Palacio said. "They're either being honored or being solicited for 
their advice on ways to improve the quality of life in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the program focuses on training people to become community leaders and 
teaching them how local government and private nonprofit agencies work. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are being accepted for next year's class, which begins in October.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PROPOSAL WOULD ASK DINERS TO FUND ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city committee is looking at ways to persuade restaurant diners to pick up 
the check for a campaign promoting local eateries, which generate about 8.3% of 
the city's general fund revenue each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the plan is implemented, the quarter-percent tax hike on each tab 
probably would not be enough to force reconsideration of whether to order 
dessert. The proposal would tack the fee onto the bill's sales tax, which is 7 
3/4%, making it an even 8%, Assistant City Manager Ken Delino said. The plan is 
part of the city's broader push for economic development, Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants are our biggest industry. There are 400 of them," he said. "It's 
a $250-million industry. That returns to the city $2.5 million in sales tax. 
It's bigger than the next three categories -- car dealers, department stores 
and apparel stores -- combined." 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected would fund joint marketing efforts to encourage diners to 
patronize Newport Beach restaurants. "It used to be that Newport Beach was the 
place in the county to get a good meal. Now, darn it, some of these other 
cities are getting good restaurants," Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of the marketing plan would be to keep local diners in town and 
remind visitors and neighbors that Newport Beach is still home to some of the 
county's finest dining. The fee would fund a "Tourist Improvement District," a 
variation on an assessment district in which the improvement is not a tangible 
item, Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 His staff is looking over the legal aspects of the plan, which should be ready 
to present to the City Council within a couple of months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Economic Development Committee notified area restaurateurs of the 
proposal and surveyed those who attended a meeting to discuss it, Delino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the restaurateurs seem to indicate that this would not bother anybody," 
he said. "On any given day, we'll have 100,000 to 125,000 extra peoplein town 
and they all have to eat." HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ROOM FOR STUDENTS FOUND AFTER GLITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Valley College has found space for most of the 654 would-be students 
who were mistakenly enrolled into already full classes by an overactive 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty members have solved what college officials described as a potentially 
"disastrous situation" by taking on extra students into their crowded 
classrooms. The fall semester began last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A computerized telephone registration system created problems at both Irvine 
Valley and Saddleback community colleges, which are part of the Saddleback 
Community College District. But only 45 Saddleback College students were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's 830 class sections, 200 were over-enrolled due to the 
computer malfunction. Most classes averaged an extra three to five students, 
with some faculty members reporting as many as 13 extra students registered for 
a single class. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the classes were split in two, but in most cases, faculty members 
agreed to make room for the additional students. It was a voluntary act by 
instructors, who are not required to add students when classes are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some cases where instructors took eight to 10 additional students 
into their classrooms," said Terry Burgess, vice president of instruction for 
Irvine Valley College. "The faculty was absolutely wonderful. They brought in 
extra chairs." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials say the telephone registration system has been relatively 
glitch-free since it was installed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 7,000 of Irvine Valley College's current 9,000 students have 
avoided the horrors of long registration lines by registering for fall semester 
classes over the phone. With credit card in hand, students can also pay their 
tuition at the same time. And when the semester is over, students can dial into 
the campus computer system to receive their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't send grades out any more," said Jess Craig, acting vice president of 
student services at Irvine Valley College. "We used to mail them out, but we 
just can't afford that luxury anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig estimates only a handful of Irvine Valley College students ended up 
without classes because of the computer registration glitch. He said those 
students will be given top priority for spring semester classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to the wonderfulness of our faculty, it turned out OK after all," 
Craig said. "It could have turned out a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Registration for some fall classes at Irvine Valley College will remain open 
through Friday. Registration is also available for the college's eight-week 
classes, which begin Oct. 17. RUSS LOAR

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; PIZZERIA PERSEVERES POST-QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pizza-making business has been a little shaky since the Jan. 17 quake, Uno 
pizzeria manager Harry Batt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Located just around the corner from the now-demolished Bullock's department 
store at Northridge Fashion Center, Batt's restaurant is an island in a sea of 
quake rebuilding. It's the only store connected to the mall that is open, but 
it no longer has an adjacent mall to lure customers. But business has been 
increasing steadily, Batt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzeria opened less than two months before the earthquake hit. Having 
reopened Feb. 1 -- just two weeks after the 6.8 temblor destroyed the rest of 
the shopping center -- the chain restaurant that features Chicago-style pizza 
has withstood not only the quake but the inconvenience of constant construction 
going on around it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," Batt said. "The two Uno stores in San Diego have been 
growing by 20% and we're growing just a little." 
</P>
<P>
 To lure customers, Batt has sent gift certificates to regular patrons, set up 
billboards on surrounding streets and hired more waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Chomping on lemon-lime cilantro chicken pizza, Melanie and Glenn Brooker of 
Northridge said they have been coming to Uno regularly since the quake. "We 
wanted to give them our business. There's nothing left here," Melanie Brooker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the food is really good," added her hungry husband, serving himself a 
slice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Doroha of Los Angeles and her date, David Inglese of Northridge, stopped 
at the pizza place Monday, the first time that they had been back since the 
quake. Doroha said that before the quake, she would visit Inglese in the San 
Fernando Valley, but until recently, Inglese had been coming to see her in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people won't come in here because they're afraid," said Chris 
Colburn, an Uno bartender and Cal State Northridge student whose apartment was 
wrecked in the quake. Colburn arrived at work the morning of the quake to find 
that he at least had a job to return to. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Uno employee, manager Adam Slotnick, died when his apartment in the 
Northridge Meadows building collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Colburn said construction and security workers at the mall make up a large 
portion of Uno's bar clientele. "But on Fridays, we get a real mixed crowd," he 
said. MAKI BECKER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; CORONER'S JOB 
FINDING BODY OF EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes coroners have to be detectives. To figure out who died and why, they 
follow clues, check up on leads and examine circumstances and surroundings.  
</P>
<P>
 But it gets difficult when their main "witness" -- the body -- is so 
decomposed that it can't tell the post-mortem story on which a coroner's 
investigator relies. That's when the Los Angeles County coroner's office calls 
in Lloyd Mahanay, a senior criminalist with the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in recent weeks the coroner's office has grappled with high-profile 
cases of badly mutilated bodies and an unforgiving public demanding to know for 
sure who the people were and how they died. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the Northridge storage-facility mystery, in which an 
unsuspecting customer at a blind auction of abandoned goods purchased three 
long-dead bodies stuffed into two steamer trunks and a box. The bodies, which 
police believed had been stored for more than a year, were nearly liquefied, 
leaving few clues to their identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a grandfather, his daughter and granddaughter were run over by a 
Metrolink train in Glendale. Although family members said they were positive 
the bodies were those of their relatives, the bodies were so badly mangled that 
it took several days to identify them. That created a hardship for the family, 
which said it was difficult for out-of-state relatives to make plans to attend 
the funeral services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some techniques to identify remains are as simple as comparing driver's 
license photos to the deceased's face or having a relative look at pictures of 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 But when there is no face left, the task becomes trickier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahanay, a 16-year-veteran who lives in North Hollywood, said fingerprints and 
dental records are the two best alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unique," Mahanay said. "You have some dentists that can look back 
and identify their own work." 
</P>
<P>
 But dental records require some clue as to the person's identity. And in order 
to identify someone by fingerprints, the person must have prints on file and 
enough fingertip skin left to print. 
</P>
<P>
 The first condition is getting easier, Mahanay said. Criminals have long been 
fingerprinted, but many employers now also fingerprint their employees, as the 
military and many sectors of the civil service have long done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prints sometimes can be obtained from long-dead corpses, Mahanay said. 
</P>
<P>
 If fingers have been mummified, experts can soften them up with chemicals, 
lifting the finger's ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fingers are decomposed, often all it takes is drying them off with a 
combination of a towel and a few chemicals, Mahanay said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other options include looking at tattoos, surgery scars and other more lasting 
characteristics. If bodies are so decayed that gender can no longer be 
determined, the coroner can call in a forensic anthropologist, who can 
distinguish male and female skeletons from the size and shape of pelvic bones. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, an examination and comparison to either a family's records or 
missing persons reports can identify even severely decomposed bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tattoos, Mahanay said, are a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you can do is very carefully remove the top layer of skin, which is 
decomposed, and get down to the next layer," Mahanay said. "You can see the 
tattoo even better. You won't have that color, but you'll still be able to 
determine what the tattoo is." 
</P>
<P>
 Scars are often visible beneath the decomposed layers, Mahanay said. 
Previously broken bones, old surgery marks, prosthetics, even bullet and knife 
wounds are often visible in the remaining flesh or marked into the bones, 
offering valuable clues. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the decayed remains of those who suffered violent ends offer 
more clues to their demise than those who died of natural causes. To rule out 
foul play on a decomposed body, investigators must already have a lead on the 
identity and match it to medical records, Mahanay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, he said, a decayed body combined with the usual difficulties in 
identifying someone can make the task impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being in a room with no door," Mahanay said. "You've got to hope 
that somebody, somewhere will inquire about one of their relatives or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you never know who they are."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DISPUTE WITH CITY IS A SIGN OF TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to gas station owner John Barkhordar, big can be beautiful -- 
especially when it comes to signs that bring in lots of business. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are insisting that Barkhordar, who owns a Mobil station near 
the Parkway Calabasas exit of the Ventura Freeway, get rid of his 100-foot 
sign. They contend that it violates a local ordinance that limits the height of 
local signs to 60 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also think signs that are any taller than 60 feet spoil the local 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barkhordar is fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sign will come down -- in 150 years," he vows.  
</P>
<P>
 Barkhordar says about 30% percent of his business comes from freeway travelers 
who see the sign and stop in for gas.  
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on the issue at its 
Sept. 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Department staff has recommended letting Barkhordar keep 
his 100-foot sign for seven years to give him time to comply with the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County approved an application by Exxon, Barkhordar's previous 
supplier, for the 100-foot sign in 1972, according to Assistant City Planner 
Barbara Pilegard. Barkhordar, who has operated the station for 17 years, 
switched to Mobil about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that his 100-foot sign should be grandfathered because county 
planners approved it in 1972. Besides, Barkhordar said, the city gave him 
permission two years ago to keep all his signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Steve Harris sees the issue differently. Harris 
said the city sent Barkhordar a letter in November, 1992, saying he could 
"install temporary signage" that would be good for six months -- as long he 
applied for a permanent sign permit within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it took Barkhordar more than a year to apply for the permanent 
permit, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners want to ban the giant signs because they are just plain 
ugly, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Calabasas, we are not just mile-after-mile of strip malls," and don't want 
to be, Planning Commissioner Dave Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 "These (freeway off-ramps) are the entrances to our community," he said. "And 
I would really like the businesses to start thinking more creatively" to find 
ways to draw customers from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills outlawed pole signs nine years ago, arguing that they spoil the 
view, and gave merchants seven years to remove them. Voters in November backed 
the sign ban by a 3-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many business owners there have balked at removing the signs, 
arguing, like Barkhordar, that they bring in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten businesses -- Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, 
Jack In The Box, Lumber City, Roadside Lumber and Fence Factory -- filed 
separate lawsuits against the city in May, charging that the ban on the signs 
will hurt their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a community group in Agoura Hills led a boycott against the 
businesses. But some of the businesses declared the boycott a failure and vowed 
to continue their fight to keep the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is becoming a very passionate issue," Brown said. FRANK MANNING

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CODE ENFORCEMENT STRENGTHENING OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Building code enforcement officials won City Council approval to strengthen a 
plan to target run-down neighborhoods where blight and crime seem to fester. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved Monday a 12-month trial program but requested a 
review after three months. They said they were nervous because devoting time to 
targeted areas would mean a less vigorous response to minor but important 
violations such as cars on lawns and trash cans in public view. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plan was originally conceived in 1991, officers were to quickly check 
out calls from the public and, on their own initiative, patrol the city's most 
troubled neighborhoods looking for blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, to get the program started, the council doubled the enforcement 
staff from one to two officers, added certain nuisances to the city code, hired 
a city prosecutor and stepped up enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, code enforcement officers were quickly swamped with calls from 
complaining neighbors. "We respond to virtually every complaint we get in the 
office," said Rick Warsinski, assistant director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the heavy volume of calls, officers were too busy to undertake the 
second part of the program -- going into targeted neighborhoods on their own to 
search for blight. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday agreed to assign one officer to work full time on specific 
neighborhoods and to respond to some minor complaints with letters rather than 
personal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will take a task-force approach, officials said. Police, fire, public 
works and other public officials who routinely come across tenants living in 
poor conditions will inform code enforcement officers of violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which begins in January, will coincide with a new Police 
Department policy that trains officers to contact other agencies when they find 
violations outside their own expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 If officers enter an apartment on a domestic violence call and see stopped-up 
sinks and toilets, they will know which agencies to call, Police Chief Richard 
M. Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, code enforcement officers would have greater ability to go 
after the largely absentee landlords who own these buildings. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOL TRUSTEES OK COMPLAINT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents who have complaints about instructional materials used in the 
Capistrano Unified School District now have a formal avenue to voice their 
displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new policy passed this week by the school district, parents are 
required to first notify their child's principal.If the complaint cannot be 
resolved, a parent may make a written complaint, which would be forwarded to 
the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, the district superintendent can appoint a reviewing committee to 
address the complaint. The panel would be made up of five members -- a district 
administrator, the district librarian, a school-site administrator, teacher and 
parent. The parent would not be selected from the school where the complaint 
was lodged. 
</P>
<P>
 A student may be excused from an assignment after his or her parent makes a 
written complaint, and receive an alternative assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 When they first considered the new policy earlier this month, trustees said 
that they did not want parents to be discouraged from appealing any 
administrative decisions to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 They unanimously approved the policy Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have said they do not believe parents will use the policy to attack 
books or other materials that they deem offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, parents in the district have objected to materials about AIDS and 
other sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has a separate committee that reviews textbooks before they are 
approved for classroom use. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; BUYER FINALLY FOUND FOR RED HILL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A buyer has finally been found for the closed Red Hill Elementary School, 
which the Tustin Unified School District has been trying to sell since last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greystone Homes, a Delaware company that develops real estate in California, 
has agreed to buy the 10-acre property for more than $3 million and is planning 
to build 24 homes on the site, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district trustees approved the sale by a 4-1 vote Monday, ending public 
debate over whether the school, which was closed in June, 1982, should be sold 
to generate money to improve other schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, particularly from North Tustin, have protested the sale of the 
school site, arguing that because of the school district's growing enrollment, 
it would be needed someday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said that selling the property in a down real estate market 
is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes more sense to hang on" to the property, said Mark Bucher, one of 
about two dozen parents who attended Monday's school board meeting. "You will 
get considerably more in the next few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Jane Bauer, who cast the dissenting vote, said that the sale should 
not go through because incomplete enrollment data was provided to the school 
board when it made the decision to sell in June. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that contrary to earlier projections, 7,700 kindergarten to 
fifth-grade students are expected for the 1997-98 school year. That is about 
1,400 more than anticipated and will make at least one more elementary school 
necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This information was not used in the decision-making process," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district, which is expecting more than 12,800 students for the 
school year that starts next month, has 10 elementary schools, three middle 
schools and three high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money from the sale will be used to complete the renovation of 
Columbus Tustin Middle School, which is reopening next month at its old campus 
on Beneta Way to become the school district's fourth middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we hold on to our surplus properties, we will not receive state 
money to refurbish our schools," said school board member Nancy Cast, because 
state law requires school districts to sell off properties they no longer need 
before they can apply for state funding for school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education allowed the Tustin school district to sell 
the Red Hill school site directly to a developer after efforts to sell the 
property through competitive bids failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, school district officials tried to auction off the school site for a 
minimum bid of $2.9 million. There were no takers. BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old woman who led police on a car chase from Van Nuys to Tarzana was 
arraigned Tuesday and charged with felony evading arrest and a separate count 
of driving under the influence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carliss McWhorter led police on a chase that reached speeds of 70 m.p.h. at 
times and ended when she crashed into a tree and her car burst into flames 
early Saturday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers had to pull the slightly injured woman from the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had initially tried to stop McWhorter, they said, when she failed to 
stop at a stop sign in North Hollywood. Then, aided by the California Highway 
Patrol, they chased her through Van Nuys, onto the Ventura Freeway and into 
Tarzana, where she crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail for McWhorter was set at $10,000, said a court officer. A preliminary 
hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9. CHIP JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MIGHTY DUCKS HELP YOUTHS WITH GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some who would say Les Gonzalez is skating on thin ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old said he recently was dropped from his high school's wrestling 
team because of poor grades. The soft-spoken young man is also from one of 
Anaheim's most crime-troubled neighborhoods -- Ponderosa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I live there's a lot of drug dealing and stuff," Gonzalez said. "It's 
like a drive-thru." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez found himself on solid ice on Tuesday -- for only his third time 
-- and catching skating tips from National Hockey League great Rick Chartraw. 
Along with five other local youths, Gonzalez received a scholarship through 
Disney's nonprofit group GOALS (Growth Opportunities through Athletics Learning 
and Service) to attend the Anaheim Mighty Ducks first summer ice hockey camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working with Les a lot," said Chartraw, who skated on five Stanley Cup 
teams during his NHL career. "He doesn't want to get over on that outside edge. 
He'll get it though, he's a hard worker." 
</P>
<P>
 It's Gonzalez's work ethic that caught GOALS Executive Director Dave Wilk's 
eye when selecting youngsters for the $350 scholarship to attend the weeklong 
day camp. GOALS' purpose is to foster teamwork and individual achievement in 
underprivileged youths, Wilk said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sheet of slippery ice at Glacial Gardens Ice Rink on Tuesday, the 
youths seemed more concerned with just improving their basic playing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skating is weird. This is only my third time," Gonzalez said. "It's coming 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little nervous," he added. "Most of the guys here are advanced and I'm 
out there wobbling around. I get good speed, but not right off." 
</P>
<P>
 The youths all ranked hockey's infamous physicality as the main lure away from 
soccer and football fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, I was the only guy who checked somebody because someone got in my 
way," said Abraham Aguilar, 15, from the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood. "When I 
hit the guy everybody applauded." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the physical contact," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the camp on scholarship were three teen-agers from a similar 
youth development program in New York City called Ice Hockey in Harlem. The 
visitors, all now enrolled in East Coast prep schools, said Southern 
Californians are respectable hockey players, but, well, California isn't 
exactly New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hockey is pretty good out here," said Bernie Smith, 15, from Harlem. "But 
in New York it's a little rougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilk said the visitors can help the Anaheim teens, who are still getting 
accustomed to precision skating and slap shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these Anaheim kids, they are starting a very foreign sport," said Wilk, 
38, who founded the Harlem hockey program in 1987. "I want them to see they can 
make it. I couldn't ask for any better role models than the Harlem kids."MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HEARING TO FOCUS ON AHMANSON PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing next month on whether the 
developers of Ahmanson Ranch should be required to get a special permit to 
allow for the extension of Las Virgenes Road to make way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's planning staff is urging the commission to require Ahmanson Land 
Co. to seek the special permit because the area is part of the Las Virgenes 
Road Scenic Corridor, said Steve Harris, the city's director of community 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like them to follow our adopted ordinances and procedures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 8 at City Hall, 26135 Mureau Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near 
the border of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has been met with fierce opposition from residents and 
municipalities in the area, who say it would disrupt surrounding neighborhoods. 
The developers maintain that they have done all they can to minimize the impact 
of the project on neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. initially filed for an encroachment permit to extend Las 
Virgenes Road to the Ventura County line to make way for the project, said 
Harris. The city Planning Department reviewed the application and then sent 
Ahmanson a letter saying the application was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The city told Ahmanson it would need a conditional use permit and that it 
would have to conduct an environmental review of the proposal, Harris said. 
Ahmanson then appealed the matter to the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a matter of record, I can't discuss this until we've had our hearing and 
made our decision," said Dave Brown, a member of the commission, when asked 
about the matter on Monday. The City Council last week voted to appeal a 
Superior Court judge's ruling that Calabasas was legally bound to allow the 
widening of Thousand Oaks Boulevard to make way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Goodman, who is on the board of directors of the Malibu Canyon Homeowners 
Assn., said he believes opponents of the Ahmanson project may have to 
compromise at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I'm a realist," said Goodman. "You are going to have big roads 
running through your community, but you don't need them going through the 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will continue to oppose the widening of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
because it would disrupt the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Las Virgenes Road matter, if the Planning Commission upholds the staff 
recommendation, Ahmanson has the option of appealing to the City Council, said 
Harris. If the council sides with Ahmanson, city planners would have to issue 
an encroachment permit. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PLEA ENTERED IN FREAK AUTO ACCIDENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman whose 2-year-old son knocked her idling car into gear, 
causing it to run over five children, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court to misdemeanor child-endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela Lopez, 33, was charged earlier this month with two child-endangerment 
counts in connection with the July 30 freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more serious count, she is accused of endangering the life of her son, 
Osvaldo, who authorities say climbed into the car and knocked it into gear 
while Lopez ran into her apartment to fetch her purse before a family outing to 
a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five children, ages 5 to 10, were hospitalized in serious or 
critical condition after the car struck a sofa they were playing on in the 
driveway, forcing it into a wall. They since have been released from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a mother of three, faces a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted. 
She is scheduled to go on trial Oct. 4 in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 She disputes claims by police, prosecutors and some witnesses that she left 
Osvaldo in the car when she ran into the apartment. She has said in interviews 
that the boy somehow opened the car door and climbed in on his own. ANN W.

<P>
 A campaign by community activists to fight helicopter noise in neighborhoods 
surrounding Van Nuys Airport is gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Political support is building for a measure activists have long sought: a 
federal rule that would require non-emergency helicopters to observe a 
1,000-foot minimum altitude over populated areas.Currently, there is no 
altitude minimum.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal 
(D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) have written the 
Federal Aviation Administration in the past month to support the proposed rule 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have in the previous two-month period received a couple dozen telephone 
inquiries and letters from people who have been subjected to a great deal more 
noise than in the past," Beilenson said. The FAA will evaluate the proposal and 
the public comments it has received. But it could take nearly three years for 
the change to go into effect.  
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter operators have criticized the proposed rule change as unworkable, 
saying that press and emergency helicopters are sometimes required to fly 
lower. KAY HWANGBO

<P>
 A representative from City Councilwoman Laura Chick's office will be on hand 
today to discuss crime and other concerns with west Van Nuys merchants at a 
meeting of the Corporate/Business Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6 p.m. meeting at American Pacific State Bank, 16600 Sherman Way, will 
feature Rayna Gabin, a field deputy from Chick's San Fernando Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meeting will be to discuss how the City Council can get more involved 
with the Los Angeles Police Department and the Corporate/Business Watch," said 
Shelly Joanis, who organized the watch program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in June, Joanis said, many of the 33 watch members have 
reported a variety of crimes in the area to police, including dozens of 
graffiti vandalism incidents and the thefts of four cars that were later 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing awesome," Joanis said. "A lot of other businesses are asking for 
suggestions on how to start up business watches. Businesses are concerned about 
what's going on in their areas." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FELLOWSHIP CREATED FOR CSUN TEACHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge professors have permission to take time off and get paid 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kulik, professor emeritus of the school's Department of Special 
Education, donated $150,000 to create a fellowship that will give her 
colleagues the opportunity to take sabbaticals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kulik Faculty Fellowship is the first of its kind for professors in the 
School of Education. It is based on seniority and will give one faculty member 
each spring semester time away from teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulik, a Northridge resident, began saving for the fellowship after she 
retired in 1991. She was a professor at CSUN for more than 21 years, during 
which she developed a "mainstreaming class" required for students pursuing a 
teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 The class teaches future educators to mainstream handicapped students into 
classrooms filled with non-handicapped peers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a professor, Kulik said she always needed more time for herself. She said 
that with a heavy load of professional commitments she didn't have enough time 
to contemplate, write, relax and socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I want to provide professors with time to use as they see fit," 
said Kulik. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was placed in a trust where it will accrue interest for the next 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first recipient of the fellowship is Joyce Hagen, chairwoman of the 
Department of Special Education and 20-year professor at CSUN. ALICIA DOYLE

<P>
 Extra relief from the heat is being provided at the Brea Plunge, which will 
remain open into the early fall for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned outdoor pool traditionally closed after Labor Day, but in 1993 
the schedule was extended as an experiment.This year, the Plunge will be be 
open for recreational swimming on weekends through Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people see how hot it is, they know kids want to be in the water," said 
recreation supervisor Connie Oyler of the community services department. The 
expanded schedule for recreational swimming will begin Sept. 10, with sessions 
held from 1 to 2:30 p.m. and 2:45 to 4:15 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Admission 
will be 50 cents for children and $1 for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming lessons have also been extended this year. Half-hour classes for all 
ages and skill levels are being taught from 3:30 to 7 p.m. weekdays through 
Sept. 9. The cost for two weeks of lessons is $27 for Brea residents and $32 
for non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The plunge, which has been designated as a historic structure, originally 
opened in 1929 and was renovated in the 1970s and 1980s, Oyler said. The pool 
is in City Hall Park at 440 S. Walnut Ave.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS $51.3-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Tustin Unified School District has adopted a $51.3-million budget for 
fiscal year 1994-95 with reserves more than two times larger than required by 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in pretty good status than in the last two to three years," said Paul 
Fisher, the assistant superintendent for business services, at Monday's school 
board meeting."We have no deficit and we have much more in reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the school district will have $3.4 million, or 6.6%, of the 
budget designated for economic uncertainties. The state requires 3%, or about 
$1.8 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, $480,000 has been set aside to be used either as a onetime bonus 
for school district employees, who have not received a pay raise over the past 
two years, or as part of a modest salary increase, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is anticipating about $1.7 million more in income than 
last school year because of increased enrollment. For the school year opening 
in September, the district is expecting more than 12,800 students, an increase 
of more than 500 from school year 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of the school district's income comes from the average daily 
attendance, or the amount the state pays to educate each enrolled child. The 
school district also receives federal and state grants and money for school 
programs, such as special and vocational education. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee salaries and benefits constitute the school district's biggest 
expense. But over the past two years, Fisher said, the costs have gone down 
from 85% of total expenses to about 83%. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major expense, about 15%, is for materials and services, including 
hiring consultants for special programs, he said.BERT ELJERA

 Work to replace two water pipelines along a one-mile section of South Coast 
Highway is scheduled to begin in October, according to the South Coast Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district spokesman Mike Dunbar said the construction, which could 
continue until January, is expected to close down one northbound lane of the 
highway, from 11th Avenue in Laguna Beach to Via Mentone in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipeline construction hours will be limited to 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday 
through Friday, Dunbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pipes being replaced is a 24-inch pipeline, one of the district's 
main supply routes that provides water to homes and businesses in South Laguna 
and Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before construction starts, the water district plans to put up a 
sign to remind motorists of the upcoming work.JEFF BEAN

BERGESON'S '1 STRIKE' BILL CLEARS ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tackling a heated election-year issue that sparked an emotional fight in the 
governor's race, the Assembly approved an Orange County lawmaker's bill Tuesday 
that would put first-time child molesters and violent rapists in prison for as 
long as 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly voted 73 to 0 for the so-called "one strike" bill carried by 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), sending it to the Senate for a 
final vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure was dramatically softened during the journey through the 
Legislature, Bergeson continued to portray it as one of the toughest sex crime 
laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "California will have a stern response to violent sex offenders," she said 
after the Assembly vote. "They're not going to be given a second chance. This 
is a responsible solution to society's most heinous of crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Democrats played down the role of Republicans in drafting the 
measure. During floor debate, Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) called 
the original measure a "dumb bill" and argued that Democrats were largely 
responsible for fixing it during committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's chances for passage improved dramatically when it was hitched 
earlier this month to sex crime bills carried by several Democrats. Gov. Pete 
Wilson, who has made the measure a plank in his reelection campaign, has 
promised to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 When first proposed, the bill called for a blanket sentence of life without 
the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 That tough stance drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups, 
including some district attorneys and women's organizations, who said the 
measure was so harsh it might actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to 
kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 After an aborted attempt to push the measure through the Senate, Bergeson 
redrafted the bill to delete references to life without parole, substituting a 
penalty of 25 years to life for most serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee, a traditional graveyard for GOP 
anti-crime measures, narrowed Bergeson's bill still further earlier this month 
by requiring that only the most brutal sexual assaults -- those involving 
torture, mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the intent to commit rape -- would 
result in the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser crimes could still earn sentences of 15 years to life, but would have 
to include special circumstances, such as the use of a firearm or dangerous 
weapon, more than one victim or the administering of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson began carrying the bill at the behest of Wilson, who has made the 
rape measure a centerpiece of his election-year fight on crime. A few weeks 
ago, the bill sparked a bitter dispute between the governor and Democrat 
challenger Kathleen Brown over her stance on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aired a television commercial in late July portraying Brown as opposed 
to the "one strike" bill. Brown countered by calling Wilson's advertisement "a 
despicable lie," arguing that she dropped her opposition to the bill after it 
was narrowed in the Senate.

DRUG SEARCHES PROPOSED FOR COSTA MESA SCHOOLS; POLICY: POLICE SUGGEST USE OF 
TRAINED DOGS TO SNIFF OUT ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES. NEWPORT-MESA OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, 
WANT PUBLIC INPUT BEFORE ADOPTING SUCH A MEASURE. 
</P>

<P>
 Police are proposing to use dogs to sniff out illegal drugs at both city high 
schools this fall, a plan that would make the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District the third in Orange County to employ the controversial tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have not yet voted on the proposal, but at least three of the seven 
said they favor the approach, previously employed by the Orange Unified School 
District -- which allowed dogs onto school buses in January, 1993 -- and 
Huntington Beach Union High School District, which still conducts searches on a 
random basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Newport-Mesa board members said they want to gauge public sentiment 
before adopting such a policy for Costa Mesa and Estancia high schools. The 
action was criticized by some students in the Orange and Huntington Beach 
school districts who believed it violated their rights against illegal searches 
and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd do this as a preventive measure, not a gotcha measure," Newport-Mesa 
trustee Forrest K. Werner said. "I don't want to mislead the public into 
thinking we have a drug problem on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward H. Decker said he supports the idea and would like the 
board to consider it in September, when the issue is expected to be formally 
scheduled for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of having dogs come on campus," he said. "If we can do it in 
such a manner that it meets everybody's satisfaction, we certainly ought to 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A news conference has been scheduled for 10 a.m. today at the Costa Mesa 
Police Department to outline details of the program. A presentation on how the 
dogs sniff out drugs will also be given, said Nadine Wilck, a school district 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was first suggested by Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden, who 
contacted school officials near the end of the last school year, when police 
were training their drug-sniffing dogs, trustees said. It was first revealed 
this week when police began making arrangements for the news conference.  
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar and Newport Harbor high schools would not be initially involved 
in the program, a decision that raised some questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have five high schools in the district," trustee Martha Fluor said. "And 
we're singling out Costa Mesa schools. These are questions that have to be 
answered." The fifth school, Monte Vista, an alternative high school in Costa 
Mesa, also would not be involved.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Roderick H. MacMillian said he favors the drug-sniffing measure, 
provided the search does not pose any physical risks to students. And Judith A. 
Franco, another trustee, stopped short of endorsing it, saying she and the 
community did not have enough information yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for drugs inside schools is legal, provided it is not conducted in a 
manner that would violate students' constitutional protections against 
unreasonable search and seizure, said Julian Eule, an associate dean with the 
UCLA Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even then, minors have (fewer) constitutional rights than full citizens 
and their rights are further constrained in the setting of the school system," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the schools are surrogate parents and have a great deal of leeway, 
but that doesn't mean they have free reign," he said. "And the irony is part of 
the reason they have that leeway is because the state doesn't want them to 
look, smell and taste like police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Staunton, the principal at Huntington Beach High School, said searches of 
lockers have been a success ever since the school implemented them in April 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've caught very few students with drugs and I think it's because of the 
dogs," he said. "The searches are random. We keep it secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lewis, principal for Orange High School, said the school allowed dogs to 
sniff certain students as they got off a school bus in January, 1993, but that 
was the last time they did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't find anything and I was happy that nobody was in possession -- and 
to me that was a success," he said. "It was a kind of negative success, though. 
I'm not happy we did it, but we had to find out what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa High School Principal Ed Harcharik said he endorses the use of the 
dogs if that is what it takes to stop students from trying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the board decides, we'll support," he said. "We've had very few 
drug-related incidents or arrests, but it's just that drugs are available to 
kids and kids are always willing to take chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia High School Principal Peggy Anatol declined to comment on the matter, 
saying she has been on the job just three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Department of Education has no say in the matter and leaves 
it up to the 27 individual school districts in the county to decide whether 
they want to use the dogs, according to a spokeswoman.

WOUNDED MAN HELD IN ATTEMPTED JEWELRY STORE HEIST

 Sheriff's deputies have arrested a Los Angeles man suspected of trying to rob 
a Lake Forest jewelry store last week and suffering wounds in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Wafer, 26, was booked into Orange County Jail on Monday on suspicion 
of attempted murder and attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wafer sought emergency treatment for bullet wounds at a Downey Hospital less 
than two hours after a bandit was wounded during a shootout at the 14K Jewelry 
Mart in the Saddleback Plaza Shopping Center, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are still seeking four other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 An armed robber set off the metal detector as he entered the store in the on 
El Toro Road. Asking the owner if he had a gun, the man pulled a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic handgun. The owner, whom authorities did not name, grabbed his 
own .44-caliber revolver and both men fired. Only the robber was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Police waited until Monday to arrest and removed Wafer to jail because of his 
wounds. Police said that Wafer was a gang member.

CHILD, 10, TESTIFIES THAT SUSPECT MOLESTED HER; CRIME: SALESMAN IS ORDERED TO 
STAND TRIAL ON CHARGES STEMMING FROM ATTACKS ON FIVE GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Memorial Day weekend, a 10-year-old girl walked alone to a West Valley 
supermarket to buy lemon-lime soda pop and a Butterfinger candy bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the way home, she testified Tuesday, a man in a pickup truck snatched 
her off the street, drove her to the mountains and did terrible things to her 
that she didn't completely understand. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, taking the witness stand in Van Nuys Municipal Court seemed to be 
too much for the child. On the witness stand, she turned her head away from her 
accused molester and whimpered. She asked for a break, then for her mommy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see him," she said in a small, quavering voice and dove, 
crying, into her mother's arms. Finally, the tears subsided, and with her 
mother seated next to her, the child pointed her finger and identified Howard 
August Davis, a 29-year-old salesman who lived in Woodland Hills, as the man 
who accosted her and molested her three separate times on the evening of May 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the child's testimony and similar stories from four other 
alleged victims, Municipal Court Judge Gregg Marcus ordered Davis, the son of a 
retired Beverly Hills police officer, to stand trial on 33 felony counts -- 
including kidnaping, rape, sodomy, forcible oral copulation and child 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stemmed from a series of abductions and attacks on five girls and 
young women, ages 10 to 18, between May 1 and May 30, Deputy Dist. Atty Martin 
L. Herscovitz said. All the attacks occurred in the western San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Davis drove a pickup truck and allegedly abducted four of his five 
victims from streets near stores and shopping malls, police and prosecutors 
dubbed him the Valley Pickup Truck Rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 As the alleged victims recounted their ordeals during a two-day preliminary 
hearing, a pattern emerged: All were accosted near malls and shopping centers 
by a man asking for directions or change, then taken to isolated alleyways or 
mountain locations, where they repeatedly were raped or sexually assaulted. The 
nature of the sex acts and their sequence seldom varied. 
</P>
<P>
 The young women said they were abducted at knifepoint -- one described how he 
used a knife to cut off her bra, while the child said she was threatened with a 
stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took out something," the child said. "It was an electric shocker and he 
said he would hurt me if I wasn't good. I heard a buzzing noise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another alleged victim said Davis kept her glasses, keys and an organizer she 
carried. "I started to pick them up and he said, 'No, I better keep those. That 
way I can find you if I need to,' " she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who is being held on $2-million bail, is scheduled to be arraigned in 
Superior Court on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Peter Knecht said Davis asserts he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Knecht questioned the prosecution witnesses closely, seeking to draw out 
inconsistencies in their stories, as well as clues or admissions that their 
identifications of his client might have been influenced by the widespread 
publicity the case received. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who had no prior criminal record, was arrested June 3 near the 
intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sale Avenue -- two days after 
investigators linked a string of sexual attacks to a single, serial rapist.

MOTEL OFFICIAL ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF ATTEMPTED RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A motel manager was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of trying to rape a 
17-year-old runaway staying in one of his rooms, although police conceded that 
he may have been the victim instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bankim Oza, 33, was booked on an allegation of attempted rape, police 
said it was unclear what exactly happened at the Bahia Motel shortly after 
midnight.  
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining his innocence, Oza told police he was the victim of a robbery 
attempt by the runaway and her 16-year-old boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to know who's more credible," Burbank Police Sgt. Doyle Holm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the girl's description of events, Oza was arrested, but was freed on 
$50,000 bail. His arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A motel employee who declined to be identified expressed shock over Oza's 
arrest, adding that he began working there just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very nice guy. Clean-cut record," she said. "We have been here 22 
years and nothing happened before. He didn't do anything at all. He didn't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The young couple were not named by authorities because of their ages. But 
police said the girl is a runaway from Glendale who had not been reported 
missing by her parents until after Tuesday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the teen-age couple's version of events, Oza touched, fondled her 
and pushed her onto a bed in one of the motel rooms, where she was trying to 
use a phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was interrupted when her boyfriend unexpectedly walked in, the 
couple told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old contends he argued with Oza and then -- fearing for his life 
-- jumped off a second-floor balcony, which distracted Oza and enabled his 
girlfriend to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 Oza, however, told police that the couple held him at knife-point and tried to 
rob him of jewelry, and that he then hid in one of the motel rooms until police 
arrived.

SUPERVISORS BACK WILSON, ASSAIL BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of Kathleen Brown's visit to Orange County, members of the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday criticized the Democratic gubernatorial candidate and 
announced their support for Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't always agree on everything, but we do agree that the governor is the 
best candidate to revive the economy with new jobs and long-term prosperity," 
board Chairman Thomas F. Riley said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the nonpartisan board, who are all Republicans, said they wanted to 
endorse Wilson before Brown makes a campaign stop today at the Orange County 
Forum's luncheon at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who was on vacation, did not attend the news 
conference held by her four colleagues. A spokeswoman for her office, however, 
said Wieder backs Wilson. The endorsements were on behalf of the individual 
supervisors and not a part of a board policy decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors praised Wilson performance, citing the governor's efforts to 
reform the state workers' compensation system, his role in preventing 
Irvine-based Taco Bell from moving out of the county and his fight to get 
federal immigration funding and attract new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to Gov. Wilson's efforts, for the first time in California history, 
California is home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state in the 
nation," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economists are finally predicting economic recovery for our state," Vasquez 
added. ". . . His leadership has provided the strong base and foundation for 
California to get back on the right economic track." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Glazer, a spokesman for the Brown campaign, said the supervisors were 
trying to "defend a Wilson record that has crippled Orange County economically 
and has resulted in the reduction in support for the schools and loss of fire 
and police services." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that since Wilson has been governor, he has "raised taxes by more 
than $7 billion" and caused "a 65% increase in unemployment" in the county.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, who was appointed to the board by Wilson, said 
"if anything can characterize this governor, it is that he has taken this state 
probably at one of the most difficult times in its history, and we're emerging 
stronger and much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he was "a little surprised with this situation with Kathleen 
Brown coming into Orange County disguising herself as a conservative. Most of 
us can see right through that, and I think the public in this community can see 
right through that." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton also denounced Brown, linking her to the policies 
of her brother, former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't want another Gov. Brown heading the helm of California," 
Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was "gutsy" of Brown to come to Orange County, but "it's very 
transparent that she is, in fact, not a conservative but a liberal in every 
sense of the word along the pattern of her brother, Jerry."

COUPLE TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATH OF ROBBERY WITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles couple were ordered to trial Tuesday on murder and conspiracy 
charges for the slaying of a witness to a 1991 Orange County computer store 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 William Clinton Clark, 40, and Antoinette Yancey, 26, face a possible death 
sentence if convicted of killing Ardell Williams last March in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Municipal Judge B. Tam Nomoto in Santa Ana ordered Clark to stand 
trial for a second killing. He faces murder, robbery and other charges stemming 
from the slaying of a 49-year-old woman who stumbled upon an armed robbery at a 
Fountain Valley computer store. Kathy Lee was shot once in the head on Oct. 18, 
1991, in the parking lot of CompUSA when she came to pick up her teen-age son, 
who worked at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision Tuesday came following an unusual five-week preliminary 
hearing in which witnesses were videotaped to preserve their testimony because 
one prosecution witness in the case already had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Williams, 22, of Gardena, was shot to death in a 
Gardena parking lot because she was a witness to the computer store robbery and 
slaying. Clark is accused of plotting the killing from his jail cell, while 
Yancey is accused of carrying out the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers Jack M. Earley and Gary L. Proctor, however, said the couple 
had nothing to do with either killings and had argued before the judge that the 
prosecution lacked evidence to prove such charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other defendants, one of them Clark's younger brother, have been convicted 
of first-degree murder for Lee's death during the computer store robbery. Eric 
D. Clark and Nokkuwa (Pretty Boy) Ervin, the alleged triggerman, await 
sentencing in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Both William Clark and Yancey remain in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder charges against the couple carry special circumstances, making them 
eligible for the death penalty should prosecutors decide to pursue such action.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO DISCUSS FLOOD DAMAGE REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City engineers will seek advice tonight from North Oaks residents about how to 
repair flood damage in their neighborhood and prevent it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The area -- in Santa Clarita's Canyon Country community -- flooded in April, 
1993, when underground streams swelled from winter rains that soaked the region 
two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Water bubbled up onto lawns, flowed down sidewalks and seeped into basements 
with such force that residents first believed that a water main had burst. 
Potholes, algae and patches of moss emerged throughout the North Oaks 
neighborhood bordered by Camp Plenty Road, Langside Avenue, Delight Street and 
Glasser Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials have obtained $498,000 from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and $66,000 from the state Office of Emergency Services. 
Together with $100,000 in city funds, they hope to prevent future flooding -- a 
problem that has plagued the North Oaks neighborhood about every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's public meeting is scheduled at 7 p.m. at Cedarcreek School, 27792 
Camp Plenty Road. Engineers want residents to suggest where wells can be placed 
in the area and which repairs they would like to see completed first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to explain to them some of the things we're going to do and see 
what sort of comments they might have," said Stan Scholl, city associate 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next month, engineers will install a pump in an existing well to draw 
water out of the ground and divert it into the bed of the nearby Santa Clara 
River, Scholl said. They also will drill several four-inch-wide wells to 
monitor water levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers believe that they can pump enough water away to prevent future 
flooding, but the process may cost tens of thousands of dollars, Scholl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see if there's a commitment from (residents) to pay for the 
ongoing maintenance cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that cost may be covered by the Santa Clarita Water Co., which city 
representatives are negotiating with for use of the water, Scholl said.

 City officials unveiled plans Tuesday to spend $3.3 million to buy, repair and 
resell 50 deteriorating foreclosure homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dwellings, scattered throughout the city, are owned by the federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD insured the mortgages, then 
took possession of the homes when the buyers stopped making payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, dubbed Operation Clean Sweep, the Lancaster 
Redevelopment Agency will pay $2.3 million for the houses, a sum that is 30% 
lower than their appraised value. The agency will spend $1 million to repair 
the structures and their landscaping, then put them up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henry Hearns, chairman of the agency's board of directors, said the 
program will allow the city to renovate HUD-owned houses that have become 
eyesores and in some cases a location for criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to help HUD with a problem they have, which is also a problem for 
us," he said. "We're going to rehabilitate (the houses) and place them back on 
the market." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Board of Realtors has agreed to assist the city in selling 
the repaired houses. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, in their role as directors of the Redevelopment Agency, 
are scheduled to vote Tuesday on funding for Operation Clean Sweep. Its 
approval is almost certain because four of the five council members spoke in 
favor of the program Tuesday at a City Hall briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help the property values of the neighbors," Mayor Frank Roberts 
said. "I can't imagine anyone being unhappy about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Deborah Shelton said she heard many complaints during her 
election campaign last spring from residents whose blocks were blemished by 
poorly maintained foreclosure houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very frustrating issue," she said. "I really think this program is 
going to be wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said renovation work on the Operation Clean Sweep houses should 
take about 90 days. Real estate agents will then try to sell them within 
another 120 days. Lancaster officials said this turnover will take less time 
than in the normal HUD process. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Antelope Valley's HUD houses had been under the jurisdiction 
of the agency's overburdened Los Angeles office. Lancaster's purchase agreement 
was arranged with HUD's Fresno office, which recently assumed responsibility 
for the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Clean Sweep will target 50 HUD homes, but Willie Mae Haskin, area 
coordinator for the Fresno HUD office, said her agency has about 200 other 
foreclosed homes in and near Lancaster.  
</P>
<P>
 Haskin, who attended Tuesday's briefing, said her staff wants to get the other 
dwellings repaired and sold promptly. "We are moving toward getting those 
properties back on the market," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; JURY ASKS TO REVIEW TESTIMONY; COURTS: AFTER 
10 DAYS OF DELIBERATION, JURORS ARE SPLIT 7-5 IN THE TRIAL OF A MARTIAL ARTS 
EXPERT ACCUSED OF MURDERING A CO-WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deadlocked Los Angeles Superior Court jury Tuesday asked that the testimony 
of a martial arts expert accused of killing a nationally ranked female 
co-worker be read back to them, along with the testimony of the victim's 
boyfriend, who the defense has accused of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury has deliberated for 10 days in the trial of Stuart Edward Milburn, 
27, who is accused of strangling Veronica Estrada, 29, on Dec. 15, 1993, as she 
walked along a dark road toward her Canyon Country home. The latest court 
survey indicates jurors are split 7-5, although it is not known what verdict 
the majority favors. 
</P>
<P>
 If no verdict is reached, a mistrial will be declared and the case will be 
retried within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather see that than a not guilty verdict, that's for sure," said 
Estrada's sister, Theresa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, said his client is "scared to death" 
at the prospect of a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been held for seven months without bail for a crime he did not commit 
and he can't get them to decide he didn't do this, which is scary," Mounger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberations have lasted longer than many expected. Judge Charles Horan, for 
example, showed up Tuesday wearing jeans under his black robe, having scheduled 
vacation time this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors announced Friday that they were deadlocked 6-6, but Horan ordered them 
to continue deliberating. Another impasse declaration -- this time by a 7-5 
vote -- came Monday afternoon, with jurors asking for a further definition of 
the term reasonable doubt . 
</P>
<P>
 They deliberated for a short time Tuesday, then sent a note to Horan just 
before 11 a.m. stating they wanted to have the entire testimonies of Milburn 
and Estrada's boyfriend, Eddie Hockaday, read to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has alleged that Milburn killed Estrada out of professional 
jealousy because of her accomplishments, such as being named instructor of the 
year at Taekwondo USA, where they both worked. Estrada also was the American 
Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the second-degree black belt 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn testified during the trial that he respected Estrada's tae kwon do 
skills, but not her leadership abilities. He also admitted that the two didn't 
get along, but said that he did not kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 Three prosecution witnesses said they saw a man -- identified from a photo 
lineup as Milburn -- near the murder scene at about 8:15 p.m., about the time 
police believe Estrada was killed. However, a defense witness, another 
co-worker, said she saw Milburn put a Christmas card in her gym bag at the tae 
kwon do studio about 8:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger has argued that Hockaday had a stronger motive and opportunity for the 
killing, since the couple had argued just before Estrada was killed. Hockaday 
also testified that he was driving along Soledad Canyon Road looking for 
Estrada, shortly after authorities believe she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockaday's testimony was read back to the jury Tuesday afternoon. It is hoped 
that the reading of Milburn's testimony, which could take two days, will begin 
today, depending on the availability of a court reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz said he "would find it a tad incredible" if 
jurors are trying to decide if Milburn or Hockaday committed the murder. 
Mounger said he "wouldn't guess" what the jury is up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors previously requested that the testimony of five other witnesses be read 
back to them by a court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of 
first-degree murder. He also faces a separate charge of sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was acquitted by Horan during the trial of charges of attempted rape, plus 
special circumstance allegations of attempted rape and lying in wait.

A COMIC TWIST IN CHINA; MOVIES: BEFORE BECOMING THE FIRST ASIAN TO WIN CANNES' 
BEST PERFORMANCE HONORS FOR THE DRAMA 'TO LIVE,' GE YOU WAS KNOWN AS THE 
COUNTRY'S PREMIER SATIRICAL ACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SAVITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China's New Wave cinema continued its remarkable run of international success 
at this spring's Cannes Film Festival. Celebrated young director Zhang Yimou's 
"To Live," a Revolutionary-era epic under threat of ban by Communist Party 
censors, was awarded the Special Jury prize, adding to acclaim earned by last 
year's Golden Palm winner, "Farewell My Concubine." 
</P>
<P>
 But more surprising than Zhang's achievement was the capture of best 
performance honors by "To Live" lead actor Ge You, the first Chinese -- indeed 
Asian -- to win best actor accolades at an international festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When word of the voting trickled back through China's grapevine (publicity for 
"To Live" is banned), the film community here assumed the distinction was 
bestowed on Gong Li, Chinese film's vivacious, internationally renowned leading 
lady. It was with astonishment and then elation that fans greeted the news that 
the film's male lead, the unheard-of-outside-of-China Ge You, had taken the 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 On the set of his new film, a drama depicting a police officer frustrated by 
increasing violence in society, Ge (pronounced Guh) talked about his recent 
trip to France and his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always assumed that Oscar and Cannes prize winners knew ahead of time, and 
just acted surprised," the tall, animated Ge said with his trademark impish 
grin. "I was sure they'd made some mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 His loyal Chinese followers have no doubt about the 40-year-old Ge's acting 
ability. The son of a stage and film star father and scriptwriter mother, his 
thespian credentials are impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ge has been a fixture on Chinese film and television screens for years. Ge's 
triumph in the dramatic lead role in "To Live" came as a surprise because he is 
known and loved as China's premier comic actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be quite honest," he confided with a conspiratorial wink, "I think my 
co-star may have been a little jealous." 
</P>
<P>
 This humor with an edge has been a distinguishing trademark throughout Ge's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 A core member of China's pioneering "Fifth Generation" of actors and 
filmmakers, Ge's politically charged, satire-laden performances have tested the 
boundaries of the acceptable in China's dangerously capricious cultural climate 
throughout the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Ge first gained prominence in 1986 for his lead role in the feature film "The 
Operators." Based on a novel by China's best-selling brat-pack writer Wang 
Shuo, the film chronicles the exploits of Ge and two partners as they 
manipulate discrepancies between China's communist veneer and corrupt reality 
for kicks and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether disguised as cops and extorting large sums from Hong Kong businessmen 
"caught" in the act of patronizing prostitutes, or peddling influence to 
business professionals who believe they are dealing with the offspring of 
high-ranking party officials, Ge and his wisecracking, street-smart comrades 
exposed the often sordid reality of Deng Xiaoping's "reforms," and "The 
Operators" achieved cult status among urban youths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several films in a similar vein, including the critically acclaimed "Spring 
Festival" and Ge's first collaboration with Zhang Yimou, "Operation Cougar," 
increased his reputation as a rebel with a sense of humor, but his leap from 
antihero to superstar status came in 1990 when he captured the imagination of 
600 million viewers as a crusading investigative reporter in the hit TV series 
"Stories From the Newsroom." 
</P>
<P>
 China's first Western-style sitcom, the Wang Shuo/Ge You combination again 
proved successful with a nationally televised, tongue-in-cheek sendup of 
everything China's leaders revere as sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show, Mao Tse-tung was frequently misquoted to humorous effect. The 
favored target of barbs is a matronly Communist Party busybody who epitomizes 
hypocrisy. And the episode that garnered the highest ratings depicted a 
newsroom power struggle following the editor in chief's retirement, which 
precipitated so much back-stabbing and double-dealing that the old man was 
obliged to stay on. This post-Tian An Men allusion to the leadership's 
inability to agree on a successor to Deng Xiaoping was the transparent reason 
behind "Stories' " national audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Newfound prominence as a result of "Stories' " success translated into Ge's 
first "serious" film role, as the homosexual opera patron in "Farewell My 
Concubine." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to see the film in a Chinese theater and was embarrassed when my 
appearance on screen was greeted with laughter," Ge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the subject matter -- political persecution and social 
intolerance -- is very serious, and the audience ultimately accepted and 
sympathized with my dramatic portrayal of a tragic character." 
</P>
<P>
 Ge's moving performance in "Farewell" led Zhang Yimou to cast him opposite 
Gong Li in "To Live." The film portrays one family's saga spanning the years 
from China's 1930s civil war through the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). Due 
to currently tense political circumstances, it is doubtful Chinese audiences 
will be permitted to see the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as my evolution from comedy to drama has been natural, I think Chinese 
audiences should be allowed to advance from making light of our tragic past to 
seriously examining its causes," Ge commented. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that his award-winning performance may have benefited from the 
fact that the story was his family's own. Ge was separated from his parents 
throughout his teens, his mother and father spending a decade in a labor camp 
while he was raising pigs on a rural farm in place of a high school education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those years were a tragedy for China, but hiding from it will not heal the 
wounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a mistake to ban this kind of film in China, an error that I 
believe must and will be rectified." 
</P>
<P>
 The police drama he is currently shooting sees Ge reuniting with his old 
"Operators" colleagues for the first time. A scene they are currently working 
on involves a soccer riot, similar to that which followed China's World Cup 
qualifying loss in 1986. Its filming, coinciding with the 1994 World Cup, was 
unplanned -- although Ge is a big soccer fan and resents missing games while on 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he sees the future holding more of the same for him, staying busy with 
work, continuing to improve his acting skills and testing the boundaries of the 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ge concluded: "I hope that I will see a day in China when no serious topic is 
off-limits to artistic treatment."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: STONE'S 'KILLERS' SHOOTS WIDE AS TV CRITIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If only minimalist Oliver Stone wouldn't equivocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Just so there's no mistake, Stone is annoyed, right? He's no fan? His 
just-released "Natural Born Killers" satirically attacks mass media and the 
violence-numbed culture it's helped shape? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, you'd have to be wearing a blindfold and ear plugs not to get the 
message that director Stone delivers in "Natural Born Killers" with a withering 
psychedelic savagery that is sending critics to their thesauruses to find the 
words to describe it. On television Sunday night, a groping Roger Ebert 
responded to Stone's new movie like the guys who extracted an alien creature 
from the permafrost in "The Thing." It may be "some kind of . . . masterpiece 
," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is, it's hard to ignore. Using excess to depict excess, Stone's 
movie kicks butt with the frenzy of someone driving stake after stake through 
the heart of a vampire. Unquestionably, his targets have earned the punishing 
mockery he administers. Yet as a treatise on television, "Natural Born Killers" 
is hardly visionary. Despite its virtues as a sort of pin-balling parody, it 
does not foresee or even look toward the lunacy at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it's no "Network." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's catalysts in "Natural Born Killers" are Mickey and Mallory (Woody 
Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), a couple of mass murderers in love who make 
Bonnie and Clyde look like Ozzie and Harriet. As this is the age of the 
Menendez brothers and O.J. Simpson cases, Mickey and Mallory's carnage 
naturally earns them a spot in America's heart ("If I was a mass killer, I'd 
like to be Mickey and Mallory," one romantic tells a TV interviewer) and on 
America's favorite TV show, "American Maniacs." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the movie's funniest moments, the tabloid show's amorally 
opportunistic Aussie host, Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.), gets Mickey to agree 
to a live prison interview following the Super Bowl by telling him that his 
ratings so far have outdone even serial slayers John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy, 
although not Charles Manson. "Well," says Mickey, "it's pretty hard to beat the 
king." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Network," the extraordinarily prophetic 1976 film about television 
written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet, "Natural Born Killers" 
is a satirist's relentless embellishment (but not by much) of the present 
instead of a dark comedy suggesting what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as James L. Brooks devilishly re-created the frailties of contemporary TV 
journalism in "Broadcast News," Stone's "Natural Born Killers" depicts, again 
and again, what TV viewers already have been exposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you be jolted by the public's romanticizing of fictional sweethearts 
Mickey and Mallory, for example, when you've seen Angelenos cheering accused 
murderer Simpson from freeway overpasses as his white Bronco was pursued by 
police? And why would the glamorizing of this pair surprise us when some of 
Simpson's more zealous supporters say even his guilt would not diminish their 
ardor? 
</P>
<P>
 "American Maniacs" itself -- the title is as applicable to the host as to his 
subjects -- could have been ripped from the TV listings, so closely does it 
resemble today's growing cluster of programs that sell fear like mouthwash. And 
if Gale going "one on one" with Mickey behind bars resonates with familiarity, 
it's because Bundy, Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer and especially Manson have all met the 
camera in televised jailhouse interviews. Moreover, if you're seeking a 
real-life microcosm of the movie's gory prison brouhaha and Gale's exploiting 
of it, try the body crunching, chair-throwing "Geraldo" explosion that Geraldo 
Rivera touched off in 1988 by bringing together a white supremacist and a black 
activist in front of a studio audience of volatile skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Chayefsky, on the other hand, was ahead of the curve. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Shaun Considine's new biography, "Mad as Hell: The Life and Work 
of Paddy Chayefsky," the great screenwriter was bitterly observing at least as 
early as 1974 that television was dicing up and trivializing the events of the 
day. He quotes Chayefsky as saying about TV news: "It totally desensitizes (us 
to) viciousness, brutality, murder, death, so we no longer actively feel the 
pains of the victim or suffer for their lives or feel their grief." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mad as Hell," director Lumet notes Chayefsky's "uncanny ability to see 
just where everything was leading." Hence the fictional UBS network in 
"Network," which Chayefsky envisioned cynically lifting its fortunes through 
programs ranging from "Celebrity Mahjong" and "The Young Shysters" to a comedy 
designed to knock ABC's hit "Laverne & Shirley" off the air, "Shirley, Pedro 
and Putz." 
</P>
<P>
 That was pure fun. Chayefsky's true genius in "Network" was in foreseeing the 
extent to which television would merge entertainment with news and public 
affairs in the cause of ratings. Thus, he had UBS give a weekly series to a 
violent black revolutionary group (whose co-opted leaders immediately covet 
ratings and profit percentages). And he designated as the soul of UBS, its 
signature voice, suicidal anchorman Howard Beale, whose mad rantings are turned 
into a wildly popular weekly series that also features a gossip columnist and 
Sybil the Soothsayer, who "tells tomorrow's news today." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this culminates outrageously: When Beale's ratings dive, the network 
has him assassinated on his own show. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder being the exception (so far), the anything-for-ratings mentality that 
Chayefsky depicted in "Network" has come to pass in one form or another. Yet 
some responded to the original release of "Network" with indignation. "It gives 
a distorted picture of people who work in television," said Paul Friedman, then 
the producer of NBC's "Today" program. There would never be "that kind of 
show-biz approach to news," insisted Barbars Walters. She added: "We will never 
let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has affixed a fantasy label to Stone's new movie, for unlike 
Chayefsky's futurist work, it merely uses surrealism to pump up the obvious. 
"Natural Born Killers" has its strengths, but it's pretty hard to beat the 
king.

'NEWLAND' PREMIERE TO KICK OFF ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL OCT. 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Israel Film Festival opens at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences in Beverly Hills on Oct. 5 with a gala premiere of Orna Ben-Dor Niv's 
"Newland," a post-Holocaust drama about a brother and sister searching for 
their mother in the new state of Israel. Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign 
minister, will be guest of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will continue at the Music Hall Theater through Oct. 20, 
presenting 16 feature films and documentaries. It will then play at New York's 
Angelika 57 Theater Nov. 8-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Other films are: Dan Wolman's "The Distance," in which an Israeli architect 
must choose between living in the U.S. or returning to Israel; Rami Na'aman's 
"The Flying Camel," about an unlikely friendship between a Jewish history 
professor and an Arab garbage collector; and Michal Bat-Adam's "Imagined 
Autobiography," in which a young filmmaker is driven by her father's ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Rottenberg's comedy "The Revenge of Itzik Finkelstein" tells of a 
disgruntled 40-year-old, still living with his mother, who makes one last stab 
at independence and success. Idit Shechori's "In the Name of Love" centers on 
five people making each other miserable. Leonid Gorovets' "Coffee With Lemon," 
drawn from the filmmaker's own experiences, finds a successful actor joining in 
the massive migration from Eastern Europe to Israel. Jacob Goldwater's "Max & 
Morris," a musical comedy about a group of petty criminals hoping to make it 
into the big time, is based on a popular play.

 The fall TV season got off to an underwhelming start last week, ratings from 
the A.C. Nielsen Co. revealed Tuesday, as two new prime-time series delivered 
lackluster ratings against mostly rerun competition. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "My So-Called Life" ran third in its Thursday time slot--close on the 
heels of NBC's "Mad About You"/"Wings" tandem and CBS' "One West Waikiki"--and 
ranked 46th among the week's 92 prime-time network programs.It attracted 16% of 
the available audience but was first in its time period among the 12-17 age 
group--not surprising, since its main character, played by Claire Danes, is a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, meanwhile, Fox's "M.A.N.T.I.S." drew 14% of the available viewers 
and ran third in the time slot behind ABC's duo of "Family Matters" and "Boy 
Meets World" and CBS' "Diagnosis Murder," finishing 65th overall. More 
encouraging for the network, however, it was first in the time period among 
viewers aged 18-49. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC won the network competition, fueled by its one-two punch of "Home 
Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire." Southland Ratings

THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; PROFILE: NORMAN R. AUGUSTINE; HIS SUCCESS IS LIKELY 
TO TURN ON A SCALPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman R. Augustine, the native Coloradan designated to take the helm of the 
proposed Lockheed Martin defense behemoth within a few years, is a man of many 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 An author and nature photographer, Augustine also likes to go dog-sledding and 
mountain climbing. He plays a solid game of tennis too. 
</P>
<P>
 But the skill that most likely will determine his success at the head of the 
merged company involves how well he can wield a corporate scalpel. Analysts say 
that to make the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger successful, the new company 
will have to slash thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This merger can't create more revenue. It can only pay off through reduced 
costs, and that means people" will be laid off, said Robert D. Paulson, who 
heads the aerospace industry practice for the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Augustine's recent background and his book "Augustine's Laws," it's 
clear that the 59-year-old executive won't shrink from the task. In the 
executive's 1983 book of business aphorisms, Law NO. 5 pronounces: "One-tenth 
of the participants produce over one-third of the output. Increasing the number 
of participants merely reduces the average output." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Augustine engineered Martin Marietta's $3-billion purchase of 
General Electric Co.'s huge aerospace division last year, then quickly moved to 
close 10 U.S. plants and slash 2,000 jobs he considered duplicative. That comes 
along with other cuts that would bring the company's overall work force 
reduction to about 11,000 during 1993 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is impressed with how Augustine handled the layoffs and cut 
costs. "He hasn't done much with the General Electric aerospace business" 
acquired by Martin Marietta in 1993, said one aerospace analyst who asked not 
to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine won't bear full responsibility for the cuts immediately. Lockheed 
Chief Executive Daniel M. Tellep, 62, will initially head the new Lockheed 
Martin if the merger is completed successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even before the merger was announced Tuesday, directors of the two 
companies had already agreed that Augustine would succeed Tellep upon the elder 
executive's retirement. And observers say it would be Augustine who would chart 
the new aerospace behemoth's course into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the top executives of the proposed merger partners say they 
don't know how many of their combined work force of 170,000 employees would 
lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a straight talker, Augustine explained his approach to management in 
"Augustine's Laws," which he wrote while still a Martin Marietta vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The book grabbed the interest of executives and policy-makers both inside and 
outside the industry and, as one of his longtime business associates said, 
"provides a real good window into Norman's soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Augustine's "laws": 
</P>
<P>
 * "It is better to be the reorganizer than the reorganizee." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The optimum committee has no members." 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine is known as a tireless worker. When he travels out of town, his 
staffers every day send him by overnight mail briefcases filled with new 
paperwork to review. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fuqua, a former Democratic congressman from Florida who has known 
Augustine for more than 20 years and who now is president of the Aerospace 
Industries Assn., also recalls the long hours Augustine put in as head of an 
advisory panel named by President George Bush to study the nation's space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fuqua, who also served on the committee, tells it, Augustine often would 
hold meetings until 10 or 11 at night. Then, Fuqua said, Augustine would write 
up the panel's findings by himself that night and present his draft in time for 
breakfast meetings the following the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see when he had the time to do all of this. It impressed me," Fuqua 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tellep is a lifetime employee of Lockheed, Augustine has spent most of 
36 years in the industry moving back and forth between jobs in the private and 
public sectors -- a background that many analysts say gives Augustine an edge 
because he knows how the defense game works from both sides of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine, who holds bachelor's and master's degrees in aeronautical 
engineering from Princeton University, got his first aerospace job with what 
was then Douglas Aircraft Co. in 1958. He later put in several stints with the 
government -- first as assistant director of defense research and engineering 
at the Defense Department from 1965 to 1970, and finally as Army undersecretary 
in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, he joined Martin Marietta as vice president of aerospace technical 
operations. By December, 1987, he was elevated to chief executive, and he took 
on the added title of chairman early the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 As the leader of Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta, he has bucked the recent 
conventional wisdom that defense companies should wean themselves off the 
federal government's shrinking defense budget. Instead, he doubled the 
company's bets on military business. He spent $3.2 billion to buy General 
Electric's aerospace division last year and within months agreed to pay $1.9 
billion for Grumman Corp. before he was outbid at the last minute by Northrop 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Tuesday that Augustine's affection for the defense business 
could put him at odds with Tellep's desire to move away from a heavy reliance 
on government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep has spent much of his time over the past few years trying to develop 
Lockheed's other businesses, which range from airport management to 
computerized information databases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Augustine indicated at a Tuesday news conference that he may now see the 
wisdom in diversifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are Darwinian times in our industry. Failure to change is failure to 
survive," he said.

THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; POWERHOUSE IN THE MAKING; ANALYSTS, INVESTORS 
CHEER, BUT ITS SIZE RAISES QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financial, technical and political power created by the proposed 
$10-billion merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. left defense 
industry experts stunned Tuesday as they began to assess its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 While they praised the deal for its potential to improve efficiency in the 
defense industry, they also fretted that it would concentrate too much potency 
in a single corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors gave a strong vote of confidence to the combination, wildly bidding 
up shares of the stocks Tuesday on the presumption that the new Lockheed Martin 
Corp. would capture leadership of the defense industry and eclipse rivals with 
its advantages in cost and technical performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been described as survivors, but we aspire to more than mere 
survival," said an ebullient Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep. "This merger 
is the forward look of two visionary companies." 
</P>
<P>
 But the powerful amalgamation also raises difficult issues for the federal 
government and for the rest of the defense industry, which must figure out 
whether the size of the new company gives it unique advantages in future 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Martin -- double the size of its nearest competitor -- would control 
as much as 20% of the Pentagon's research and acquisitions budget and hold 
enormous regional political sway. It would employ thousands of people in each 
of a number of states -- California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, 
Colorado and Pennsylvania -- whose congressional delegations could easily 
control any vote on future weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep rejected those concerns, saying the new company would be no bigger than 
aerospace rivals such as Boeing Corp. or United Technologies Corp., and that he 
would not have proposed the merger if he had any concern that it might not 
survive antitrust scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect the deal to pass muster because there is no major 
product line in which the new firm would be the sole supplier to the Pentagon 
and because the Pentagon has been hounding the defense industry for just such 
consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics were not so sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Old Man Eisenhower warned us about the undue influence of contractors, 
he had nothing in mind like this giant corporation," said Eugene Carroll, 
director of the Center for Defense Information, a liberal think tank composed 
of former military officers. "They will have enormous clout in Washington, and 
it raises concern over the integrity of the political process." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace analyst Joseph Campbell of Lehman Bros., while endorsing the merger, 
said the size of the deal may prompt defense officials to be more cautious than 
usual in their evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch, in Kingston, Jamaica, seemed less than 
effusive. He said the Pentagon will take several weeks to evaluate the proposed 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain to be very serious antitrust questions to be examined," 
Deutch told wire service reporters. Still, he added, "it shows the trend that 
(Defense Secretary) Bill Perry and I have been expecting, and indeed 
encouraging to an extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dark side of the deal would be the inevitable job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, executives have acknowledged only 100 to 200 job cuts at Lockheed's 
headquarters in Calabasas, which would be closed and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep and Martin Marietta Chairman Norman R. Augustine said Tuesday that the 
deal will reap hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. Such savings are 
typically achieved in mergers through the surgical removal of thousands of 
employees, though the executives insisted that a more efficient merged company 
would be more robust than their current operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three full factories are better than six half-full factories," Augustine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense industry executives were attempting to assess how the merger would 
change the stakes in the industry -- in particular, whether it would compel a 
new round of consolidations that would deprive Lockheed Martin of the advantage 
of size. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some experts dismissed the notion that size alone would give the new firm 
special clout in specific markets where it might not be bigger than any of its 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is treating this like General Motors and Ford are merging, but it 
is really two diversified manufacturers," said Robert Paulson, a McKinsey & Co. 
aerospace consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it is unlikely that Martin's technical prowess would give Lockheed's 
aircraft divisions an advantage when they compete with Northrop or McDonnell 
Douglas for a prime contract, some Pentagon officials wonder just what benefit 
the merger holds for the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big, but what else?" asked one defense procurement official. "The next 
step is for them to buy Utah." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep would not say specifically how the merger would cut costs, overhead and 
unused factory capacity. The only sector with obvious overlap between Lockheed 
and Martin is the satellite business. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harbison, an aerospace expert at Booz Allen & Hamilton, said the 
aerospace industry is not even close to the end of consolidations, because 
major players such as Boeing, Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas have 
yet to act. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger that caught everybody by surprise was born on a Saturday afternoon 
five months ago, Tellep said, when he decided to call Augustine and suggest 
that the firms merge on equal terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal got started just as Martin was backing away from a bidding war with 
Northrop for Grumman. Over the next several months, the two firms held a 
succession of detailed discussions, examining their products, technologies, 
facilities and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both firms had made major acquisitions in the past, neither had the sort 
of intense and unique culture for which aerospace firms such as Northrop and 
Hughes Aircraft have long been famous. But they did share common emphases as 
integrators of major high-technology systems, including some of the most 
sophisticated satellites used by the government. What resulted was an effort to 
construct a deal that would make neither company top dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep would be chief executive, but Augustine would succeed him. Lockheed's 
name would be first; Martin's headquarters would be the new main office. Two 
major sectors would be headed by Lockheed executives and two by Martin 
executives. Shares would be apportioned by a ratio that would preserve each set 
of shareholders' respective position in terms of their claims to future 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep and Augustine said the combined companies would generate $4 billion to 
$5 billion of free cash over the next five years. The merger would not add 
debt. And already, shareholders have reaped about $700 million in value: 
Lockheed shares surged $10.75 Tuesday to close at $76.75; Martin shares rose 50 
cents to close at $48.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Mapping Out a 
Merger 
</P>
<P>
 The new Lockheed Martin Marietta will be an aerospace giant, with 170,000 
employees and hundreds of facilities spread across more than 20 states. The new 
company will close Lockheed's headquarters in Calabasas. Overlapping space 
systems, satellite and electronics operations also are among the likely 
candidates for cut backs and consolidation. WHERE LOCKHEED AND MARTIN MARIETTA

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; RESULTS AS BOLD AS THE IDEA? TIME 
WILL TELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If giant corporations were interchangeable parts, the success of the big 
Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger would be assured. 
</P>
<P>
 But as even big companies are living organizations with distinct 
personalities, we'll have to wait two years or so to see if Lockheed and 
Martin's execution of their merger will be as bold as the concept that drove 
them together. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger results from forces driving the post-Cold War aerospace-defense 
industry, and it offers an insight into the complexity and importance of what 
is happening for companies, their employees and stockholders and for the 
military preparedness of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the industry has been changing since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 
and even before that, as fewer Pentagon contracts separated winners from losers 
among defense companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lockheed-Martin deal is a new order of magnitude, creating a company 
with $23 billion in sales. And coming only five months after the merger of 
Northrop and Grumman, it's only natural that the first question raised Tuesday 
was: Who's next? 
</P>
<P>
 Defense analysts in think tanks around Washington wondered aloud whether 
McDonnell Douglas, a giant itself with $14.7 billion in sales, 60% of them from 
defense, would need to seek a partner. The answer is not right away, but quick 
answers only hint at larger events. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense spending keeps going down, from 6% of the national economy in the 
mid-1980s, to 4% this year and 3% or so in the next few years -- levels not 
seen since the aftermath of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 As defense budgets diminish, so inevitably do the number of companies the 
budget can support. The Pentagon is cutting its roster of suppliers. "We are on 
a course to reduce the number of major contractors," Keith R. Hall, an 
assistant defense secretary, told Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was referring specifically to suppliers of military satellites -- and the 
Lockheed-Martin deal unites two major participants in that business. 
</P>
<P>
 Merger action in other defense fields is inevitable. "There are four 
helicopter makers -- McDonnell Douglas, the Sikorsky division of United 
Technologies, the Bell division of Textron and Boeing," says analyst Richard 
Bitzinger of the Defense Budget Project, a Washington research firm. "The 
Pentagon will want to winnow that to two suppliers at most." 
</P>
<P>
 But mergers achieve efficiencies only if company managements do the tough 
follow-up work of closing duplicate facilities -- combining departments, 
deciding on a single factory to do the work of two or more. And in that 
respect, Wall Street's reaction Tuesday to the Lockheed-Martin deal was 
revealing.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed stock shot up $10.75 a share, but Martin Marietta stock edged up only 
50 cents, after being down almost $2 a share earlier in the day. Wall Street's 
thinking is that Martin Marietta management, led by Chairman Norman Augustine, 
59, may not be able to realize the full potential of the merged Lockheed Martin 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The merged company, at 170,000 employees, initially will have lower sales per 
employee -- a measure of efficiency -- than other major defense firms. It will 
be imperative that operations be combined and employees be retired or laid off 
-- never a pleasant prospect but a necessary one if the business is to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, under Chairman Daniel Tellep, 62 -- who will lead the new company 
initially -- took tough measures in the last five years to whip itself into 
shape. It is one of four remaining military aircraft producers -- out of seven 
years ago -- and, with its fabled "Skunk Works," one of the world's premier 
aerospace technology organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge will be for Augustine to make hard choices at the more complex 
merged company, while preserving Lockheed's research capabilities. And some 
analysts are skeptical, claiming that Martin Marietta has been slow to achieve 
gains in efficiency from the General Electric aerospace business it acquired in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take two years to see how the merger works," says Robert Paulson, 
head of aerospace consulting for McKinsey & Co., "but it could be a much 
stronger company." 
</P>
<P>
 What does the creation of an industry behemoth mean to Lockheed Martin's 
competitors? For the answer, you have to define competitors product-line by 
product-line, say the experts. Even though Lockheed is an aircraft 
manufacturer, the new Lockheed Martin will be predominantly a defense 
electronics firm, says John Harbison, chief aerospace consultant for Booz, 
Allen & Hamilton. He's referring to both companies' satellite communications 
products, some of them top-secret.  
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is meaningful for McDonnell Douglas, which is mainly a fighter 
plane producer -- as well as a commercial airliner maker. The Lockheed Martin 
merger doesn't threaten McDonnell directly, although in the defense industry's 
battle for survival, the St. Louis-based company may have to form a partnership 
with Northrop Grumman or Boeing, the big commercial plane builder that keeps a 
hand in military production. 
</P>
<P>
 All this focus on mergers and partnerships underscores the fact that U.S. 
defense contracting, after 50 years of competitive bidding, is going back to 
the arsenal system that prevailed in World War II. In such a system, weapons 
are ordered by the Pentagon from lists of approved suppliers. It is to qualify 
for such lists that Lockheed, Martin and others are trying to get costs down by 
combining facilities and cutting back employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the Defense Department itself has not slimmed down. On the 
contrary, perhaps 500,000 of its roughly 1 million employees -- uniformed and 
civilian -- are still engaged in oversight work on fewer and fewer contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes you wonder, after all the mergers and consolidations, how 
efficient the arsenal of America will be.

HOUSE OF FABRICS DOUBLES RETREAT, WILL CLOSE 200 STORES THIS YEAR ; RETAILING: 
COMPANY POSTS $11.6-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS. CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE 25 STORES AND 
250 MOSTLY PART-TIME JOBS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House of Fabrics Inc., among the nation's largest fabric retailers and one 
that has been hurt by competition and the struggling California economy, said 
Tuesday that mounting losses will force it to close about 200 stores by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan more than doubles the scope of a retreat announced in November 
and will cost the 624-store, Sherman Oaks-based chain between $30 million and 
$40 million through closings, write-offs of improvements on leased properties 
and inventory liquidation, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will result in the closure of 25 stores in California and the loss of 
250 mostly part-time jobs in the state -- with half the store and job losses 
occurring in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Gary L. Larkins said in a statement that the closures are 
necessary because of "extremely difficult operating conditions in an 
over-stored industry, compounded by a sluggish economy in California." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it lost $11.6 million in the second quarter ended July 31, 
almost triple the quarterly loss of a year earlier. Sales tumbled 15% to $110 
million, from $129 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also disclosed that it is "in default of two of its financial 
covenants" and that it is negotiating with its bank lenders. House of Fabrics 
executives would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street frowned at the news. House of Fabrics' stock tumbled 50 cents to 
$2.125 a share, a 52-week low, on the New York Stock Exchange. The price was as 
high as $14.50 in 1993. In November, the company announced plans to close all 
105 of its mall outlets. About 30 of those have been shut down, and a write-off 
of $34.7 million for the closures contributed to a 1993 loss of $29.5 million 
on sales of $545 million. But the latest plan targets 125 of the chain's 
10,000-square-foot "super-stores." Most of the closures will take place in the 
Midwest and on the East Coast, said Jim Hartwig, executive vice president of 
store operations. But 25 of the chain's 160 California locations will also be 
closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 of the company's 12,000 mostly part-time jobs will be eliminated, 
Hartwig said, including 250 positions in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will be left with is our very best stores, and we plan to change the 
(inventory) mix in our stores to include more crafts and home decorating items, 
to appeal to a broader market," Hartwig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts were not surprised by House of Fabrics' plans, noting that 
fabric stores have been navigating dire straits since the 1970s, when many 
women entered the work force and had less time to sew. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition from clothing outlets that offer ready-made apparel at bargain 
prices has also cut into fabric stores' business. House of Fabrics has been hit 
particularly hard, analysts said, because much of its business is concentrated 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Simonson, an analyst with Kemper Securities in Chicago, said the 
$4-billion-a-year fabric industry is stable and that the bitter pill House of 
Fabrics is swallowing could ultimately restore its health. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very significant move on their part; this is not rearranging the 
deck chairs," Simonson said. "House of Fabrics is certainly worth fixing." 
</P>
<P>
 The first House of Fabrics store opened in 1946 on Wilshire Boulevard. 
Co-founder and longtime Chairman David Sofro took the company public in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, Sofro bought out a number of competitors, including the 
23-store Southern California competitor Home Silk Shop in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits continued to grow into the early 1990s and House of Fabrics ranked 
among the nation's largest fabric retailers. But in 1992 the bubble burst, as 
recession prompted fierce price wars among fabric retailers, Simonson said. 
House of Fabrics' net income dropped to $5.2 million, down 73% from a year 
earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinball, it seems, is still profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when "Super Streetfighter 2" and sophisticated virtual reality games 
are all the rage at the video arcade, Sega Enterprises Ltd. plans to acquire 
Chicago-based Data East Pinball, the world's second-largest pinball maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Sega, the $4-billion Japanese video 
game giant that has built a reputation as a cutting-edge interactive 
entertainment firm, said in a news release that pinball machines "continue to 
be a dominant element in the amusement arcade industry." AMY HARMON

 General Signal, Reliance Electric to Merge: General Signal Corp., seeking 
critical mass to compete globally in the industrial equipment market, has 
agreed to acquire Reliance Electric Co. of Cleveland in a stock swap valued at 
about $1.4 billion.The transaction gives Stamford, Conn.-based General Signal 
access to Reliance's fledgling fiber-optics business. Telephone companies need 
fiber optics and other digital equipment to upgrade their networks and compete 
with cable television along the information superhighway. Wall Street painted 
the merger as a good fit. Both companies have been making industrial equipment 
since 1904.

 China Leads in Drawing Foreign Investment: According to a U.N. report, China 
has surpassed all other developing countries and trails only the United States 
in attracting investment capital from major international companies.A record 
$80 billion was poured into developing countries in 1993 and China got $26 
billion of that, according to the report. China has the world's fastest-growing 
economy. It was second only to the United States, which received $32 billion in 
foreign investments last year.

 Wireless Auction Bidding Under Probe: The Federal Communications Commission 
said it is investigating whether one or more bidders may have misrepresented 
themselves in recent auctions of licenses offering interactive television over 
the airwaves.The agency said the bidders may have presented themselves as 
"designated entities," a status that entitled entrepreneurs, minorities and 
women to win licenses with lower bids. Also, one or more winners may have 
failed to meet the down payment deadlines for the licenses and may have 
encouraged other buyers to default on their payments, the FCC said. The agency 
noted that when it adopted the rules for the government's first airwaves 
auctions, it warned it would impose severe penalties for abusing the system.

 Study of Cellular Phone Risks Revised: Cellular telephone users may be exposed 
to greater levels of potentially dangerous electromagnetic energy than 
previously thought, according to revised figures from Om Ghandi, a researcher 
at the University of Utah.He recalculated data from an earlier study of 10 
cellular phones and found higher levels of electromagnetic energy than were 
originally reported. Lawsuits have alleged a connection between cellular phone 
use and some forms of brain cancer. A spokesman for the Washington-based 
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. said that, even using the revised 
data, the amount of electromagnetic energy emitted falls within established 
safety guidelines.

 Survey Challenges Conventional View of Home PC Market: Only 27% of the 
nation's households have personal computers, according to a market report that 
challenges conventional wisdom about the size and growth of the PC consumer 
market. It is widely believed in the computer industry that PCs are now in 
about a third of the 96 million U.S. households.The study, conducted by a 
relatively new research firm called Odyssey, relied on a phone survey rather 
than the manufacturers' sales data typically used. Nick Donatiello, president 
of the San Francisco firm, said the survey's random sampling of 1,500 
households probably produced a more accurate measurement of home PC use. It 
tried to allow for multiple PCs in some homes and replacement purchases, he 
said.

 Pilgrim CEO Relinquishes One Post: Palomba Weingarten, who chairs Century 
City-based mutual fund firm Pilgrim Group and its distribution arm Pilgrim 
Distributors, named James Ash to be chief executive of the latter. Weingarten 
faces a one-year ban on her association with the distribution unit since a 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers panel found that she had approved Pilgrim 
ads containing "misleading or exaggerated statements" about fund 
performance.The ban, recommended on May 13, is being appealed to a national 
NASD committee. Ash had been president of the distribution unit, which deals 
with the independent brokers who sell Pilgrim funds. Weingarten remains CEO of 
the parent company. Pilgrim also announced that it will voluntarily file its 
ads with the NASD before they are published.

entirely in stock, Scott spokeswoman Greta L. Thomsen said. Scott has 11 
directors and only two of them work for the company. Pending shareholder 
approval, the nine outside members will receive 1,000 shares annually.

 UnionFed May Sell Thrift Unit: UnionFed Financial Corp. in Brea is thinking of 
selling troubled Union Federal Bank, according to a letter to an investor from 
Chairman and Chief Executive David S. Engleman.Sale of the thrift is one option 
"as we pursue a resolution that will maximize shareholder value," Engleman 
wrote Hamid Boroumand, a bond analyst with the investment firm M.L. Stern & Co. 
in Beverly Hills, in a letter dated Friday. UnionFed disclosed Aug. 4 in its 
annual earnings report that it no longer meets regulatory capital requirements 
and is under increased scrutiny from the Office of Thrift Supervision. The 
thrift has $918.9 million in assets, $841.9 million in deposits and 14 branches 
in Orange County.

 American Airlines to Reduce Headquarters Staff: The nation's largest carrier 
in terms of revenue said it will reduce its headquarters staff as part of a 
program to lower costs. The job cuts, which have yet to be determined, will be 
another step in the airline's campaign to save $750 million in annual labor 
costs and become more competitive with low-fare challengers such as Southwest 
Airlines Co.American, a unit of AMR Corp., said it is looking to save an 
additional $250 million a year in other parts of its operations. About 10,000 
of American's 90,000 employees work at the headquarters near the Dallas-Ft. 
Worth airport. A study over the next five months, conducted by an outside 
consultant, will determine the extent of the cuts, American said.

 Stock prices rose Tuesday for the sixth time in seven trading sessions, 
spurred by renewed takeover activity and by a mild bond market rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials gained 18.45 points to 3,917.30, the index's first 
close above 3,900 since Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were encouraged that the rally broadened Tuesday after stalling 
somewhat Monday. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks rose 3.25 
points to 766.45, a 0.4% gain that was nearly equal to the Dow's advance. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, rising issues topped losers by 13 to 8; volume 
totaled an active 295 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks began their ascent early in the session, as bond yields eased after the 
Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to 89.0 in August 
from a revised 91.3 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidence index offered further proof that the economy's momentum is 
slowing. The stock market's rally since last Wednesday has been built on such 
data, on the assumption that more moderate growth will avert the need for 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanced against the drop in confidence was a report Tuesday showing that 
sales of new single-family houses surged 8.3% in July, the largest gain since 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 But that report failed to spook bond traders, and yields finished the day 
modestly lower. The 30-year Treasury bond yield slipped to 7.46% from Monday's 
7.49%. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. bonds were also helped as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased 
as much as $6 billion of Treasury securities to pump currency into the banking 
system, in a routine transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, bonds' strength added to positive sentiment 
fueled by takeovers, real and imagined. A deal to combine Lockheed and Martin 
Marietta sent defense stocks surging, while drug giant Warner-Lambert soared 7% 
on renewed takeover talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the world is out there saying there will be more (mergers) in 
health care and more in defense," said Robert Von Pentz, chief investment 
officer at Riggs Investment Management. 
</P>
<P>
 On a technical front, analysts note that many "short" sellers who had 
previously sold borrowed stock, betting on further price declines, must now 
cover their bets by buying stock in the open market -- or risk unlimited losses 
if the rally continues. Such buying can help fuel the market's gains.

NEW HOME SALES UP 8.3%, BUT SLOWING SEEN; ECONOMY: WEST SEES A 6.5% GAIN IN 
JULY, BUT REBOUND IS STILL WELL BELOW DECEMBER'S PEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 New home sales rebounded in July, but analysts said the trend is for slower 
growth in a sector of the economy that is particularly sensitive to rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 New home sales surged 8.3% last month, the government said Tuesday, and the 
rates for May and June were revised upward. Still, the June level was a 
15-month low, and the July sales were well below December's peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales rose 6.5% in the West, which includes California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The July rebound is making up some ground, given the huge drop in June," said 
economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "The basic message 
is we've passed over the top of the market and we've begun to descend. But 
there's no reason to believe it will be precipitous." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Conference Board said its widely followed survey shows that 
consumer confidence in the economy dropped in August for the second straight 
month. The index fell to 89.0 from a revised reading of 91.3 in July and 92.5 
in June, which was the highest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agreed that the five increases in interest rates by the Federal 
Reserve Board since February are taking a toll on the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we're showing the effects of rising interest rates," said Jim Irvine 
of the National Assn. of Home Builders. "If they continue to rise, we'll have 
significant problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said sales of 
new homes, which declined a revised 11.4% in June, totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 664,000 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 All regions of the country except the Midwest benefited from last month's 
recovery, which most analysts had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The June rate was revised to 613,000, up from an initial estimate of 591,000. 
Still, the higher figure was the lowest level since the rate was 600,000 in 
March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual rate for new home sales peaked in December at 817,000 in response 
to the lowest mortgage rates in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government previously reported that sales of existing homes slipped 
slightly in July but that construction of new homes was up from June. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 8.62% in July, up from 8.43% in June 
and 8.6% in May. Rates hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, according to the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Rates averaged 8.56% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's nearly two-percentage-point increase adds about $200 to the 
monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said the greater availability of adjustable-rate mortgages 
is blunting the impact of higher rates by allowing buyers to pay less in the 
first years of new home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monthly carrying costs have not risen in the near term," said Eugene Sherman 
of M.A. Schapiro & Co. in New York. "Adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for 
15% to 20% of mortgages prior to February and now they're at 45% to 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 The July rebound may also have been helped by a drop in prices. The median 
price of a new home declined to $123,000, down 6.1% from $131,000 in June. The 
median is the midpoint, meaning half the homes cost more and half cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said sales of homes during the first seven months of 1994 were 
6.6% above the same period last year. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new 
houses for sale at the end of July was 314,000, representing a supply of 5.8 
months at the current sales rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, sales rose 17% in the South, to a 289,000 annual rate. They were 
up 9.8% in the Northeast to a 56,000 rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales rose in the West to a 198,000 rate. Sales declined 6.2% in the Midwest 
to a 121,000 rate.

PG&E TO CUT UP TO 3,000 MORE JOBS; ENERGY: UTILITY SAYS MOVE WILL HELP IT 
COMPETE AGAINST EXPECTED NEW BREED OF PROVIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hard on the heels of massive job cuts last year, supervisors at Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co., the big San Francisco-based utility, told employees Tuesday that 
another 2,500 to 3,000 jobs will be slashed beginning in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other California utilities, PG&E is cutting costs to become competitive 
with new electricity providers that are expected to enter the fray under 
free-market reforms proposed by the state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects most of this quota to be met by voluntary 
severance, spurred by enhanced incentives that have yet to be announced. It 
projects annual labor savings of $150 million to $185 million when the cuts are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 of the cuts will be made in the utility's Customer Energy Services 
unit, which now employees 14,000. Another 800 jobs will be eliminated at power 
plants and in administration. With more cuts to be announced in the next few 
weeks, the total work force will be reduced to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, the utility announced a companywide restructuring that 
resulted in the elimination of 3,000 jobs by the end of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 23, PG&E Chief Executive Stanley T. Skinner announced cost-cutting 
measures ranging from an employee wage freeze to a 5% cut in pay for himself 
and PG&E Chairman Richard A. Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really concerned," said Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward 
Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco, who 
complained that the utility is cutting too many service jobs and not enough 
higher-ranking positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of getting rid of those folks, they're getting rid of people who 
actually give service to consumers," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said PG&E could become more competitive by closing its Diablo Canyon 
nuclear facility and cutting staff attorneys and lobbyists.

THE LOCKHEED-MARTIN MERGER; PROFILE: DANIEL TELLEP; CEO GUIDED LOCKHEED IN 
TRYING TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It took the biggest merger in the history of the aerospace industry to get 
Daniel M. Tellep to finally change companies after 39 years. The 62-year-old 
chief executive of Lockheed Corp. was officially named CEO of the new Lockheed 
Martin Corp. as part of the merger with Martin Marietta announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep took control in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War 
ended, and analysts credit him with guiding Lockheed through the turbulence 
that has rocked the defense industry in the intervening years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite dwindling U.S. outlays for defense, Lockheed's profits have climbed 
steadily over the past three years, with the company earning $422 million in 
1993 on sales of $13.1 billion. Its stock price has nearly doubled since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process of endearing himself to many of Lockheed's biggest 
shareholders, he, like other defense CEOs, took a meat-ax to the work force. 
Lockheed's California payroll, which numbered almost 40,000 at the start of 
1988, has been nearly halved through layoffs and transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep's efforts to diversify away from the defense business have also met 
with only limited success. For example, Lockheed's commercial aircraft 
refurbishing unit at now-deactivated Norton Air Force Base was forced to close 
earlier this year for lack of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellep would not say much about his plans for the new company Tuesday, adding 
that a study is under way to determine what lines of business it should pursue 
and where possible staff reductions could be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts aren't sure how long Tellep may decide to stay on. An avid 
tennis player who also jogs and relaxes by flying gliders and painting, he 
appears to be in fine physical shape. But some analysts speculate that Tellep 
may leave sooner to clear the way for Norman Augustine, 59, the Martin Marietta 
chief executive who has already been picked to succeed Tellep when he retires. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Tuesday news conference, Tellep said he will retire within three years. 
But an insider at the company said his retirement could come as early as next 
year. Daniel M. Tellep 
</P>
<P>
 Born: Nov. 20, 1931, in Forest City, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hometown: Calabasas  
</P>
<P>
 Education: Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, UC Berkeley, 1954; 
master's in mechanical engineering, UC Berkeley, 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Career highlights: Joined Lockheed Missiles & Space Systems as a scientist in 
1955. Became vice president in 1983 and president in 1986. Was named chairman 
and chief executive of parent Lockheed Corp. in 1989. Last year engineered the 
$1.5-billion purchase of General Dynamics' military aircraft operations, an 
acquisition that made Lockheed the world's biggest builder of fighter planes. 
Has also tried to diversify the company into other businesses, such as airport 
management and information services, but with limited success.

 Lockheed Corp.'s roots go back to the earliest days of aviation. Like all of 
Southern California's aerospace companies, it grew dramatically during World 
War II. But it needed a federal bailout in the early 1970s and suffered the 
collapse of its commercial airliner business in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 1913: Auto mechanic Allan Loughhead (pronounced Lockheed) and his brother 
Malcolm build and fly their first aircraft, a seaplane, over San Francisco Bay. 
They establish Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Co. 
</P>
<P>
 1916: After Alco fails, the brothers set up the Loughhead Aircraft 
Manufacturing Co. in Santa Barbara with designer Jack Northrop. Later, the 
brothers adopt the name Lockheed, apparently to avoid having their original 
name mispronounced.  
</P>
<P>
 1927: Introduction of the Vega plane, which Amelia Earhart uses in a solo 
flight across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 1929: Allan Loughhead sells his interest in the company after losing control 
to Detroit Aircraft Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 1932: Detroit Aircraft files for bankruptcy and sells Lockheed to Boston 
bankers for $40,000.  
</P>
<P>
 1933: The Electra passenger plane becomes a popular model, flown by Pan 
American World Airways and Northwest Airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 1938: Company enters military business after designing the Hudson bomber for 
the British Royal Air Force in only five days. More than 3,000 are built. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II: Lockheed builds nearly 20,000 planes for the military, including 
the P-38 Lightning interceptor and the C-69 Constellation transport. Famed 
design and research plant in Burbank, the "Skunk Works," builds prototypes of 
the nation's first jet fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
 1953: Missiles and space division created to make satellites and 
submarine-launched missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 1959: Electra turboprop commercial airliner is introduced, but two planes 
crash shortly after rollout and production is halted two years later. In 
separate incidents, 175 Shooting Star fighter jets sold to West Germany crash, 
killing 85 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Early 1960s: Company designs and builds huge transports, including the C-130 
Hercules and C-5 Galaxy, as well as the U-2 spy plane.  
</P>
<P>
 1969: Loss of $32 million posted; company tells the government that four 
military projects are in danger unless it gets a $700-million bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 1970: Launch of L-1011 TriStar passenger jet, which is plagued with equipment 
problems and poor sales.  
</P>
<P>
 1971: Government saves Lockheed after Congress agrees to guarantee $250 
million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 1975: Congressional investigators find that Lockheed had paid $25.5 million in 
bribes to foreign officials, including former Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei 
Tanaka.  
</P>
<P>
 1976: Chief Executive Daniel Haughton and President Carl Kotchian resign amid 
bribery scandal. Former New York Stock Exchange President Robert Haak is 
brought in to restructure company as interim CEO. Later, Vice President 
Lawrence Kitchen is named president and chief financial officer. Roy A. 
Anderson becomes new CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 1981: Poor sales lead to the demise of TriStar program. About 250 were built. 
</P>
<P>
 1983: Tanaka is sentenced to four years in jail for accepting $2-million 
Lockheed bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 1988: Company closes factory in Watts, built in the aftermath of the Watts 
Riots.

 January, 1990: Investor and Texas billionaire Harold Simmons launches fight to 
win control of the board following the company's poor financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
 December, 1990: Simmons' $1.6-billion takeover offer is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 December, 1992: Company acquires General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 fighter 
division in Texas for $1.5 billion.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; ROBOLOBSTER TO THE RESEARCH RESCUE!

 Lobsters are remarkably adept at detecting a chemical and then following it to 
its source. That's how they track down mussels even through the underwater 
turbulence that breaks the chemical up into irregular patches of varying 
concentrations. A robot that mimics the lobster's remarkable tracking could 
have a number of scientific and commercial applications: finding underwater 
vents, tracking fish, locating an underwater oil leak or studying red tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Consi, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant research 
engineer, has created a Robolobster to study how the lobster processes the 
chemical information it receives. The nine-inch device consists of a plastic 
cylinder containing a computer, motor drivers and sensor electronics. Powered 
by 16 AA batteries and mounted atop two wheels, the robot, though it looks 
nothing like a lobster, can approximate its speed and turning skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Consi and his collaborator, Jella Atema, the director of Boston University's 
marine program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, will outfit 
Robolobster with various sensor designs and computer algorithms until they find 
the most lobster-like ones. These hypotheses can then be tested on the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Speed-of-Light Computing: Scientists have long realized that there are 
inherent limits to how fast electronic computers can work. In part, this is due 
to the limited speed of the electrons that carry information through a 
computer's circuitry. Devices based not on electrons but on pulses of light 
theoretically could overcome these limits and perform calculations a million 
times faster than today's fastest supercomputer.  
</P>
<P>
 In a report in the Aug. 26 issue of the journal Science, scientists at the 
Institute of Polymers and Organic Solids at UC Santa Barbara announced the 
development of just such a device: an extremely high-speed optical processor. 
So how fast is it? In one trial run, the processor was able to compare very 
similar drawings of three early U.S. presidents and detect their difference in 
just a tenth of a trillionth of a second -- perhaps the fastest calculation 
ever performed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the optical image processor is a new synthetic polymer that 
reacts to even extremely slight fluctuations in a beam of light by doubling or 
even tripling its frequency. Called poly (1,6-heptadiester), the polymer is 
chemically stable at ordinary temperatures and relatively easy to manufacture. 
For now, the device is not a full-fledged computer but is designed to perform 
one or more tasks very quickly. But the scientists' work could lead to an 
all-optical computer that could perform pattern-recognition tasks with the same 
alacrity as the human eye and brain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Potassium Please, but Hold the Salt: Plants thrive on potassium but choke on 
sodium. Biologists at UC San Diego, believe they may have found a way to 
genetically engineer crops that more efficiently take up potassium from the 
soil and allow plants to grow in soils containing high levels of salt or other 
toxic material. 
</P>
<P>
 The biologists have isolated a gene in plants that controls the transport 
pathway for potassium nutrition. Now they believe they can find out whether it 
is possible to engineer this gene to improve plants' ability to take up 
potassium, to cut the need for fertilizer containing potassium. But while the 
gene selectively takes potassium, measurable quantities of sodium are also 
accumulated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the western San Joaquin Valley and other parts of the world where 
irrigation is frequently used, 20% to 50% of agricultural land has become 
almost useless because of high sodium levels. Whether the isolated gene 
contributes to sodium accumulation -- and whether plants can be engineered to 
feast on potassium while avoiding salt -- are questions that can now be 
addressed, the researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Birds and Blades: The government, which seems to have specifications for 
everything from ashtrays to toilet seats, also has a specification for bird 
ingestion by jet turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration requires 
that every aircraft engine be certified to maintain a specified power 
capability after ingesting "medium-sized birds." In the case of GE Aircraft 
Engines' newest engine, the GE90, this means the ability to ingest up to four 
birds weighing 2 1/2 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the GE90 is the first large commercial turbofan that uses fan blades 
made of a high-strength composite rather than conventional metal alloys, GE has 
signed a cooperative research and development agreement with Los Alamos 
National Laboratory to come up with a computer model to be sure the fan blade 
and the case that houses it can meet FAA requirements.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; TIPS FOR NEW COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Anyone going off to college these days will need access to a computer. But you 
don't necessarily have to buy a new one, especially if you already have a home 
PC that you can bring along. Another option is to use one of the school's 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many colleges offer public computer labs where students can use PCs or Macs 
for little or no cost. These labs are typically located in the center of campus 
but are sometimes in dorms, libraries or individual academic departments. Many 
labs also offer access to high-speed laser printers, but there may be a charge 
per page. 
</P>
<P>
 If you might be using a lab computer, ask what is done to protect users from 
contracting a software virus. The threat of such an infection to individual PC 
users is often exaggerated, but it can be a real problem when using a shared 
computer. The campus computer center staff can help you avoid the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 If you already have a PC -- even an older one -- there is a good chance it 
will be adequate for school needs. Just about any computer is OK for writing 
papers or plugging in a modem so you can connect to the school's central 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are advantages to having the latest and greatest. But if you 
do decide to buy a new machine, be sure to do some research to find out which 
one is best for your studies. And before buying, check to see if the campus 
store offers special deals on hardware and software. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few schools require a specific type of computer, but on some campuses 
there is a preferred type used by most students. Being in sync with what's 
popular on campus means it will be easier to get help from fellow students and 
faculty as well as access to data files and software programs.  
</P>
<P>
 The preferred machine varies not only by campus but also by department. 
Graphic arts departments are likely to encourage Macintosh use and business 
schools are more inclined to use IBM-compatibles, but there are exceptions, so 
don't jump to conclusions. A visit or phone call to your department or the 
school's academic computing center is advised before buying a new computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first decision is whether to go for an IBM-compatible PC or an Apple 
Macintosh. I used to think that Macs were the most popular machines for 
undergraduates, but that's not necessarily true. A recent UCLA survey found 
that 68% of the students have computers and that about 60% of those are 
IBM-compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Worth, manager of the UCLA microcomputer support office, prefers that 
students have either Macs or PCs that can run Windows; they're easier to 
support and to connect to the campus network. However, many students, he 
acknowledges, come to campus with old 286 PCs -- fine for word processing and 
other basic tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Brown, director of UCLA's Health Policy Research Center, gives 
different advice depending on who's asking. When it came to his own daughter, a 
student at University of California, Santa Cruz, he bought a Macintosh "because 
it is easy to use." For graduate students and staff working in his program, he 
recommends a PC with Windows because "it will be easier to exchange files with 
other computers in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when campus bookstores sold machines at far below retail 
prices, but these days the difference won't be all that remarkable. If you're 
buying an IBM-compatible machine, you're likely to get as good a deal or better 
on the open market, but check first. 
</P>
<P>
 Macs are a different story. The Stanford University bookstore, for example, 
offers the Macintosh Quadra 630 with 4 megabytes of RAM and a 250-megabyte hard 
disk for $1,086. The same machine costs about $1,259 at retail stores. 
Nevertheless, it still pays to shop around and watch for sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely check the campus store before you buy software. Many campuses have 
negotiated site license arrangements with software firms that allow them to 
sell programs to students and staff at substantially reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Notebook computers are ideal for some students because they can be carried to 
class for note taking or used at the library, coffee shop or a friend's dorm 
room. Be careful, though. But notebooks are also easily lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get a notebook, consider one that accommodates an external monitor, 
keyboard and mouse for use in the dorm room. Leading notebook computer makers 
include Apple, Dell, IBM, Compaq and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also need a modem to log on to the campus computer system, unless your 
dorm happens to be wired for a direct connection. If you get a modem, your best 
bet is a 14,400-bit-per-second data-fax modem. I've seen IBM-compatible, 
internal 14,400 bps modems for as little as $60. High-speed external modems 
start at about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have access to the Internet, there is a good chance the college or 
university has an on-line menu (called "gopher") that you can access from any 
Internet provider even if you're away from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In each case, I was able to find information about campus computer resources, 
including hardware and software that students can buy or borrow. You can also 
use the Internet to check library catalogues and, in some cases, course 
listings. Internet gophers are organized geographically, so once you learn to 
use the system, it's easy to find your way around.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the Internet, electronic mail is a great way for parents and 
friends to communicate with college students. Many universities offer free 
Internet accounts to students, which means it will cost them nothing to send or 
receive mail.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; WILTEL 'PIPE DREAM' IS 
NOW A MODEL; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: OKLAHOMA ENERGY COMPANY'S INGENUITY PAYS OFF 
IN $2.5-BILLION SALE OF SUBSIDIARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When an Oklahoma energy company began stringing fiber-optic cables inside 
abandoned natural gas pipelines a decade ago to take on the big phone 
companies, many dismissed the notion as a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams Co. is having the last laugh. The Tulsa-based company recently 
struck a deal to sell its telecom subsidiary, WilTel, to rival LDDS 
Communications for a tidy $2.5 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of WilTel is a classic case of new technology opening dramatic -- if 
not always obvious -- opportunities for a well-run, forward-thinking company to 
diversify. A host of others, especially electric utility firms, are now taking 
a page from WilTel's book, but they will be hard-pressed to repeat its success. 
</P>
<P>
 WilTel's saga begins in 1984. Roy Wilkens, president of Williams Co.'s 
pipeline subsidiary, assigned a task force that year to look for new ways to 
use thousands of miles of pipeline that had been decommissioned because of 
sluggish demand. Wilkens, an electrical engineer by training, was intrigued by 
a proposal to string telephone lines through the pipes to upgrade the company's 
internal communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Further study showed that the idea didn't make financial sense. But having 
recently returned from a Harvard University program for mid-career executives 
fired up with entrepreneurial enthusiasm, Wilkens came up with a bolder idea 
that did make sense. He asked Williams' board in 1985 for $200 million to 
string high-capacity fiber-optic lines as the backbone for a new communications 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics scoffed, and consultants advised Williams against making the risky 
move. "People said, 'How can a bunch of damn pipeliners compete with the likes 
of AT&T?' " Wilkens recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The company went ahead with the plan. But Wilkens was asked to take some risks 
of his own. He stepped down as president of the pipeline company and took six 
employees with him to start WilTel. 
</P>
<P>
 Laying the fiber was simple. Crews attached a line to a "pig," a cylindrical 
device used for maintenance, that traveled through the pipe. The line was used 
to haul the fiber through the pipe. WilTel discovered it could lay fiber at 
half the cost of Sprint and AT&T, which had to pay for use of rights of way 
along railroads and highways, then dig trenches to install the fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a brilliant idea," says Ashok Rao, president of Midi-Com, a 
Seattle-based long-distance company and one of WilTel's biggest customers. "In 
the early days, Sprint's line kept getting broken. Here was a line that was 
cheap and secured by steel pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 WilTel completed much of its western network in early 1987, becoming the first 
company to string optic fiber into Los Angeles. Where it couldn't use its own 
pipelines, it purchased lines from others or leased rights of way and built new 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 When WilTel acquired an 1800s-vintage oil pipeline to extend fiber cable to 
New York, "the owners thought they were pulling the pants over some silly 
Oklahoma boys," one Williams Co. executive recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill out its network, WilTel acquired other regional long-distance 
companies that had popped up on the East Coast. Williams' willingness to 
quickly approve money for such deals enabled WilTel to out-maneuver 
competitors, often closing deals in as little as 10 days, Wilkens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Building an infrastructure wasn't a problem for a company that had built 
27,000 miles of pipeline. And long-distance companies such as MCI that leased 
capacity from WilTel to supplement their internal networks loved WilTel's new 
system. But the more profitable business of selling communications services 
directly to large national firms was another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a large financial institution with 2,000 people processing checks 
in the back room, do you want to trust your business to WilTel? A lot of people 
felt safer with AT&T," Wilkens says. 
</P>
<P>
 To impress customers, Wilkens packed the company's headquarters with high-tech 
wonders, including a multimedia conference room in which the touch of a button 
would turn the windows opaque, raise a podium and prepare the conference table 
with special computer screens for presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to show we were a technology leader," Wilkens says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkens also took on challenging jobs. In 1990, WilTel became the first to 
carry a television broadcast over a fiber-optic network when it transmitted 
coverage of the Super Bowl from New Orleans to New York for CBS. The deal lost 
the company $30,000 but helped it win long-term agreements with every major 
network in the country. It now has fiber-optic connections to virtually every 
baseball and football stadium in the country to "backhaul" images to New York 
television studios. 
</P>
<P>
 WilTel's success has become a wake-up call to power companies. "It's caught 
everyone's attention," one power company executive says. "You can't help but 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Power companies across the country have already installed some 10,000 miles of 
fiber optics for their own internal use, but they have been slow to take 
advantage of either the huge excess capacity on their fiber or the rights of 
way they have established into virtually every home in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Co. of Atlanta, for example, has a 2,000-mile fiber-optic network 
used to connect Southern's power stations to computers that determine where 
power should be generated and distributed. Paul DeNicola, executive vice 
president at Southern, says the company could save huge sums by extending its 
network into individual homes in joint ventures with cable and phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone and cable companies would use the network to offer such services as 
video on demand. Southern would use the network to collect detailed information 
on power usage so it could vary electricity rates by the hour to discourage 
electricity use during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rivkin, a communications lawyer who has long championed a more 
aggressive role by utilities in the communications business, thinks the huge 
savings of power companies from such systems will be instrumental in financing 
the construction of the much touted information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 MPX Systems, a subsidiary of Columbus, S.C.-based utility Scana Corp., also 
has 2,000 miles of fiber strung throughout the Southeast and is adding new 
lines as fast as it can. MPX takes down the ground wire that is installed along 
the top of power transmission towers and telephone poles to prevent lightning 
from disrupting power lines. A new fiber-optic line is strung atop the towers 
instead, acting both as a ground wire and a communications line. 
</P>
<P>
 MPX has sold its unused fiber capacity to WilTel and AT&T but wants to follow 
WilTel up the value chain. "We plan to take a hard look at cable, PCS (personal 
communications services) and interactive television," says Mike Blackwell, 
executive vice president at MPX. 
</P>
<P>
 With a host of other companies competing for the same market, the going will 
be tough. But Blackwell takes courage from WilTel's pioneering moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could have prophesied their success," he says.

LOCKHEED UNIT UNSURE OF ITS PLACE IN MERGER; BUSINESS: CALCOMP WORKERS ARE NOT 
PANICKING, BUT ANAHEIM IS TAKING NOTICE -- IT WANTS THE COMPANY TO STAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Though the climate was calm Tuesday at CalComp Inc., winds of change were 
stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of the Anaheim maker of computer peripherals learned that parent 
company Lockheed plans to merge with Martin Marietta to form a giant aerospace 
company, and they don't know just how they will fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of premature to talk about it," CalComp spokesman Richard Stehr 
said. In fact, the merger agreement was hardly even a topic of conversation 
around the plant Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But around town, business leaders were taking notice. With a work force of 
700, CalComp is one of Anaheim's largest employers, and its closure or 
relocation from the city would be a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Farano, president of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said CalComp is 
just the kind of business the city would like to keep -- a manufacturer that 
provides a large number of good jobs. The city would be willing to work with 
the parent company, he said, to ensure that CalComp stays put. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is a profitable competitor in the growing market for computer 
graphics printers and plotters, CalComp may be insulated from economic 
pressures in the aerospace industry to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly not in the short term is there going to be any difference" under 
Lockheed Martin, as the new company would be called, Stehr said. "We operate 
fairly autonomously." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to now, the computer peripherals business has not been hit as hard as other 
segments of the defense industry by budget cutbacks. It has had some 
reductions, though. CalComp's work force in Anaheim is half the size it was a 
decade ago, Stehr said, as the company has contracted out work such as quality 
control that is now done by suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University in Orange, predicted that 
CalComp will stay in the Lockheed Martin fold unless it falters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would love to put money in CalComp as long as they see it as the state 
of the art," Adibi said.

TROUBLED THRIFT UNION FEDERAL MAY BE SOLD; FINANCE: BREA-BASED INSTITUTION'S 
PARENT COMPANY WEIGHS OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE VALUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent company of Union Federal Bank is thinking about selling the 
troubled thrift, according to a letter sent by the board chairman to an 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Engleman, chairman and chief executive of UnionFed Financial Corp., 
wrote in a letter dated Friday that directors of the Brea-based institution are 
considering a sale as one option "as we pursue a resolution that will maximize 
shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed disclosed Aug. 4 in its annual earnings report that it no longer 
meets regulatory capital requirements and is under increased scrutiny by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurt by bad real estate loans, the company posted a loss of $26.5 million for 
its fiscal year ended June 30. That compared to a loss of $32.1 million for the 
previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed's stock price dropped to a 52-week low of 25 cents a share the day 
after the earnings report was issued. It has since recovered somewhat, closing 
Tuesday at 63 cents a share, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
Earlier this year, however, the stock was trading at more than $2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Engleman's letter was in response to an inquiry about the company's future by 
Hamid Boroumand, a bond analyst with the investment firm M.L. Stern & Co. in 
Beverly Hills. Boroumand said he wrote Engleman as a private investor and that 
his inquiry was unrelated to his work at Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Boroumand said he estimates that a sale of UnionFed would fetch about $54 
million. "When a lot of financial institutions are consolidating," he said 
Tuesday, "it would be hard for a small one to survive without consolidating." 
</P>
<P>
 Engleman did not return calls Tuesday seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A top executive with the investment advisory company that is UnionFed's 
second-largest shareholder said the company, given its financial difficulty, 
would be wise to consider a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have any other choice than to investigate these options," 
said Robert Rodriguez, senior vice president of First Pacific Advisors Inc. in 
Los Angeles, which holds 5% of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy is improving for thrifts, but UnionFed may not have sufficient 
capital to hold on, Rodriguez said. "There's a value in the company and value 
in the franchise," he said, that would make it attractive to a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift has $918.9 million in assets, $841.9 million in deposits and 14 
branches in Orange County. UnionFed Under Scrutiny 
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed Financial Corp.'s board is considering selling the company. Though 
the company has assets of more than $900 million, its stock price has been 
declining steadily since the beginning of the year. UnionFed's stock dropped 
sharply when it announced earlier this month that it no longer meets federal 
capital requirements. Monthly closing prices: 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's close: $0.63 
</P>
<P>

NEWPORT ACCELERATES EFFORT TO KEEP MERCEDES DEALERSHIP; RETAIL: FLETCHER JONES 
MOTORCARS, THE CITY'S LARGEST GENERATOR OF SALES TAX REVENUE, PLANS TO LEAVE 
SITE WHEN LEASE EXPIRES IN 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Newport Beach has stepped up its efforts to prevent one of its 
most prominent residents from moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher Jones Motorcars, one of the nation's largest Mercedes-Benz 
dealerships, has made no secret of the fact that it will move out of the former 
Jim Slemons lot when its lease expires in December, 1996. Should Fletcher Jones 
leave town, Newport Beach stands to lose its single largest generator of sales 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach City Manager Kevin J. Murphy would not disclose the amount that 
Fletcher Jones pays to the city annually in sales taxes. However, the total is 
significant enough that the city is prepared to do whatever it can to keep 
Fletcher Jones, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also lucrative enough that the neighboring city of Irvine has been in 
contact with the dealership to brief the company on its zoning laws and other 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach appears to have the edge, though. The city has been working with 
Irvine Co., Orange County's largest landowner, to facilitate the sale of a 
parcel that would fit the particular needs stated by Fletcher Jones Jr., owner 
of the dealership. It has also been lobbying both the city and the state to 
alter the zoning restrictions now on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has said the lot that the dealership now leases on Quail Street is no 
longer adequate. The company is seeking a site that it could buy on or near a 
major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, such places in Newport Beach are few. "There are a limited 
number of sites in Newport that are large enough, near major streets or have 
good visibility that would work for them," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are now focusing on a parcel of land owned by Irvine Co. near the 
intersection of Jamboree Road and Bristol Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn McCormick, spokeswoman for Irvine Co., confirmed Tuesday that Fletcher 
Jones and the city of Newport Beach have been negotiating, and that Irvine Co. 
would be interested in selling the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag is that the land would have to be rezoned before it could be 
developed. "That will definitely be a challenge," Murphy said, "but we are 
going to give it our best try." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is zoned now, the property could be maintained as open space or 
developed as a fire station or as a park-and-ride lot for commuters. Changing 
that would require modifying both the city's General Plan and the local coastal 
plan. It would also mean changing the coastal development permit filed with the 
California Coastal Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach may very well prevail, in part because the competition is 
fading. Robert Johnson, Irvine's director of community development, said he is 
no longer in contact with Fletcher Jones. "It has been months since we talked 
to them," he said. 
</P>
