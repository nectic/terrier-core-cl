DAVID DUKE BACKS DOWN IN DISPUTE WITH GOP

 Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said Friday that he would stop using the 
name "Conservative Republican National Committee" in his fund-raising efforts 
to avoid threatened legal action by the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour sent Duke a letter 
Tuesday threatening to sue him for violating consumer-protection laws and to 
prohibit him from using the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour said the name was misleading. "The Republican National Committee takes 
its historic and longstanding rights in its name quite seriously," he said.

GROUNDS TO BE ANXIOUS IN LAGUNA BEACH; FIRE ZONE: UPCOMING REPORT ON ANCIENT 
SLIDES IN MYSTIC HILLS AREA WILL HAVE BOTH GOOD AND BAD NEWS FOR THOSE EAGER TO 
REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A geological report scheduled to be released next week on the stability of 
fire-scarred Mystic Hills will carry good and bad news for the neighborhood's 
disaster-weary residents: it will confirm that an ancient landslide exists in 
the area but show its size to be smaller than originally feared, according to a 
source close to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the landslide 
appears to affect 20 lots in the Mystic Hills area, fewer than half the 50 lots 
previously reported. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city learned about the ancient landslide in a report in March. It raised 
questions about whether the rebuilding of about 15 homes destroyed in the Oct. 
27 wildfire would be delayed and whether other homeowners would be required to 
perform costly stabilization work. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hired Geofirm, a geotechnical consulting company in Laguna Beach, to 
examine the area. The company's report, which is not yet completed, is expected 
to be delivered to city officials by the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is moving to study the geology beneath a second burned 
area, the Temple Hills neighborhood, an action prompted by reports that an 
ancient landslide may exist there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, city officials received letters from two geologists and one 
property owner about potential problems under parts of Buena Vista Way and 
several nearby streets in the Temple Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the city's request, Geofirm last week submitted a proposal to examine that 
neighborhood, a move that is almost certain to further slow the efforts of fire 
victims to rebuild their homes there. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for a study lasting at least four to six weeks, a source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the reports, fears about the stability of Laguna's hillsides 
have spread throughout the fire-damaged areas, said Kyle Butterwick, the city's 
community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly say it is a very serious problem," Butterwick said. "Not only 
are the fire victims concerned about this issue in terms of how it relates to 
their ability to rebuild their houses, but also existing residents both within 
and adjacent to the fire-damaged areas on hillside lots are becoming 
increasingly concerned and alarmed about the stability of these hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and geologists were reluctant this week to discuss specifics of 
the Buena Vista proposal or the Mystic Hills report, emphasizing that neither 
is yet in final form and stressing that they hope to avoid alarming residents 
unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are going to get scared and frightened before they know if 
they are in the area," said City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, who lost his own 
Mystic Hills home in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 He did say, however, that the Mystic Hills report is expected to be delivered 
to the city on Wednesday and made public on Friday. A special City Council 
meeting to discuss the study has been scheduled for 3 p.m. next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Frank said, a revised version of Geofirm's Buena Vista proposal 
will be ready Monday and will be considered by the City Council at a previously 
scheduled special meeting at 7 p.m Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A map of the affected area -- which, like Mystic Hills, includes both 
fire-damaged lots and homes which survived -- and a notice of the meeting will 
be hand-delivered to area property owners next Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But several of those who lost their homes in both areas and have had their 
dreams of rebuilding put on hold by the landslide reports, have expressed a 
growing frustration with what they view as the city's cautious, maddeningly 
slow pace of progress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there is a process this has to go through and I understand that the 
city and Geofirm both want to be cautious about what they want to release," 
said Polly Sloan, a fire victim and the chairperson of a newly created "Ancient 
Landslides Committee" for the Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn. "But I can't help 
but wonder if there wouldn't be some way to expedite what's going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated April 23, Buena Vista resident Christian Werner appealed to 
Frank and other city officials to act quickly to resolve the matter, stressing 
its urgency to the affected residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had not contracted for a comprehensive study of the area during the 
previous six weeks, Werner noted, despite numerous conversations and meetings 
between city officials and geologists who had found evidence of an ancient 
slide beneath his lot and others in the Temple Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, the cost-of-living allowance that property owners receive as 
part of their insurance coverage continue(s) to diminish, not to mention their 
psychological ability to cope with prolonged waiting and uncertainty," Werner 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Werner said he was encouraged by the quickened pace of action in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you forget about the fact that we lost more than one month of time and 
just deal with how things are going in the last 10 days, clearly, things are 
looking up," said Werner, whose lot is believed by geologists to form the 
northern boundary of the ancient slide area. "The city has now acknowledged 
that this is something worthy to be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who also lost his Mystic Hills home in the fire, 
said he understood both the impatience of the fire victims and the city's need 
to proceed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not heard anything (from fire victims) lately other than a high, high 
level of frustration and fear that this landslide issue could impede the 
rebuilding process itself, and I feel that too," Gentry said. "We've been 
through the fire and the mudslides and it's very difficult to cope with yet 
another hurdle thrown at you. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with my city hat on, we have got to be very cautious how we proceed 
because we are the authorizing agency for building. So we have to look at this 
very carefully. We bear the responsibility for public safety here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hannes Richter, a geotechnical engineer and one of Geofirm's two principals, 
said Friday that his company is "double-checking every aspect of this, 
especially the Mystic Hills report. We know that this is going to be very 
thoroughly scrutinized and we don't want to make any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the two slides was discovered by geologists contracted by private 
homeowners to prepare geological studies of their properties, surveys that are 
required by the city before building permits may be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The geologists have said the Mystic Hills landslide lies about 28 to 40 feet 
beneath the surface in an area on the hillside just above City Hall. 
Preliminary findings on the Temple Hills landslide indicate that it is much 
deeper, lying about 65 to 76 feet beneath the surface and possibly involving 
properties on Buena Vista Way, Canyon View Drive and Temple Hills Drive.

SCHOOL TRUSTEES VOTE TO POSTPONE STATE CLAS TESTS; EDUCATION: NEWPORT-MESA 
BOARD MAY DECIDE TUESDAY NOT TO GIVE THE CONTROVERSIAL EXAMS AT ALL, CITING 
STATE LAW VIOLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District trustees Friday voted to postpone 
administering the state's controversial standardized CLAS tests to eighth- and 
10th-graders until after a meeting Tuesday night, when they will consider not 
giving the tests at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they believe portions of the California Learning Assessment System 
tests violate state law because students would be required to answer questions 
about moral issues without parental permission, school board members who voted 
5-0 for the postponement Friday took a major step toward defying a separate 
state mandate that requires them to give the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other school districts statewide have already taken that step, but 
Newport-Mesa would become the largest to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board also will consider delaying the tests further while it seeks 
written permission from all parents to give them, officials said. Another 
option would be to allow students to take only the portions of the exams that 
board members do not find objectionable, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they are convinced that at least five of the 11 segments of 
the upper-grade reading and writing tests are illegal under the state's 
Education Code. But they said they will seek public input, obtain more 
information from the state, and include two board members who could not attend 
Friday's emergency closed-session before making a decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would never vote to administer those (five controversial sections) under 
any circumstances," said Trustee Martha Fluor. "The state Department of 
Education has placed us in an untenable position. They have absolutely 
destroyed all confidence. The judgment they made on some of this is just 
horrendous. I am appalled." 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS has faced a host of criticism throughout the state over the past several 
weeks. Several conservative groups have filed lawsuits objecting to the alleged 
posing of moral questions, and hundreds of parents have pulled their students 
out of the exams. Processing problems that plagued last year's exams have 
further hurt the test's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS was introduced last year as a revolution in educational testing. The 
performance-based assessments evaluate students' thought processes in addition 
to their ability to derive correct answers, and use tough statewide achievement 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders in more than 7,000 
schools statewide are scheduled to take the reading, writing, math, science and 
social studies exams this spring. The program will cost nearly $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the state Friday, opponents of the exam said they had obtained 
copies of the confidential tests, but promised they would not disseminate them 
publicly until Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien rules on 
whether the exams violate the Education Code. O'Brien said Friday he will rule 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, the State Department of Education promised to seek a court 
order to force the Antelope Valley Union High School District to administer the 
exams, and the Assn. of California School Administrators asked the Education 
department not to release this year's results until scoring problems are ironed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblywoman Doris Allen scheduled a public hearing on the wide 
variety of concerns about the tests for Thursday at 6:30 p.m. in the Huntington 
Beach City School District board room. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing their decision to delay giving the CLAS tests -- which were 
scheduled to begin Monday -- Newport-Mesa trustees also revealed the names of 
several novels and stories that are excerpted in the exams, which the state has 
been trying to keep confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The works named were: "What I Want to be When I Grow Up," by Martha Brooks; 
"All the Years of Her Life," by Morley Callaghan; "My Father and I," by Par 
Lagerk-vist; "Looking for Work," by Gary Soto; "My Parents," by Stephen 
Spender, and Richard Wright's "Black Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members stressed that they were criticizing the questions and writing 
tasks students were assigned -- not the literature itself. CLAS is a 
several-step test in which students read excerpts from published works, then do 
a variety of individual and group writing exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, said she is 
confident that most of the material Newport-Mesa trustees highlighted does not 
violate the Education Code, and criticized board members for revealing the 
contents of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no control over (the test) once you have bits and pieces of it out. 
We can no longer vouch for fairness," Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 All school board members throughout the state were given the chance to read 
the exam booklets this week, but only after they agreed to keep the documents 
secret. Before reviewing the material Wednesday and Thursday, each Newport-Mesa 
trustee signed a release pledging confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fluor defended the board's release of the titles, saying "the public has a 
right to know what the selections are that are on the test."

MAN ACCUSED OF HABITUALLY BEATING HIS DOG; LAW ENFORCEMENT: A FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
RESIDENT IS ARRESTED AFTER NEIGHBORS VIDEOTAPED INCIDENTS, POLICE SAID.

 Police arrested a Fountain Valley man Friday on suspicion of kicking, stoning 
and beating his collie with a garden tool, after taping the dog's mouth closed, 
which was videotaped by neighbors, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Eugene Griffith, Jr., 36, was arrested at his Huntington Beach 
insurance office, and booked at the city jail on $5,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, authorities filed two felony counts of cruelty to an animal 
against Griffith in Westminster Municipal Court alleging "the continual beating 
of the family's 1-year-old pet collie, named 'Jazzy,' " Sgt. Dann Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Concerned neighbors reported the incidents to Fountain Valley police and 
actually videotaped the beatings, which included Griffith kicking the collie, 
throwing rocks at her and beating her with a wooden handled garden tool," Bean 
said. "The video depicts Griffith taping Jazzy's mouth shut before striking her 
with the garden tool numerous times." 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Griffith declined to comment on the charges against her husband but 
said that Jazzy was still in the walled back yard of the family's two-story 
home on the 10900 block of La Carta Avenue Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark N. Phillips, Griffith's attorney, said his client would not comment on 
the charges until after they are allowed to see the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Younkin, whose back yard borders the Griffiths', said, "The dog was 
abandoned during the day and did bark and bark and bark. My husband was more 
annoyed than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Younkin said that about two weeks ago, an anonymous letter appeared in 
neighborhood mailboxes, urging people who were bothered by the dog's barking to 
write the Griffiths and complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gather the person who wrote this anonymous letter was pretty upset about 
it. The letter also said that the dog is never allowed in the house and is out 
in all weather." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 30, a Fullerton man was sentenced to 60 days' confinement after 
pleading no contest to charges that he killed a neighbor's golden retriever by 
taping its mouth shut, because, he said, its barking gave him headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Steven Sakall, 39, also was sentenced to 250 hours of community service 
and three years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Municipal Court Judge Richard E. Behn ordered that Sakall's 
community service should be related to the care of animals.

SURF FANS CAN HANG 10 ON NEWEST WALK OF FAME; HUNTINGTON BEACH: PIONEERS AND 
LOCAL HEROES WILL BE HONORED IN THE HOLLYWOOD-STYLE SHOWCASE TO BE INAUGURATED 
MAY 28. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Borrowing a page out of Hollywood Boulevard's famous sidewalk, Orange County's 
Surf City is putting the finishing touches on its downtown redevelopment with a 
Surfing Walk of Fame beginning at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, organizers say, is to recognize surfing's pioneers, champions, local 
heroes and people who who have contributed to the sport's lifestyle and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The first name on the walkway's 2-foot by 2-foot granite stones is Hawaiian 
surfing pioneer Duke Kahanamoku. The walkway will be inaugurated May 28, and 
Kahanamoku and five others still unnamed will be installed in August at the 
U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Hollywood was known for its actors and the movie industry in the 
1920s and '30s," said Michael Adams, Huntington Beach director of special 
projects.  
</P>
<P>
 "And that's the idea behind this. What the town is known for is our surfing. 
Hopefully, this will be looked at by people as baseball's Hall of Fame," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no other California city is as closely linked to surfing and the 
surfing lifestyle as Huntington Beach. Organizers such as Australian-born Peter 
Townend, himself a 1976 world surf champion who now lives in Orange County and 
is on the walkway's committee, said Huntington may not have Hawaii's powerful 
waves or rustic beauty, but the city's tradition of hosting major surfing 
contests made it a natural selection for the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huntington Beach has not always had the greatest surf, but it had the 
accessibility to the public and always attracted large numbers of people who 
have watched the sport right at the pier," Townend said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And if you look at the success of the U.S. Surfing Championships which were 
held at Huntington Beach for so many years during surfing's early years and the 
Op Pro (contest), it's a natural," he said. "It authenticates the city's title 
of Surf City." 
</P>
<P>
 The walkway was approved by the city's Design Review Board on Thursday, Adams 
said. Each year, a nominating committee will induct five people, four men and a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "On May 16, the City Council is going to have a proclamation approved for Walk 
of Fame Day, which is May 28, a Saturday. That's when we'll have the 
unveiling," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said the surfing walkway will 
be a "nice touch" to the city's image. "We still think we're the Surf City," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman and former mayor Jim Silva, who recently pushed to allow surfers 
free parking before 8 a.m., recalled that when he travels on personal or city 
business, people throughout the country come up to him and comment about 
surfing on the city's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if I'm in St. Louis, Mo., or Washington, D.C., they always 
ask, 'Hey, what about the surf in Huntington Beach.' Or, 'I see you're from 
Huntington Beach. You have the most beautiful beaches there.' I think when 
people hear about Huntington Beach, they think of the surf and the ocean," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots for nominees for the first induction were mailed this week to about 60 
people from the surf media, noted surf historians, surf associations, and 
recognized surfing halls of fame and museums, Townend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahanamoku, who is regarded as the father of surfing and helped popularize 
surfing in the United States, has already been named in the surfing pioneer 
category, Townend said. Other categories for inductees include surf champions, 
local heroes, and those who have contributed to surf culture, which could 
include noted surf bands such as the Beach Boys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local heroes must be graduates of a Huntington Beach school or 10-year 
residents of the city, Townend said. Champions, surf culture and local heroes 
must have been popular before 1984. Surf pioneers must be at least 50 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket, which is sponsoring the U.S. Open of Surfing professional 
contest, is planning to broadcast the induction ceremony as part of a two-hour 
television show, said Townend, a color analyst for surfing on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term goal," Townend said, "is to build vignettes and have part of 
Prime Ticket's show promote future inductees." 
</P>
<P>
 But there have already been some rumblings over what the surfing tribute 
should be called. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Grant, Honorary Mayor of Hollywood and chairman of the Walk of Fame, 
said Huntington's idea is a fantastic way to honor its surfing celebrities. 
However, he took exception to using a name that his city helped make famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't call it 'walk of fame,' " Grant insisted. "That's a copyrighted 
name, and our legal people would get upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams acknowledged that the walkway committee could not use "Hollywood Walk of 
Fame," but believed that it was legal to use, "Surfing Walk of Fame." Father of 
Surfing 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Kahanamoku, considered a pioneer in the sport, is the first inductee of 
the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Birthplace: Honolulu, Hawaii 
</P>
<P>
 Born: 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 Died: 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Achievements: Won five Olympic swimming medals.

JUST A PLACE TO CALL HOME; HOUSING: PATRICIA HICKS AND 15 OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE 
WILL, THANKS TO WESTMINSTER, GET TEMPORARY QUARTERS AND HELP FINDING WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Patricia Hicks calls it the cleansing of her soul, these past eight months 
that she has spent homeless on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cold nights spent huddled in a sleeping bag with her dog, Sandy, are 
about over. Finally, Hicks, 43, will again enjoy hot baths, a bed and clean 
clothes. And more important, a chance to work again. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, she will move into a temporary home in Westminster thanks to city 
officials, who decided to provide up to three months of housing for some of the 
city's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks and 15 others will live in two houses rented by the Westminster 
Redevelopment Agency and managed by Shelter for the Homeless, a nonprofit 
organization that operates in Orange County. Most are former residents of an 
encampment Caltrans shut down last month near the Beach Boulevard exit of the 
San Diego Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 The 16 will also receive free food, utility services and the use of a 
telephone, and they will be given job training and help in finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials describe the $10,000 effort as an investment in turning around 
the lives of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks agrees. "They have opened the door for me," she said. "Now it's up to 
me. If I blow this, I have no one to blame but myself." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, at the abandoned fire station where she has been staying, Hicks 
was preparing for the move. There was not much to pack: a pair of Levi's, 
T-shirts, a Big Bird stuffed toy, a sleeping bag and a Little League banner 
fished from the garbage that her dog uses as a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn to live with what people throw away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her slide began in 1991, when she lost her job of 13 years as a 
purchasing agent with an air conditioning and heating company in Anaheim. Hicks 
said she had no savings because her mother had been ill for several years. By 
the time her mother died in 1990, Hicks said, she had been spending more than 
half her take-home pay on her mother's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said she has had one job since 1991, as a $5-an-hour motel desk clerk. 
She lost that job after less than a year and was unable to find other work, and 
she then was evicted from her apartment last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my friends forgot who I was," she said. "I asked for help, but my 
half-sisters and half-brothers said, 'Things are rough all over, Sis.' " (Her 
father died in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start a downhill slide, the longer you are on that downhill slide, 
the harder it is to pull yourself back up," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she knew she had hit bottom the day she found herself scavenging for 
aluminum cans and plastic bottles along Beach and Garden Grove boulevards in 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing a grocery cart, Hicks would walk 10 to 12 miles a day looking for 
aluminum cans, plastic bottles and other recyclable things from dumpsters, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3 to $5 she made redeeming them would be enough for "my sodas and a 
little food," she said. She said enjoys beer occasionally but insists that she 
is not an alcoholic or drug user. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at Ralphs Grocery store on Beach Boulevard would give her money, 
clothes and food from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cared about her very much," said Lorita Langea bookkeeper at the store. 
"She's very intelligent; she seems like a good person. I liked her dog." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hicks came down with a cold during a rainy week in March, Ralphs 
employees contributed money for a motel room, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difference between myself and anybody else is that they have roofs 
over their heads and have jobs, and I don't," Hicks said. "I'm still a human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 There were days when she was ready to give up, she said. But having her cocker 
spaniel helped her keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get down in the dumps sometimes," Hicks said, "but Sandy would lie down 
next to me, we'd play ball and I would feel better again." 
</P>
<P>
 Most shelters don't accept homeless people with dogs, Hicks pointed out, so on 
many a rainy night Hicks stayed outside getting wet rather than leave her pet. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she slept wherever "the police didn't bother me." She moved from 
place to place until some of her homeless friends invited her to join them at 
the abandoned fire station on Goldenwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The station had become the home of about a dozen homeless people evicted from 
the San Diego Freeway encampment. City officials had condemned the structure as 
unsafe, but they decided to provide the homeless with temporary housing rather 
than send them out into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks says she is grateful for the opportunity to leave this life behind. 
Within a year, she has promised herself, she will be back on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned about myself a whole lot," Hicks said of the past eight months. 
"Some were good, some were bad," she said of the things she learned. "I don't 
want to go through it again. But, yes, I'm a stronger person now. I've learned 
I'm a survivor."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; STUDENTS GET REWARD FOR EXPOSING VANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Brea Olinda Unified School District have decided to reward two 
Brea Junior High School students for turning in a local student suspected of 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Canyon High School student was expelled last month for defacing the 
junior high building, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the students will receive $100 for helping administrators find the 
vandal. Officials said the expelled student's parents will be expected to pay 
half the reward, along with half the cost of the graffiti removal. The district 
will pay the other half. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Frank Davies praised the two junior high students for 
reporting the vandal to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the junior high students) have got a lot of pride in their school, 
and they want to keep it looking like an ideal school to go to," Davies said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER MODEST TAX INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a $3-million budget deficit facing the city, the City Council Monday will 
consider a set of modest tax increases designed to raise a projected $375,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The first proposal would mean an up to $1 tax per passenger on charter boats 
in Newport Harbor. The second tax calls for an extra $10 fine for those 
delinquent in paying parking tickets. The third would be an annual fee charged 
people with security alarms in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the strongest tax foes on the City Council appear to favor the new fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can justify them," said Councilman Phil Sansone. Of the marine charter tax, 
he said, "I don't mind if tourists have to kick in a buck to help pay for 
harbor and tidelands maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 The city currently charges boat operators who shuttle passengers in and out of 
Newport Harbor $42 a year for a permit, City Manager Kevin Murphy said. The 
current proposal would charge each passenger a dollar on boat fares over $10. 
For boat fares less than $10, there would be a 50-cent fee. There would be no 
fee for boats, like the Balboa Ferry, that charge less than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said Newport Beach was one of the only harbors in the state with no 
head tax on charter passengers. About 80 charter companies carry 300,000 
passengers, according to city statistics. The tax is expected to raise 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax on home alarms would affect 6,000 residences in Newport 
Beach. Monday, the City Council is expected to approve a $20 annual fee to 
raise $150,000 to help cover police costs in responding to thousands of false 
alarms each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge on delinquent parking citations would raise an estimated $75,000 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the city has already laid off seven city workers and plan to 
eliminate 33 total municipal positions in order to cut expenses.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; VOLUNTEER PAINTERS TO BRUSH UP 47 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people are expected to turn out today for "Paint Your Heart 
Out Anaheim," an all-day project in which volunteers will paint 47 homes 
belonging to elderly and disabled people in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, more than 100 homes have been refurbished through the 
program.Materials and labor are donated by local businesses and community 
members and volunteers, while the city partially sponsors the event as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers are expected to use about 1,500 gallons to repaint the homes. 
Homeowners who are physically or financially unable to perform or pay for the 
improvements are eligible for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to painting, volunteer crews also install water and energy saving 
devices, repair driveways and haul away tons of yard debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, we're able to offer more services to these homeowners," said 
Keith Olesen, co-chairman of the event. "Thanks to the generous spirit of our 
donors and volunteers, the houses, neighborhoods and the city benefit. But most 
importantly, the homeowners know people still care." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners wishing to be placed on the waiting list for next year can call 
program coordinator Carolyn Griebe at (714) 974-9481.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LOW-COST HOUSING PROJECT OKD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's on-again, off-again low-cost housing project for the Florida-Utica 
area is now on again. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week once more approved financing for an apartment 
renovation in the once-crime-ridden area.The council originally had approved 
the plan on April 4, but in an unusual move rescinded that vote on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's turnabout came after Councilman David Sullivan questioned 
financing for the project. Sullivan again voted against the project on Monday 
night, but the other six council members supported the low-cost housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's plan, the private owners of a apartment complex at 725-733 
Utica Ave. will receive a $446,000 forgivable loan. The loan will not have to 
be paid back if the owners rent the apartments only to low-income families for 
the next 30 years. The city also is providing a $100,000 grant for security 
lighting and landscaping in the apartment-complex area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, Mike Adams, the city's director of special 
projects, said that rehabilitation of the run-down apartment complex is a key 
to continuing neighborhood improvement in the areas of Florida Street and Utica 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the neighborhood had once been a high-crime area, with 
drug dealing among the problems. A police crackdown, coupled with a 
neighborhood task force, has greatly helped the area, city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staffers have said rehabilitation of the run-down, aging apartment 
complex at 725-733 Utica Ave. is a key to continued neighborhood improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer on Monday night said he agreed that improvement of the 
apartments is a worthy goal. "This used to be a drug-infested, 
prostitution-infested area," Bauer said. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; OFFICER'S GOOD DEED EARNS HIM NEW PET

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual rescue last week, Police Officer Gary Kirby scooped an abandoned 
kitten off a roadway and saved the tiny feline from being killed by an oncoming 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kirby patrolled city streets April 27, he saw a couple of dead kittens, 
killed by cars, in the traffic lanes on Edinger Avenue between Harbor Boulevard 
and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of obvious that someone dumped them off in the roadway," Kirby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kirby continued to drive, he saw another dead kitten. Then he stopped at 
the intersection of Euclid Street and Edinger Avenue and saw a kitten alive in 
the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kirby flashed his lights and prepared to stop, the kitten darted into the 
next lane and was almost hit by another vehicle. Kirby then stopped traffic, 
got out of his patrol car and rescued the scared gray kitten from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists clapped, honked and gave the police officer a thumbs up for his good 
deed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ride back to the station, the shaken kitten climbed up inside the 
car's dashboard. It took several people to get him out, a feat accomplished 
only after the radio was removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the police station, officers pampered the kitten, giving him a can of 
tuna to eat and a cardboard box, padded with a T-shirt, to sleep in. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby took the kitten home. He and his wife, Lisa, have named him Caine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good," Kirby said of his rescue effort. "I've got a new cat 
now, and he acts like he owns the house already."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; STUDENTS TACKLE ISSUES VIA TV LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there were any doubts that guns and violence have become a grim reality in 
schools around the country, students from Orange County had them resolved 
firsthand this week as they took part in a transcontinental classroom forum 
through the use of modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, 20 teen-agers from Santa Ana and Rancho Santa Margarita stared at 
the video images of students in Texas and South Carolina and were temporarily 
speechless. That didn't last long. In minutes, the students were engaged with 
their counterparts thousands of miles away in vigorous debate over guns on 
campus and youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful," said Randy McCord, faculty adviser for eight students 
from Santa Margarita Catholic School. "For me as a teacher, it's fun because 
this isn't a learning theory, this is a learning experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 For almost two hours, the discussion on guns and violence on campus linked 
students from the Rancho Santa Margarita private school, Century High School in 
Santa Ana, and high schools in Houston and Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a video conference room at the Fluor Daniel Corp. in Irvine, the 
students first had to adjust to the strangeness of video technology. The 
out-of-state schools were also sitting in local Fluor Daniel teleconference 
rooms in their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The images were sent electronically through telephone lines, creating a 
momentary delay between sound and picture that had lips moving just after the 
words were spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for all the students to get used to talking to a 
television screen and the debate on guns in schools was lively. The local group 
disagreed strongly with students from Southside High School in South Carolina 
over random locker searches and stressing security guards over gun education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who bring guns to school do it to show off their power," said 
Century High freshman Floyd Watson. "They do it to intimidate other kids. We 
should bring in people who were paralyzed by gun violence to be a positive 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking her head, an unidentified female student from Southside High said 
security guards are also needed. "There's more than one solution to this 
problem. We're going to wake up one day and realize that there is no magic 
solution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A female student at Dulles High in Houston said she just wants the violence at 
her school to stop. "I would give up my right for privacy to be safe," she 
said. "I'm afraid of guns at our school and I don't want to wind up in the 
cross-fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santa Margarita Catholic School hooked up with Southside High to 
discuss racial issues. "We both had these stereotypes of each other that 
weren't true," said Brian Flock, a Santa Margarita sophomore who moderated the 
teleconference. "They thought we were a bunch of surfer dudes who hung out by 
the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, the stereotypes were tossed aside. "We just started talking about how 
to deal with racism," Flock said. "They're closer to the problem than us, but 
it just seemed like we could also see the problems."FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GANG-PREVENTION PROGRAM TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors this week gave unanimous approval for about $400,000 
in start-up costs for a new gang-prevention and education program developed by 
the Orange County Chiefs of Police & Sheriff's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-gang program is modeled after the Sheriff's Department's Drug Abuse 
Is Life Abuse Foundation, a privately funded partnership between business and 
law enforcement leaders that has produced anti-drug brochures for students, as 
well as other educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said he believes the countywide project -- which includes 
cooperation among numerous government agencies, schools, cities and other 
organizations -- is an unprecedented step in fighting gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors, who approved the funding for the program at their Tuesday 
meeting, said they believe education is an important part of any effort to curb 
gangs. "It is a cooperative effort," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. "It is a 
unified front." 
</P>
<P>
 The project will involve hiring eight civilian employees, including an 
executive director and crime prevention specialists, who will work with schools 
and other organizations to increase awareness of gang violence. It will also 
develop programs to give young people positive alternatives to gang involvement 
and will support already-established programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers predict that the nonprofit project will become self-sufficient 
within a year through fund-raising and other efforts.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; MANAGER OF SANITARY DISTRICT IS FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Price, the general manager of the Capistrano Beach Sanitary District 
for the past two years, was fired this week, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's five-member board of directors voted 3 to 2 during a 
closed-door session Tuesday night to fire Price, a resident of San Diego County 
who had worked for the district as an independent contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors Larry Montoya, Jim Forrester and Kenneth Lawrence Jr. voted with the 
majority. Bill Morison and Don Simpkin dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the directors who voted in the majority could be reached for comment 
to explain the decision. But Morison said the firing was prompted by anonymous 
complaints from some of the district's 10 employees and called the decision "a 
gross misjudgment on the part of the three who voted for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were petty allegations presented by nameless and faceless sources," 
Morison said. "These were undoubtedly initiated by a marginal employee who was 
criticized for his poor performance. Here we are, seven months away from a 
merger (with another district) with no manager, our superintendent on vacation 
and Mutt and Jeff running the plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Morison said the allegations dealt with employee relations but would not 
elaborate. Price, who could not be reached for comment, earned about $60,000 a 
year.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; COUNCIL CREATES NEW CITY STAFF POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted this week to create a new staff position to coordinate 
more than 200 volunteers working in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer services coordinator is expected to make $35,000 a year, plus 
$12,300 in benefits.The council approved the position by a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas Lorch cast the dissenting vote and suggested the job could 
be shared by other staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 His objections were shared by resident Steve Kingston, who told the council he 
would do the work himself for free and guaranteed he would have the program "up 
and running by July." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Michael W. Parness said the city's long-term financial plan 
and 11 new programs can only work through volunteer support. A coordinator will 
have to serve as a liaison between the city employees and the volunteers, log 
the volunteers' hours and do performance evaluations and counseling, among 
other duties, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be foolish "to expect a volunteer to do all that work," Parness said. 
"Sometimes you have to spend a dime to make a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Candace Haggard agreed, calling the volunteer coordinator 
"cutting-edge government." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this work in library systems," said Haggard, who works for the 
county library system. "To be done right, this is an 80-hour-a-week job. . . . 
I think it's definitely something we need to do."LEN HALL

 Public works officials this week unveiled plans to spend $37.8 million next 
fiscal year on street, sewer and park improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for spending more than $20.2 million to improve traffic.Almost 
$12 million of that money will be spend to widen Bristol Street between Edinger 
and McFadden avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the city's highest-priority transportation project, and it is expected 
to speed traffic and reduce congestion through the area, said transportation 
analyst Manuel Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 The street will be widened from four to six lanes and landscaping improvements 
will be added as part of the project. Furthermore, utility lines will be moved 
underground to improve the appearance and safety of the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials presented the plan to the City Council during a study session at 
City Hall on Monday. The council will use the information to plan next year's 
budget, which is expected to be adopted on June 20, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital improvement plan also calls for $4.5 million to resurface alleys, 
streets, sidewalks and to replace street lighting in several neighborhoods. JON

<TEXT>
<P>
 A slow-moving storm drenched Orange County with scattered rain showers Friday, 
and forecasters are predicting brief downpours and isolated thunderstorms over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm coasted down from Northern California and arrived in the afternoon, 
one day later than originally predicted.Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist at 
WeatherData Inc., said rain fell in small amounts throughout most of the county 
but some areas experienced isolated heavy showers. WeatherData provides

<P>
 Santa Ana received .03 of an inch of rain by 5:30 p.m., while most other 
cities reported only traces. Santa Ana has recorded 12.22 inches of rain to 
date, compared to 22.67 inches for the same period last year. The season norm 
to date for Santa Ana is 12.44 inches, Thoren said.

and thunderstorms for Orange County today and 40% on Sunday.

AWARD AGAINST 3 HUNTINGTON BEACH OFFICERS REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Friday reduced a $105,000 jury award against three Huntington Beach 
Police officers accused of assaulting two brothers, but denied the officer's 
request for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Logan Moore agreed to reduce the jury's 
January award by nearly $10,000 because he said the jury improperly gave the 
brothers punitive damages for unlawfully entering the men's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, Miguel and Roberto Garcia, accused Officers Steven E. Overcast, 
Thomas A. Tremblay and Raymond Villescas of assaulting, handcuffing and 
pointing pistols at them during a 1988 incident at their Huntington Beach 
apartment. The men were not charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers denied any wrongdoing and testified that they were only trying to 
help a woman who had lived in the apartment safely retrieve her belongings.

77 TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventy-seven faculty members at UC Irvine have accepted this year's early 
retirement package and will leave the campus by July 1, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 202 UCI faculty eligible for the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive 
Program, 38% decided to take it, UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 They include: Michael Butler, dean of Undergraduate Studies; Robert Hickok, 
dean of the School of Fine Arts; Harold Moore, dean of the School of Physical 
Sciences; F. Sherwood Rowland, well-known chemistry professor and ozone 
depletion researcher, and James McGaugh, director of the UCI Center for the 
Neurobiology of Learning and Memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of those taking the plan will be called back to the university later this 
year on a part-time basis, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirement plan is expected to save about $2.6 million in salary at UCI. A 
similar offer to staff members is estimated to save about $5.2 million. It is 
the third such plan offered since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 All nine University of California campuses as well as Hastings Law School 
offered the buyouts. UC Berkeley and UCLA reported the largest number of 
departing faculty, each losing 195 people. UC Santa Cruz had the largest 
proportion of faculty taking the offer -- 44% -- while UC San Francisco posted 
the smallest ratio, less than 30%.

2 ARRESTED IN RESIDENTIAL MAIL THEFT RING; 3RD STILL AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two people suspected of breaking into residential mailboxes and cashing stolen 
checks have been arrested following a three-week investigation, police said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects allegedly stole outgoing mail from at least 40 apartments and 
houses in Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa. They then altered 
the names on checks and cashed them at local banks, said police Detective Sara 
Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people who were victimized wouldn't find out their checks had 
been stolen until they received their bank statement or got a call from a 
creditor," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested this week were 30-year-old Lisa Jean Agnew and 27-year-old Kevin 
Walter Craig. The pair are being held on suspicion of possession of stolen 
property, suspicion of forgery and suspicion of theft of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said the suspects were using the money from the checks to buy drugs. She 
said police stumbled upon the operation when they set up a surveillance at a 
local motel for drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we contacted the suspects at the motel, we found checks, fraudulent 
identification and drugs throughout the room," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suggest that in order to prevent becoming a victim of such crimes, 
residents should drop mail at the post office or in the blue collection boxes 
in their community or hand it to their mail carriers instead of leaving 
outgoing mail in boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew and Craig are being held at Huntington Beach Jail on $25,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect, 24-year-old Daniel Oharrold, remains at large and is wanted 
on a $25,000 warrant on the same charges. He is described as a white male, 5 
feet, 4 inches tall, weighing about 150 pounds. Police said Oharrold recently 
cut his hair short and dyed it blond to alter his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have been doing this for a long time," Long said. "We suspect that 
there may be more victims coming forward."

4 STUDENTS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO INCITE RIOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four La Habra High School students were arrested Friday on suspicion of trying 
to incite a riot after they staged a demonstration to protest their 
suspensions, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and school officials said three of the four male students who were 
arrested were moshing, or slam dancing, during an assembly in the gymnasium 
where a rap band was performing. The dancers were told to stop and leave the 
gym but refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Patricia Howell called the dancing, which involves slamming bodies 
together, "inappropriate behavior." The dancing trio was escorted out of the 
gym and taken to an administrator's office where a fourth student arrived to 
protest. All were suspended, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they were suspended, they were not allowed to be on campus and were asked 
to leave, Howell said. Instead, the four rallied about 100 classmates from 
classes in session and staged a demonstration on campus, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 When 10 police officers arrived, someone in the crowd threw a bottle at them, 
Sgt. Phil Stufflebean said. The four suspended students -- an 18-year-old, two 
17-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- were then arrested on suspicion of trying to 
incite a riot and trespassing,  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the student protesters went back to class, but about 45 left campus, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One student, Stephen Reifenstein, 18, said he was protesting because the 
suspensions "were bogus. They didn't do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other students agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the whole thing and (the four male students who were arrested) were 
just dancing like everybody else," said Meghan Sweet, 16, who participated in 
the walkout. "I think it's pretty sad to see kids get suspended and then 
arrested just for dancing. It's totally unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said she has a list of those who participated in the demonstration and 
will hold conferences with each of them. Their parents will be notified.

SEAL BEACH RUNOFF PITS SLOW GROWTH, BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bombarded for months by mailers, campaign signs, charges and countercharges, 
voters in the city's Old Town district probably won't have trouble 
distinguishing between the two candidates on Tuesday's runoff election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The race pits incumbent Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, a slow-growth 
advocate and critic of alcohol sales on Main Street, against teacher and 
realtor Jim Klisanin, who has organized the annual Main Street Christmas parade 
and is supported by many merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings, 65, and Klisanin, 59, disagree on numerous issues from development 
to taxes. And as the heated campaign winds down, they also differ on what the 
election is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the last small beach town on the entire coast," Hastings said this 
week. "What we have is absolutely the most perfect thing in the whole wide 
world. Our residents want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin maintains that Seal Beach can be improved, saying the election "comes 
down to whether people want someone who will stay with the status quo or 
someone new who will work hard to get things accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings came within about 20 votes of winning April's general election 
outright in a three-way race against Klisanin and community activist Charles 
Antos. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates are fighting to represent the city's oldest neighborhood, 
with its mix of 60-year-old Spanish bungalows, modern apartments and beachfront 
mansions. Old Town is bisected by Main Street, a tree-lined row of restaurants, 
specialty shops and bars that cater to locals and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping area's close proximity to homes has created friction between 
merchants and residents and represents a key issue in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has championed the concerns of some Old Town residents who complain 
that Main Street businesses that serve alcohol often lure rowdy customers into 
the neighborhood at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has opposed bids by some liquor-serving restaurants to increase their 
operating hours. She has expressed general skepticism about new developments, 
including a proposal several years ago to build hundreds of homes on a stretch 
of vacant land along Seal Beach Boulevard known as Hellman Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants have called Hastings' views "anti-business." Klisanin stopped 
short of that label, but said she and the rest of the current council have 
weakened the city's fiscal health by failing to strongly support Seal Beach's 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has faced budget shortfalls during the past few years and was 
forced to lay off workers and cut some services to balance the city's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Hastings and the rest of the council voted to more than double the 
tax that residents pay on their monthly gas, electric and telephone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said the tax hike -- which must be approved annually by the council 
-- was the only way of closing a budget deficit without making severe cuts in 
city services, including the Police Department. "It's better than bringing a 
Home Depot into town," she said. "People understand and support what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin opposed the tax, saying the city should have looked at other ways of 
generating revenues. He suggested that city officials seek contributions from 
corporations and try to pay for some municipal projects through private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Klisanin said he would work to streamline the city's process for 
issuing planning and building permits, saying the current system is too slow. 
He also vowed to work on improving the look of Main Street by installing 
benches and repairing buckled sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to bring people together and accomplish things," Klisanin said. "I 
feel I am a fair person who can help people get along." Seal Beach Runoff 
Election 
</P>
<P>
 The following two candidates will face one another Tuesday in a runoff City 
Council election in Seal Beach. The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.

</P>
<P>
 During 1993, 20,214 vehicles were stolen in Orange County and 14,399 of those

CANDIDATE TELLS FBI OF THREATS IN LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Republican candidate in the 41st Congressional District has filed a 
complaint with the FBI after receiving two threatening letters, one of them 
expressing anger because of her decision to challenge incumbent Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar). 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Valerie Romero, an Upland businesswoman and one of four Republicans 
challenging Kim in the June 7 primary, said she turned two letters over to the 
FBI -- one received about three weeks ago that was postmarked in the City of 
Industry, and another that arrived this week with a Santa Ana postmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Both letters were similarly typed, short and filled with grammatical errors 
and obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the FBI's usual policy, a spokesman would neither confirm nor deny 
that the agency is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, I think that because I am a woman, maybe they are trying to 
scare me off," Romero said from her campaign headquarters in Ontario, adding 
that she has no idea who is behind the letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it's one of my opponents," she said. "It could be one of the 
crazies out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said she initially dismissed the first letter as a "typical" prank. It 
warned her not to run against Kim, whose district includes parts of Orange and 
Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, she decided to call police after the second letter because it 
threatened acts of violence against her. The police referred her to the FBI, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Garner, a spokeswoman for Kim, said that, unfortunately, such letters 
"go with the territory" and are part of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Kim's office also receives threatening letters occasionally, when 
volatile issues are before Congress. Recently, she added, the congressman drew 
strong reaction to his stand against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some very serious threats. We have had (to call) the police on a 
couple of them," Garner said. "When you get your first one, you really react to 
it . . . and then you start to understand this goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other candidates in the race, Bob Kerns of Ontario and Todd R. Thakar of 
Newport Beach, said they had not received threatening letters and had not heard 
of Romero's complaint. The fifth Republican candidate, Ronald L. Curtis, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerns agreed that "maybe because (Romero) is a young female, they think they 
can intimidate her."

ANGELS BEAT THE A'S, 11-6, BUT ANDERSON IS SIDELINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago, the Angels probably would have welcomed a liquid gift from the 
heavens. A rainout would have meant at least a temporary respite from their 
struggles. But they weren't happy to see the steady rain that pelted the 
Anaheim Stadium field between 5 and 6 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning two in a row, the Angels were eager to play again. Then the rain 
suddenly stopped, the ominous black clouds parted and bright sunshine lit the 
upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for good omens and silver linings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels beat the Oakland Athletics, 11-6, before 33,399, but rookie 
left-hander Brian Anderson, who leads the Angels with three victories, suffered 
a broken left thumb when Geronimo Berroa's single to center glanced off his 
hand in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who had been the Angels' most consistent starter, completed the 
inning, but was unable to continue after warming up for the second. He was 
taken to St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, where X-rays revealed a non-displaced 
fracture. Anderson, who will be out of action four to six weeks, was put on the 
15-day disabled list and Mike Butcher was recalled from triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, Mark (Langston) is one, maybe two workouts away (from 
returning)," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "And Joe Magrane is just back. Thank 
goodness for small favors." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Tim Salmon watched the downpour from the protection of the 
dugout and frowned. "I didn't know it ever rained here this time of year," he 
said. "Damn. This is the one time you can't wait to play. We're going good." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon didn't mention that the A's happen to be going very, very badly, but 
soon, both truths were clearly evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon belted homers in his first two at-bats. Gary DiSarcina, who hadn't hit 
a homer in almost two years, hit a two-run shot to left in the third and Chad 
Curtis added a two-run homer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oakland looked very much like one of the worst teams in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's frustration boiled over in the sixth inning when Steve Sax was called 
out on strikes by umpire Al Clark. Sax protested, Clark ejected him and then 
Sax earned himself a certain suspension by slamming into Clark with a 
Sumo-quality chest bump. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland's woes began when Chili Davis hit a line drive right at first baseman 
Berroa in the first inning. Berroa feebly stuck out his glove and the ball 
ended up in the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 And Berroa wasn't the only player in gray and green to come up empty on this 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggles continued when Scott Brosius dropped Curtis' popup near the 
mound in the second inning . . . and when shortstop Mike Bordick booted 
DiSarcina's hard grounder later the same inning . . . and when Davis scored 
after advancing on a wild pitch in the third . . . and when Harold Reynolds 
stole third and scored on a throwing error by catcher Terry Steinbach in the 
third . . . and when Damion Easley reached first on Brosius' two-out throwing 
error in the fifth . . . and when Davis scored after moving over to second on a 
Steinbach's passed ball in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels needed all the help they could get. Their bullpen still hasn't 
recovered from Wednesday night's 13-inning victory over the Yankees and the 
early exit by Anderson only exacerbated the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sampen pitched three innings, putting the A's down in order in the second 
and third before giving up four consecutive hits and three runs in the fourth. 
Scott Lewis followed Sampen and yielded a bases-empty homer to Ruben Sierra 
leading off the sixth and two two-out hits and one run in the seventh. And John 
Dopson pitched the eighth and ninth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Angels were able to win their third game in a row. It was the 
first time this season they have managed to string together three victories, 
but considering the loss of Anderson for at least a month, was it worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really unfortunate," Langston said. "As well as he's pitched for us, 
he's done such a great job, we really want him out there."

GIANTS MAKE A BIG SPLASH WITH RALLY; BASEBALL: DODGERS' OFFENSE IS STIFLED BY 
SWIFT AND BECK, AND SAN FRANCISCO COMES FROM BEHIND IN THE RAIN, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Puddles started to form on the center-field warning track during the sixth 
inning, when the rain started coming down hard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's never a picnic to play at Candlestick Park at night anyway, what with the 
cold winds blowing off the bay. The Dodgers were ahead, 1-0, at that point, 
with Pedro Astacio on the mound, pitching well, and the Giants' Darren Lewis on 
first base with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 But to call a game, there has to be more than a soggy infield, muddy outfield 
and drenched players. And it didn't stop Lewis from scoring the tying run, 
Royce Clayton the winning run and Rod Beck from preserving the Giants' 2-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bad, but both teams had to play in it," Dodger first baseman Eric 
Karros said. "I don't think any plays weren't made because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Giant starter Bill Swift (4-3), the Dodgers managed only four hits, 
and against Beck, they got nothing. Beck retired the Dodgers in order in the 
ninth inning for his fourth save.  
</P>
<P>
 The loss ruined a solid outing by Astacio (1-3) who held the Giants to seven 
hits, had one walk and eight strikeouts. But the Giants put together three 
consecutive hits in the seventh inning, with Kirt Manwaring's single to right 
scoring Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both pitchers were tough," Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. 
"Astacio got his breaking ball over and he changed speeds well. And when he got 
out of kilter, he was able to straighten out again. Where the rain affects 
pitchers is in their footing, and both of them pitched well." 
</P>
<P>
 It had rained hard in the morning and into the afternoon, stopping about 4 
p.m. and causing a delay at the start of the game for 20 minutes as the ground 
crew got the field ready. But by the seventh, the field was muddy again, and 
when the crew was summoned by home plate umpire Greg Bonin to bring out some 
Turface -- an absorbent similar to kitty litter -- to patch up the batter's box 
and pitcher's mound, first base coach Reggie Smith argued that it should have 
been brought out before the Dodgers batted in the top of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him why he didn't call for it before we hit in that inning," said 
Manager Tom Lasorda, who also argued with Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio allowed only one runner to reach second base until Lewis stole second 
in the sixth inning. Lewis then scored on Dave Martinez's hard-hit grounder to 
Tim Wallach, which bounced off his glove and into short left field. It was 
questionably ruled a hit, but either way, the score was tied.  
</P>
<P>
 A great throw by Raul Mondesi in the fourth inning helped Astacio. Mark 
Carreon hit a ball in the right-field corner and had every right to think it 
was good for a double. But as the season progresses, Dodger opponents are 
beginning to learn about Mondesi's arm. The Giants now know. Mondesi fielded 
the ball on the run, spun and made a perfect throw to Delino DeShields at 
second base to get the final out of the inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza, who extended his hitting streak to eight games with a single, 
also helped out in the third, when he threw out Lewis trying to steal third. 
Lewis was the only batter Astacio walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, coach Bill Russell talked with DeShields and told him he had 
been moved to eighth in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields has been struggling offensively since the fourth game of the season 
and it has become worse since he suffered a concussion two weeks ago. Since 
returning, he has batted .136. He still doesn't feel 100%, his head still aches 
and his left leg is still weak from a 15-year-old injury to his left thigh that 
acted up about three weeks ago. Lasorda thought taking DeShields out of the 
leadoff spot would help take the pressure off him for a while, but DeShields 
was not happy about the move.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's not it, it's not the pressure, it's my leg," DeShields said before the 
game. "I have never batted eighth. It would be one thing if I have never done 
anything before, but I have put up numbers. There is nobody better than me at 
what I do. " 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields doubled in the third inning and eventually scored on an infield 
single by Brett Butler. But that was all the Dodgers could manage against 
Swift, who went on to retire nine of the next 10 batters and gave up only two 
hits the rest of the way.

LEWIS WINS EVERY ROUND BEFORE STOPPING JACKSON WITH A TKO; PRO BOXING: WBC 
CHAMPION'S SIZE ADVANTAGE TOO MUCH FOR CHALLENGER AFTER THREE KNOCKDOWNS.

 The Chicago Bull coach might have done better against Lennox Lewis on Friday 
night than this Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the NBA coach has the height to deal with the World Boxing Council 
heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis completely outclassed Jackson, stopping him at 1:35 of the eighth round 
and easily retaining his share of the heavyweight championship. Using his 
five-inch height edge and seven-inch reach advantage, Lewis won every round on 
all three judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a lot of avid boxing fans realize my true talents," said Lewis, 
who has complained he doesn't get the respect other heavyweights receive. "I 
went out and won and looked good tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't difficult against this opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks easy on the tape," Jackson said. "But when you're standing there 
looking up at a giant, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
 It was impossible for the six-foot Jackson, whose "Man on a Mission" theme was 
flawed from the start. He simply isn't on the 6-foot-5 Lewis' level, in height 
or stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind fighting shorter opponents, because they're going to find it 
hard to hit me because they have to reach up to hit me. With my reach 
advantage, it gives them a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more to Lennox Lewis," said the 28-year-old champion from 
England, "and a lot more the people haven't seen yet. As soon as a I get up 
against a good opponent, you'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' victory sets up a possible unification bout with Michael Moorer, who 
beat Evander Holyfield last month for the World Boxing Assn. and International 
Boxing Federation portions of the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Michael Moorer is going to get the respect of the world until 
he fights Lennox Lewis," Lewis said/ 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, seated at ringside, has shown little inclination to unify the title, 
but Lewis probably didn't scare him on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis landed 247 punches; Jackson got in 64. Of the 310 jabs thrown by Lewis, 
158 landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis had won every round when he knocked down Jackson for the third time 
midway through the eighth. A sharp right followed by a left uppercut did the 
damage and referee Arthur Mercante stopped the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also knocked down Jackson 20 seconds into the fight and again in a wild 
fifth round. That round ended with Jackson on the canvas, knocked down after 
the bell. Mercante deducted a point from Lewis for hitting after the bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ever hear the bell," Lewis said. "Something clicked and I decided to 
get off my combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who earned $4 million, scored his 25th straight victory and 21st 
knockout. It was the third defense of the WBC belt he acquired when 
then-undisputed champion Riddick Bowe dumped it in a garbage can two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson earned $500,000 while falling to 30-2.

 The preliminary is over, as far as the New York Knicks are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring on the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to be finished and go on to the next round," said Patrick 
Ewing, who scored 27 of his 36 points in the second half at East Rutherford, 
N.J., Friday night in a 102-92 victory over the New Jersey Nets. "New Jersey 
was in the way, and we got rid of them. Let's move on. I don't care who's 
there. Chicago is in our way, too. We'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, who also had 14 rebounds and five blocked shots, won a second-half duel 
with Derrick Coleman to help set up yet another playoff series between the 
Knicks and Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, which won the best-of-five series, 3-1, has been eliminated the last 
three years by the Bulls en route to their three consecutive NBA titles. The 
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals begin Sunday at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a competitive series and now we have to concentrate on Chicago," Knick 
Coach Pat Riley said. "We know them pretty well. Somewhere, you've got to break 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing had 11 points and Charles Smith eight during a decisive 23-12 burst that 
turned a 49-49 tie into a 72-61 lead after three quarters. The Knicks extended 
the margin to 78-63 early in the fourth quarter before New Jersey rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a big run, they came back, we regrouped and we were able to come away 
with the win," said Ewing, who scored 25 points after Net center Benoit 
Benjamin left the game with five fouls midway through the third quarter. "I 
wouldn't say they were soft, but Armon Gilliam is a lot smaller than I am. I 
got the ball, I made strong moves and they fouled me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing made 12 of 16 free throws along with his 12-for-24 shooting from the 
field. Coleman scored 23 of his 31 points in the second half and finished 21 
for 25 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets, who shot 18.8% in the final quarter of the first three games of the 
series, scored seven consecutive points to close within eight, then made it 
89-84 with 3:20 left on Coleman's two free throws. But they had only one more 
point until the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets shot 31.6% for the game and 35.7% for the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored 18 points and Charles Oakley and John Starks had 16 each for the 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 92, Portland 89 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 10 of his 28 points in the 
final 6:06 as the Rockets blew a 21-point first-half lead, then held on to win 
at Portland and advance to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon also had 16 rebounds for the Midwest Division champions, who won the 
best-of-five series, 3-1, and open the conference semifinals at home against 
Phoenix on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed one of two free throws with 4.2 seconds to play to give the 
Trail Blazers a final chance to tie the score. Portland's Rod Strickland, who 
scored 18 of his 26 points in the second half, threw up a three-pointer from 
the top of the key at the buzzer but it bounced off the front of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Horry added 14 points and Kenny Smith 13 for the Rockets, who were 7-1 
against Portland this season. Clyde Drexler scored 23 points for the Trail 
Blazers, who shot an all-time franchise playoff low 34%.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; DAHLEN WEARS WINNING HAT FOR THE SHARKS, 5-2 
</P>

<P>
 In a season of individual firsts for the Sharks, perhaps their most important 
came Friday night in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an aggressive checking defense in the neutral zone, the Sharks kept 
Toronto's scoring opportunities to a minimum and made the most of their own in 
a 5-2 victory over the Maple Leafs that gave San Jose a 2-1 lead in their 
Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulf Dahlen finished the first playoff hat trick of his career with 2:22 to 
play after taking a lead pass from Tom Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 He skated down the ice with Todd Elik, looking to his teammate as if he was 
about to pass before flipping the puck above goaltender Felix Potvin's left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose goaltender Arturs Irbe faced only 12 shots through the first two 
periods and 21 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Errey and Jamie Baker took turns assisting each other for the other goals 
by the Sharks, who took 27 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikolai Borschevsky scored both of Toronto's goals, his first of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose used a three-goal second-period burst that included the second by 
Dahlen, acquired March 19 in a trade with Dallas, to go up, 4-1. A Toronto 
power-play goal by Borschevsky cut the deficit back to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In a reversal of roles from San Jose's first goal, Errey passed off to Jamie 
Baker at the top of the right circle and Baker wound up and slapped the shot 
into the net 29 seconds into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety seconds later, Dahlen picked up a loose puck from teammate Gaetan 
Duchesne along the boards, skated behind the net and stuffed a wraparound shot 
past Potvin to put San Jose up, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks added a power-play score by Dahlen at 14:25, who beat Potvin up 
close for his fourth goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Toronto on a power play, Borschevsky skated down the middle and put in a 
rebound at 16:59 after Doug Gilmour's shot glanced off Irbe's pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 4, Vancouver 3 -- Neal Broten scored twice and Mike Modano scored the 
go-ahead goal early in the second period, leading the Stars to a victory at 
Vancouver and cutting their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-seven Western 
Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Four will be in Vancouver on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Gagner and Mike Modano also scored as Dallas erased an early two-goal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars scored four consecutive goals to win their third consecutive NHL 
playoff game on the road, with Modano putting Dallas ahead in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks' five-game winning streak was stopped, despite two goals by Trevor 
Linden and another from Pavel Bure. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver managed only two shots on Dallas goalie Andy Moog in the last 
period. The Stars outshot Vancouver, 36-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver led, 2-0, midway through the opening period on power-play goals by 
Linden and Bure, both set up by defenseman Jeff Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas tied the score when Broten scored late in the first period, converting 
a rebound of a shot by Craig Ludwig.

KENTUCKY OAKS; SARDULA UPSETS LAKEWAY BY A HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the same track where his grandfather, J.P. Mayberry, saddled Judge Himes, 
winner of the 1903 Kentucky Derby, trainer Brian Mayberry won the $283,600 
Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs with Sardula on Friday, beating undefeated 
Lakeway by a head in a long stretch battle before 80,321. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, using his whip only once, at the top of the stretch, gave 
Sardula a perfect ride, nursing her to the wire despite the all-out pursuit by 
Lakeway and Kent Desormeaux, who was urging his filly from the sixteenth pole 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself that I had a horse under me that's got a lot of class, so I 
just kept my cool," Delahoussaye said. "She was getting a little tired at the 
end. From the eighth pole on, I just hand rode her. She's got a lot of guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry, 56, formed his own stable in 1966. His training job with Sardula was 
extraordinary. He got her ready to run Friday's 1 1/8 miles after a 6 
1/2-furlong victory at Santa Anita on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 On a track listed as good, Sardula was fifth in the seven-horse field after 
half a mile. Lakeway, who had won four in a row, settled into third behind the 
leaders, Flying In The Lane and Slide Show, and made her move from the outside 
on the far turn. Sardula made up her ground on the inside, but well off the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, the 7-10 favorite, finished two lengths ahead of Dianes Halo. The 
rest of the field, in order of finish: Slew Kitty Slew, Slide Show, Flying In 
The Lane and Fair Kris. Sardula, who races for Jerry and Ann Moss of Los 
Angeles, earned $184,340 and paid $5 to win. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another odds-on favorite, Lure, went down to defeat Friday, finishing second, 
4 1/2 lengths behind Paradise Creek, in the $233,950 Early Times Turf Classic, 
run on a turf course listed as good. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek, ridden by Pat Day and trained by Bill Mott, took the lead when 
the field straightened out for home. Lure, who had been second or third most of 
the way, failed to rally. Lure had won the Early Times a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Creek won for the fourth consecutive time this year, running 1 1/8 
miles in 1:48 1/5 and paying $8.60. Lure finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of Yukon 
Robbery.

AL'S RIVER CAT WIRES 'SLEW FIELD FOR EASY THREE-LENGTH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden Eagle Farm's 7-5 favorite Al's River Cat took command at the start and 
never looked back to win the $56,600 Tsunami Slew Handicap by three lengths 
under jockey Alex Solis Friday night at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third win in eight starts for Al's River Cat, who earned $31,850 
and gave Solis and trainer Lewis Cenicola their second victories of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Al's River Cat, a 3-year-old Kentucky-bred son of Riverman, paid $4.80, $3.40 
and $2.60. Troyalty prompted the pace in second along the rail early, dropped 
back to third on the turn, then finished gamely to take second. 
</P>
<P>
 Troyalty, ridden by Corey Black, returned $3.80 and $2.80. Sharp Try rallied 
from far back to gain third, one length behind Troyalty, and paid $3 to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Al's River Cat covered 5 1/2 furlongs on a firm turf course in 1:02 1/5 under 
117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Indien, Don Icecapade, Windwood Lad, Feliz Hora and College Town 
completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Al's River Cat has never failed to earn a check in eight starts and his 
earnings now stand at $92,550.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; EX-GOAT WINS WITH A NEW ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After parading a good-luck goat around Wrigley Field, then ending a 
season-long losing streak there, it's no surprise that Chicago Manager Tom 
Trebelhorn took one on the road to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a surprise that it wasn't Anthony Young, who beat the Pirates, 10-1, 
Friday for his first victory as a starting pitcher since April 9, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he endured a major league-record 27-game losing streak, broken 
only by a victory last season in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to tempt fate after Wednesday's victory at home, Trebelhorn included 
a plastic goat in his road gear. The Cubs hit five homers, including two each 
by Sammy Sosa and Glenallen Hill, among their 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid homage to the goat, and then we went out and played a good game," 
Trebelhorn said. "You don't count on getting five homers, but there weren't any 
cheapies. They were way up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Young (1-2) had it easy after a seven-run third inning, when Sosa and Ryne 
Sandberg hit consecutive homers and Hill followed Mark Grace's single with the 
11th upper-deck homer in the 24-year history of Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's shot was estimated at 457 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate Manager Jim Leyland aired out his clubhouse. Much of his displeasure 
was directed at starting pitcher Denny Neagle (2-4), who gave up three homers 
in a four-batter stretch of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He chewed us pretty good," Neagle said. "Everyone needs chewing out sooner or 
later, and I certainly did." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, New York 2 -- John Franco walked four in the ninth inning, 
forcing home the tying and winning runs as the Cardinals rallied at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mets leading, 2-1, Franco (0-2) walked Todd Zeile with one out, and 
Mark Whiten singled with two out. Pinch-hitter Brian Jordan walked, loading the 
bases, and then Franco walked pinch-hitter Gerald Perry on a 3-and-2 pitch. 
Terry McGriff, another pinch-hitter, walked on a 3-and-1 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 John Habyan (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth in relief of Bob Tewksbury, who 
had won his first six starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, Montreal 0 -- Fred McGriff hit two home runs and Greg Maddux 
pitched a four-hitter for the Braves at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (5-2) had a no-hitter until Marquis Grissom lined a single to center 
field leading off the seventh inning. He lowered his league-leading earned-run 
average to 0.94 and struck out five in his third complete game this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, Houston 3 -- Tim Pugh overcame his erratic pitching with clutch 
hitting at Cincinnati, going two for two with a pivotal RBI single that rallied 
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugh (3-1) and Astro starter Pete Harnisch (2-3) both struggled in a steady 
rain, with Pugh's at-bats making up for his erratic 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell added a solo homer off the facing of the upper deck in left 
field, his eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 9, Philadelphia 5 -- Dave Weathers won his fifth consecutive start and 
Charles Johnson homered and scored three runs in his major league debut for the 
Marlins at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Weathers (5-1) gave up four runs and 10 hits in six innings. He struck out one 
and walked three in helping the Marlins (16-13) move three games over .500 for 
the first time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was catching because Benito Santiago is injured and sitting out the 
second game of a four-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 8, Colorado 0 -- Andy Benes pitched a four-hit shutout and Phil 
Plantier hit two home runs to lead the Padres at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Benes (2-5) struck out 10 for the sixth shutout of his career and the first 
complete game by a Padre pitcher all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Plantier hit a bases-empty homer in the third and two-run shot in the eighth. 
Arci Cianfrocco added a solo homer and a sacrifice fly for the Padres, who have 
won four of their last five games.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MURRAY, MARTINEZ PROSPER IN HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like old times in Baltimore -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray homered and Dennis Martinez pitched a three-hitter, but the home 
team lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Murray talked to no one. Some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray and Martinez teamed to help the Cleveland Indians end a four-game 
losing streak Friday night with a 4-2 victory. Carlos Baerga doubled home two 
runs in the 10th inning to make it a perfect homecoming for Martinez, who last 
pitched in Baltimore in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who spent a decade with the Orioles, was given a lengthy standing 
ovation when he took the mound in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to tip my hat because otherwise they would never sit down," Martinez 
said. "That was a very emotional time. I almost started getting tears. . . . I 
think that was what really inspired me to pitch the way I did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (1-3), who spent the previous eight seasons with Montreal, retired 14 
in a row before giving up a one-out walk in the 10th, won in the American 
League for the first time since September of 1985. He walked four and struck 
out nine in his 11th three-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, playing his first regular-season game in Baltimore since leaving the 
Orioles after the 1988 season, also got a lengthy standing ovation from the 
sellout crowd. In his second at-bat, he hit his seventh homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A changeup," Baltimore starter Mike Mussina said. "I think he set me up by 
looking bad on the first two. He's not going to the Hall of Fame for no 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has homered in 31 different ballparks, one short of the record shared 
by Frank Robinson and Rusty Staub. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, Boston 1 -- The opposition has been lost in the glare of the 
Boston Red Sox's major league-best record over the season's first month, but 
they're playing back in the East. The glare in New York is on the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Key pitched a four-hitter for his first complete game of the season as 
New York stopped the Red Sox's seven-game winning streak. Boston had won eight 
of 10 and was 20-7 as the night began, but the record was largely compiled 
against the Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (5-1) struck out two and walked none in his first complete game since Aug. 
5. He is 11-5 against the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill walked in his first at-bat against Aaron Sele (3-1), had an RBI 
single in a three-run fourth inning and singled leading off the sixth. He hit 
into a double play ending the eighth but still increased his major 
league-leading average to .455. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Toronto 1 -- Cal Eldred pitched a three-hitter, and Darryl 
Hamilton and Kevin Seitzer each drove in two runs to lead the Brewers at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldred (3-3) gave up a two-out single to Paul Molitor in the first inning but 
retired 13 in a row before Pat Borders' leadoff double in the sixth. He struck 
out three in his first complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays have lost three in a row and five of their last six. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing pitcher Dave Stewart (2-3) removed himself in the sixth inning after 
suffering a pulled groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 9, Seattle 4 -- Tony Phillips' two-run double keyed a four-run second 
inning, and Randy Johnson's problems at Tiger Stadium continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (2-3), the only pitcher to no-hit the Tigers in the last 21 years, has 
never won at Tiger Stadium. He is 0-4 with an 8.17 earned-run average in his 
five starts in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the Mariners to 2-12 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Minnesota 0 -- Rookie Rick Helling gave up nine hits in his first 
major league shutout and complete game, leading the Rangers at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hulse singled home the go-ahead run in the sixth inning, and Will Clark 
drove in two runs for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helling (3-0) struck out two and walked one as the Rangers won for the seventh 
time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Chicago 5 -- Felix Jose drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth 
inning as the Royals rallied at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City trailed, 5-1, entering the seventh before tying the score on Gary 
Gaetti's three-run homer and Vince Coleman's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals have won three games in a row and five of their last six.

PIERCING VOLLEYS TAKE BRAHMAS TO TITLE GAME; MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: HIGA AND RING 
POWER THREE-GAME SWEEP OF GROSSMONT IN SEMIFINALS OF STATE TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone on the floor knows that Gabe Higa and Jason Ring are the go-to men 
for the Pierce College men's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody has figured out how to stop them this season and Friday night in 
the semifinals of the state championships at Santa Barbara City College, 
Grossmont became the latest team to miserably fail in the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa had a match-high 20 kills and Ring added 12 to lead the Brahmas to a 
15-4, 15-8, 15-7 victory over Grossmont and a berth in the title match tonight 
at 7:30 against Orange Coast, which swept American River in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second appearance in the final for Pierce in three seasons and 
the second in the past four years for Orange Coast. The Brahmas (20-0) won the 
tournament in 1992 and Orange Coast took the trophy the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa, a left-handed freshman opposite hitter from Quartz Hill High, started 
slowly and had only three kills in the first game, as Ring (six kills) and Brad 
Schultz (five kills) sparked the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of tight in the first game," Higa said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he got loose in the second game, Grossmont already was in serious 
trouble and headed for more. He slammed home 12 kills in the game as the 
Brahmas pulled away after committing a few hitting and passing errors that kept 
Grossmont in the game for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabe was unstoppable and (setter) Dan Nash did a good job of moving the ball 
around," Pierce Coach Ken Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pierce hitters repeatedly found holes in the Grossmont defense and kept 
the pressure up without much of a letdown throughout the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "That team, as big and as tough as they are, we were just outmanned," 
Grossmont Coach Fred Featherstone said. "We didn't play any defense behind the 
block and that killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmont (15-5) led, 2-0, in the first game before Pierce went on a 13-0 run 
behind Ring, a freshman outside hitter, and Schultz, a sophomore outside 
hitter. In addition to his five kills in the game, Schultz had two service aces 
and one block for a point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I normally would take (Schultz) out on serve situations, but he did such a 
good job, I left him in there," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmont rallied in the second game from a 4-1 deficit to tie, 4-4, but 
continued to make numerous passing and hitting mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded points early in the third game but Pierce turned it up and 
went ahead, 10-3, on a double block by Higa and Schultz. The Brahmas wrapped it 
up on a hitting error by Grossmont.

SECOND PLACE GOOD ENOUGH FOR CAMARILLO; TRACK AND FIELD: RUNNER-UP FINISH IN 
MARMONTE FINALS GIVES SCORPIONS OVERALL TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High won the boys' team title in the Marmonte League track and 
field finals at Camarillo High on Friday night, but the overall league title 
went to Camarillo by virtue of the Scorpions' second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo and Royal tied for first in the boys' dual-meet standings with 5-0 
records -- the regular-season finale among the Scorpions, Highlanders and Simi 
Valley was rained out -- and Thousand Oaks finished third with a 5-2 mark, so 
Camarillo won its first league title since 1982 by finishing behind Thousand 
Oaks but ahead of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, led by distance runners Jeff Fischer and Kevin Marsden, and 
sprinter Rob Scherrei, totaled 148 1/2 points on Friday, followed by Camarillo 
(108 1/2) and Royal (79). 
</P>
<P>
 The Scorpions trailed Royal, 71-55, after 11 events, but outscored the 
Highlanders, 53 1/2-8, over the final five events to wrap up their first league 
title since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Sadowsky started the Scorpions' late run with a fourth-place finish of 
23.19 seconds in the 200 -- an event won by Scherrei in 22.45 -- and Matt 
Alecock led a 1-4-5 finish for Camarillo in the pole vault by clearing a 
personal best of 13 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer -- who won the long jump (23-2) and high jump (6-8) earlier in 
the meet -- and Mike Wygant placed first (44-8 3/4) and second (44-1 1/2) in 
the triple jump for the Scorpions and Eleazar Hernandez followed that with a 
second-place finish behind Jeff Fischer, 9 minutes 18.77 seconds to 9:18.79, in 
the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez finished third behind Fischer and Marsden in a superb 1,600 earlier 
in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez led the field through the first two laps in 61 seconds and 2:06, but 
Fischer moved into the lead with 500 meters left and held off the fast-closing 
Marsden to win in a personal best of 4 minutes 16.94 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden placed second in a personal best of 4:18.09 with Hernandez third in 
4:22.21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleazar did a great job of setting up that race," Thousand Oaks distance 
coach Jack Farrell said. "We didn't come in here looking to run great times, we 
were just looking for place. But when Eleazar took it out, the times were 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherrei and Marsden added victories in the 400 (49.99) and 800 (personal best 
of 1:57.15) for Thousand Oaks, which finished second behind Camarillo in the 
overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' competition, Channel Islands, led by double winners Dolores 
Tuimoloau and Shawanda Hotchkiss, and Thousand Oaks, led by distance runner Kim 
Mortensen, tied for first place with 105 points, followed by two-time defending 
league champion Agoura with 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, the league dual-meet champion with a 7-0 record, won its 11th 
overall league title in the last 14 years for Coach Art Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kim Mortensen led the Lancers with victories in the 1,600 (5:05.72) 
and 3,200 (11:11.05) and ran 2:20.47 to finish second in the 800 behind 
Westlake sophomore Patricia Gibby, who timed a personal best of 2:17.27. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Prater accounted for 38 of Agoura's points as the UC Davis-bound senior 
won the 100 high hurdles in 15.32, the 300 lows in 47.15 and the 200 in 26.00, 
and finished second in the triple jump with a leap of 35-11. 
</P>

 Prater's marks in the 100 highs, 200 and triple jump were all school records. 
Tuimoloau was victorious in the shotput (46-1 1/2) and discus (125-7), and 
Hotchkiss placed first in the long jump (17-5 3/4) and triple jump (personal 
best of 37-2) for Channel Islands.

PALMDALE IS WORKED OVER BY HOLIDAY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: ANTELOPE VALLEY 
FRESHMAN CLEANS UP DURING AND AFTER 4-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 After Antelope Valley High pitcher Jeremy Holiday shut down Golden 
League-leading Palmdale on three hits Friday, his real work began. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday is a freshman, so after every game he is saddled with the tedious 
tasks of watering the field, raking the mound and emptying the water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Coach Ed T'Sas watched his star pitcher dump the leftover 
water out of the bucket while Holiday's teammates joked and yelled in the 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just won the game and you've still got all those little duties," he said. 
"Isn't it great?" 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday smiled. Life didn't seem such a chore after the crucial 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale had to swallow a bitter pill, though. Its ace, senior David Glick -- 
who was all but unhittable in his previous three starts -- surrendered three 
runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough for Antelope Valley because the Falcon hitters took a 
collective vacation against Holiday, making his second start of the season and 
first in league play. And so the Antelopes (9-9, 8-4 in league play), who have 
three league games remaining, moved to within one-half game of Palmdale (16-6, 
9-4) in the league standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid pitched good," Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell said. "We didn't swing 
the bat well and we have to give him part of the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's only breakthrough came in the third inning, when shortstop Jerome 
Payton's two-out double drove in Kevin Habeger. But Holiday (5-2) minimized the 
damage by inducing Bob Harmon to fly out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale didn't advance a runner past first base the remainder of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous at first, but once I got through the first inning I 
felt like it was going to be a really good game for us," Holiday said. "I felt 
like we were really going to take it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. Palmdale's Glick (7-2) struck out 44 batters in his previous 
three starts -- all one-sided victories -- including 13 on Tuesday when he 
pitched a one-hitter against Ridgecrest Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothwell hoped to get three solid innings from Glick (the weekly limit for 
innings pitched is 10) against Antelope Valley. But in the first inning, Glick 
gave up run-scoring single to Marcus Armstrong and a two-run double to Charlie 
Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been doing it all year," Bothwell said of the powerful left-hander. 
"Normally, he can rebound pretty quickly, but he didn't quite have his good 
stuff today. He just wasn't as sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't throw as hard as when well-rested, either. A scout timed Glick at 84 
miles per hour on a radar gun Friday, about three to four m.p.h. slower than 
usual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glick recorded eight of his nine outs on strikeouts, but gave up six hits, 
four runs and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday, in contrast, didn't blow anyone away. He simply threw his sneaky 
fastball and accurate curve to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him to come through like that, it's a really big victory for him," T'Sas 
said. "And for the team."

PREP ROUNDUP; CALVARY CHAPEL RALLIES TO WIN, CLINCHES LEAGUE VOLLEYBALL TITLE 
</P>

<P>
 Calvary Chapel swept the final three games to stay undefeated and clinch the 
Olympic League volleyball title by beating visiting Whittier Christian, 13-15, 
5-15, 15-8, 15-8, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (14-0, 10-0) let a 13-10 lead slip away in the first game, when 
Whittier Christian came back with five straight points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds took their momentum into the second game, going on runs of five 
and six points to take an 11-3 lead. Calvary Chapel committed four serving 
errors, three ball-handling errors and four hitting errors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles recovered in the third, coming back from a 4-2 deficit to tie, 
then staved off Whittier Christian's rally, holding the Heralds at 9-8 and 
scoring the next six points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles took a 9-2 lead in the fourth game then let the Heralds (14-2, 8-2) 
come to within 10-8 before edging ahead to take the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth game, the Eagles went up, 10-2, then sat at 12-2 while the 
Heralds scored seven unanswered points to come within three, 12-9. Finally, 
Steve LeFevre and Aaron Fountain killed the ball and LeFevre combined with 
Jason Mandall to block Ryan McGuyre for the game and the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played (Whittier Christian) four times this year," Calvary Chapel Coach 
Chuck Wright said. "It's hard to beat a team four times. And we're in a slump; 
it's been a long season. But the guys decided they wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Philip Schildts led the Eagles with 31 kills; his younger brother 
Robert contributed 20. LeFevre led both teams with three solo blocks and two 
block assists. Tim Willey led the Heralds with 19 kills. HEATHER STEVENS

VOLLEYBALL / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; UCLA MOVES CLOSER TO RETAINING ITS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HORNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Scates had the matchup he wanted and UCLA created a mismatch in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Bruins jumped on an undermanned and ailing Indiana-Purdue at 
Ft. Wayne squad Friday night and advanced to the NCAA men's volleyball 
championship game with a 15-3, 15-8, 15-4 victory at the Allen County War 
Memorial Coliseum. UCLA will play Penn State in the final tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA defeated Ft. Wayne twice earlier this season, but needed four games to 
beat the Volleydons (20-7) here in January. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the Bruins only minutes to set the tone this time, taking a 6-0 lead 
in the opening game and never letting the Volleydons challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, of the three teams (in the Final Four), we would actually be more 
focused on IPFW than anybody else," Scates said, citing the previous matches 
this year. "It was a good draw for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before a mostly hostile crowd of 7,227 didn't faze the defending 
national champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the crowd," Scates said. "We like the noise. It doesn't matter if 
they're cheering for us or against us." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA attacked with a tournament-record .542 clip, including .600 efficiency in 
the opening game. Freshman quick hitter Paul Nihipali scored on 13 of his 16 
kill attempts with no errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really concerned about Paul. He was horrible in the warm-up," Scates 
said. "He was pumped up and excited. That helped him with his hitting (in the 
match)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nygaard had 17 kills and Stein Metzger had 50 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloy Ball, Ft. Wayne's All-American setter, played despite a broken left index 
finger. He attempted only one set in the first game, but finished with 19 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins -- seeking their 28th consecutive victory, second consecutive title 
and 15th overall crown -- have not played Penn State this season. The Nittany 
Lions (24-3) advanced by beating Ball State, 9-15, 15-7, 15-10, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State started sluggishly against Ball State (27-10) but grabbed the 
momentum midway through the second game and cruised from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a veteran club. Those hitters have been playing a long time," Scates 
said of Penn State. "They're very savvy. They look very good."

GOLF ROUNDUP; DALY SHOOTS CONSERVATIVE 64 AT ATLANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the hilly, 7,018-yard Atlanta Country Club course, John Daly made a 
concession to the Georgia pines that line the narrow fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 He used his driver only twice, on No. 1 and No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep it in play on this course," Daly said Friday after shooting 
an eight-under-par 64 to build a two-shot lead over Nike Tour player Brian 
Henninger at the halfway point of the BellSouth Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played it smart yesterday and played it smart today," Daly said of his 
strategy to use irons off the tees. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64 left Daly with a 36-hole score of 133, 11 under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger, who narrowly missed retaining his exempt status on the PGA Tour 
last year, had a second-round 67. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly had shot a 69 in the opening round, despite having no practice on the 
Atlanta layout, on which he had competed only once, three years ago. He left 
Atlanta on Tuesday night to go to Orlando for a court appearance dealing with 
his visitation rights with his daughter, Shynah. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 6 1/2 hours down, 2 1/2 hours in court, 6 1/2 hours back," Daly said, 
adding that he drove because, "I hate flying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two bounces -- off a rake and a rock -- led to two eagles and a tie for the 
lead of Legends of Golf tournament at Austin, Tex., as the teams of Chi Chi 
Rodriguez-Jim Dent and Dale Douglass-Charles Coody each shot opening-round 63s 
on the 6,777-yard Barton Creek Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Four teams were a stroke behind, at eight under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez eagled the par-five, 500-yard eighth hole when his fairway wood 
ricocheted off a bunker rake and rolled about four feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Coody's eagle came on the 555-yard fifth hole when his four-wood hit a rock in 
a creek and came out about 60 feet from the hole and he chipped in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Crafter paid no attention to an ankle injury and shot an eight-under-par 
64 for a one-stroke lead after the opening round of the $525,000 Sara Lee 
Classic at the 6,311-yard Hermitage Golf Course in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Mallon and Laura Davies had 65s. 
</P>
<P>
 Crafter had strained her left ankle Thursday when she stepped off a curb while 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian native was in some pain, but had her ankle taped and started 
off quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 Crafter, who matched her career low, birdied Nos. 12 and 13 before bogeying 
the 14th hole. She responded with three straight birdies, finishing with eight 
for the round.

RAIN PUTS EL TORO'S GAME, HOPES ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two outs short of taking sole possession of first place in the South Coast 
League, rain halted El Toro's immediate hopes of winning its second title in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers held a 4-1 lead over fourth-ranked Mater Dei with one out in the 
bottom of the fifth inning when umpire Wally Divino suspended Friday's game at 
Mile Square Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we'll treat it as a suspended game, pending a decision from 
(Southern Section administrator) Karen Hellyer," Divino said. "There's some 
confusion in the National Federation rules as to how the game is to be 
treated." 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be resumed at 3:15 p.m. Monday at Mile Square Park, or replayed, 
depending on Hellyer's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we scored too many runs," quipped El Toro Coach Jim Daugherty, whose 
team scored two more runs than it needed in the top of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (18-8, 6-1) scored twice in the second inning to take a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei is 17-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hellyer's decision also will affect the resumption of the Ocean 
View-Huntington Beach game, which was tied, 0-0, with one out in the bottom of 
the fifth inning. Those teams will meet again at 3:15 p.m. Monday at Worthy 
Park. MARTIN HENDERSON

TENNIS ROUNDUP; WILANDER'S SLIDE ENDS ON CLAY AT PINEHURST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vince Spadea's game suddenly collapsed and Mats Wilander advanced to his first 
tournament semifinal in four years Friday with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory in the 
U.S. Tennis Assn. Clay Court Classic in Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the No. 1 player in the world, Wilander was last in a semifinal at 
Itaparica, Brazil, in 1990, his last tournament victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Spadea, Wilander came to Pinehurst as a wild-card entry. Had he not made 
the semifinals, he might have played in a legends event nearby this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think winning three matches, and especially winning a match like this today 
where I really didn't feel good in the beginning and I wasn't focused . . . it 
feels good to come back and know that I have the guts and whatever to stay with 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilander will play top-seeded Todd Martin, the lone survivor from the run of 
upsets that marked the second round. Martin beat Fabrice Santoro, 6-3, 6-2. 
Martin and Wilander played last weekend in Atlanta, where Martin won in 
straight sets in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal, Jared Palmer will play Mark Woodforde. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, struggling to stay in the top 100, took a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over 
Francisco Clavet, and Woodforde won a match of left-handers against Franco 
Davin, 6-4, 7-5 (7-3). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the only sure things so far in an upset-filled Italian Open, top-seeded 
Conchita Martinez and No. 2 Martina Navratilova stayed on course with 
quarterfinal victories on clay in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, ranked No. 3 in the world and defending Italian Open champion, 
defeated eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, 6-4, 6-4, and Navratilova eliminated 
No. 7 Naoko Sawamatsu, 6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals, Martinez will play Karina Habsudova of Slovakia, who ended 
Italian hopes by beating Adriana Serra-Zannetti, 6-3, 6-2, in a match between 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova will take on Irena Spirlea, who eliminated ninth-seeded Judith 
Wiesner, 6-0, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; LAGUNA HILLS RALLIES TO KNOCK OFF 
TRABUCO HILLS

<P>
 Trabuco Hills lost its first Pacific Coast League game this season when Laguna 
Hills rallied for a 4-3 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off Tuesday's 15-0 loss to the Mustangs, the Hawks scored twice in the 
bottom of the seventh to retain their playoff hopes. They won by combining the 
pitching of Ryan McDermott, the baserunning of Ron DeVito and the hitting of 
Brett Nista and Matt Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 "McDermott pitched a beautiful game," Laguna Hills Coach Pete Tereschuk said. 
"It was the best pitched game we've had here in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott (3-1), usually a reliever, yielded five hits, struck out five and 
walked none. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawk rally began when Rick Stilson's bouncer to pitcher Bryan Kelley was 
dropped, and Nista lined deep to left for a double. An intentional walk to 
DeVito loaded the bases. Ian Jensen's bouncer to shortstop Nick Punto scored 
Stilson when DeVito slid under the tag at second. Nista then scored the winning 
run on Evans' fly ball to deep left. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (17-6, 12-1 in league) took a 3-0 lead in the third inning after 
Dan DelFium led off with a single and McDermott's 1-2 pitch hit catcher John 
Lukin. Brad Cervantes' sacrifice bunt moved both runners into scoring position. 
Consecutive run-scoring singles by Punto, Justin Poe and Jake Anderson staked 
the Mustangs to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (10-11, 7-6) began its comeback in the bottom of the third after 
Nista lined a single to left, stole second and scored when Lukin took Jason 
Hogan's bouncer in front of the plate and overthrew first base, allowing Nista 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista scored three runs and went two for three to raise his career hit total 
to 144, three shy of the Orange County mark of 147 set by Tustin's Shawn Green 
from 1988 to 1991. Nista scored the Hawks' second run in the fifth when he 
reached second on a two-base error, third on a sacrifice and scored on DeVito's 
grounder to third. TOM BIRSCHBACH

PREP TRACK AND FIELD ROUNDUP; WOODBRIDGE BOYS WIN THE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Young thought he had done everything he could for Woodbridge to win the 
Sea View League team title Friday night at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warrior senior won the 100 (10.98) and 200 meters (22.34) and anchored the 
1,600 relay team to an apparent victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But a celebratory flip of the baton cost the Warriors the relay victory and 
nearly their third consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the final relay, Woodbridge was tied with Saddleback at 73 points. A 
victory in the relay would have ensured a team title for Woodbridge with the 
triple jump to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge was disqualified immediately, giving Saddleback the lead (83 
points) with one event to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rule is a rule," said Warrior Coach George Varvas, referring to one that 
limits youthful exuberance and taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not in touch with reality when you run a leg of that time," added 
Varvas, whose star pupil held off Saddleback's Matt Lete. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the disqualification, Young accounted for 20 of the 88 points the 
Warriors scored in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior triple jumpers Jimmy Matsushima and Tony Muniz, who finished second 
and third, clinched the team title by one point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita girls' team ran away with the team title behind strong 
performances from Barbara Scheil and Heather Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheil, a junior, won the 100 (12.87) and 200 (26.07) in addition to anchoring 
the Eagles' victory in the 400 relay (a county-leading 49.44). 
</P>
<P>
 Novak won the long jump (17-5 wind aided), 100-meter high hurdles (15.18) and 
triple jump (35-5 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the key to our winning tonight was that we had so many girls advance 
into the (league) finals," said Eagle Coach Cindy Schaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle freshman Katie Nuanes won the 800 (2:23.61) and the 1,600 relay 
(4:05.59). 
</P>
<P>
 The individual highlight of the meet for the boys came in the day's first 
event, the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's Wade Tift assumed the state lead with a personal best effort 
of 61-6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Freeway League boys' track and field finals: 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra boys win -- Mark Gonzalez of Sonora, the winner of three events, was 
named the athlete of the meet. The junior sprinter won the 200 meters (22.99), 
triple jump (42-5 1/2) and anchored the winning mile relay (3:36.19). 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Wilson of Sunny Hills set a league record of 50.80 in the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra won the title with 156 points, followed by Sonora (114), Sunny Hills 
(72), Buena Park (59), Troy (22) and Fullerton (18). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Freeway League girls' track and field finals: 
</P>

MICHAEL WALSH, ENGINEER OF TENNECO REVIVAL, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tenneco Chairman Michael H. Walsh, a hard-charging executive who engineered 
turnarounds at two major corporations and served as U.S. attorney in San Diego, 
died Friday at age 51 after a lengthy battle with brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh relinquished control of the Houston-based conglomerate and the title of 
chief executive in February to concentrate on his treatment and recovery from 
the tumor, which was diagnosed in January, 1993. He retained the title of 
chairman while on medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tenneco and Mike Walsh's many friends mourn the loss of our remarkable leader 
and friend," said Dana Mead, who succeeded Walsh as Tenneco's chief executive. 
"Mike's legacy is our shared inspiration to fight on and never settle for 
second best." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, a graduate of Stanford University and Yale Law School, stepped down as 
chief executive of Tenneco only a few months after he announced that tests had 
indicated chemotherapy and radiation treatments had managed to stop the growth 
of the tumor, which had begun to break up. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors said Friday that the cancer had recurred, and Walsh died of 
complications from it at the Institute for Rehabilitation and Research in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenneco, which will donate $1 million to the University of Texas in Walsh's 
honor, is expected to name a new chairman next week after its annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether as a high school football star, a San Diego trial lawyer or a 
corporate chairman, Walsh was known for a competitive and ambitious nature that 
left him restless for the next challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man of tremendous energy and ability," said John Lightner, a senior 
partner in the San Diego law firm of Lightner Castro Schaefer & Hunter, where 
Walsh worked as a trial lawyer and partner in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, President Jimmy Carter named Walsh the U.S. attorney for Southern 
California in San Diego. During his brief tenure, he mounted a successful case 
that led to the prosecution of a San Diego City Council member for customs 
fraud. But his office failed to convict two U.S. Border Patrol agents charged 
with brutality against illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh entered the corporate world in 1980 when he joined Cummins Engine Co. as 
a vice president in its international manufacturing operations. Four years 
later, he was executive vice president of Cummins and a member of its board. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Walsh became chairman and chief executive of Union Pacific Railroad 
Co. He was credited with a restructuring that boosted productivity and quality 
at the nation's third-largest railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh faced an even bigger restructuring in the fall of 1991 when he became 
president of Tenneco, which owns a variety of companies, from natural gas 
operations to auto parts. Within a relatively short and tumultuous period, 
Walsh halved the dividend, sold off divisions and laid off workers. The painful 
changes resulted in a profit of $426 million in 1993, following combined losses 
of more than $2 billion in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh is survived by his wife, Joan, of Houston and three college-age 
children.

THEATER REVIEW; CHEMISTRY MAKES 'KISS' MEMORABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sculptor Auguste Rodin once called the human body "a walking cathedral." For 
others, it's a house we live in, but few of us take care of it, and even fewer 
give it Rodin's high respect. Most of us would gladly change bodies with 
someone younger, better looking, sturdier. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the very serious idea behind Craig Lucas' rather light comedy-drama 
"Prelude to a Kiss" at the Huntington Beach Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 It also says something about the power of love and the trauma of embracing 
maturity. Peter and Rita are young and single and carefree. Until they meet at 
a party. Lightning strikes, they fall in love and almost immediately decide to 
marry, a union conceived in heaven.  
</P>
<P>
 At their wedding, lightning strikes again, when a strange interloper, a 
wandering Old Man, asks to kiss the bride. The confusion that results from Rita 
finding herself in the Old Man's body, and he in hers, reverberates in both 
families and, particularly, in the marriage between Peter and Rita. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret in any production of this play is in the casting of the three 
principals, and director Laurie T. Freed has made some sharp choices. She also 
weaves the matched and mismatched personality threads lucidly between Rita and 
the Old Man, between both of them and Peter. Some of her tempos could be goosed 
slightly to give the text a brighter gleam, but her sense of the interior 
rhythms of the scenes is faultless. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Louise David as Rita and Marc Marosi as Peter wear the roles like 
gloves. In the beginning, her candor and piquancy, his energy and naivete, set 
a tone that gradually darkens as Peter realizes his new wife is involved in a 
psychic shell-game. They're both attractive and have a good comic sensibility, 
Marosi especially in the early scenes, when he watches Rita with the adoration 
verging on panic of a cocker spaniel puppy greeting his master.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob May as the Old Man is a charmer, once Peter realizes that the stranger's 
body holds his love, and the Old Man becomes Rita. May's gentle shading is just 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Siegel-Berryhill and Dan Rodgers are fine and funny as Rita's 
well-to-do, suburbanite parents, among a good supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of set pieces that are pushed surreptitiously onstage for designer 
Martin G. Eckmann's multi-settings is effective, but it would be more so if the 
stage area weren't so deep. There's a lot of wasted space behind the action; 
lighting designer Terri Foy-Verhaegen's pools of light help enclose the scenes 
well but don't solve the problem. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; BRIT BY BRIT, COMEDY SERIES 'GOD' AGES WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first episode of "Waiting for God," a British comedy series set in a 
nursing home, resident Diana (Stephanie Cole) comments that no one ever sees a 
hearse on the driveway -- they come at night, while everyone sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun comes up and everyone looks at the untouched bowl of Frosties" on the 
breakfast table, she notes wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting for God," a 27-part series that premieres tonight at 9 on KOCE 
Channel 50, has many of the attributes we've come to expect from the better 
British sitcoms: sharp comic dialogue and well-drawn characters. It also has 
the added kick of a real cause, as it rebels against the way society discards 
its elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The society in question is British, not American, but the attitudes are 
parallel, although the country-manor elegance of the show's Bayview Retirement 
Homes is a far cry from the institutional sterility typical of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's episode, we meet the protagonists: Diana, whose razor tongue cuts 
all those who dare draw near, and new resident Tom (Graham Crowden), whose 
loopy zest for life fuels his determination not to give in to indignity. They 
meet cute, British-style, as Tom asks Diana if he may sit with her at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit, stand, do whatever you like," she replies. "You can burn to the ground 
for all I care." His offbeat charms, and impersonations of everything from emus 
to Tom Jones, fail to win her over at first: "Cloying old fuddies like you give 
the elderly a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
 She has a point. He is a little cloying at first, a bit too eager to express 
his eccentricity. But the show soon settles into a more comfortable rhythm, and 
it becomes clear that together this pair will be working to shake up the 
socially dictated torpor of most of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowden and Cole invest their characters with a dignity that often escapes 
depictions of older citizens on American television, and the series promises 
its share of laughs. Here's hoping that they don't soften Cole's character too 
much -- she has the best laughs of the opening episode. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Waiting for God" premieres tonight at 9 and continues each Saturday in that 
time slot on KOCE Channel 50. Repeats Sundays at 10:30 p.m.

BRING ON THE BEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Methinks something is rotten in the state of American television. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, one needs only to flip through the TV channels to see that the 
American public seems to have taken a fancy to scaring itself to death. 
</P>
<P>
 What passes for documentary is nothing but a thinly veiled pitch for the 
latest: a) deadly disease, b) social ill, or c) heinous crime sweeping the 
nation. Gee, I remember when watching a documentary meant seeing a Jacques 
Cousteau or National Geographic special. Times have changed, and definitely not 
for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some might say, "Learning about rare, deadly, airborne parasites is far 
more important than learning about how polar bears mate." I beg to differ. What 
good is it to instill fear and paranoia in people when there is already enough 
fear and paranoia in this country to last two lifetimes? 
</P>
<P>
 I say bring back the polar bears; they've been relegated to the Discovery 
Channel for long enough. They're a lot more interesting to watch, and, besides, 
they won't hurt you unless you bother them while they're mating.

DIRECTOR RICHARD RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having had the privilege of being directed by Richard Rush in "The Stunt Man," 
I find The Times' comments regarding him to be, at best, unfathomable ("Who's 
Got the Right to 'Color' Final Cut?," April 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The Richard Rush I know and worked with is a man of impeccable integrity, 
ferocious perfectionism and loyalty. How these traits can somehow be perceived 
as character flaws is beyond my comprehension. I applaud his "24-hours-a-day, 
7-days-a-week" dedication to a film into which he has poured his blood, sweat 
and soul. STEVE RAILSBACK

PLAZA DE LA RAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Morning Report's "Plaza to Lose Leader" (March 26) about Gema 
Sandoval leaving her post as executive director at Plaza de la Raza, The Times 
states that she leaves "during a period of turmoil." The Board of Directors of 
Plaza de la Raza takes exception to that statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza de la Raza has never been more prolific in its programming, more active 
in its community and more visible in the arts and culture area. We service more 
than 600 children a week through our after-school program. We are in the midst 
of the second annual Nuevo LA Chicano MusicWorks Competition, which had brought 
in more than 100 entries in four musical categories. We are putting the 
finishing touches to a stellar summer season, our third annual "Con Sabor 
Latino" presenting series. We are beginning a thorough, much needed, upgrade of 
the whole facility. And we have just recruited four very capable and respected 
board members who would not have lent their names and reputations to the 
organization if they had felt that we were "in turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 We are grateful for Sandoval's years of service, and we recognize the tenacity 
of her vision, which has helped to poise Plaza as a national leader in 
community arts programming. And, although she will no longer be an employee of 
Plaza, because she is a Chicana artist of this community, her relationship with 
us will continue throughout the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Our employees are pursuing the issue of organizing themselves through a union. 
The board of directors has recognized their union and is going through careful 
negotiations with their representative. We hardly consider that turmoil. What 
we are worried about, however, is the erroneous perception that The Times has 
given with its inaccurate reporting and the repercussions that will have on the 
credibility of Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
 I, as chairperson of the board, must always ensure that I maintain an unbiased 
view toward the organization, one that serves the needs of the organization as 
well as protects the rights of the employees. I know that you, too, seek that 
level of impartiality. I, therefore, ask that you print this letter so that we 
are allowed to write our own history and dispel any doubts about the future of 
our organization.

 In my mind's eye I can see my whole family in the gas chambers gasping for

 I survived to remember, and I say to you the skinheads are not a passing fad. 
They are real. I saw the German Hitler Youth. I was there when it started.

TORI AMOS IS WELCOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tori Amos' performance did not appeal to Steve Hochman ("Tori Amos: Too Much 
Drama, Not Enough Song," March 24). He claims she made us count every one of 
the stars.I wasn't counting any stars. I felt I was welcomed by a warm 
individual who is very open about her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Very little music can stand up to the test of being performed by a solo 
vocalist with an instrument. It is a very exposed place. At no point did she 
"spoil" the effect. She is gifted as a songwriter and a performer. Burn the 
metronome and backing tracks, let's have the real thing, the unpolished stone 
from the heart, the unspoiled natural beauty of the Earth, untouched by human 
hands.

 Big strokes of blue and white are one way to brighten a table this summer, 
especially when set with dinnerware and linens in the same vein. 
</P>
<P>
 From the ELSA candlesticks ($9) to the ELSA melamine ad earthenware plates 
(from $3.95 and up) in four designs, brilliant blue and white stripes form the 
backdrop for hearty servings of corn on the cob and such. Coordinating serving 
pieces, such as the ELSA metal trivet ($8.75) or melamine tray ($12), are 
emblazoned with two Matisse-inspired patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the dishes are available from Ikea by phone, (818) 912-1119, or at the 
firm's warehouse in the Tustin Market Place. Surf's Up 
</P>
<P>
 Surferniture is making a big splash with its new line of surfboard furniture. 
The furniture is the creation of lighting designer Jim Gibson of Chula Vista 
and two friends, Mike Bennett, a metal craftsman, and Jon Strebler, a teacher 
and surfboard designer. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego County-based company features chairs and tables made of 
reproduction foam or wooden surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden tables and chairs, made of balsa, redwood cactus and other exotic 
woods, have wave-shaped solid brass arms or legs, wooden fins and a fiberglass 
coating; nose blocks and tall blocks also are available. 
</P>
<P>
 When fabric is incorporated into the designs, it is covered with fiberglass. 
(Gibson's sister, Sandi Provence, can stitch up a shirt in the same fabric-sans 
the fiberglass.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a hand in the design, Surferniture is more than happy to oblige. 
Furniture prices range $1,200 to $1,500. For information, call (619) 585-7775. 
Paper Clips Have History, Too. 
</P>
<P>
 How did a fork get its tines? How were Post-it notes invented? Why do aluminum 
cans have hollow bottoms? 
</P>
<P>
 These questions and more are answered in detail in Henry Petroski's new book, 
"The Evolution of Useful Things: How Everyday Artifacts-From Forks and Pins to 
Paperclips and Zippers-Came to Be as They Are" (Random House, $13). 
</P>
<P>
 Petroski's book is a mix of history, biography and design theory. Now, on to 
the entry on zippers. . .

IT ISN'T ALWAYS BED OF ROSES FOR FLORIST; HOLIDAY: LOCAL FLOWER SHOPS OFFER A 
LITTLE THERAPY, COUNSELING, AND A LISTENING EAR WITH EACH RUSH ORDER FOR 
MOTHER'S DAY. 
</P>

 There's no black leather couch where Mary Blohm works. But after designing 
flower bouquets for 22 Mother's Days, she may have heard more stories of 
Oedipal Angst than Freud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to give her something, " one Mother's Day shopper told Blohm. "Do 
you have a black rose?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another asked her for "dead flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 For his mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 On this holiday especially, florists like Blohm find themselves playing the 
roles of friend, confidant and counselor to complete strangers, offering 
flower-shop therapy and listening to intimate relationship details they never 
wanted to know -- all in the interest of holiday harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little like being a hairdresser," said Bates Hinds, head designer at 
The Flower Factory. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the busiest of hairdressers won't clip and prune as much as these 
folks over the next few days. Mother's Day is the second biggest day for 
florists, after Christmas, and at The Flower Factory a few extra florists were 
brought in to handle the "hundreds and hundreds" of orders that were coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 While workers in the back of The Flower Factory soaked white orchids from 
Hawaii and lopped the stems off red tulips from Holland on Friday morning, 
those helping customers out front strained to stay sharp under the growing 
rush. It is now about 10 a.m., and Simon Soriano, who owns the shop with his 
brother Elton, had been on the job since 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple mistake, the wrong card on the wrong bouquet, can cost the shop some 
business, or a customer his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping girlfriends and wives separate -- that's important," said Hinds with 
great seriousness. Men have sought his professional advice on which floral 
arrangement to buy for their wives and which for their mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Extreme, spy-like discretion is also required. Hinds remembered the time the 
wife of a Don Juan stomped into the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is my husband sending flowers to someone else?" she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't think so," Hinds replied, and went into the back room as if to 
check sales records. He twiddled his thumbs a minute and returned to tell a 
small lie. "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Information on who purchases what for whom, you see, is top secret in this 
surprisingly intimate business. Intimate as well are the messages customers jot 
down on cards -- or even dictate over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He calls with in-depth letters, intimate things they do at home," said Robbi 
Soriano, Elton's wife, of one customer's dictation. "They have names for their 
sex parts (but) I can't figure them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such spicy requests happen year-round, but the sheer volume of orders around 
Mother's Day -- when the florists are exhausted and the customers are emotional 
-- can make this a memorable time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The florists recalled one woman who sent a specially tailored Mother's Day 
greeting to her husband's mistress: a tall vase of white lilies tied with a big 
black bow and a card that read, "This is my last threat."

MEADOWS FINALLY FALLING; QUAKE: DEMOLITION CREWS TAKE MOST OF THE DAY BRINGING 
DOWN THE THIRD FLOOR. RELATIVES ARE ALLOWED TO RETRIEVE ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It took nature just a few seconds to flatten 40 first-floor apartments at 
Northridge Meadows. It took demolition crews most of the afternoon Friday to 
tear down four third-floor units. 
</P>
<P>
 The first section of the 163-unit complex on Reseda Boulevard came crashing 
down at midafternoon, kicking up clouds of concrete dust. Earlier, relatives of 
some of the 16 people killed there during the Jan. 17 quake had been allowed to 
burrow into the pancaked first-floor units to retrieve belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Runnings, 28, whose mother Karol died in Apartment 108, found the Raiders 
jersey she had ordered for him for Christmas. "She was bummed she didn't get it 
in time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Julie Tindall, 29, was happy she had been able to retrieve their 
mother's diamond watch and wedding and engagement rings.  
</P>
<P>
 Next door, at Apartment 109, Marcee Murray broke down and cried when she saw 
the mess where her mother, Bea Reskin, had lived. It looked like a cave. "The 
whole kitchen is smashed. You can't see anything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner in Apartment 103, Bill Cerone unearthed his mother's wall 
clock, its hands still pointing to that fateful hour, 4:31, when Ann Cerone, 
80, was crushed to death in the apartment where she had lived nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's my grandson's puzzle. Here's some more," Cerone said. "Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerone was up to his hips in rubble. His mother's former apartment looked more 
like a crawl space. It was dusty and dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to breathe in there," Cerone said. "Apparently in all the units 
there was a lot of spoilage, so it doesn't smell particularly great." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerone wasn't able to retrieve much on Friday, but he said he will be back. 
"I'd just like to get the rest of my mother's things, photographs and other 
things I know are under there. I'd rather get to them than have them bulldozed 
under." 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives and survivors who gained access Friday were among a handful who 
had hired lawyers. Seven lawsuits have either been filed or are about to be 
filed accusing the Northridge Meadows owner and builder of negligence and poor 
quality construction. 
</P>
<P>
 When the family members had collected what they could, crews tore down 
sections of the third floor and dumped the debris into the swimming pool. The 
work is slow because care must be taken to preserve evidence and belongings in 
the still-buried units underneath, said Bruce Decker, owner of the Thousand 
Oaks company performing the court-ordered controlled demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't take a 'dozer and drive over the top like you normally do 
because you'll just squash everything and lose all the evidence," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker said he was amazed by the possessions left behind in the damaged 
apartments. "There's a lot of stuff left here." For now, Decker said, his 
workers are tagging what they can and moving it to the complex's recreation 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition followed several days of evidence retrieval and study by scores 
of structural engineers and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The work to tear down the third-floor units resembled a monstrous dental 
extraction. Saws were used to cut the building into sections. Then, steel cable 
was wrapped around them. An excavator rammed through the stucco, then pulled 
the cable tight, yanking the third-floor apartments into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 After the roof and walls tumbled, the apartments' contents spilled over the 
sides. A kitchen sink tumbled, shattering clean plates that had survived the 
6.8-magnitude quake and a 15-foot plunge in the collapse that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 About four families have made appointments to retrieve belongings today, when 
access to the first floor is expected to be better, said Allen Tharpe, attorney 
for complex owner Shasikant Jogani. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation and examination of crucial evidence on the first floor are expected 
to begin early next week.

REPUTED GANG MEMBER HELD IN STUDENT'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cracking a 2-year-old murder case, police arrested a reputed gang member 
Friday in the fatal stabbing of a Taft High School student who was attacked by 
a group of youths as he waited for a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources identified the suspect as Oscar Andres Lopez, now 18, who is currently 
in county jail on charges of participating in a series of armed robberies. The 
case is being reviewed by prosecutors in Juvenile Court, where records are 
confidential, because Lopez was 16 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was arrested in the Aug. 5, 1992, stabbing of Lamoun Thames, a 
15-year-old South-Central Los Angeles boy who was preparing to enter the 10th 
grade. Thames was waiting for a bus about 10 p.m. at the corner of Ventura 
Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue after attending a preseason football practice 
where a coach had given him a chance to make Taft's varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 A confidential informant recently came forward and "indicated the juvenile who 
was responsible for the killing," said Los Angeles Police Detective Joel Price. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant reported that Lopez "had been bragging that he had committed the 
crime . . . and that he had a $25,000 price on his head," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the slaying, the Los Angeles City Council posted a $25,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others, 19-year-old James Han of Calabasas and a 17-year-old juvenile, 
were arrested Thursday. They "both admitted to being present at the time of the 
killing and have identified the 18-year-old as the actual stabber," according 
to Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Friday declined to file charges against Han and the juvenile. 
"There's not sufficient evidence to charge them with the crime," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thames was attacked when a carload of youths pulled up and two people 
confronted the teen-ager about his gang affiliation, according to Price. Only 
one person physically attacked Thames, Price said. Police and school officials 
said at the time that Thames was not associated with any gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was charged April 29 in an armed robbery spree and is being held in lieu 
of $1-million bail in that case. He and another man, John Anthony Zapata, 20, 
allegedly committed five armed robberies, one at a westside residence and 
several at San Fernando Valley businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Talent manager Don Gibble, 24, has also been charged with receiving stolen 
property after police found identification and credit cards -- which had been 
stolen in the residential robbery -- in his possession.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Lopez and Gibble were living in a Northridge house with 
actress Victoria Sellers, who has not yet been charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is charged with attempted murder in a mugging, seven counts of armed 
robbery and five counts of assault with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing for Lopez in the robbery spree is scheduled for Tuesday, 
but Zapata's defense attorney has already requested that the hearing be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors reviewing the stabbing case against Lopez said a decision on what 
charges to file would be made Monday.

INCREASING VIOLENCE CLAIMS LIVES OF 2 SECURITY GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Two security guards were fatally shot in separate attacks that security firm 
owners Friday said underline the increasing hazards of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent killing, at a Stuart Anderson's Black Angus restaurant in 
Burbank early Friday, a man approached unarmed guard Walter H. Thomas III, 44, 
who was patrolling the parking lot, and fired several times, striking Thomas at 
least twice, according to witnesses and Burbank police. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours earlier, Eddy Sanchez, 32, was shot during a struggle with 
bank robbers at Hanmi Bank near 1st Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles, 
the LAPD said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three incidents like this is highly unusual, especially in such a 
short period of time," said Thomas Wathen, chairman of Van Nuys-based Pinkerton 
Security and Investigations. "But the more security guards there are out there, 
the more likely it is to happen. It's very dangerous out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, the shooting was preceded by at least two fights and three arrests 
as patrons crowded into the restaurant's bar for $2 shots of tequila and beer, 
police and employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 After one of the brawls police arrested three men, who were still in custody 
when the security guard was gunned down, said Burbank Police Sgt. Scott Wilson. 
Employees, however, said Friday that friends of the men had threatened them 
after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'We're gonna get you' said one of the employees, all of whom asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's manager and other officials with the company declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second incident, guard Eddy Sanchez apparently didn't realize that the 
bank was about to be robbed when three men entered about 11 a.m. Thursday, said 
Lt. Ken Lady of the Los Angeles Police Department. When he became aware of what 
was happening, police said, Sanchez approached two of the men and was 
struggling with them when a gun went off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was armed but did not draw his weapon, police said. The three robbers, 
who were all armed, escaped on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank employs two guards, but the other one -- who is Sanchez's cousin -- 
had gone on a break moments before the shooting, Lady said. Sanchez's employer, 
API Security Inc., did not return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a security guard is among the most dangerous professions in the United 
States, with an annual homicide rate of 3.6 per 100,000, according to a 1994 
study by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job is extremely dangerous, probably more dangerous than being a police 
officer because of lack of backups, lack of equipment and lack of training," 
said Walter Cranston, owner of Cranston Security Services in North Hollywood. 
"Armed or unarmed, it's not going to make a difference," Cranston said. "The 
state training is next to nothing. (The guards) are not mentally prepared to 
deal with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Police know Black Angus, a popular watering hole on 1st Street in downtown 
Burbank, as a place where the crowd frequently gets out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardly a week goes by when there is not an arrest there," said Wilson of the 
Burbank police. "We've had shootings over the years, but no one's been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the restaurant's management agreed to hire an outside security firm 
to police the parking lot and to discontinue its popular $1 drink nights when 
Burbank police and Alcohol Beverage Control officials complained about frequent 
fights there, said ABC district administrator Jim Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, an employee of Ace Security Services, was in the parking lot as part 
of the Black Angus security detail, police said. Employees said nine guards had 
been hired to help with the large crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Thomas' friends and family were angry about his death. After his 
son's death, Thomas' father quit his job at the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "An unarmed security agent is too dangerous," said Malcolm Thomas, Walter's 
brother. "We can't afford to have this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said Thomas, who had worked for Ace for about four months after a stint 
as an aerospace contractor, might have survived had he been taken to a hospital 
sooner.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had nothing to do with the fight," said Malcolm Thomas. "He was there to 
guard the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was close to a hospital and bled to death," said Patricia Smith, the dead 
man's sister. "Why didn't the paramedic get there in time? It's within walking 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' mother is under observation at Thompson Memorial Medical Center in 
Burbank because she has a heart condition.

PANEL MOVES TOWARD BALLOT VOTE ON SALES TAX; TRANSPORTATION: A CONSULTANT WILL 
BE HIRED TO DRAFT AN INITIATIVE. STREET REPAIR NEEDS AND MUSHROOMING METROLINK 
COSTS ARE CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite strong opposition from some public officials, the county's 
transportation panel took the first step Friday toward putting a half-cent 
sales tax measure on the November ballot to raise money for road projects. 
</P>
<P>
 After three hours of discussion, the Ventura County Transportation Commission 
voted 4 to 3 to pay a consultant $20,000 to study the county's transportation 
needs and draft a sales tax initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, estimated to raise more than $500 million over 20 years, was 
recommended by commission staff members as a way to avoid slashing street and 
road repair budgets while trying to cover the mushrooming costs of Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying to the citizens of this county is that they will not have 
money for streets," Commissioner Michael Wooten of Camarillo said. "But unless 
we put this on the ballot, we're not giving the citizens an opportunity to 
decide their own fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Wooten in favor of the plan were Commissioners David Smith, Nancy 
Grasmehr and Susan Lacey, who is also a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The three commissioners opposed to the measure were Thousand Oaks Councilman 
Frank Schillo, Simi Valley Councilman Bill Davis and county Supervisor Vicky 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo acknowledged the need for more transportation money, but argued that 
there was not enough time to run a campaign that would persuade a majority of 
voters to back the tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being totally irresponsible on this measure," Schillo said. "It's not 
only our streets. We need to have some time to educate the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Manager John Baker agreed with Schillo, making an impassioned 
speech before the commission. "If you try to go for a sales tax this November, 
you are going to get killed," Baker warned the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker urged the commission to look for extra dollars in various county 
transportation funds and city budgets before pursuing a sales tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar sales tax measure 
placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the largest county in California that does not have a local 
sales tax to help pay for street repair and other transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the county and most cities rely heavily on money placed in a fund 
established by the state's Transportation Development Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the county receives $14 million from that state fund. About $6 
million of the money is spent on public transit and administrative costs and $8 
million on roads. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ginger Gherardi, the commission's top staffer, told the panel that state 
law gives public transit services such as Metrolink top priority for those 
funds, and that the commission may have to take most of the $8 million away 
from the cities to pay for Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 State law encourage mass transit as a way to decrease air pollution and reduce 
freeway congestion. Gherardi warned commissioners that the state may not allow 
the county to discontinue Metrolink service to save money, unless the county is 
willing to surrender its annual $14-million share of the Transportation 
Development Act fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said the county has the financial ability to make it through the 
upcoming fiscal year that begins in July. "We can scrape by for another year," 
she said. "But after that, we're really going to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 During the daylong meeting, the commission also agreed to borrow money from 
reserves to cover the county's Metrolink bill for the coming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the commuter trains first rolled into Moorpark and Simi Valley in 1992, 
the commission agreed to pay $800,000 a year for service. But the Southern 
California Regional Rail Authority, which runs Metrolink, had not come up with 
an accurate annual cost of running the commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The rail authority recently came up with the price -- double the $800,000 the 
commission originally paid. So the county owes $1.6 million for Metrolink 
services during the first two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners agreed Friday to pay the bill by borrowing the money from a 
reserve fund for roadside emergency telephones.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the commission has to come up with $1.6 million for the next year of 
service, plus an added $400,000 to continue temporary service to Oxnard and 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo and Oxnard were added to the Ventura County line after the Jan. 17 
earthquake to attract more riders and help relieve congestion on damaged 
freeways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying most of the cost of 
service until Oct. 1 or until the Simi Valley Freeway is repaired, whichever 
comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 When the commission approved the emergency service, it was perceived as a 
temporary service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gherardi told the commission that since the Metrolink line that serves 
Camarillo and Oxnard is meeting the state minimum in fare revenue, the county 
may have to continue paying for service to those stations when FEMA funding 
runs out, or risk losing its share of the Transportation Development Act money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said she was dismayed that the county might be forced to subsidize

OXNARD IS TARGET OF HOUSING LAWSUITS; COURTS: COUNTY'S LARGEST CITY IS ACCUSED 
OF HAVING BLUEPRINT FOR CONSTRUCTION THAT VIOLATES STATE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A coalition of law firms sued the city of Oxnard Friday, seeking to halt 
nearly all future development citywide until officials create a state-certified 
housing plan to shelter the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lawsuits, filed back-to-back Friday in Ventura County Superior Court on 
behalf of six low-income residents, allege that the city's blueprint for 
housing construction violates state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the lawsuits attack two recently approved development projects, 
alleging that they fail to provide enough low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits also allege that the city has maintained housing policies that 
discriminate against low-income households, large families and ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has established a pattern and practice of not providing housing for 
poor people, made clear by looking at development over the last 14 years," said 
Eileen McCarthy, an attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance. "It's 
imperative that action be taken now to stop these continued practices and 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Both lawsuits name as defendants the city of Oxnard and all five City Council 
members. One lawsuit also names Laguna Pacific Development, the Montecito 
developer of a 216-house project in northwest Oxnard called Patterson Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suit names 12 property owners in the Northeast Community Specific 
Plan, a 737-acre development of homes, shops and schools approved by the City 
Council earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both projects provided some low-income housing, but attorneys argue it is not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said he had not seen the lawsuits but is 
confident that the city's housing policies comply with state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council is mindful and conscientious about trying to provide housing 
for all people in the city of Oxnard," Gillig said. "However, if we can't 
resolve this amicably, I guess we'll have to resolve it in court." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Laguna Pacific Development said the Oxnard project had been 
sold to R.W. Hertel & Sons Inc. Company spokesman Ron Hertel declined comment. 
Several landowners in the Northeast Community could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits -- filed by Oxnard-based California Rural Legal Assistance, 
Channel Counties Legal Services Assn., and three other firms -- come at a time 
when the city has shown renewed interest in providing affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Oxnard City Council approved a 32-unit low-income housing 
project in the city's downtown district. And most recently, city leaders 
established a committee to guide the affordable housing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys who filed the lawsuits said that despite the city's concerns, 
council members have missed recent opportunities to truly beef up the city's 
low-income housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to resort to this because land is disappearing," said Barbara 
Macri-Ortiz, a lawyer for Channel Counties Legal Services. "It's no longer 
business as usual. We've got to resolve this problem and we've got to resolve 
it promptly and expeditiously." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is Ventura County's largest city and one of its poorest, with a median 
family income of $38,700. The county median is $50,091. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the last 14 years, only 68 units of low-income housing have been built, 
according to the lawsuits. During that same period, thousands of houses valued 
at $200,000 or more have been built, the lawsuits said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Southern California Assn. of Governments set Oxnard's 
"fair-share housing need" at 1,700 low-income units during the five-year period 
that ends this year. The city has built only 22 units during that five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bent over backwards to keep out of court with this city," Macri-Ortiz said. 
"But the gloves are off now. If it takes a lawsuit to address this issue of 
housing, then that's what we are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the lawsuits is the contention that Oxnard's housing element, 
which sets goals for housing construction, is out of compliance with state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, state officials told the city that the housing element of 
Oxnard's General Plan was deficient and therefore could not be certified. The 
lawsuits contend that the city has taken no steps to bring the planning 
document into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing element is key. The lawsuits ask that approvals for the Patterson 
Park project and the Northeast Specific Plan be reversed because the General 
Plan is invalid. The General Plan is invalid, according to the lawsuits, 
because the housing element is out of compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits seek to compel the city to prepare and adopt a housing element 
that has been certified by the state. Until that is done, the suits want the 
court to halt all commercial and residential projects that come before the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we can accomplish, we have that duty to our clients," Macri-Ortiz 
said. "They've been waiting a long time."

CHANGE OF COMMAND; CAPT. DELKER TAKES THE HELM AT HUENEME NAVAL BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a new commander took the helm at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in 
Port Hueneme Friday, naval brass reminded assembled troops that the Seabees 
will probably suffer little damage from defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although downsizing in the Navy will undoubtedly continue, the men and women 
who take care of the logistics of mobilizing a military force remain in demand, 
Rear Adm. Jack E. Buffington, told nearly 1,000 people at the change-of-command 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to lose a few Seabees as we go along," said Buffington, the 
Seabees' top representative in Washington. "But wherever (the United States 
military) goes, we are going to be the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 "And don't forget it," he added in a booming voice. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 invited civilian guests, plus about 750 troops in dress whites, 
attended the hourlong event. It formalized the transfer of power at the 
sprawling base from Rear Adm. David J. Nash to Capt. James L. Delker. Nash, who 
has held the position for two years and eight months, has been promoted to 
commander of the Third Naval Construction Brigade, Pacific Division, in Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker will assume command of the battalion center and the 31st Naval 
Construction Regiment based in Port Hueneme, his latest post in a military 
career that began in July, 1969. As base commander, Delker will have ultimate 
authority and responsibility for about 9,000 military and civilian employees 
with an annual payroll of $297 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremonies were filled with pomp and circumstance built up over 400 
years of naval tradition, including the playing of patriotic music, rigid 
salutes by troops and commanders, and bells and whistles announcing the arrival 
of military dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of rain did not stop the precise order of events, including the 
playing of military music by a naval band from San Diego, short talks by 
Buffington, Nash and Delker and the formal transfer of command. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened when Delker read his orders, faced Nash and said, "I am ready to 
relieve you, sir." To which Nash responded: "I stand relieved." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men then faced each other, formally saluted, walked down a red-carpeted 
walkway and were escorted into separate cars. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd scattered at ceremony's end, light rain began to fall across the 
outdoor parade field. Navy spokeswoman Linda Wadley said organizers had planned 
to move the ceremony into a nearby theater on the base in case of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so glad we were able to stay out here," Wadley said, clutching her 
closed umbrella beneath her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker made no reference to any changes or other plans for the base during his 
brief remarks. But, during Nash's spirited talk, he alluded to the paring of 
the Navy nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy will be smaller, but the weapons platform will be greater," he said. 
"I'm confident that our senior Navy leaders will make the right decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme's base escaped almost unscathed when the government disclosed a 
national base-closure plan last year. The biggest change was the closure of the 
Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory and the absorption of its operations onto 
the 1,615-acre Seabee base. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 15 military or civilian jobs in Ventura County were lost as a result of 
last year's cutbacks. But Ventura County is fortunate because its facilities, 
including the Point Mugu Naval Air Station, are necessary and unique. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme Seabee base is one of only two construction battalions in the 
nation and serves all of the Pacific Fleet. The Point Mugu air station is a key 
base in a triangle of facilities that test missiles over a 25,000-square-mile 
area of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffington, whose career has included several visits to Port Hueneme, told 
guests Port Hueneme's base has been held out as a model for naval installations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here, it was not much more than Quonset huts," Buffington 
said. Now the base not only has modernized housing, but a retail store, a 
credit union, a child-care center and recreation activities for enlisted 
troops, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely the showpiece of the Navy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nash's closing remarks, he compared his command at the Seabee base to that 
of a relay runner. He was part of a team effort, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My segment is over and I gave it my best," he said.

YOUTHS PLEAD FOR AN END TO VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school students from Oxnard to Thousand Oaks said Friday they are 
frustrated with crime on campus and adults' inability to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at Assemblyman Nao Takasugi's Youth Crime Summit in Thousand Oaks, 
the students begged a panel of criminal justice officials and politicians for 
better security, more discipline and clearer communication in the war on 
increasing campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things come in the mail for our parents, not for us," said John Freed, 17, a 
Thousand Oaks High School senior, telling the gathering about the conclusions 
his study group reached at the conference of about 120 Ventura County high 
school students. "I don't know who I'd go to if I wanted to report someone in a 
gang, except to call 911." 
</P>
<P>
 Others at the session attended by Gov. Pete Wilson's wife, Gayle, lamented the 
lack of information available in high schools on crime prevention and self-help 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students criticized parents for not keeping a tighter grip on their sons 
and daughters at night, when gang activity increases. 
</P>
<P>
 And several teen-agers urged school administrators and teachers to be 
proactive, not reactive, in handling gang activity, drug use and other campus 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 After huddling in groups to share problems and ideas, the teen-agers 
recommended: 
</P>
<P>
 * Informing students about anti-crime hot lines, self-help groups and 
lawmakers they can lobby for better crime-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Convening an inter-school youth council to keep students abreast of crime 
and crime-prevention in other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing security measures such as use of guards and metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conducting more inter-cultural activities and race-awareness classes to 
promote understanding and defuse racism that often leads to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting students more involved in sports and after-school activities to 
divert them from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to is students taking a more active role in what we do, 
the administration listening more to the students and the media portraying a 
more positive view of students," said Dung Hoang, 16, a junior at Channel 
Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult panelists agreed that students must be partly responsible for 
fighting crime in their own schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that whatever the problem is, people get engaged and involved. 
I think the students have the solutions to the problems," said Philip Gore, 
director of the Gateway Community School, which teaches youths adjudicated by 
the juvenile court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students have the greatest impact on school climate, and school climate can 
only be addressed if students and staff work together," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Ludaescher, youth officer for the Oxnard Police Department, added: "You 
have a lot more control than you think over your surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials listened to the students' suggestions, which ranged from 
enforcing state curfew laws countywide to putting students through random drug 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, Takasugi promised a report in three or four weeks summarizing the 
summit's findings and proposing possible solutions that could even become draft 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 And Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White said she was glad to hear the 
teen-agers themselves cry for more guidance from parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were hopeful about results too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of good ideas came from it and I think positive things will 
take place," said Lauretta Lamothe, 17, a Camarillo High senior. "I think 
parents definitely need to be more involved and know what their kids are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, some students questioned whether the summit would do much to 
quell on-campus crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talking about it is different than doing or acting or making a move," said 
Josh Tucci, 16, a junior at Frontier High School in Camarillo. "If they're 
serious about it, they'll make a move," 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Taday, a 17-year-old Thousand Oaks High senior, said she will wait to 
see whether Takasugi and the panelists act on their goodwill, and she 
questioned whether students have any power in the adult world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have control, why would we be here?," she said. "No one teaches us how 
to write to our legislators, no one tells us we are capable of making a change. 
. . . It's sad to think that the kids are the ones who have to be in charge of 
this."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; CHARITY EVENT IS AS EASY AS PIE FOR DEVON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top executives of Devon Industries on Friday couldn't escape being targets of 
their employees' sweet revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 At $1 a throw, 276 employees of the Chatsworth medical supplies company lined 
up after lunch Friday to throw whipped creamed pies at the faces of Devon 
President Joseph R. Kletzel and a few of his vice presidents -- all in the name 
of charity.The pie-throwing event was held to raise money for the American 
Cancer Society's Making Strides walk-a-thon to be held June 4 at CityWalk in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stuck their heads through big plastic sheets but it didn't help much," 
said Jim Wunderlich, spokesman for the company. "The pies were just flying." 
</P>
<P>
 The executives took turns at being targets. Mike Griffin, vice president of 
operations, spent the longest time as a target. He withstood the sticky 
onslaught for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is most of these pies weren't thrown," Wunderlich said. "People 
walked right up to them and smashed it into their faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Wunderlich said at times, a whole department would gang up on their boss and 
throw the pies all at once, "really slamming the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was a good time for everyone," he said with a laugh. JEANNETTE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; SHOW TO RAISE FUNDS FOR DAMAGED CHURCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parishioners at St. Joseph the Worker Church will hold a variety show May 21 
to raise money to renovate their quake-damaged church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic church at 19803 Sherman Way in Canoga Park suffered about 
$200,000 in losses in the temblor, according to Pastor Jim Gehl.Significant 
damage was caused to a 5,000-pipe organ, the bell tower and the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, "Shake, Rattle and Roll," will feature singing, dancing, musical 
acts and actors performing two scenes from the musical comedy "Sister Act." 
With tickets going for $3 a person, organizers say they are less concerned with 
making money than they are with restoring parish morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect to raise big bucks from this, but we hope to bolster people's 
spirits and come together as a parish family," Gehl said. "We're just going to 
have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be held at Msgr. Greene Hall at 7 p.m. For information, call

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE HEADQUARTERS STUDY TO BE UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A consultant next week will present his study on the need for a new Glendale 
police headquarters that could cost between $18 million and $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Jim McClaren of San Jose, is scheduled to unveil to city 
officials on Tuesday site options and several possible floor plans for the 
proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has outgrown its current 34-year-old building -- where 
boxes of records and equipment are stacked in hallways for lack of storage 
space and officers are forced to share offices, said Lt. Jim Swinford. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of police officers and civilian personnel working in the facility 
has almost doubled -- from 170 in 1960 to 325 in 1994. Police facilities 
receive more wear and tear than other office buildings because they are used 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, Swinford said. 
</P>
<P>
 While researching his report, McClaren interviewed most Police Department 
personnel to include their input on how offices should be positioned in the 
proposed structure, Swinford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for the proposed structure to be built at $160 per square 
foot and suggests the facility be built for a 40-year life span. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility should encompass 115,000 to 130,000 square feet given staffing 
levels and projections of population growth for the city, Swinford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Larry Zarian said although he's certain the city needs a new 
facility, he is unsure how soon a new structure should be built and how large 
it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that an organization like the Police Department have proper 
facilities, the question is 'What is proper?' " Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hire another consultant to study financing options if the 
council decides to continue its research into a new police headquarters, 
Swinford said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT ANIMALS, PET OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a ball python curled over her arm, Joyce George of the Ventura County 
Humane Society slowly walked around the circle of fourth-grade students, giving 
each child a chance to pet the scaly serpent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nasty!" 10-year-old Mario Calvillo said after George passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such reactions, one purpose of George's visit Friday to Will Rogers 
School was to let children get close to animals they may otherwise see only in 
a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball pythons, George warned the students, are in danger of becoming extinct 
because of the destruction of the rain forests they inhabit and the wanton 
killing of snakes in other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we'll get to the point," George said, "where we're not killing snakes 
right and left. Why should we kill something just because it's different?" 
</P>
<P>
 In her visits to schools around the county, George seeks both to raise 
students' awareness of endangered species and to teach them about the 
responsibilities of pet ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 She uses animals to make the point. On Friday, she brought the python, a pair 
of small white rats, a golden retriever named Molly and a California desert 
tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 The tortoise, like the python, is an endangered species, George told the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 George used the rats, which remained in their carrying case during the visit, 
to talk about the importance of keeping cages clean. 
</P>
<P>
 And George's dog, Molly, served as a perfect example of why people should spay 
or neuter their pets and keep them on leashes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Molly was brought to the Humane Society 12 years ago, her hip and leg 
were broken from when she was hit by a car, George said, eliciting gasps from 
the children. The dog had been a stray on the streets of Ventura for months, 
George said, "but nobody took care of her." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent other animals from becoming strays, George said, pet owners need to 
attach name tags and keep the animals inside or on leashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As smart as Molly is," George said, "she cannot talk. She cannot say, 'My 
name is Molly George.' " And she cannot tell people where she lives, George 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only certain way to reduce the number of unwanted and stray animals,

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PRIZES TO EASE PAIN OF INOCULATIONS FOR TOTS

<P>
 Organizers of this year's "Shots for Tots" hope that storytelling and prizes 
will distract children from the fear of getting immunization shots. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year St. Joseph Medical Center has offered the free 
immunizations.This year's event is being held May 21 at the Burbank Adult 
School on Allan Avenue. For the first time, the event is being combined with 
"Babes in Storyland," run by the Burbank Preschool parent council. The 
preschool is a program for the children of students at the adult school. 
</P>
<P>
 The story program is a literacy carnival at which children, from preschool age 
through sixth grade, can hear storytellers, play games and win prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A child could be soothed from pre-shot fears with a story, or go to the 
carnival afterward to forget the pain. "It could work either way," said Kelly 
Curtis, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The free immunizations are being offered to the first 200 children who show up 
at the site May 21 between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The shots are administered by hospital staff, using free vaccines provided by 
the Los Angeles County Health Department for measles, polio, mumps, diphtheria, 
rubella and tetanus. Parents are asked to bring their child's immunization 
records. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WATER RATES EXPECTED TO RISE FOR 3RD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feeling the effects of increased water prices and an absence of revenue 
because of a development slowdown, the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District 
expects to increase water rates this summer for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it becomes very difficult not to have a rate increase this year," 
said Hal Helsley, chairman of the district's board of directors. "We know that 
we're getting a fair increase passed to us, and we simply can't absorb that 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive Metropolitan Water District, which supplies water to Las Virgenes, 
plans to raise its prices 7% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a near-total freeze in development between Topanga Canyon and the 
Ventura County line, the smaller agency is scrambling to find ways to pay its 
debt on ambitious projects undertaken during better times, such as a 
$50-million facility that will turn sewer sludge into compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been no formal proposal, studies requested by the 
district's directors estimate rate increases of as much as 10% to 15% may be in 
order, Helsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board asked its staff to propose by May 23 more cost-cutting measures and 
projects that can be put on hold until revenues from development increase 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rates for the 14,000 households that use Las Virgenes water are still 
lower than those in most other Southern California districts, Helsley said, 
residents of the arid, semirural Conejo Valley area use nearly twice as much 
water as the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 District General Manager James E. Colbaugh said the agency may have to become 
less aggressive in its efforts to conserve energy and reuse all of its 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The board probably will choose to put on hold the purchase of a $1.5-million 
generator to turn methane from the composting process into electricity, 
Colbaugh said. Smaller programs, such as car pools for the district's 131 
employees, also may be cut, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any surplus expenses, and there are no things we can just 
eliminate without affecting the quality of service," Colbaugh said. "We're in a 
situation where we're going to have to make some tough choices." 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed budget will be submitted to the board at a public meeting May 23, 
Helsley said. If rate increases become part of the final spending plan for the 
next fiscal year, the district will hold public hearings before approving them.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JUDGE FINALLY TAKES CASE OTHERS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The probation-violation case of a Somis woman who killed three young men was 
bounced around to three Ventura County courtrooms Friday before a judge finally 
agreed to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 And that jurist, Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr., delayed the 
matter until June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In a widely publicized case that went as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, Diane 
Mannes was placed on five years' probation after pleading guilty to three 
counts of vehicular manslaughter last August. Prosecutors now accuse her of 
violating that probation by not attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and 
doctoring attendance sheets to conceal her absence. 
</P>
<P>
 She was scheduled to appear Friday on the probation-violation charge before 
acting Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis III. But Curtis sent the case to 
Judge James McNally, who had sentenced Mannes. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally, however, told court officials he did not want to hear it because he 
no longer is assigned to felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell accepted it but granted a defense motion to delay the hearing for 
seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion about who would hear the matter did not sit well with Linda 
Oxenreider, whose 19-year-old son, Joshua, was struck and killed when Mannes' 
car swerved off the Ventura Freeway's Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes for more delays," she said. "I've waited for five years to get some 
kind of justice for Josh." 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes served about two years in prison for a felony drunk-driving conviction 
in connection with injuring two boys in the group. But she never served any 
time for killing the three boys. A Ventura County jury deadlocked on three 
counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors were then blocked from retrying the murder case by a federal 
court, which said a trial judge's comment that there was insufficient evidence 
to support a verdict of murder constituted an acquittal. Mannes eventually 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a promise of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Mannes should now be sent back to prison. "I'm sure prison 
will make it easier for her to attend AA," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. DeNoce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Robert A. Dahlstedt could not be reached for comment.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN GETS PROBATION IN BEACH SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge placed a 19-year-old Santa Paula man on three years' probation for his 
role in a shooting on a crowded Ventura beach last summer, ending a 
high-profile but complicated case for prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury acquitted Alejandro Garcia last month of felony assault 
with a firearm and grossly negligent shooting.He was convicted of four 
misdemeanors for having a weapon at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. placed Garcia on probation for 
those offenses -- one count each of carrying a loaded weapon and carrying a 
concealed weapon, and two counts of discharging a weapon within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly after 10 a.m. Aug. 5, when Garcia was confronted 
by members of a Santa Paula gang at San Buenaventura State Beach, according to 
court testimony. No one was injured as gunfire rang out from both sides, but 
about 200 beach-goers had to scurry for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury ruled that Garcia had fired his weapon in self-defense. Charges were 
dropped against two of Garcia's foes because of a lack of evidence. Garcia's 
19-year-old cousin, John Sosa, still faces a charge of accessory after the fact 
for allegedly trying to hide Garcia's gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons said he doesn't expect to continue with 
that charge since Garcia was acquitted of felony wrongdoing. DWAYNE BRAY

 Police said Friday they will cite a 30-year-old Oxnard woman for allegedly 
making an unsafe U-turn in front of an Oxnard police officer, who was seriously 
injured when his motorcycle crashed into her van. 
</P>
<P>
 Humbelina Avalos, who had finished her night school class at Oxnard High 
School on Thursday evening, was making a U-turn on 5th Street when she turned 
in front of Officer Michael Zamore, who was riding behind her, said Officer 
Randey Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamore, who was going about 35 m.p.h., suffered a crushed right foot in the 
crash, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old officer was in fair condition at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center on Friday evening, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avalos received minor cuts and was treated and released from the hospital, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said police will cite Avalos for making an unsafe turn and being in the 
wrong lane for a U-turn. Both are considered infractions, Cole said. PEGGY Y.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: DRIVER ACCUSED OF SOLICITING MURDER 
</P>

<P>
 A man accused of putting out a $500 murder contract on someone he thought had 
stolen his car has been arrested in Port Hueneme, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hicks, 37, of Lompoc was being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$5,000 bail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began Monday, police said, when Hicks met Matthew Makela, 34, an 
unemployed drywaller, at a party in Santa Maria. Makela then drove Hicks' car 
to Port Hueneme.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hicks told Santa Maria police his car had been stolen, and Port 
Hueneme officers arrested Makela in Hicks' vehicle on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Makela posted bail and was released from jail about 6 p.m., but within an hour 
he called police and told them he had heard on the street that Hicks had 
purchased a $500 contract on his life and was in the area, said Port Hueneme 
Police Sgt. Jerry Beck. Shortly after Makela's call, his ex-girlfriend 
telephoned with the same information, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers stopped a car that matched the description of an auto reportedly 
driven by Hicks, and found Hicks and Cedric Adams, a 25-year-old transient, 
inside, with a loaded .25-caliber automatic handgun under the front seat, Beck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hicks denied any knowledge of the gun or any threats at all," Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks and Adams were arrested on suspicion of soliciting murder, carrying a 
concealed weapon and carrying a loaded firearm in public, authorities said. 
Both are scheduled to be arraigned Monday. PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; SENIORS SALUTE MOTHER'S DAY WITH A CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chopin's mother would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 In a classical salute to Mother's Day, about 60 senior music lovers gathered 
at the Valley Storefront Jewish Family Services in North Hollywood on Friday to 
listen to pianists over 60 play selections such as a mazurka by the 
19th-Century composer Frederic Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, which also featured renditions of Brahms by violinists, provided 
a Mother's Day activity for mothers who would be alone on this holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of her," Joyce Caplan, 51, said of her mother, Muriel Shapiro, 
who organized the concert and played Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu. "She was a 
piano teacher when I was growing up and she teaches (at the Valley Storefront). 
This music has to be passed on and preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Caplan does her best to help her mother by furnishing her with old classical 
music sheets she finds in her antique business in Sherman Oaks. Shapiro, who is 
in her 70s, likes to share the music with her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Other audience members came to the concert at the senior center simply because 
they had no one with whom to share Mother's Day. One of those was Marion 
Walson, 77, of Studio City, whose two sons live in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 A pianist herself, Walson hoped the concert would inspire her to spend 
Mother's Day practicing on the black-and-white keys at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that older people are still supple and able to perform," 
Walson said. "We're not over the hill." JEFF SCHNAUFER

 The good news about this garden party is that no one will force you to play 
croquet, wear white or sip watery iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if you show up in a ripped and soiled T-shirt, cutoffs and flip-flops 
and spill soda on yourself, the hosts at Haven Hills won't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would they care? You'll be in your own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, the only San Fernando Valley shelter for battered women and their 
children, is sending out invitations to a Phantom Garden Party complete with a 
packet of seeds and an RSVP card that states: "* Yes, count me in. I will be 
delighted NOT to come." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the fund-raising non-party, invitees can send in their RSVP card 
with savings on a traffic ticket, $50; savings on gas, parking and 
miscellaneous expenses, $25; or savings on a dress or a new sports jacket, 
$150. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you plant your package of seeds, think of the shelter and services that 
Haven Hills provides to battered women and their children," reads the mauve 
invitation, which carries a reminder to wear sunscreen and kneepads to your own 
garden party. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising dinners and parties have become so expensive to put on that 
organizations either end up with little left from the donations or have to 
charge high ticket prices, the event's organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for this party, donors don't have to commit to a long evening, "buy 
clothes, hire a baby-sitter or do any of this other stuff," said Betty Fisher, 
director of the West Valley shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills has sent out 3,500 of the invitations and seed packets donated by 
local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to raise $15,000, then I'd be real happy," said Karyn Palmer, 
chairwoman of Haven Hills' fund-raising committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, a private, nonprofit organization, has operated in the San 
Fernando Valley since 1977. It has sheltered more than 5,300 women and children 
victims of domestic violence. The organization also has a crisis phone line.

<P>
 A slow-moving Pacific storm that contributed to a fatal car accident and 
caused minor mudslides and traffic tie-ups Friday is expected to hover over 
Ventura County throughout the weekend, producing scattered showers and a chance 
of thunderstorms, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 30-minute period Friday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol 
reported half a dozen traffic accidents in the Ventura County area, including 
an accident that killed two people near Bates Road just north of the county 
line.  
</P>
<P>
 Two died and four others were critically injured when three cars were involved 
in a head-on crash on the southbound Ventura Freeway at about 3 p.m., the CHP 
said. One of the cars hydroplaned, jumped the center divider and crashed into 
oncoming traffic, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the dead was identified as Jonathan Jenkins, 32, a resident of England, 
the CHP said. The identity of the other person killed, a Santa Barbara 
resident, was not released.  
</P>
<P>
 The four survivors, whose identities were not available late Friday, were all 
in critical condition at St. Francis Medical Center in Santa Barbara, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southbound lanes of the freeway were closed and traffic rerouted to California 
150 for several hours, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers responded to mudslides at three locations on the Pacific 
Coast Highway, but kept the road open.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Ventura Police Department's Block Party and the Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce's Cinco de Mayo festival in Oxnard said today's events will 
proceed as scheduled. County Rainfall

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; RESIDENTS OPPOSE CHABAD EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of an Oak Park neighborhood want to halt the expansion of a Jewish 
worship center, saying they fear it will drive down property values and alter 
the quaint nature of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to lower our property values in the long run," neighbor Arlene 
Fishstein said. "It's just an inappropriate spot for that type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For about the past year, members of Chabad of the Conejo Valley, a 
conservative sect of Hasidic Jews, have used the 1,700-square-foot house on 
Conifer Street as a place to pray and conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 They submitted plans March 23 for a 1,300-square-foot expansion that included 
a second story and a small parking lot in the back yard. Those changes would 
have required a parking variance and zone change from the Ventura County 
Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council first recommended that the plan be 
approved but reversed itself when neighbors protested, saying they had been 
given the impression that the expansion was to be more limited than the plans 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
 To appease neighbors, the Chabad this week eliminated the parking lot from its 
plans and proposed building out instead of up, a planning official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current plan no longer requires a variance or zone change, according to 
senior planner Ron Allen. Since neighbors complained, however, Chabad must now 
apply for a permit to hold religious meetings in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say they still don't approve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lost any sort of goodwill they had by doing it on the sly," said David 
Winstone, who lives across the street from the Chabad house. The group "said 
one thing, did another," Winstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad Rabbi Moshe Bryski declined to comment, saying he wanted to let the 
issue die and to repair relations with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal is undergoing a 30-day review by the Planning Department.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE TO RULE ON CONFISCATED FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge said Friday that he would soon issue a written decision on who is 
entitled to about $65,000 confiscated from the car, office and bedroom of a 
Simi Valley priest once accused of stealing from his former parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan Steele did not specify when he would issue his 
opinion on the fate of money seized by police from Father David Dean Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was acquitted last month of an embezzlement charge by a Superior Court 
jury, which deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal on a grand-theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
 During the six-week trial, the defense maintained that a senior pastor framed 
Piroli by planting much of the money found in his room at St. Peter Claver in 
Simi Valley and inside his church-owned car. The embezzlement charge stemmed 
from accusations against Piroli at Sacred heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli's attorney argued Friday that about $11,000 of the confiscated money 
belongs to the priest, as well as $23,000 frozen in Piroli's bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary C. Peace accused Piroli of now claiming money that he 
disowned during the trial -- an allegation denied by Piroli's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele ordered Piroli to pay $3,000 to two local banks and the Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles for copying documents he had requested for his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli has also sued the Archdiocese, saying it defamed him during the 
criminal investigation he faced. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COST TO RESERVE STAGE AT ARTS PLAZA 
REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraging community groups to use the Civic Arts Plaza, the Thousand Oaks 
theater commission has reduced upfront costs for low-budget organizations 
seeking to rent stage space. 
</P>
<P>
 From student dancers to classical pianists to vaudeville actors, performers 
wishing to stage productions in the 400-seat Forum Theater will now be allowed 
to reserve show dates with a small down payment, instead of forking over the 
entire rent in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent for nonprofit groups costs $400 per performance, and profit-making 
ventures must pay $800 per show. It will cost $200 a day to rehearse in the 
Forum Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The old contract called for performers to pay, in full, rental charges and 
estimated stage crew fees before the first show.  
</P>
<P>
 The revisions allow groups to reserve the stage with a down payment of $200 
for an individual performance and $100 per show for a run of several nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they book a year in advance, asking them to pay the full rent might mean 
that one of their members has to pay from his own pocket," theater Director Tom 
Mitze said, noting that most groups depend on ticket sales to cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 To further ease the financial burden on local groups, commissioners agreed to 
allow some troupes to staff the theater with qualified volunteers, instead of 
paying for the Civic Arts Plaza's stage crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater commissioners also unanimously agreed to consider allowing rap and 
heavy metal concerts on a case-by-case basis. The concert promoters would have 
to pay for any extra security deemed necessary. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 4 TARGETED MOTELS HIRE PRIVATE SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Culminating a months-long battle between Van Nuys neighbors and motel owners, 
four motels on crime-plagued Sepulveda Boulevard this week pooled their 
resources and hired private security, a move intended to comply with city 
orders to curb prostitution in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The motel owners, who for months said hiring security would cause them 
financial hardship, will pay less than $10,000 a month for the service. The 
decision brought expressions of relief from those who have considered the 
motels magnets for prostitution, drug dealing and other crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled," said Rosalind Wayman, field deputy for City Councilman 
Marvin Braude, who initiated the city's crackdown on the motels in December at 
the request of neighborhood constituents. "My sense is, at this point, (the 
motel owners) are complying with the security condition. I believe they really 
want to resolve this." 
</P>
<P>
 The motels, located along a 2.9-mile stretch of Sepulveda Boulevard from 
Camarillo Street to Sherman Way, are the El Cortez, the Town House, the Cinema 
and the Bali Hi. None of the owners returned calls requesting a comment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bill Van Horenbeeck, general manager of West Hills Patrol and Guard 
Inc., disclosed details about the four motels' contract with his company. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are providing right now is a security guard eight hours a day, seven 
days a week, plus 24-hour response," Van Horenbeeck said. "Our officers make 
regular rounds at irregular intervals." 
</P>
<P>
 The guard, who will ride in a patrol car, will be responsible for chasing 
prostitutes and drug dealers from the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Troublesome trespassers would probably be handled by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, although the guards are equipped to make citizen's arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city's Board of Zoning Appeals again ordered all four motels 
to participate in a security program to discourage prostitution and other 
illegal activity that police say occurs at the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than forcing all the motels to hire individual security -- at a cost of 
as much as $60,000 per year per motel -- the zoning panel allowed the owners to 
split the cost for 24-hour on-call security, as long as the Bali Hi retained an 
eight-hour-a-day security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The security requirement is one of 27 conditions imposed on the motels in 
March by a city zoning official who investigated the businesses and branded 
them public nuisances. A fifth motel, the Chateau, has since closed. The motels 
were ordered to comply with the conditions or risk closure by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hold a review within the next 100 days to determine if its 
conditions have been met by all four motels and whether they have been 
effective in eliminating the crime problems. JEFF SCHNAUFER

<P>
 The 11th annual Sylmar Parade will take place today with the most diverse 
group of entries ever, parade organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sylmar: Something for Everyone" is the theme of this year's parade, sponsored 
by the Sylmar Chamber of Commerce.More than 50 entries, including clowns, 
floats, the Sylmar High School band, Polynesian dancers, equestrian groups, 
antique and specialty cars and drill teams will make their way through Sylmar, 
starting at 10:30 a.m. at Sylmar Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will travel on Borden Avenue to Polk Street, then east on Foothill 
Boulevard, south onto Hubbard Street to Glenoaks Boulevard and back to Polk 
Street, ending in Sylmar Park at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Jacobs, the chamber's executive director, will hand out trophies to the 
34 best entries, and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon will be the 
parade's grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be the best one yet," said Doris Jacobs of the Sylmar chamber.

BE 'TRUE TO YOURSELF,' FILMMAKER TELLS YOUTHS; SERVICE: ROBERT TOWNSEND TALKS 
TO 100 BOYS AT CAMP HOLTON PROBATION FACILITY AS PART OF THE L.A. THEATRE 
WORKS' ARTS AND CHILDREN PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Right in front of their eyes, without props or wardrobe, actor-filmmaker 
Robert Townsend transformed himself into pieces of his past. 
</P>
<P>
 As an audience of young men at Camp Holton probation camp looked on intently, 
Townsend slipped easily into real-life characters: the neighborhood drug 
dealer, his grandmother, his "homeboy" from Chicago, who shot down his dreams 
of making it in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "You on welfare like everybody else," Townsend said mimicking his street-smart 
friend. "You ain't gon' be the next Billy Dee Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard 'cause that's supposed to be your boy," Townsend told the crowd in 
his own voice. "You gotta check out who your friends really are . . . If a 
friend says you can't do it, he's not your friend." 
</P>
<P>
 To the 100 teen-agers in the gym at the camp on Friday, Townsend's past 
sounded a lot like their own lives, and after his nearly hour-long motivational 
presentation about holding on to and reaching their dreams, many left believing 
that maybe their futures could be as bright as his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try," said Tommy, 16, after hearing Townsend speak. "I might not 
make it but I'm going to try. Everybody's got a dream, but it's hard to stay 
committed to that dream." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, who wrote and produced, "The Five Heartbeats," "Hollywood Shuffle," 
and "Meteor Man," appeared as part of the L.A. Theatre Works' Arts and Children 
Project. LATW recruits artists to teach visual, performing and literary arts to 
incarcerated youth throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tremendous talent in the (camps,)" said LATW spokeswoman Gale Cohen. 
"It's a resource you have to mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The young men at Holton delivered raps written especially for Townsend, shared 
their poetry and plans for the future, then gave the actor-filmmaker several 
boisterous standing ovation after his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that kids see someone who came from a similar 
situation -- on welfare, no father figure -- who went on to make something on 
himself," Townsend said an in interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor and writer Tommy Hicks, who conducts dramatic workshops with Holton 
youth, invited Townsend as part of his own effort to help fill a gap he sees 
all too often in the lives of today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This generation does not have the mentoring that past generations have had," 
he said. "My generation had mentors. We had someone telling us what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said that as a young man, he was lucky to be taken under the wings of 
men in his neighborhood who would not let him become involve in crime -- even 
if they were.  
</P>
<P>
 "All I'm doing is what guys did for me when I was growing up," Hicks said. " . 
. . Even though I have a career, I have to do this. I feel a need." 
</P>
<P>
 During the presentation, young men sat transfixed by Townsend's comic but 
serious stories about "growing up eating government cheese," and about his 
teen-age friends who all wanted to be pimps after the movies "The Mack" and 
"Superfly" came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I do movies on the real tip is because they're telling you a lie," 
Townsend said, pointing out the negative and stereotyped images of Latinos and 
African Americans found in some Hollywood films.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I first started acting," he said. "The first thing they 
wanted me to do was be a pimp. Then every role after that was a pimp. It was 
like 29 pimps," he said as the audience roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend's vignettes also stressed the importance of being "your own man," and 
of saying no to the temptation to commit violent crime in hopes of gaining 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw people get beat down over dumb stuff, stupid stuff," he said, 
remembering a child who was brutally killed over a watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was he a man? No?" he said of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then he told the group about the drug dealers from his neighborhood who had 
nice cars but, "never really enjoyed them." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's thinking, 'somebody could take me out at any second if I sell them the 
wrong stuff,' " Townsend said, acting out the role of a paranoid drug dealer.  
</P>
<P>
 If Townsend's stories about growing up and rising above the negativity around 
him were not enough to convince the young men of their own power to achieve, 
his true story about making an independent movie with credit cards -- a movie 
that eventually made $16 million -- might have turned the doubters into 
believers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard work really does pay off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated near the front, Jonathan, 15, was the first to stand up when Townsend 
opened the floor for questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about when I get out of here of publishing a book," he said. 
"How do I go about doing that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend explained the process of publishing and encouraged Jonathan to send 
him a copy of his manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Jonathan recited a poem he wrote about Black History for Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One young man in the back stood up and asked Townsend squarely: 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you rise above the rest if everybody is trying to bring you down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta be true to yourself," Townsend said. "A lot of it comes with being 
your own man . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 After the presentation, some young men said they saw parts of themselves in 
the stories Townsend shared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like me, you know?" said Alex, 15. "I'm happy he came and shared with 
us. A lot of people are happy he came. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was very inspiring," said Thomas, 17, who wants to be a real estate 
agent. "He told the truth."

LIFE INSIDE THE 'GLASS HOUSE'; SIMI VALLEY: PRESIDENTS' DAUGHTERS GATHER AT THE 
REAGAN LIBRARY TO RECALL GROWING UP AS PART OF AMERICA'S FIRST FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Luci Baines Johnson remembers going to sleep to the echoes of protesters 
outside the White House yelling, "Hey, hey, L.B.J., how many kids did you kill 
today?"  
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Hoover Brigham, granddaughter of President Herbert Hoover, recalls a 
time during the Great Depression when the mother of a childhood friend forbade 
them to play together. "She's responsible for your father losing his job," 
Brigham remembers the woman telling her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 At an unusual gathering Friday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in 
Simi Valley, women who grew up in the White House talked about how the 
experience was decidedly a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ford Bales, daughter of Gerald Ford, got to have her senior prom at the 
White House. And Luci Baines Johnson's marriage was the first White House 
wedding in 50 years, one that was celebrated on the cover of Life magazine and 
beamed to every television in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson also recalled when a Secret Service agent yanked her out of her 
high school Spanish class after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew right at that moment that my life would never be the same, and it 
wasn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former First Lady Nancy Reagan introduced the panel, saying each woman would 
bring a "human dimension to the presidential events of the last six decades" -- 
a history, she said, that was "too important to leave to the historians."  
</P>
<P>
 Bales remembered being the first person to throw a Frisbee on the Great Wall 
of China with cartoonist Garry Trudeau and shaking hands with Chairman Mao, 
whom she remembers as overly forward to her.  
</P>
<P>
 Bales and Johnson were both teen-agers in the White House and shared a similar 
discomfort with spending their formative years in what they called the nation's 
"glass house" and "fishbowl."  
</P>
<P>
 Bales said there were wonderful benefits to being the President's daughter, 
like meeting celebrities and receiving VIP treatment at rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved Rod Stewart and was ecstatic when I got to go backstage," she said. 
"The flip side of that was that the tabloids were reporting a week later that I 
was engaged to Rod Stewart." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bales and Johnson recalled going on dates while being shadowed by Secret 
Service agents and having their personal lives reported in the media. But 
Brigham, who lived at the White House from age 3 to 6, said she had only 
nannies keeping her in line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Later on we did get driven to school by the Secret Service," she recalled. "I 
remember they had a big blue roadster with a rumble seat, and if we were good 
they'd let us sit back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Reagan, who was grown and married when her father took office, said 
her memories centered on the White House itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a warmer or more hospitable place," she said. "I was 
always aware that our time there was finite, and I felt privileged. When it 
came time to leave, I cried." 
</P>
<P>
 The same emotions overcame Johnson as she watched the inauguration of 
President Richard Nixon in 1969.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember standing there, tears welling up in my eyes, and Tricia (Nixon) 
hugging me, saying: 'Don't worry, we'll invite you back,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the more than 450 people who heard the discussion seemed impressed by 
the insiders' view of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was magnificent," said Vee Rosevear of Modesto, who came with her 
husband. "I found myself in tears more than a couple of times. I wish everyone 
could have heard this. It really shows the personal side of things, to see the 
humanity of these people we read about." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was held to kick off a new exhibit at the library that organizers 
hope will illuminate the personal side of presidential families. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Madame President," it is the largest show on First Ladies and their 
families ever exhibited outside the Smithsonian Institution. The show includes 
more than 200 objects of personal memorabilia, from Martha Washington's 
petticoat to Hillary Clinton's law degree.  
</P>
<P>
 Library Director Richard Norton Smith said the event and the exhibit were 
meant to bring history to life. He said the shared experiences of the women on 
the panel and the more than 40 First Ladies featured in the exhibit transcend 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a special relationship that binds them all together," he said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 "Madame President" will run for six months at the Reagan library. General 
admission is $4, seniors $2. Children under 15 are admitted free. On Mother's 
Day, all mothers will be admitted for free. Library hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Monday through Saturday, and Sunday noon to 5 p.m. For more information call 
(805) 522-8444.

FEMA APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadline to apply for disaster assistance for the Jan. 17 earthquake has 
been extended 60 days, a FEMA spokesperson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster relief agencies are continuing to receive more than 1,600 individual 
assistance applications daily, said Federal Emergency Management Agency 
spokesperson Russ Edmonston. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the aftershocks, people realize they may have more damage than they had 
with the original quake," Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local, state and federal agencies hope the new July 18 deadline will 
accommodate any additional requests for aid, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking assistance can apply at any of the 11 earthquake service centers 
in the Los Angeles area or by calling the registration number at 800-462-9029, 
or 800-462-7585 for the hearing or speech impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, earthquake service centers are situated in 
Northridge, Sylmar, Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks and at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to apply for Small Business Administration loans was also 
extended to July 18, but the Oct. 17 deadline for SBA economic injury loans 
will not be extended, according to a statement released jointly by the 
assistance agencies.

MANY QUAKE VICTIMS STILL AWAIT NEW APARTMENTS; HOUSING: ABOUT 8,000 FAMILIES 
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CASH IN THEIR EMERGENCY VOUCHERS BECAUSE HUD HAS NOT 
INSPECTED THEIR OLD AND NEW HOMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Four months after the Jan. 17 earthquake, 40% of the nearly 19,000 low-income 
families who received emergency-housing vouchers still haven't moved into new 
apartments, a top Housing and Urban Development official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the program has been extraordinarily successful," said Joseph 
Shuldiner, HUD's assistant secretary for housing. But 8,000 families have not 
been able to exchange their vouchers for temporary apartments chiefly because 
they must wait for HUD to inspect both their old and new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 families have found new places to live and just need those 
inspections, Shuldiner said. "I would expect in another month we'll have taken 
care of the balance of people who still need housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The HUD vouchers pay most of the rent for displaced, low-income quake victims 
for 18 months. The deadline for applying for the vouchers was April 30. HUD set 
aside $200 million for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuldiner did not blame the delay on uncooperative landlords. On the contrary, 
he said, the publicity the special voucher program has received since the 
Northridge quake has made more landlords aware of HUD's ongoing 
housing-assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The vouchers were expressly created to encourage landlords to rent to 
low-income quake victims. Voucher recipients pay 30% of their monthly income to 
the landlord and HUD pays the balance for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuldiner said HUD doesn't expect to extend the voucher program to more than 
18 months of housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize we're only giving people middle-term relief," he said. "But until 
we get through this period we won't know who will need more aid." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the voucher program's only goal was to help people find housing and 
stabilize their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Santa Monica, that's probably going to happen because many of the victims 
there were working folk who can get themselves back on their feet in 18 
months," he said. "But in the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles, there were 
more lower-income people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Shuldiner also addressed the issue of illegal immigrants 
possibly getting some of the aid. Starting Feb. 25, he said, HUD required 
voucher applicants to sign declarations stating they were legal citizens of the 
United States or otherwise in the country legally and to show California 
identification, such as a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time those controls were adopted, Shuldiner said, "fewer than 1% of 
applicants refused to sign the declarations. That tells me the number of 
illegal aliens trying to apply for vouchers was insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the program questioned whether the voucher program was 
necessary in addition to the traditional Federal Emergency Management Agency 
housing assistance program. Together, they added up to $8.6 billion of federal 
relief, the most expensive disaster-aid effort in U.S. history.  
</P>
<P>
 Shuldiner said HUD is studying whether the voucher program should be used in 
the wake of other disasters and what changes, if any, should be made in it.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER AWARDING 424 ALLOTMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT; THOUSAND OAKS: 
IMPACT ON POLICE SERVICES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRIOR TO PROCESS, COUNCILWOMAN 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How many hours do police officers spend protecting each home in Thousand Oaks? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski wants answered before the city 
plunges into the annual development allotment process and starts handing out 
permission to build new houses, apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing on Tuesday, the council will consider awarding developers 
a total of 424 allotments, each representing one residential unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most have already been promised to MGM Ranch and Dos Vientos Ranch under 
development agreements signed years ago. But staff is also urging the council 
to grant 45 allotments for a townhouse complex on Hillcrest Drive and another 
13 for a similar project on Haigh Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's slow-growth law, each project must receive allotments before 
construction can begin. To determine which projects should get the allotments, 
planners each year consider two dozen issues.  
</P>
<P>
 They look at whether the project can be effectively and swiftly served by 
existing fire stations. They examine how the development would affect traffic 
on city streets and local freeways. And they study details from architectural 
design to wheelchair accessibility to the impact on oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But they never consider how the project might strain police resources. 
</P>
<P>
 And that omission troubles Zukowski, who has repeatedly expressed fear that 
new development will tax an already strapped Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like an assessment of how much it costs to serve each additional 
unit," Zukowski said at last week's council meeting. "I don't feel we've gone 
far enough in precisely determining the costs" of new development. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fellow council members, however, argue that the city already takes care to 
provide for the safety of all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members consider population growth -- including projected development 
-- when drafting a budget for police services, Councilwoman Judy Lazar noted. 
Last fall, to keep up with demand, they added four police officers and three 
civilian law-enforcement employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We maintain a very, very safe community," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, crime prevention specialists in the Sheriff's Department 
routinely evaluate development proposals to make sure projects are designed 
safely. They may recommend planting lower shrubs or eliminating dark corners, 
for example, so the complex will be less appealing to crooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, developers must pay hefty fees for each bedroom or square foot they 
build -- money that goes to support schools, parks and also police. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects requiring special attention, such as a new road or water reservoir, 
are saddled with additional mitigation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developers are, in effect, keeping up with any demands on the system that 
their projects might create," said Elaine Freeman, a Thousand Oaks consultant 
who specializes in land-use planning. "It's not as if projects go forward 
without analysis of the impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zukowski contends that the city's impact reports often focus just on the 
first few years of a development's life -- how much it would cost to widen a 
road or expand a playground to accommodate the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development fees are like a shot of adrenaline, but after five years we find 
that the city's putting out more than it ever received," Zukowski said. "We're 
looking at the very short term." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp agreed. "Obviously, if we keep building all these 
projects, that adds to the workload of law enforcement," she said. "And we 
haven't had the staffing to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's development allotment system, refined in 1990, requires planners to 
rank projects on a scale of one to 10. Developers get extra points for 
providing amenities such as bike trails or energy-efficient homes. They earn 
low ratings for creating traffic jams or chopping oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects that rack up the most points are deemed the most beneficial to the 
city, and get first crack at the development allotments. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks allotments were coveted in the mid-1980s, but demand has sagged 
with the sinking economy. This year, planners have recommended saving 53 of the 
city's 650 available allotments until the housing market rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when allotments are granted, they often just collect dust on builders' 
blueprints. Many projects approved by the council and awarded allotments never 
reach the ground-breaking stage, due to a poor economy or bankrupt developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the volatility of the housing market, "We don't agree with having 
development allotments in the first place," said Dee Zinke, executive officer 
of the Building Industry Assn. "It's not necessary to artificially constrain 
the market."

L.A. COUNCIL GETS TOUGH ON EMERGENCY MEDICAL BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing its search for new revenue, the Los Angeles City Council voted 
Friday to aggressively pursue unpaid bills for ambulance and emergency medical 
services -- an effort that could raise up to $1.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, proposed by San Fernando Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick, calls on 
the city to spend about $538,000 to hire a team of nine clerks and bill 
collectors to crack down on delinquent bills for an 18-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very excited about saving money and that is what this is going to do," 
Chick said after the council voted unanimously for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have said more staff members are needed because the Los Angeles 
Fire Department's collection rate is about 50%, primarily due to an increasing 
workload and an overworked staff that doesn't have time to follow up on each 
unpaid bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, the number of medical emergencies that the Fire 
Department has attended increased by about 50%, from 151,519 in fiscal year 
1981-82 to 223,205 in fiscal 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Fire Department collected more than $12 million in fees, about 5% 
of the department's $230-million budget for that year. 
</P>
<P>
 To collect fees, the department sends a bill, then three follow-up 
notifications, fire officials said. But if the bills are ignored, the city's 
collection efforts end. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Rose, a Chick aide, blamed most of the lost revenues on bills sent to the 
wrong address or unpaid because of incorrect insurance information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going after people who can't pay," Rose said. "We are losing 
millions of dollars a year because we are unable to go after people who can 
afford to pay the fees." 
</P>
<P>
 One way the proposed collection unit can increase revenues is to track down 
people who have changed addresses and to correct erroneous insurance 
information that keeps the city from collecting the fees, he said. The program 
is aimed at generating an additional $1.5 million annually, Rose said.

EPA ASKS 50 FIRMS TO SETTLE GROUND WATER SUIT; CLEANUP: IF BURBANK COMPANIES 
AGREE ON COSTS, THEY WILL BE EXEMPT FROM LOCKHEED LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM. AT 
ISSUE IS FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CITY WELL POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual move, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials on Friday 
encouraged 50 firms they say helped pollute the ground water in Burbank to 
settle with the government for cleanup costs and thereby exempt themselves from 
a lawsuit against them by the Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, which is currently on the hook for the majority of the Gargantuan 
Superfund cleanup, has demanded financial contributions -- ranging from $50,000 
to $15 million per company -- from dozens of firms it says also polluted the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . We're trying to bring in some of the liable parties and sign them up 
to long-term contracts instead of letting Lockheed decide their fate," said 
Thomas P. Mintz, EPA associate regional counsel. "By definition, we're in 
charge, and the Lockheed suit becomes a secondary matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that settled with Lockheed would still have to contend with the EPA, 
but not vice versa, Mintz said. Under the provisions of the federal Superfund 
program, which requires polluters to fund the cleanup of toxic waste sites, 
companies that settle with the EPA are exempt from third-party lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the financial responsibility for purging ground water supplies of 
chemical solvents that have seeped into the vast reservoir beneath the San 
Fernando Valley and into Burbank's municipal water supply wells, which were 
shut down in 1986 after pollution was found. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Lockheed entered an agreement with the EPA to design, build and run a 
ground water treatment system in Burbank until the year 2000. Lockheed is 
currently finishing construction of the system, which will continuously cleanse 
12,000 gallons of water per minute for up to 20 years. The company expects the 
cost of the system to exceed $172 million, and is seeking contributions from 
the other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the EPA is seeking money from 50 companies -- including Lockheed -- 
for the period after the year 2000, to pay for running the system until at 
least 2015, which is necessary to cleanse the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce O'Donell, an attorney representing Lockheed, welcomed the EPA's move, 
saying it will help take the financial burden off the defense giant in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If other parties come in with and settle with the EPA, that will reduce our 
costs, and will achieve the same purpose as our lawsuit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Goodreau, chairman of the California Industrial Leadership Council, a 
small-business advocacy group, welcomed the EPA's move -- but for different 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed literally tried to intimidate these companies into paying up or 
having to face the wrath of their lawyers," said Goodreau. "I would be 
surprised if anyone turns the EPA deal down." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donell said Lockheed has gone out of its way to be fair to smaller 
companies, many of which it helped keep in business during the recession by 
awarding them small contracts, and warned those who see the EPA as a white 
knight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The EPA is the real 800-pound gorilla, not Lockheed," O'Donell said. "I'm not 
saying the EPA is not fair, but there is no reason to believe they are fairer 
than we."

'BRYANT FAMILY' LAWYERS APPEAL TO HIGH COURT FOR A NEW PROSECUTOR; CRIME: 
CHARGING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WITH IMPROPRIETIES, THEY SEEK AN ORDER 
SHIFTING THE DRUG AND MURDER CASE TO THE STATE LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys in the "Bryant Family" drug and murder case have asked the 
state Supreme Court to order that their clients be prosecuted by the state 
attorney general -- not the Los Angeles district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, Andrew Settle and Donald Smith, are accused of being part of a 
crime ring that masterminded attacks leading to murder and that sold up to half 
a million dollars in cocaine each month in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attorneys had accused the district attorney's office of improprieties, 
including tampering with witnesses and withholding evidence from the defense 
during pretrial proceedings, and in January, 1993, Superior Judge J.D. Smith 
agreed to send the case to the attorney general's office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But an appeals court ruled on March 3 that Smith had overstepped his 
authority, and it returned the prosecution role to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis E. Mulcahy, an attorney representing Settle, told Smith that he filed 
the petition April 14 with the state Supreme Court, which has until June 10 to 
decide whether to rule on the petition or to grant a 30-day extension. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the long series of pretrial proceedings in the case 
continues. A hearing has been scheduled for June 24 in Smith's courtroom, when 
a trial date could be set if the Supreme Court has reached a decision at that 
time. Prosecutors and defense attorneys estimated Friday that the trial could 
begin as early as a few months after the June date or as late as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McCormick said he is confident the case will not be 
taken away from his office by the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing improper done by the district attorney's office for the 
recusal in the first place," McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
 State prosecutors opposed taking on the case, arguing that the district 
attorney's office was more familiar with the complex prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our office's position is that under the law there is no reason for the 
district attorney's office not to try the case," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Douglas 
Sortino, one of more than a dozen attorneys who attended the hearing Friday.

GIRL, 5, CRITICAL AFTER FALLING INTO POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5-year-old girl was in critical condition late Friday after falling into a 
swimming pool, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was found by her mother about 9 a.m. in a pool on Tulsa Street in 
Granada Hills, according to Brian Humphrey, a Los Angeles Fire Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, whose identity was withheld, called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, "the child had no pulse and was not breathing," Humphrey said. 
The 911 operator gave instructions on how to administer cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child was doing poorly," Humphrey said, "but the mother remained calm and 
took instructions well. During the entire time, she was continuing CPR." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was taken to Granada Hills Community Hospital in critical condition 
and was then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital about 12:30 p.m., according to Hal Wurtzel, a spokesman 
for Valley Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was taken to Valley Presbyterian, Wurtzel said, because it has the 
largest pediatric intensive care unit in northern Los Angeles County.

CAMARILLO MAN ARRAIGNED IN DRUG CASE; CRIME: NO EXPLOSIVES CHARGES ARE FILED 
DESPITE PIPE BOMB DISCOVERY. THREE OTHERS ARE ALSO ARRESTED.

<P>
 A Camarillo man was arraigned Friday on one count of drug possession and one 
count of drug possession for sale, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Crawford, 61, was arrested Wednesday by Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies, who served a search warrant at his house on the 1700 block of Las 
Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 During the search, investigators found a 6-inch pipe bomb in the living room, 
but Crawford was not charged with its possession because detectives do not have 
enough evidence to prove it belonged to him, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Grunert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts deactivated the bomb, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics detectives said they had received several calls about suspected drug 
sales at Crawford's house and a house next door. Both homes had been under 
surveillance by sheriff's deputies for about three months, Sgt. Arnie Aviles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the pipe bomb, investigators found gunpowder and other items used to 
make a bomb. They also found evidence of drug sales, including 
methamphetamines, scales and packing material, Aviles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford was being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, 
authorities said. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrested three other people at the time of drug bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Walkley, 54, of Camarillo, who lived next door to Crawford, was 
arrested on suspicion of possessing narcotics paraphernalia. He was released 
Friday from County Jail and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Perry, 26, of Camarillo was arrested on suspicion of being under the 
influence of methamphetamines. He was released Friday and is scheduled to be 
arraigned June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Kari Baker, 23, of Camarillo was arrested on suspicion of possessing narcotics 
paraphernalia and being under the influence of methamphetamines. She was 
released Friday and is scheduled to be arraigned June 3. PEGGY Y. LEE

 "You never know. I might end up in this place," said Ted Schroeder, 87, of 
Santa Clarita, who stopped by to examine the new facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 The center works with patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other 
forms of memory loss. Providing daytime activities and health care for up to 50 
patients, it has been in operation since Feb. 9, its formal opening delayed by 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Friday's ceremony, including Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson 
and Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, praised center employees 
for establishing a much-needed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that for the area of the Santa Clarita Valley, where 18% of the 
people who live here are -- I don't want to say old -- less than young, I think 
it's important to have these types of facilities," Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center places more emphasis on activities than on medical service, 
although a full-time registered nurse is on duty, center employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Brown, an activity coordinator, said patients participate in music, 
gardening and other activities that help many cope with short-term memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that, although their memories are really poor -- they can't remember 
what they did 10 minutes ago -- they can sing a full song," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs $50 a day to use the facility, but donations make it possible to 
accept patients on an ability-to-pay basis, said Lisa Foust, president of the 
hospital's foundation.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LEGAL ACTION LIKELY IN DISPUTE OVER CLAS TEST; 
SCHOOLS: EDUCATION DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY SAYS WARNINGS TO ANTELOPE VALLEY ARE NOT 
'EMPTY THREATS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Education will likely seek a court order next week 
mandating that the Antelope Valley Union High School District give the 
controversial CLAS test in the wake of the district's continuing refusal to 
administer the exam.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first time for the department to take a school district to 
court over CLAS. Allan Keown, a Department of Education attorney, said a 
decision on whether to go to court will be made in the coming days. "These have 
not been empty threats we're making," he said, referring to a letter the 
department sent the district last month promising legal action if the 
California Learning Assessment Test is not administered. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley district board, said Friday he 
was hopeful the Education Department would decide against legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping that they wouldn't, that they would allow the four districts 
(who have decided not to give the test) to go this way," he said. "There's so 
much controversy with the test now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being praised by its supporters as a revolutionary method of testing 
students, the test is facing increasing opposition. Critics contend, among 
other things, that the literature portions of CLAS ask personal questions that 
violate the privacy of students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there has been so much controversy over the test, Pricer said, the 
court may be sympathetic. But he said he would not defy any court order 
requiring the 1994 CLAS test to be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative majority of the Antelope Valley board voted April 20 not to 
give the CLAS test. In response, the Department of Education ordered the 
district to administer it, gave the board until May 6 to notify the department 
of its intent and threatened legal action if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting in a closed session Thursday night for more than two hours, the 
conservative board majority again prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to purposefully give a flawed test to any students, and CLAS is 
obviously flawed," Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Wilda Andrejcik and Bill Olenick, who both voted with the 
minority, said they believe parents should be able to decide whether their 
children should take the exam.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrejcik and Olenick also expressed concern with the financial implications 
of the board's defiance. The Antelope Valley district is recovering from a 
$14-million deficit that forced layoffs and program reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Keown, the Department of Education attorney, said the education code mandates 
that every school district in the state give CLAS to students in the fourth, 
fifth, eighth and 10th grades. CLAS opponents, however, argue that while a 
statewide assessment test must be given, they do not believe that test must be 
CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other tests that we can give," Pricer said. "Parents want a test 
that will test the academics of their children and give an accurate result." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Antelope Valley district, three other school districts, 
including the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District, have decided against 
administering the 1994 CLAS test. Monterey Peninsula Unified and Slournoy Union 
Elementary School District, both in Northern California, are the other 
districts not giving the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education has not yet responded to the three other 
districts, but both department and district officials expect a response similar 
to that given to Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 More news of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears on B20.

WALTON Q. JUE; OWNER OF VENTURA'S OLDEST GROCERY STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walton Q. Jue, the founder and owner of Ventura's oldest grocery store, died 
Wednesday after a brief illness. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Jue came to the United States from China in 1922, and helped his uncle run a 
grocery store in Fresno until 1927, when a cousin persuaded him to move to 
Ventura. His cousin used the weather as the lure, promising it was neither too 
hot nor too cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Jue fell in love with the city and set to work to establish a business of his 
own. He opened the National Market a block away from San Buenaventura Mission 
and ran the store until 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Jue then moved the store to its present location, on the corner of Santa Cruz 
and Main streets. Jue and his first wife, Mary, chose a site on the eastern 
side of the street because she wanted the sun to come in the store's windows. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Dorothy Jue Lee, said her father was a true believer in the 
American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought America was a wonderful place," she said. "You could open a 
business and people would come." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was there for the opening of the new store in 1946. "Stores then always 
had their grand openings on Fridays, but that week was Friday the 13th," she 
said. "My dad was superstitious, so we had to have the opening on Thursday 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
 The business endured, while others came and went. In 1978, Jue retired, and 
turned the store over to his sons, Allen and Edward. 
</P>
<P>
 But his retirement was hardly complete; until he was 86, Jue was still driving 
his pickup truck to Oxnard to pick up fresh strawberries and vegetables for the 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 One rainy day, his son Allen said his father did not return from Oxnard at his 
usual time. Worried, he called emergency rooms around the county looking for 
him. Finally his father turned up, after dark, his pants covered in mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Where have you been?' " Allen Jue recalled. "And he said, 'Well, it 
started to rain, and all the workers left. So I had to pick the vegetables.' He 
just had to make his customers happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jue is survived by his wife of 31 years, Betty, of Ventura. His first wife, 
Mary, died in 1960. Also surviving him are four sons; Tony and Gene Jue, both 
of Los Angeles, Allen and Edward Jue, both of Ventura; three daughters, Dorothy 
Jue Lee of Ventura and Daisy Jue Yang of Thousand Oaks and Jeanne Jue Luna of 
Westlake Village; 17 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for 11 a.m. May 14 at the Ted Mayr Funeral Home, 
Ventura.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; VILLAGE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS, THOUGH LITTLE-KNOWN, ARE AMONG 
LARGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With nearly 1,900 elementary and high school students on its pastoral campus, 
it has one of the largest enrollments of any Christian school in the country 
outside the Roman Catholic educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Village Christian Schools in Sun Valley are relatively unknown, even in 
religious circles. The 30-acre campus lacks connections to a denomination or a 
large church. Nor is it visible from any thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a telephone installer come to campus once and he kept shaking his head 
in amazement because he said he had been all over the San Fernando Valley and 
never knew this was here," said David L. Wilson, director of development. "We 
do very little advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 The school got its name from Village Church in Burbank, which launched the 
school on Victory Boulevard in 1949. Ten years later, the school moved to land 
in La Tuna Canyon nestled against foothills of the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with registration at 1,882 students, Village Christian is third in 
enrollment behind the 2,100-student Pensacola Christian School in Florida and 
the 1,950-student Dayton Christian Schools in Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Catholic schools in the Los Angeles Archdiocese average 646 
students at high schools and 308 at elementary schools. One of the largest high 
schools is Bishop Amat in La Puente, with 1,700 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Steady growth has been the reward for high standards, an ambitious busing 
program that once used teachers as drivers and, ultimately, a campus removed 
from the increasingly urbanized Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fitted the needs of parents interested in the education of their children 
and in an atmosphere of good Bible teaching," said Elementary School Principal 
Victor E. Frendt, who will be honored at a retirement party Friday night for 
his 38 years at the Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The setting is a factor -- away from busy streets and where parents don't 
worry about drive-by shootings," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Village Christian subscribes to a policy of non-discrimination 
regarding racial and ethnic enrollment, it has a higher percentage of white 
students than public schools in the area. Supt. Ronald G. Sipus said that 
Village Christian has about 27% Latino students, 9% Asian American and less 
than .5% African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had high interest from the black community," Wilson said. "It's 
probably more for financial reasons than anything else. We have a larger Latino 
enrollment because Sun Valley has a high Hispanic population." 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian offers no scholarships or subsidies for minority students, 
Wilson said. Tuition ranges between $3,000 and $3,630 a year, which Sipus said 
is about the median for non-Catholic Christian schools in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 A campaign for an endowment fund to provide tuition aid to minorities and 
large, moderate-income families will be launched Friday at Frendt's retirement 
party. The fund will bear Frendt's name, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 65, Frendt started working for Village Christian Schools part-time in 1956 
while completing ministerial studies at Talbot Theological Seminary in La 
Mirada. He had intended to go into missionary work but was convinced that he 
was needed more as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, classes were held at Village Church and another Burbank 
location. That congregation grew to about 1,000 members until 1969 to 1970, 
when a series of internal disputes began to decimate the church, said the Rev. 
Wade Mikels, the current pastor. He said average Sunday attendance has risen 
from 150 to 300 people in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian Schools incorporated as a separate institution during the 
1970s. "The only connection today is that all school board members must be 
members of the church," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who began his association with Village Christian a few years after 
Frendt, said the two of them are the "dinosaurs" at the campus. Both learned to 
run heavy machinery to help build the fledgling campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Frendt supplemented his teaching salary by driving a school bus 
morning and night and his wife started teaching in public schools. It was 
nearly 20 years before his bus-driving stint ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in seminary I had expected to go into missionary work, so the idea 
of sacrifice went with my training," Frendt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools still operate 10 bus routes in the East Valley, Glendale and the 
Sunland-Tujunga area. The longest run is to Santa Clarita and Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Students applying to the secondary school grades are asked to provide a 
recommendation from their pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 While grades and citizenship count, a notice on admissions policy states: "It 
is desired that the student be one who has accepted Jesus Christ as his 
personal Savior, and one who is active, and whose parents are active in an 
evangelical church whose teaching is in agreement with Village Christian 
Schools' statement of faith. The student, if not a professing Christian, must 
be in agreement with the spiritual emphasis of VCS." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials Wilson and Sipus emphasized that applicants are considered 
case by case and that they consider their religious approach to be mainstream 
evangelical, not fundamentalist in a legalistic sense.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a rather detailed dress code, however. No extremes in hair style are 
allowed. High school boys may have well-groomed mustaches, but their hair 
should not hang over their collar or their ears. No earrings are tolerated on 
males. Girls' skirts and dresses measuring more than three inches above the top 
of the knee while the girl is standing are banned. 
</P>
<P>
 During the warmer months of May, June, September and October, modest shorts 
are permitted. But banned are tank tops and T-shirts portraying the rock 
culture or controversial themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In standards of faith and conduct, Sipus said, "we believe there are rules 
that people should follow . . . that there are black-and-white issues. Not 
everything is gray." At the same time, Sipus said, "nobody is perfect. We are 
trying to become more Christ-like." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that some parents think of a private school as a place that will 
"straighten out" a child. "Sometimes we can be very helpful in that area, but 
that's not really our prime purpose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian, which is located at Penrose Street and Village Avenue, 
signed an agreement in 1992 with the neighborhood to stay within its present 
acreage for 10 years. School officials also let neighbors use the horse trails 
on 77 acres it owns to the east of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 After the moratorium ends, the schools' facilities may be expanded to include 
tennis courts, a swimming pool and baseball fields, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Its enrollment will not grow much more -- the city has imposed a cap of 1,950 
students, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy caused us to dip below 1,900 students a year ago, but we expect 
to be above that mark again next fall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, Village Christian had to "be a little more aggressive" with 
advertisements and recruiting follow-ups, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CASTAIC SCHOOL OFFICIALS SEEK SAFE SITE FOR 
NEW ELEMENTARY CAMPUS; EDUCATION: TRUSTEES WANT TO AVOID BUSING STUDENTS ACROSS 
THE GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 School officials here are looking for a new elementary school site to avoid 
having to bus students across the Golden State Freeway to attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Union School District trustees voted 5 to 0 in closed session Thursday 
evening for a $25,000 feasibility study of a seven-acre site near Camino Del 
Valle Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmichael-Kemp Architects of Los Angeles will examine the Sloan Canyon Road 
property to see if its slope, seismic conditions and soil content are suitable 
for a school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking, (and) because the market and timing is right, this site 
may be in reach for the district," said board President Lester Freeman. 
"(There) is the reality that Castaic Elementary School, where it is located, is 
an old school." 
</P>
<P>
 No other sites are now being considered, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 students attend Castaic Elementary School, situated on North Ridge 
Route Road adjacent to Castaic Middle School. District officials want to close 
the existing campus and move all students to the new site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the possibility we would sell the existing site," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sloan Canyon Road property encompasses three parcels of land owned by 
different people. One site is vacant, two have houses on them. District 
officials declined to state the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only about a mile from the existing elementary school, the site is 
west of the Golden State Freeway where nine out of every 10 Castaic students 
live, and where additional homes are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents dislike having to drive their children across the freeway to 
attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point (the effort for a new school) is being driven by the issue of 
transportation, where children could walk to school instead of being bused," 
Supt. Scott Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students on the east side of the freeway will eventually be accommodated by 
elementary schools situated between the Golden State Freeway and Castaic Lake, 
north of the community, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has the deed to two other properties from Cook Ranch Associates 
as part of the 3,600-home development planned above Castaic Lake. Those two 
properties will be graded by the builder once construction of the 1,330-acre 
project begins. 
</P>
<P>
 No time frame has been set for when the district might open a new elementary 
school. A major factor in any purchase effort by the district will be the 
availability of state funding, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COMMUTER LANE PLANNED FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY 
FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State highway officials want to build California's longest commuter lane along 
the Antelope Valley Freeway to ease driving between Santa Clarita and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may review the plans and submit written comments to the California 
Department of Transportation beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has proposed constructing a 33.5-mile lane for car-pools in the 
median of the Antelope Valley Freeway from San Fernando Road in Santa Clarita 
to Avenue P-8 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic is so heavy and we believe the volume of people is sufficient," 
said Raja Mitwasi, head of the department's high-occupancy vehicle program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two lanes in each direction for several miles along the freeway 
and at peak traffic times about 2,000 vehicles per hour travel through its 
interchange with the Golden State Freeway, Mitwasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the $110-million project is slated for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work consists of excavating and repaving the median area, with 
little need to widen the thoroughfare. The project also includes installing 
sound walls and areas for California Highway Patrol officers to be stationed to 
watch for violators. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, it will be the longest lane in the state's high-occupancy vehicle 
program, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 California's longest existing commuter lane runs for about 27 miles along the 
San Diego Freeway in Orange County. A commuter lane even longer than that 
proposed for the Antelope Valley Freeway is being planned for the San 
Bernardino Freeway but would not begin construction until 1997 or 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Written comments may be directed to Ronald J. Kosinski at Caltrans' 
Environmental Planning Branch, 120 S. Spring St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90012, 
through June 10. Copies of the project proposal and accompanying environmental 
documents are available at that office.

HUGHES CONSIDERING MORE CUTBACKS IN PLANTS AND WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Layoffs again loom for Hughes Aircraft Co.'s workers in Southern California as 
the company studies how to further streamline its operations in the region -- 
perhaps with plant closings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes -- the state's largest industrial employer, with 34,000 workers in 
California -- said the consolidation effort focuses on four sites: its radar 
and warfare electronics facility in Fullerton, which has 6,800 workers; two 
defense electronics plants in El Segundo, with 8,000 employees, and a field 
support office in Long Beach, with 970 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not affected are Hughes' headquarters offices in Westchester and its satellite 
and communications plants in El Segundo, spokesman Ray Silvius said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Task forces are evaluating how best to streamline the four facilities under 
review, and no decisions about closings, transfers or layoffs will be made 
until summer, Hughes officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a special newsletter distributed to Hughes workers this week, Vice 
Chairman Michael T. Smith said that "there are no sacred cows here" in terms of 
the plant sites involved, adding, "All options will be considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also said that "employee layoffs would almost certainly be part of the 
restructuring process -- especially in view of the fact that any cost incurred 
by restructuring must be borne by the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., is developing ways to help "employees 
at risk" find work elsewhere in the company, with "specific plans related to 
layoffs" to be worked out over the next three months, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task forces' review stems from Hughes' creation in March of a new 
subsidiary, called Hughes Aerospace & Electronics Co., that merged the firm's 
aerospace, defense, missile and systems groups. The new unit is headed by 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be only the latest shrinkage for Hughes, which, like other defense 
companies, has already undergone wrenching cutbacks in the post-Cold War era.  
</P>
<P>
 In one major revamp, for example, Hughes moved its missile operations from 
Canoga Park to Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now employs 50,000 people worldwide, down from 82,000 in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the latest review unsettled Hughes workers in Fullerton. "I bought a 
house last week and now this happens," one employee said, asking not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin said closing the Fullerton site would be "a 
crushing blow," saying it would hurt nearby stores and other businesses that 
cater to the Hughes work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said it needs to consolidate further because of its excessive office 
and manufacturing space in Southern California and ongoing Pentagon spending 
cuts. In Fullerton, Hughes is using about two-thirds of its available space on 
a 350-acre site. At its peak in 1986, the Fullerton plant employed 14,500 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Hughes has between 1 million and 2 million square feet of excess 
office and production space in Los Angeles and Orange counties, spokesman Dan 
Reeder said.

STOCKS DROP, BOND YIELDS SOAR ON JOBS REPORT; MARKETS: TRADERS FEAR EMPLOYMENT 
GROWTH WILL REVIVE INFLATION. GOLD, OIL AND OTHER COMMODITIES POST GAINS. 
</P>

 Bond yields soared to their highest levels in more than a year and a half 
Friday and stock prices closed broadly lower as a strong April employment 
report reignited inflation fears and investors anticipated another Federal 
Reserve Board hike in short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond surged to 7.55% from 7.33% on 
Thursday. Friday's yield was the highest since December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on short-term securities also soared, with the return on three-month 
Treasury bills jumping to 4.29% from 4.13% on Thursday -- its highest level in 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average, off more than 50 points 
at midday, closed down 26.47 points at 3,669.50 as losing issues outnumbered 
winners 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 While stocks and bonds were falling, gold, oil and some other major 
commodities posted big gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets headed downward shortly after the Labor Department reported 
that non-farm payrolls added 267,000 jobs in April, far more than the 170,000 
to 200,000 analysts expected. The report rattled Wall Street traders, who have 
been fearful that the accelerating recovery and its robust job growth will 
revive inflation, which erodes the value of stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Their uncertainty was intensified when the Fed failed to raise its key 
short-term interest rate Friday -- the federal funds rate -- despite the strong 
employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole market is expecting a rate increase, and the Fed seems to be 
resisting it," said Kevin McClean, an analyst with Cavelti Capital Management 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has already raised short-term rates three times in the past 100 days, 
and many analysts expect a fourth increase to be announced as early as next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But some bond traders had hoped that the Fed would act Friday in an effort to 
show its resolve against inflation and perhaps calm nervous owners of long-term 
bonds. When the Fed didn't move, many traders dumped bonds Friday, producing 
yet another selloff in that beleaguered market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting crushed in here," said Dudley Eppel, head trader at Donaldson, 
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. "There just aren't any buyers 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow had lost more than 50 points by midafternoon, 
prompting the NYSE to impose restrictions on some computerized program trading. 
The move put a floor under prices, and bargain hunters moved in to cut the 
Dow's losses in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, some traders said the stock market's losses were relatively mild. 
NYSE volume was moderate at 292 million shares, suggesting there was no panic 
rush for the exits. In commodity markets, gold and silver benefited from the 
renewed inflation jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Near-term gold futures rocketed $9.80 to $383.40 an ounce on the New York 
Comex, while silver futures soared 32.8 cents to $5.44 an ounce. In oil 
markets, crude futures surged to a six-month high as production was squeezed by 
mechanical problems in the North Sea and civil unrest in Yemen. June crude oil 
rose 41 cents to $17.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency markets, the dollar eased slightly despite the strong economic 
news. It slipped to 1.660 German marks in New York from 1.666 on Thursday and 
edged down to 102.40 Japanese yen from 102.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks were hit hard on fears that higher interest rates will 
eventually slow the economy's pace. Losers included GE, off 1 1/8 to 96 5/8; 
Bethlehem Steel, off 5/8 to 18 1/2; International Paper, down 1 3/4 to 62 7/8; 
Caterpillar, down 4 3/8 to 108 1/8, and Ford, off 1 to 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric utility stocks, which are sensitive to rising bond yields, also 
plunged. The Dow utility index sank 3.96 points to 188.83, its lowest level 
since August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Gas & Electric slumped 7/8 to 23 7/8, Commonwealth Edison fell 1 to 24 
1/4 and SCEcorp lost 1/4 to 15 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks were big winners. Arco gained 4 5/8 to 104, Chevron leaped 2 1/8 
to 89 1/8 and Texaco surged 1 5/8 to 65 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign stock markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 58.48 points, or 
2.61%, to 2,176.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended firmer in Tokyo amid an absence of serious sellers due to the 
"Golden Week" holidays. The Nikkei index gained 292.26 points to 19,862.47. 
</P>
<P>
 London's FTSE-100 index was unchanged at 3,106.0. Frankfurt's DAX index added

FARMERS INSURANCE TO LAUNCH 5-YEAR SALES EFFORT IN INNER CITIES; MARKETING: THE 
COMPANY HOPES TO OUTDO COMPETITORS, WHILE ADMITTING ITS OUTREACH, NOT PRICES 
ALONE, HAS HINDERED PAST SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Co. said Friday that it will launch an intensive, five-year 
effort to boost its sales in inner-city areas that have long been overlooked by 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide effort, which initially will focus on homeowners and business 
insurance, represents a challenge to some of the industry's prevailing beliefs 
about why certain neighborhoods are underinsured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an availability problem, it's an affordability problem" is a theme 
often sounded by insurance executives in rebutting accusations of redlining, or 
sales discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But by committing itself to putting more agents on the inner-city streets and 
using multilingual advertising and promotion, Farmers -- California's 
second-largest property-casualty insurer -- said it is acknowledging that price 
is not the only reason lower-income areas don't buy much insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a market out there that hasn't been developed as well as it could 
be," Farmers Vice President Jeffrey Beyer said. "We think whoever does it first 
and does it right is going to own it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference Friday morning outside Farmers' Mid-Wilshire 
headquarters, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said there are 
affordability problems too. He joined Farmers executives in asking the 
Legislature to allow the sale of a low-priced, no-fault auto insurance policy 
-- legislation that has never gotten far in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Braddock, Farmers executive vice president, said the company has 
not yet set a budget for the new initiative, which is still in the planning 
stages. Farmers is also conducting a demographic study to determine exactly 
which areas are underserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers said it expects to establish a toll-free number for 
non-English-speaking customers. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster its agent force in underserved neighborhoods, Farmers will consider 
changing its hiring criteria and training methods, Braddock said. It also plans 
to step up its advertising in non-English media and to develop new ways of 
marketing to cultural groups that may not be familiar with insurance products. 
</P>
<P>
 One tangible element of the new program is a $40,000 donation that Farmers 
made Friday to Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit housing 
development organization. Lori R. Gay, the group's president, said the money 
will buy smoke detectors, deadbolt locks, floodlights and other equipment that 
reduces risk in homes and businesses.

 Supermarket shoppers may soon tally up their own groceries electronically as 
they wheel through store aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at this week's supermarket industry expo got a preview of "portable 
personal shoppers." The scanning device lets shoppers record the price of each 
item as it is taken from the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers first register their bank account numbers, then keep a running total 
of purchases and generate their own register receipts. A cashier does a visual 
check of the tallied purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shopping cart was radical and revolutionary when it was introduced in 
1936," said an industry consultant. "This is the logical evolution of 
self-service."

SCRAMBLING FOR A SHARE; AUTHORS OF SOFTWARE SEARCH FOR WAYS TO COPE WITH 
COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PRESTON GRALLA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savvy personal computer users have always relied on "shareware" as a cheap way 
to get good software. With shareware, you get to try a program, then pay for it 
only if you like it. Prices are usually low. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, though, with commercial programs such as Lotus' Approach database 
and Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet selling for less than $100, many 
shareware authors -- often one-person shops operating on a shoestring -- can't 
compete. Some are being driven out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that despite all the turmoil, a new generation of shareware 
developers has stepped up to accommodate the changing needs of computer users. 
Thanks mainly to booming PC sales and the increasing prevalence of modems, 
which make it easy to get shareware, the industry as a whole appears to be 
thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 (the latest year for which figures are available), shareware authors 
took in $46.8 million in registration fees, says Steve Hudgik, a shareware 
author who does an annual survey. That compares to $24.2 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But the business is changing so fast that many shareware writers have had to 
scramble to survive. For instance, discount stores such as Wal-Mart have begun 
carrying super-low-priced software, often as low as $10. That has put the pinch 
on some shareware authors, even as others moved to take advantage of the new 
outlet by releasing their products as low-priced commercial packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the broad acceptance of the Microsoft Windows operating environment 
has changed the marketplace, throwing some old-line DOS authors on hard times. 
Early this year, Seattle-based shareware pioneer Quicksoft, maker of that 
venerable DOS favorite PC-Write, went belly up.  
</P>
<P>
 Newer, Windows-aware shareware developers are reaping the benefits. Most new 
shareware is written for Windows, and the advent of Visual Basic, a relatively 
easy-to-learn programming language with a modular, prefab approach, has opened 
up the field by letting even people with relatively little formal experience 
write Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareware, more than most kinds of human commerce, depends on trust. You try 
it out for free; if you keep it after, say, 30 days, you are supposed to pay 
the author. No one will know if you don't pay, although some programs will 
plague you with reminders beyond the trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many people actually register, or pay for, the shareware they 
are using. Shareware authors' estimates range from just 1% to 60%. Games 
makers, among the most successful of shareware authors in recent years, have a 
way around the problem, via a technique pioneered by shareware games powerhouse 
Apogee Software. In essence, they give away part of a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually you get to try out one "adventure" in a series of three or more. 
That's often enough of a hook. To get the next adventure, you have to register 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Robichaud, a shareware author and chairman of the Assn. of Shareware 
Professionals, says about 140 authors make a full-time living from writing and 
publishing shareware, "with incomes ranging from $30,000 a year up to the 
millions." 
</P>
<P>
 But things are different now than in the early days of shareware, when several 
authors racked up millions of dollars in sales. One of those companies, 
Datastorm Technologies, was so successful with its telecommunications software 
that the program, Procomm, became something of a standard and is now primarily 
a commercial product. 
</P>
<P>
 For many other shareware creators, success was less enduring. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Button, who wrote PC-File, a shareware database, "jokes that he was the 
first person to make a million dollars in shareware -- and the first to lose a 
million," Robichaud says. "But the days are over when you can be in the right 
place at the right time and have lightning strike you." 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that when programmer Bob Wallace wrote PC-Write, which sold for 
$49.95, a copy of Microsoft Word went for $400. Today, owners of earlier word 
processors can upgrade to MS Word, with a staggering array of features no 
shareware could match, for something like $149. 
</P>
<P>
 Robichaud believes that if shareware authors are to thrive, they must branch 
out into low-cost, retail software and even contract programming. Robichaud's 
company, Rhode Soft Systems of Woonsocket, R.I., does all three. It sells 
WinPaks -- collections of screen savers, icons, wallpaper and TrueType fonts 
for Windows -- as shareware and also in discount retail outlets.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the company develops a product, covers the development costs via 
shareware registrations and tries to sell the program in stores, where anyone 
who wants it has to pay for it. Since the shareware and discount retail markets 
are made up of entirely different people, the company charges a different price 
in each place. In fact, the retail version is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Robichaud's company also does contract programming. Most recently it wrote 
"T2: The Screen Saver," Windows screen saver modules complete with sound and 
animation based on the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "Terminator 2: Judgment 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some classic shareware success stories. Take Hudgik, an 
inveterate collector. He wrote a program for himself 10 years ago to catalogue 
his 25,000 records and thought he would try offering the program as shareware, 
not expecting much of a pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 But PC magazine gave it a rave review and he was swamped with orders. His 
business has grown so much that running it takes all his time. He has since 
hired others to do programming for him, and his company, PSG-HomeCraft of 
Tualatin, Ore., now sells an "Organize Your Collection" series of shareware for 
stamps, recordings and other items. Thank You for Downloading 
</P>
<P>
 The turbulent shareware industry is booming as personal computers proliferate. 
Shareware lets users try a program and pay for it if they decide to keep it. 
(Freeware, on the other hand, never requires payment.) But with commercial 
software getting cheaper, competition in the shareware business is fierce. The

AUDIT CITES MISMANAGEMENT IN INSURANCE DEPARTMENT UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a report that echoes findings last year by another agency, the state 
auditor this week cited serious management deficiencies within the Insurance 
Department division that handles the assets of failed insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor Kurt R. Sjoberg said the department's Conservation and Liquidation 
Division lacked a strategic plan for handling insolvencies as they occurred and 
thus was slow to identify which firms needed to be liquidated and which were 
worth rehabilitating. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, he said, was needless delay in distributing the companies' assets 
to policyholders and, in some cases, overspending on staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Insurance Commissioner Gary Hernandez, who oversees the division, said 
most of the problems were identified in previous audits by the state Finance 
Department and have already been corrected or are being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ousted the division's top 
two managers last October, blaming them for making more than $200,000 in 
unauthorized payments to employees, as well as other mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg acknowledged that corrective action has been taken, but he said the 
response was slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Problems within the division were known in the summer of 1991 with sufficient 
detail that red flags should have been raised," he said.

DIGITAL TO CUT 20,000 JOBS AND MAY SELL UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Digital Equipment Corp., still reeling from an unexpectedly heavy 
third-quarter loss and warning that its "entire enterprise could be at risk," 
said Friday that it will slash 20,000 jobs and consider selling parts of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Robert Palmer said the deep cuts in the troubled computer 
maker's 85,000-strong full-time work force will be carried out over the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maynard, Mass.-based company has racked up losses of more than $3 billion 
over the past three fiscal years. It stunned Wall Street last month when it 
reported a $183-million loss for its fiscal third quarter, sparking a run on 
its stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In an address broadcast to employees Wednesday and released to reporters 
Friday, Palmer vowed to return Digital to profit this calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to act promptly will result in greater loss of employment," Palmer 
warned. "In fact, the entire enterprise could well be at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that to be competitive with its current revenue base, Digital needs to 
cut its work force to 65,000 people or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the speech, Palmer said some units will be sold. He said Digital plans "to 
focus our investments in the segments of the business where we know we can 
prosper and to disinvest elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson declined to say what divisions might be spun off. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the company, which has laid off about 40,000 workers over the 
past 18 months and announced plans to cut another 7,000 jobs, will need to 
carry out the reorganization swiftly if it hopes to return to profit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key here is how quickly they can get through this and move forward," said 
Stephen Smith, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York. He noted that yet another 
restructuring will cause massive disruption in a company already suffering from 
low morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital's stock rose 75 cents to $22.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Blinder Vows to Fight Inflation: In a confirmation hearing before the Senate 
Banking Committee, President Clinton's nominee for the No. 2 position at the 
sought to dispel suggestions that he would be soft on inflation. Alan S. 
Blinder, the nominee for Fed vice chairman and the first Democratic appointment 
to the central bank in 14 years, said a further rise in short-term interest 
rates would probably not roil financial markets as severely as earlier this 
year.

LAST OFF-RAMP ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY; COMMUNICATIONS: DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES 
LIKELY TO BE SLOW TO BENEFIT, FCC MEMBER TELLS URBAN LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The much-heralded information superhighway will improve some people's lives, 
but already-disadvantaged communities will probably be the last to benefit, 
Federal Communications Commission member Andrew Barrett told members of the Los 
Angeles Urban League in Inglewood on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At an Urban League-sponsored seminar titled "The Super Information Highway and 
Minorities: An On-Ramp to Opportunity or an Off-Ramp to Nowhere?" Barrett said 
cable and phone companies will roll out an array of new services first in areas 
most likely to offer the fastest rate of return on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 And while telecommuting will save time and enhance the work environment for 
some, that may be bad news for minority-owned businesses and the Latinos, 
African Americans and Asian Americans working at service jobs in business 
districts such as Downtown Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suggest to you that you will have an inner city where you will have 
less and less jobs," Barrett said. "At that point, you had better ask whose 
quality of life we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barrett and several other speakers from companies involved in building the 
so-called data highway said the technology that will enable the delivery of 
hundreds of TV channels to consumer homes will also create opportunities for 
small, minority-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a program about African American history that has a small 
viewership might not be commercially viable in a local market, said David 
Baylor, vice president of operations for Hughes Satellite DirecTV. But with the 
new Hughes system of national satellite broadcasting, such "niche" programming 
could reach hundreds of smaller markets, turning it into a profitable venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opportunities for minority businesses are electrical subcontracting -- 
phone and cable firms are laying miles of fiber-optic cables daily and often 
contract those jobs out -- and marketing to minority communities, the panelists 
suggested.

 Court Partially Blocks Ban on Campaign Contributions: An Alabama politician 
and municipal bond dealer won a partial victory in his challenge of rules that 
sharply restrict campaign contributions by the municipal bond industry.The U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia partially granted William B. 
Blount's request to halt new rules that prevent muni dealers' political 
fund-raising activities. However, the court order applies only to Blount, not 
other municipal bond dealers. But Blount's attorney hopes the decision will 
encourage other dealers to join the suit.

BROWN DOWNPLAYS GENDER ISSUE AS VOTERS' MOOD SHIFTS; POLITICS: LOW-KEY APPROACH 
TO WOMEN'S CONCERNS IS A SHARP CHANGE FROM FEINSTEIN'S STRATEGY IN 1990 RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a crack unthinkable a mere four years ago. Before several hundred women 
lunching in the penthouse of a Westside hotel, Kathleen Brown praised the 
political connections of a female friend who had introduced her, then added one 
more line: 
</P>
<P>
 "More importantly, we go to the same hairdresser and manicurist," the 
candidate for governor said a few days ago, "so we can gossip and catch up when 
it really counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Dianne Feinstein, the state's first serious female gubernatorial 
candidate, uttered that remark, it would have ricocheted across the political 
landscape, raising eyebrows here, prompting aggrieved tut-tuts there, providing 
yet another unnerving bit of gender Angst in her 1990 battle, the one Feinstein 
herself characterized as pitting "a skirt" against "a suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead Brown's remark fluttered into nothingness, accompanied by polite 
laughs from the audience, serving only to underscore the vast changes under 
which California's second major female gubernatorial candidate is running for 
her political life. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, things are a lot less cataclysmic this time out. If Feinstein's 
unsuccessful race for the governorship in 1990 was historic, so is Brown's -- 
but barely a word about the import of becoming the first woman in the 
statehouse can be heard from her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Feinstein traveled around the state with a laundry list of positions on 
"women's issues," Brown has issued a one-sheet campaign paper on her views. 
Rarely does she speak of them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the differences between Feinstein's race and Brown's reflect their 
different personalities and their standings among activist women. In part, they 
reflect Brown's caution at repeating Feinstein's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But two years after California elected two women to the U.S. Senate -- 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- the changes also reflect greater understandings 
among female candidates in general and the voters they seek to woo, a maturing 
of what is still a young and evolving relationship into one that has a silent 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woman candidates now don't have to sort of sell themselves to the women's 
community," said Harriett Woods, head of the National Women's Political Caucus. 
"There is an assumption of a commitment there that will be fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization 
for Women, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown and the female candidates after the Feinstein race and the Ann 
Richards race (for governor of Texas in 1990) have benefited from not having to 
explain themselves," Bruce said. "People now know that women, regardless of 
party involvement and rhetoric, do look at issues differently in office." 
</P>
<P>
 The political ground on which all candidates tread has shifted remarkably in 
the last four years, in ways that have largely helped female candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months before the heat of Feinstein's race for governor came a U.S. 
Supreme Court decision curtailing abortion rights, a ruling that fired the 
campaigns of women running for office in 1990. After the mixed results of that 
election came the national controversy over Clarence Thomas' appointment to the 
Supreme Court, and its prompting of a national debate over sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor over Thomas and Anita Hill, the law professor who accused the 
justice of harassment, fueled the 1992 campaigns of female candidates for 
Senate, including Feinstein and Boxer, who constitute the first all-woman team 
to represent any state in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Kapolczynski, who managed Boxer's 1992 bid for the Senate, contends that 
there is a huge gulf between the skepticism that greeted 1992's candidates in 
California and the matter-of-fact attitude that attends Brown's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see nearly as many questions of Kathleen Brown of the type that, say, 
we got in the general election -- 'How could California elect two Northern 
California women to the Senate? It's a virtual impossibility.' I think electing 
a woman governor isn't much questioned in this race. . . . Those questions may 
have been answered." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys taken by The Times emphasize the changes wrought in four years. In 
1990, when registered voters were asked if the time was right for a female 
governor, 39% said it was. By this spring, that number had risen to 52%, 
suggesting that Brown faces an easier road than did Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage for a female candidate is particularly profound in the 
Democratic primary. According to a demographic study of the electorate prepared 
by Brown's campaign manager, Clint Reilly, 58% of the voters in the June 7 
Democratic primary will be women. In a recent Times Poll, Brown held a 20-point 
advantage over her male counterparts among female voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein saw similar numbers in 1990, and chose a campaign strategy that 
played heavily on appeals to women. Unfortunately for Feinstein, those appeals 
backfired somewhat in the general election.  
</P>
<P>
 The most famous of Feinstein's appeals was her pledge to appoint women and 
minorities to her Administration in keeping with their presence among the 
state's voters -- in other words, more than 50% of the positions, Feinstein 
said, would go to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Her general election opponent, Republican Pete Wilson, seized the issue, 
running television ads that proclaimed she stood for "quotas over 
qualifications." While Feinstein denied she advocated quotas, she said after 
the election that the claim had hurt her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was outspoken on other issues of interest to female voters in 1990, 
from her advocacy of reproductive rights to her proposal that developers be 
forced to construct day-care centers.  
</P>
<P>
 In part, political observers say, Feinstein's relative stridence came from a 
desire to win over women's groups that were not particularly friendly to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Carrick, who ran Feinstein's 1990 campaign, said some of her difficulties 
can be blamed on the historic nature of her effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had not really been a serious (female) candidate in either party," he 
said. ". . . We had no history to rely on, no polling history to say we were 
going to get a huge block of women voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's relative silence about issues on which Feinstein was outspoken 
reflects her campaign's concern that it not risk offending male voters as it 
courts women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson is that (the feminist) message did not sell in the general 
election to white Democratic men," said a Brown adviser.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown also has been able to keep her appeal low-key because she has had little 
challenge on the gender front from Democrats John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom 
Hayden or Republican Wilson. In 1990, in contrast, Feinstein's primary 
opponent, John K. Van de Kamp, characterized himself as the "best feminist in 
the race," and Wilson also made special appeals to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's soft-sell approach was apparent at her recent address to women on the 
Westside. There, she told folksy tales about the difficulties of melding her 
political and personal lives. Like the time, she said, she was pulled out of a 
heated meeting of the Los Angeles school board, during the school busing 
negotiations, to take an important phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom," she heard as she picked up the phone, her daughter's voice ringing in 
her ear. "Zeb's hitting me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the humor of Brown's description of mediating daughter-son squabbles, 
the anecdote was clearly meant to suggest that the treasurer was a figure for 
all those in the audience to emulate and support -- a working mother and 
grandmother, trying to have it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mentioned by Brown were the items on her list of "women's issue" 
positions: abortion rights, comparable worth pay, gender equity for medical 
research, a federal Equal Rights Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked after her speech how a Brown victory would affect the lives of 
California women, the treasurer characterized the prospective change as a 
largely symbolic one that could cause a "ripple effect" elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not very many women in power that you can look to, in politics or 
business," she said. ". . . I think it just goes without saying that if you 
have a qualified woman who will represent us well and who will be good for the 
state, there's an opportunity to make history as well as vote for a great 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Among some of Brown's supporters, there is concern that she may be making a 
mistake with her low-key approach. They point to New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd 
Whitman, who remained largely silent on women's issues until she nearly lost 
her 1993 election. Last-minute support from women was credited for helping her 
overcome a surge by then-incumbent Gov. James Florio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people want change and reform, they turn to women," said NOW's Bruce. 
"And if the women seem like the men, why vote for them?

CITIZENS PANEL GRANTS LEGISLATORS A 37% RAISE; GOVERNMENT: MOVE SURPRISES MANY 
STATE LAWMAKERS, WHO WILL BECOME HIGHEST-PAID IN THE COUNTRY AT $72,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a decision that surprised many lawmakers, a citizens commission charged 
with setting the salaries of the state's elected officials Friday granted 
legislators a 37% pay increase from $52,500 to $72,000 a year, effective in 
December. The raise will make California legislators the highest-paid in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's decision, made on a 5-2 vote Friday afternoon when few 
lawmakers were in the Capitol, is final. The additional pay will cost taxpayers 
$2.5 million annually and comes as the state faces a $5-billion budget 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legislators, sensing the wrath of voters in the June and November 
elections, quickly pledged to refuse the pay increase, the first granted them 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, created by voters when they approved Proposition 112 in 1990 
as part of a reform package, said it granted the raises after reviewing 
salaries of other state officials, including judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises were needed, the commission majority said, to attract qualified 
candidates who, under term limits, cannot make the Legislature their career and 
need a good salary to leave their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission granted legislative leaders greater pay increases, in 
recognition of their additional duties. Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown will receive $86,400 annually. Both are 
lawyers with private practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican leaders, Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) and Assemblyman Jim Brulte 
(R-Rancho Cucamonga), will receive $79,200, as will the Democratic floor 
leaders, Sen. Henry Mello of Watsonville and Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan of 
Benicia, the commission ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators, who receive numerous fringe benefits beyond their salaries, 
including a $101-a-day tax-free per diem to cover living expenses while they 
are in session, now will have a total compensation package worth about $100,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer, who is known for putting in unusually long hours, said: "It is an 
appropriate salary given the levels of responsibility, stress and effort that 
legislative jobs entail." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockyer acknowledged that there could be a backlash, even though the 
decision was made by an independent commission. "Campaign opponents always have 
something they can throw at you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio talk shows already were abuzz Friday afternoon, as were many critics of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "This pushes Paula Jones, Haiti and caning off the air -- unless people start 
proposing caning legislators," said Duane Garrett, a San Francisco radio talk 
show host and longtime Democratic activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a political Pearl Harbor," said Tom McClintock, a conservative 
Republican and former state legislator running for state controller. "It will 
ignite a firestorm of taxpayer resentment, anger and action."  
</P>
<P>
 Some critics noted that the seven-member commission made its decision on the 
day that California's new unemployment numbers were released, showing 
joblessness increasing to 9.6% in April, a jump of 1.3% over March. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is never good timing," Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento) said. 
"We could be at 0% unemployment and it would still be controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting only a month before the June primary, commission Chairman Claude 
Brinegar said he was aware that there would be criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are convinced this is the right thing to do for the state of California," 
Brinegar, a member of the board of Unocal, told reporters afterward, "and 
further delay would not produce any worthwhile results. 
</P>
<P>
 "With term limits, we feel it is urgent that we attract candidates to run for 
the Legislature who represent a balanced mix -- not just people who are retired 
or want to be here for the power, but people who are willing to take mid-career 
interruptions to serve the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other commissioners said it was time for legislative salary increases 
because the pay is too low to attract high-quality people to give up other more 
lucrative careers to run for the Assembly and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reaching its decision, the commission conducted a salary survey of 
other state and local government positions and private industry posts. 
Congressmen and U.S. senators are paid $133,600; Gov. Pete Wilson is eligible 
to receive $120,000 but voluntarily takes only $114,000, and Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan's salary is $123,778, but he accepts only $1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I thought it was reasonable," said Maddy, the Republican leader in 
the Senate. "People entering politics are not looking at pensions or longevity. 
In some fashion, it has to be pay that is reasonable and commensurate with 
what's going on in government." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to fringe benefits, veteran lawmakers have a very good pension 
plan, although legislators elected after the 1990 passage of Proposition 140, 
the term limit measure, do not receive pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 All lawmakers also receive life insurance policies, medical and dental care 
benefits, free telephone and gasoline credit cards for legislative purposes, 
and can obtain new leased automobiles every few years with the state paying the 
majority of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a $250 annual limit on gifts from a single source, lawmakers receive 
free tickets to attend entertainment events such as Disneyland, the Academy 
Awards, USC and UCLA football games, movies and professional football, 
basketball and baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also take paid-for junkets to countries that generally come under the 
heading of trade missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary-setting commission's members are gubernatorial appointees. Since 
1990, state budget problems have prompted the commission to freeze the 
legislative salary level at $52,500, which represented an increase from the 
previous $40,816. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Brinegar, Commissioners Jim Green, Andy Hopwood, George 
Nesterczuk and John Ohanesian voted for the pay hike. Commissioners Steven 
Hayward and Janice Baird voted no. Hayward said he was concerned about the 
combination of salary and per diem allowance and Baird indicated that she was 
in favor of a lower raise, perhaps to the $65,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is required to meet by June 30 of each year and will not meet 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pay commission is an independent panel and is charged by the electorate 
to make this decision, and we are not going to question their judgment," said 
Sean Walsh, Wilson's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 At California Common Cause, one of the backers of the 1990 initiative that 
created the salary commission, director Ruth Holton said: "We support a 
cost-of-living increase. This is probably on the high end . . . You don't want 
the salaries to be too low. You want to attract quality people." 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg said most lawmakers will accept the pay raise, but added: "Others 
will say they oppose it and take it later. Everybody does have to go before the 
voters. They can vote them out if they don't like their answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who was considering not taking the extra money is Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), who said he plans to give it as scholarships to students who 
cannot afford to attend state universities because of increasing tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This commission is supposed to be apolitical but not out of touch," said 
Hayden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. "I don't know 
how we could raise our salaries 37% when we're downsizing education." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Quentin L. Kopp, a San Francisco independent who practices law when he is 
not in the Capitol, said he would reject the raise. "I appreciate the kind 
thoughts of the commission as to our worth individually and collectively, but I 
won't accept the increase." Legislators' Salaries 
</P>
<P>
 The California Citizens Compensation Commission's members are appointed by the 
governor and they must consider judges' salaries as one of the factors in 
setting salaries for the Legislature and statewide officers. Salaries for state 
judges have risen 10% since 1990.

EX-GUERRILLAS, EXILES NAMED TO MANDELA CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Election officials on Friday formally proclaimed last week's all-race 
elections "substantially free and fair," and Nelson Mandela, president-to-be of 
the first post-apartheid government, immediately named 17 members of his new 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 For first deputy president, the most closely watched spot, Mandela chose Thabo 
Mbeki, the urbane chairman of the African National Congress. He bypassed Cyril 
Ramaphosa, the popular ANC general secretary who was widely touted for the slot 
after his success as the ANC's chief negotiator. Ramaphosa subsequently 
declined any Cabinet post in an apparent rift with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederik W. de Klerk, the outgoing white president, will be appointed 
executive deputy president of the coalition government. His National Party, 
which has ruled South Africa since 1948, lost to the ANC by a margin of more 
than 3-to-1 in the first elections in which the country's black majority was 
allowed to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the nation's new political system of proportional representation, the 
National Party will get six places in the 27-member Cabinet. They include such 
powerful portfolios as finance, home affairs and constitutional development. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela told reporters that he will retain the current finance minister, Derek 
Keys, in his post. The move is aimed at reassuring the country's mainly white 
business leaders -- as well as potential investors and aid donors overseas -- 
who are nervous about the ANC's still untested economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize the importance of leaving the department, the portfolio, of 
finance as it is -- without interference," Mandela told reporters in Cape Town 
after a three-hour meeting with De Klerk. He has previously said he would 
recommend that Chris Stals, governor of the Central Bank, be retained when his 
term ends in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said De Klerk had complained that naming a Cabinet was premature and 
had asked him to reconsider several choices. Mandela, who shared last year's 
Nobel Peace Prize with De Klerk, said he would take the request back to his 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we are concerned, it is a decision which is final, but when you are 
working in a government of national unity, you can't talk about finalities," he 
said. "You have to take into account the concerns of the parties with whom you 
are going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Mandela's frequent promises of a gender-equal society, he named only 
two women to his Cabinet, giving them the portfolios of health and public 
enterprises. His estranged wife, Winnie Mandela, was elected to Parliament but 
was not named to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the new ministers are little known, but nearly all share one thing 
with the 75-year-old patriarch of the anti-apartheid struggle: They either 
suffered in prison with Mandela, fought as guerrillas against white authorities 
or worked from exile to end the brutal system of institutionalized segregation 
and white minority rule. Most are in their 50s or older. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal transfer of power from De Klerk to Mandela, and from white to black 
after more than three centuries of racial tyranny, will be at an elaborate 
inauguration ceremony Tuesday in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Electoral Commission said the final vote tallies showed the 
ANC with a landslide victory of 12,237,655 votes, or 62.6% of 19.5 million 
ballots cast. The ANC also won control of seven of nine new provincial 
legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The total was less than the ANC goal of winning two-thirds of the vote, which 
would have created a majority in Parliament that would have enabled the party 
to rewrite the interim constitution. Mandela, surprisingly, said he was 
"relieved" that the ANC would be forced to compromise in the so-called 
government of national unity in drafting the charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Party won 3,983,690 votes, or 20.3% of the total. That was half 
of what De Klerk had called his goal but consistent with many pre-election 
polls. As expected, the National Party easily won the provincial race in the 
Western Cape region. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party was third 
nationally with a larger-than-expected 10.5% of the total vote. That gives them 
up to three seats in Mandela's Cabinet and provides a major political platform 
for Buthelezi, a mercurial politician whose career seemed near oblivion less 
than a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of Inkatha's votes came from bitterly contested Zulu areas in the 
strife-torn KwaZulu-Natal province. Although Buthelezi only joined the race a 
week before polls opened, Inkatha won an upset there, with a majority of 50.3% 
of the vote to 32.2% for the ANC. Other parties split the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha's come-from-behind victory in the area was tainted by allegations, by 
rival parties as well as independent observers, of widespread fraud and ballot 
rigging. But the electoral commission said it was unable to prove many of the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi hailed the win as "a moment of glory, because we know that the 
hardships we suffered and the battles we fought were not wasted." He said in a 
statement that South Africans are now "free of oppression, free of racialism 
and, most of all, free of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Front, which campaigned for a homeland for Afrikaners, was fourth 
in the national polls with 2.1% of the total. The Democratic Party, a white 
liberal group, won 1.7%, and the Pan-Africanist Congress, a radical black group 
that was once the ANC's chief rival, won only 1.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The tally gives the ANC 252 seats in the 400-seat National Parliament, which 
will convene for the first time Monday in Cape Town to formally elect Mandela 
president. The National Party will get 82 seats and Inkatha 43.  
</P>
<P>
 Results were announced a week after polls closed on a remarkable election. 
There was little or no violence, although millions of voters were forced to 
line up for hours or even days. But poor planning and logistic bungling 
complicated the polling and slowed the counting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many said it would be impossible," Johann Kriegler, the electoral commission 
chairman, said at a news conference at a convention center north of 
Johannesburg. "And it very nearly was. We had the will, but not the time." 
</P>
<P>
 During the elections, he said, "we managed to pull back from disaster" by 
using the army and air force to deliver millions of extra ballots and voting 
materials and by extending voting in some areas to a fourth day. Despite a near 
breakdown in counting, he said, "once again disaster was narrowly averted." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler said "no deals" were struck in KwaZulu-Natal to allow Inkatha to win 
over ANC complaints. And he said the country must prepare a voters roll before 
the next election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is virtually impossible to run an election without" such a list, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 International observer missions from the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the 
European Union and the Organization of African Unity quickly endorsed the 
electoral commission's assessment and results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome of the elections reflects the will of the people of South 
Africa," the missions said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mbeki was always a likely candidate for Mandela's deputy president. He was the 
ANC's most visible diplomat during its long exile. He left the country in 1961 
and studied economics at Sussex University in England and military strategy in 
the Soviet Union. He is the son of an ANC stalwart, Govan Mbeki, who was jailed 
with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 But several of Mandela's other top choices raised questions and eyebrows. He 
named Alfred Nzo, an enigmatic former ANC leader, as foreign minister to 
replace Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, who has held the post since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Nzo went into exile in 1964 and served as ANC secretary general from 1969 
until 1991, when he was eased out as a poor administrator. Nzo is little-known 
at home or abroad and is not listed in the current "Who's Who in South African 
Politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Modise, the portly former commander of the ANC's largely unsuccessful 
guerrilla army, Spear of the Nation, was named defense minister. He was 
criticized for condoning torture at ANC camps prior to 1990 and has had little 
success in his attempts to create a national peacekeeping force made up of 
former black guerrillas, homeland forces and white soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Mandela choices were applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 Dullah Omar, a respected civil rights and community lawyer in Cape Town, will 
be justice minister. Trevor Manuel, a civil engineer who played a key role in 
drawing up the ANC platform for reconstruction and development, was given trade 
and industry. Jay Naidoo, a trade unionist who helped found the nation's 
largest labor federation, will help oversee the redevelopment plan as minister 
without portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 And Joe Slovo, the avuncular Communist Party chairman who emerged as a crucial 
problem-solver in the oft-bitter negotiations for democracy, was given the 
portfolio of housing and welfare.

U.S. PUBLICLY ASSAILS U.N.'S BOSNIA ENVOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Escalating a battle over U.N. actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States 
issued an unusual public slap at U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi on Friday, saying he 
was too lenient when he let Bosnian Serbs move tanks through the 
weapons-exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the United States strongly 
objected to the violation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-enforced 
zone and said: "We would like to see (Akashi) do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 The public complaint was the latest salvo in a feud between the Clinton 
Administration and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's man in 
Bosnia. Last month, Akashi publicly derided U.S. policy in Bosnia as "somewhat 
reticent, somewhat afraid, timid and tentative." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the Administration's public complaint came close to a demand 
that Boutros-Ghali either fire Akashi or publicly discipline him, but the U.N. 
chief has shown no inclination to do so. Boutros-Ghali said in Geneva that 
Akashi "continues to have my full confidence. There's no question of any kind 
of replacement." 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate issue was a decision by Akashi to let Bosnian Serbs move tanks 
across the 12-mile exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO ordered the Bosnian Serbs to move all tanks and other heavy weapons out 
of the zone in February and enforced the decision with air power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly did not support a decision of this type," Shelly said. "We do 
not concur in decisions that acquiesce in actions that violate the exclusion 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the United States had confidence in Akashi, she read from a 
prepared response: "We do not support calls for his resignation. We would like 
to see him do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led Bosnian government has said it no longer will deal with Akashi 
and demanded his resignation. A Bosnian Serb spokesman, on the other hand, 
praised the Japanese diplomat as "neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind that argument lay a broader, more important dispute: Akashi has often 
compromised with the Bosnian Serbs to protect U.N. peacekeeping forces from 
attack -- even though that has sometimes meant softening the impact of U.N. or 
NATO decisions. The Administration, struggling to convey a sense of Western 
power and resolve after two years of impotent diplomacy, has seen Akashi's 
attempts at conciliation as conflicting with that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Administration was upset when Akashi refused to approve air 
strikes against Serbian forces firing on the Muslim town of Gorazde in 
violation of a NATO ultimatum. Akashi responded by calling the United States 
"timid" for refusing to put ground troops of its own into Bosnia -- drawing a 
complaint to Boutros-Ghali from Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, senior U.N. officials serving under Akashi told reporters 
in Sarajevo that they considered the United States partly to blame for the 
continuing war in Bosnia -- drawing another protest from Albright. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright telephoned Boutros-Ghali again this week to complain about Akashi's 
decision to allow the Bosnian Serb tanks to move near Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Joe Sills said Akashi "reluctantly agreed" to the Bosnian Serb 
request for an exception to the NATO order. In return, the Bosnian Serbs 
allowed the United Nations to send 16 observers to Brcko, in northern Bosnia, 
and ended a blockade of a convoy of 170 British troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. George Joulwan, NATO's supreme commander in Europe, reacted sharply, 
complaining that Akashi's compromise diminished the alliance's ability to 
enforce its own ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi gave the Serbs permission to move seven tanks on flatbed trucks across 
the Sarajevo exclusion zone, but only five T-34 tanks had moved through by 
Friday. After the United States complained, Akashi called Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic to tell him that the "agreement was off," a U.N. spokesman 
told the Associated Press in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, the Serbs moved two more tanks into the exclusion zone, 
but U.N. forces intercepted them and took them to weapons collection depots, 
the AP reported.

STRICKEN VETERANS BLAME THE MILITARY FOR HEALTH HAZARDS; ILLNESSES: GROUP 
INCLUDES GULF WAR SOLDIERS WHO LINK THEIR AILMENTS TO VACCINES INTENDED TO 
PROTECT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In often-poignant testimony, veterans -- including some from the Persian Gulf 
War and some from as long ago as World War II -- told Congress on Friday that 
they are suffering from an array of medical ailments as a result of service in 
a military that has since abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, the veterans described 
a wide range of illnesses and other health problems that they blamed on secret 
experiments, preventive drugs or vaccines they were given, or exposure to 
environmental chemicals or other possible hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans of the Gulf War, in particular, charged that experimental drugs and 
vaccines intended to protect them against chemical and biological weapons were 
administered without adequate warnings about possible damaging side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we were told was that the pills would protect us against chemical and 
biological weapons," said the Rev. Barry Walker, a chaplain during the Gulf 
War, referring to the drug pyridostigmine bromide, which was distributed as a 
shield against lethal nerve gas. "We were told to take the pills and not given 
a choice, though some soldiers did not take them." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of soldiers' exposure to health, environmental and other hazards has 
long been a persistent and difficult problem. Particularly in the case of the 
Gulf War -- when the armed forces were responding to what was seen as a 
military emergency and were facing an enemy that had used chemical and 
biological weapons in the past -- there may have been no good alternative to 
whatever protective drugs were available, regardless of possible side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one substance or organism has been identified as the sole cause of the 
multiple health problems experienced by the men and women who served in the 
Persian Gulf or elsewhere. Nor is there agreement as to how widespread the 
problems are. 
</P>
<P>
 But veterans testified Friday that, since the problems developed, the health 
care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs has either ignored them or 
been slow to address their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, such stories have taken on a special resonance because of the 
government's well-documented history of indifference or carelessness about 
exposing troops to risks, and of its laxity in acknowledging links between such 
exposures and the development of disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many more lessons do we have to learn?" asked Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), 
one of Capitol Hill's leading advocates for veterans. "We've gone through it 
decade after decade, and here we are again in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 It was many years after the end of the Vietnam War before the federal 
government recognized that a range of physical disorders -- from mild to 
life-threatening -- was associated with exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange 
during the Southeast Asian war. Similarly, the government was sluggish in 
responding to the growing numbers of combat-related cases of post-traumatic 
stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II Navy veteran Rudolph Mills of Fredericksburg, Va., speaking 
barely above a whisper, told of being used as a human guinea pig during mustard 
gas experiments 50 years ago. He said he participated unhesitatingly because he 
had been "willing to do anything to help my country." 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all the agony the VA has put me through, I would step into a gas 
chamber again today if it would help preserve this great country for my 
grandchildren," he said, his already weak voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said he suffered burns on his face during the experiments and later was 
diagnosed with larynx cancer, a condition that he believes was caused by the 
exposure. So far, he said, he has received no compensation from the government, 
despite years of trying to secure service-related benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Lt. Col. Neil Tetzlaff, a Gulf War veteran, told the committee that 
he endured uncontrollable vomiting -- and still suffers pain and other 
disabling conditions -- after taking pyridostigmine bromide while on the way to 
Saudi Arabia, as he was instructed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Tetzlaff said he has encountered other soldiers who suffered similar drug 
reactions. He said they were treated badly by the VA when they sought help for 
their ailments because they were unable to prove that the medications were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 American soldiers fought for their country in the Persian Gulf, he said, but 
received no economic or rehabilitative assistance because "they can't prove in 
what ways or how badly they were injured."  
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20,000 or more of the nearly 700,000 troops who served in the 
Persian Gulf theater during 1990 and 1991 have reported an array of 
debilitating symptoms, including fatigue, skin rashes, muscle and joint pain, 
headaches, memory loss, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Such symptoms could stem from problems unrelated to military service, but many 
of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals, such as 
fumes and smoke from oil well fires, diesel fumes, toxic paints, pesticides and 
depleted uranium used in munitions and armor. 
</P>
<P>
 They were also given at least three drugs under special circumstances in which 
the military and the Food and Drug Administration waived the usual 
informed-consent procedures because of expected battlefield conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs included pyridostigmine bromide, which is licensed only for the 
treatment of myasthenia gravis, a chronic muscle weakness disorder; an as yet 
unapproved vaccine to combat botulism and a licensed vaccine to protect against 
anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Vogel, the Veterans Affairs undersecretary for benefits, told the 
committee that he believes the department is "seriously attempting to 
understand and find answers to the causes of health problems some Persian Gulf 
War veterans are experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to review our policies to expedite claims processing and are 
providing medical services to veterans suffering from various health problems 
that may have been incurred in the Gulf," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel's remarks provoked an angry rebuke from Daschle, who chastised the VA 
official for giving a "bureaucratic answer" after the "emotional outpouring" of 
the previous witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 These men "deserve better than that," Daschle said, adding: "I think the VA 
has failed miserably. It's very important for us to listen to what we heard 
this morning with more empathy than your answer of the last few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Senator, I've got good ears, and I've got a good heart," Vogel replied. "I 
think the VA is doing what it can." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said that immediately following Mills' moving testimony he directed a 
member of his staff to call the department's Roanoke, Va., office to determine 
why Mills was having such difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 That angered Daschle even further. "He shouldn't have to come to a hearing of 
the U.S. Senate to get redress of a problem he's had for years," he said.

MANDATORY TESTS OF STEEL-FRAME BUILDINGS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to widespread reports that steel building frames cracked during the 
Northridge earthquake, city officials are pushing a costly proposal to require 
the inspection of at least 400 steel-frame office buildings throughout the San 
Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal -- the first step in the city's strategy for addressing the most 
startling discovery of the Jan. 17 quake -- is sparking dissent among building 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is expected to draw support from safety-minded tenants of the 
buildings, which include many of Los Angeles' high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who also serves on the state Seismic Safety 
Commission, agreed Friday to take the building officials' proposal to the City 
Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, building owners in the Valley and along the San Diego 
Freeway corridor from the Valley to Santa Monica will be required to inspect 
their buildings within three months of notification by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Such inspections by structural engineers and ultrasonic testing firms involve 
tearing into walls and stripping steel columns of fireproofing to examine the 
frames for cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners would have one year from the time they are notified to fix the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also considering whether to require owners of many of the 
remaining 600 steel-frame buildings, including those in Hollywood and Century 
City, to conduct similar inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the inspection results, Bernson and building officials said, they 
may seek a citywide ordinance to retrofit, or shore up, all 1,000 steel-frame 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Deppe, assistant chief of the Building and Safety Department's resource 
management bureau, said a citywide retrofitting program, though costly and time 
consuming, is likely. He said steel buildings constructed after 1970 would 
probably be affected by such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said: "Building owners don't want to spend money. . . . Some of them 
don't have the money. But we have to ensure people's safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Sabol, an engineer who serves on the city's building and safety panel 
studying the problem with steel-frame buildings, said: "I would recommend 
retrofitting all (of them). None of these structures collapsed. Nevertheless, 
in a more significant earthquake, it may overwhelm the reserve strength of 
these structures." 
</P>
<P>
 Steel-framed mid- and high-rise buildings are designed to bend with the 
enormous forces of an earthquake without breaking and were considered among the 
safest to ride out an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said cracks had not been detected in steel-frame office buildings -- 
which made up half of all buildings constructed last year in Los Angeles -- 
until the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers have emphasized that no steel-frame buildings came close to 
collapsing. But in recent weeks, some earthquake experts have noted that in 
some buildings up to 90% of the welds that hold vertical columns and horizontal 
beams together had broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious problem," Deppe said. "It's very important that these 
connections be repaired." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal from building officials said that inspections are needed because 
"damage to these steel-frame connections . . . could expose occupants of these 
buildings to a potential life-safety risk in a future earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 In buildings with six floors or less, the first story's steel connections 
would be checked for cracks. In taller buildings, stories in the middle third 
of the building would be inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 If any cracks are found in these preliminary inspections, all of the 
building's connections would have to be checked, said Richard Holguin, 
assistant chief of the city's building bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners would have to file an inspection report with the city's 
building and safety department. 
</P>
<P>
 For a six-story building with 120 joints, or connections, a preliminary 
inspection would cost about $4,000, and a full-fledged inspection of all the 
joints would cost $12,000, Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of these inspections, said 
Kathy Crook, with Johnson & Higgins, an insurance brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Ely, executive director of the Los Angeles Building Owners and 
Managers Assn., said his members would support reasonable inspections. He said 
requiring building owners to have engineers visually examine joints for 
possible damage is reasonable, but having them ultrasonically test every joint 
is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely said the timetable for the repairs is too short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that if you have major expenses and high vacancies, this poses 
major problems for some building owners," said Ely, adding that these costs 
were likely to be passed on to tenants.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say cracks in steel frames have been found in at least 60 
buildings up to 23 stories high. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials say they will follow Los Angeles' lead. The Building 
and Safety Commission will propose an ordinance requiring inspections of the 20 
or more steel-frame buildings three stories or taller, said building officer 
William Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Seismic Safety Commission issued a public advisory about 
steel-frame office buildings last month, urging that owners who observed even 
cosmetic damage to their buildings have them inspected for cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials have already required that all new steel-frame buildings 
use more rigorous welding procedures.

MONTHS AGO.

 Ernesto Zedillo, the man most likely to become the next president of Mexico, 
was taking on one of his nation's toughest problems, the peasant uprising in 
Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he met with the southern state's governor. Then he drove 50 miles of 
winding road to visit the bishop who had mediated between the rebels and the 
government -- talks that collapsed after the March 23 slaying of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, whom Zedillo succeeded as candidate of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo twice addressed citizens of the violence-torn state from local radio 
stations. Under heavy guard, he paused for pictures at a town square that 
rebels had briefly occupied on New Year's Day. Then he flew back to the 
capital. Not a single public appearance was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 That visit a few weeks ago was vintage Zedillo. One task -- Chiapas -- checked 
off the list; no bold moves, no risks, no crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 That cautious approach has boosted the electrician's son from junior economic 
analyst to presidential candidate in 23 years. Ironically, it has also thrust a 
man whom friends and critics alike describe as orderly and disciplined into the 
center of the most chaotic period in six decades of Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Chiapas rebellion and Colosio's assassination, the police chief of 
Tijuana and Guadalajara's cardinal have been killed in the last 11 months as 
battles between drug traffickers have become more frequent. Prominent 
businessmen have been kidnaped in broad daylight on busy Mexico City streets 
where people used to feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction, an estimated $10 billion has poured out of the country so far 
this year, threatening to destabilize the peso and set off a new round of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At this crucial juncture in their history, Mexicans are being told to trust 
their country to a 42-year-old technocrat whose name most of them had never 
heard until just two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans knew so little about Zedillo when he was nominated March 29 that 
loyal activists rushing to party headquarters to show their support misspelled 
his name on their signs. Since then, he has campaigned dutifully and hard. But 
pressing the flesh does not come naturally to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving to a Mexico City crowd one last time from the running board of his gray 
Suburban, he swings himself into the passenger seat, straightening his 
zip-front jacket and running a brush through his wavy salt-and-pepper hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really like to get close," he explains sheepishly, straightening his 
gold wire-rimmed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting close to Ernesto Zedillo is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 He has built a wall of reserve around himself on his way to the presidential 
nomination that now leaves him dependent on party machinery to run his campaign 
and beholden to that machine if he wins. Unlike most Mexican politicians, who 
tend to accumulate camp followers, he has kept his circle of advisers tight, 
substituting rather than adding supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he climbed the ladder, it became more difficult for him to remain open," 
one longtime friend said. "Everyone wants to get close to him, and he has to 
manage his time." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics take a less benign view. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has moved up the ladder alone," said Jesus Martin del Campo, an official 
of the National Union of Educational Workers and a deputy for the opposition 
Democratic Revolutionary Party. "He seems extremely isolated, in his own 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo even prefers individual sports: racquetball while studying economics 
at Yale in the 1970s, tennis later as a promising young central bank official, 
and now cycling as a father of five. Because he has built his career by obeying 
the unwritten rules of Mexican politics -- obedience and silence -- no one is 
really sure what Zedillo will do if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads no clear political or ideological movement; until his nomination he 
was just another member of the elite group of foreign-educated economists who 
have run this country for the last decade. At the time of Colosio's slaying, he 
was the candidate's campaign manager, succeeding as the ruling party 
presidential candidate thanks to the one vote that counts, that of outgoing 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 His lack of recognition, his personal reserve and the sharp tenor voice that 
quickly grows hoarse addressing large crowds might, in many countries, leave 
Zedillo with as good a shot at the presidency as, say, a Paul Tsongas. But in 
Mexico, where the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) machine has elected 
the last 13 presidents, he is a virtual shoo-in this August, far ahead of his 
eight challengers in every national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 For its campaign rallies, the PRI is already filling Mexico City's domed 
Sports Palace with taxi drivers, farm workers and garbage collectors to cheer 
the candidate -- or risk five days' suspension from work if they do not show. 
</P>
<P>
 And on pro-government television networks, Zedillo has shared memories of his 
impoverished childhood, promoting a Horatio Alger image to fill the void of 
information about himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is clear: Mexico is a land of opportunity where an electrician's 
son raised in Mexicali can become president -- and a vote for Zedillo will 
prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 He is playing to one of Mexican society's most important beliefs about itself 
-- that this is a country that promotes social mobility. That belief has been 
sorely tested since 1982 as wages eroded and government spending was slashed, 
leaving less money for schools, scholarships and bureaucratic jobs, the 
traditional paths out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 1% of the 1,155 top Mexican bureaucrats are the children of manual 
workers, said Roderic Camp, author of a forthcoming book about political 
recruitment in Mexico. Just 83 are graduates of Zedillo's undergraduate alma 
mater, the National Polytechnical Institute, a school for children of the 
working class, founded to counterbalance the perceived elitism of the Mexican 
National Autonomous University, where more than half the bureaucracy studied. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is indicative of some access to upward social mobility," Camp said in an 
interview. "But it has been decreasing rather than increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo addresses that issue in the time-honored PRI fashion: speaking as if 
he were an opposition candidate campaigning for change rather than a member of 
the "compact Cabinet," the closest advisers to the current president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that Mexico has a tremendous problem of distribution of income," 
Zedillo said in a recent interview. "There is an enormous concentration, and 
one of the ways to correct this problem is spending more on people. Much more 
investment is needed in the country's human capital, particularly among the 
poorest and most disadvantaged people." 
</P>
<P>
 As Zedillo points out at nearly every campaign stop, he knows about being 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mexico City two days after Christmas in 1951, he spent most of his 
childhood in Pueblo Nuevo, a transient neighborhood in the border town of 
Mexicali. People who live behind its graffiti-covered walls have modest 
ambitions: opening a garage or taking a fashion-design course.  
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving Mexicali at 15 or 16 to come study in Mexico City was a tremendous 
challenge," said Saul Trejo, the older brother of a junior high school friend 
of Zedillo's. Besides the traffic and other problems of city life he had to 
cope with, students from the capital tended to make fun of classmates from the 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 The mid-1960s were tumultuous, with most of the ferment centered in the two 
public universities and their network of feeder high schools, including 
Zedillo's Vocational School No. 5. Classes were constantly interrupted by 
strikes and demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on that experience, he did not form a favorable opinion of public 
higher education," said a teacher who worked with Zedillo decades later at the 
Public Education Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo finished a five-year program in less than four years with a record 
grade-point average. He also met his wife, fellow student Nilda Patricia 
Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never dreamed of doing postgraduate degrees abroad," said one classmate, 
who like many of those interviewed asked not to be identified. "At most we 
hoped for a scholarship to a short course somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed for Zedillo in his third year of college, when Trejo came back to 
Mexico with a doctorate from Yale and looked him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Trejo offered the 19-year-old Zedillo a job in President Luis Echeverria's 
strategic planning department, alongside the brightest young economists from 
Mexico's most prestigious universities. Showing off their English, junior 
analysts called themselves "el underground." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo also met Leopoldo Solis, the crusty economist who ran the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me finish school quickly," Zedillo said. "He encouraged me to study 
English. He gave me academic recommendations. He helped me to continue my 
studies, and when I got back to Mexico, he offered me a job at the Bank of 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 With Solis' help, he got a government scholarship to Yale. On finishing his 
Ph.D., Zedillo went to work at the central bank's economic research department, 
known as "the medical service" because it was full of doctorates. 
</P>
<P>
 He survived the political downfall of his mentor, Solis, and in 1983 was put 
in charge of the government fund for the hundreds of private companies caught 
with dollar debt when the peso was devalued in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saved a lot of Mexican companies from bankruptcy," a government source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the responsibility went one of a dozen Bank of Mexico memberships 
in the Club de Golf Mexico country club, where Zedillo played tennis with top 
bank officials. 
</P>
<P>
 His tennis partners recall him as a warrior on the court. But what other club 
members remember is that Zedillo always carried a bunch of papers with him and 
worked frantically at every game break. "He didn't know how to relax," one man 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say that Zedillo does not relax in public; he relaxes at his Mexico 
City home, where he roughhouses with his children and cooks on the grill. The 
multilevel house, filled with dark wood furniture, is one of the few places 
where he looks comfortable without a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a sweater reminiscent of Ozzie Nelson's cardigan, he sips tequila and 
jokes about the screams of his children playing in the kitchen. Success has 
made such moments rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has come at a great sacrifice of his time and private life," one former 
colleague said. "He had to develop rapidly, and that required changes in his 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo has become more serious and controlled, friends said. As part of the 
"underground," he pulled pranks, such as once telling a co-worker that he was 
about to be fired. The man fretted for days before finding out it was not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, teachers union representatives said they found Education 
Minister Zedillo humorless when they invited him to El Habito, a Mexico City 
comedy club known for political satire. Zedillo sat stone-faced as actors 
mimicked him in a skit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has become more and more interested in politics to the exclusion of other 
interests," one friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 How good Zedillo is at politics depends on whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters point to the consensus-building required to decentralize the 
educational system. Detractors remember his 11-month tenure as public education 
minister differently, full of scandals over inaccurate textbooks and fights 
with the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The task overwhelmed him," Martin del Campo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo also seemed overwhelmed at first by the presidential campaign but is 
adjusting. In contrast to his earlier, low-key visit, on his most recent trip 
to Chiapas a few days ago, he congratulated his party's gubernatorial nominee 
at a mass rally. 
</P>
<P>
 He still looks stiff and uncomfortable at those big rallies, but he has 
introduced a more intimate format of Bill Clinton-style neighborhood forums in 
which he shines. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Zedillo fields questions about pensions, prostitution 
and public works, taking notes on suggestions and often complementing the 
questioners. He appears to truly enjoy such policy discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of these forums come the inevitable round of handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo seems only too glad to get back in the van where he can put on his tie 
and head off for a private meeting with the president-elect of Costa Rica, far 
from the crowds.

SECURITY COUNCIL IMPOSES TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON HAITI; UNITED NATIONS: THE 15-0 
VOTE COMES AS CLINTON TAKES A HARDER LINE ON THE JUNTA THAT OUSTED ARISTIDE. 
RESOLUTION TIGHTENS NOOSE AROUND 'USURPERS,' BANNING ALMOST ALL TRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council, acting at the behest of the United States, on 
Friday voted to tighten sanctions against Haiti in a move intended to force 
that nation's ruling military regime to relinquish power to ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 15-0 vote, the Council approved a resolution to ban almost all trade with 
the Caribbean nation, halt all airline flights in and out of there, prohibit 
foreign travel by those associated with the military regime and urge other 
nations to freeze assets of the leaders who overthrew Aristide in a 1991 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came in the wake of President Clinton's recent decision to take a 
harder line against the Haitian military, which has resisted U.S. and U.N. 
efforts to return Aristide to his role as the nation's first democratically 
elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 In scathing tones, U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright scorned the military and 
police leaders of Haiti as "usurpers . . . devoid of honor or patriotism and 
driven only by greed and mistaken self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, in a separate appearance, Clinton reiterated his 
oft-repeated position of late that the United States would consider military 
options against the Haitian regime if the new sanctions fail to restore 
democracy to Haiti. "I don't favor that option but can't rule it out," Clinton 
said in a photo session with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the President nor his aides have been willing to reveal any details of 
military action under consideration. But U.S. and U.N. sources said the next 
major step will be to prevent goods from crossing into Haiti from the Dominican 
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola. 
</P>
<P>
 The porous nature of the Haitian border has undermined the oil embargo, 
reimposed on Haiti by the U.N. last year, when Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army 
commander who led the coup, reneged on an agreement to resign and allow 
Aristide's return. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Ambassador Louise Frechette told the Security Council that embargo 
violations by the Dominican Republic are "unacceptable and must stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the key role of the Dominican Republic in making the newest 
embargo work, Albright said: "All of us can and must make these sanctions work. 
The price of failure would be too high for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics have suggested putting pressure on Venezuela, which, according 
to various sources, has been increasing its sales to the Dominican Republic for 
transfer to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton planned to continue meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake today for further discussions about 
implementing the sanctions, aides said. Among the issues under review, they 
said, are possible compensation to the Dominican Republic for losses incurred 
because of the sanctions and whether to send a new U.N. contingent to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans and Canadians were part of a U.N. military training and engineering 
mission that was recalled by the White House last fall when pro-Cedras thugs 
demonstrated on the docks in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 A variation of the tough sanctions resolution has lain dormant before the 
Security Council for several months. U.S. officials had held it back in hopes 
that they could persuade Aristide to compromise with the military leaders who 
deposed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one scenario, Aristide, now in exile in Washington, would have been 
reinstated but with far less power than in his elected position. But he refused 
to compromise, insisting that it was his right to return to Haiti with full 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Derided by many Aristide sympathizers in this country for failing to stand 
firm against the military regime, the Clinton Administration reviewed its Haiti 
policy and changed direction a little more than a week ago, announcing that it 
would push the sanctions resolution through the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also forced Lawrence Pezzullo, a veteran ambassador, to resign 
as special U.S. envoy working to end the crisis in Haiti. He was described as 
too closely linked to the failed U.S. effort to pressure Aristide into a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, echoing a phrase often used by 
Albright, said the new resolution "tightens the noose" around the Haitian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Fritz Longchamp, who still represents the Aristide regime at the 
United Nations, said he trusted that "this resolution will have the desired 
impact even before it comes into force -- in other words that the military 
leaves immediately and Aristide returns." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet welcomed the resolution, 
saying, "Canada has maintained consistently that a total, universally applied 
embargo on Haiti is necessary to force the military and de facto authorities to 
step down." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was far more skepticism in Haiti. Reports from Port-au-Prince were 
replete with angry comments from Haitians who called the sanctions a waste of 
time and said they would fail to change the military's position, simply making 
the poor even poorer. Even before sanctions were first imposed, Haiti was 
ranked as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with a per capita 
income of less than $300 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright acknowledged the effect the embargo would have on Haiti's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are acutely conscious of the suffering of the Haitian people and of the 
potential of these sanctions to aggravate that suffering," she told the 
Security Council. "That is why the United States and the international 
community is also undertaking humanitarian assistance measures in Haiti on a 
massive scale." 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions resolution is unusual in that it attempts to concentrate much of 
its force on Cedras, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the police commandant, 
and their families and associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these provisions, which take effect immediately, the council prohibited 
any travel outside of Haiti by all officers of the Haitian military and police 
and all major participants in the September, 1991, coup and in the illegal 
governments after the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was extended to their immediate families, as well. The resolution 
strongly urged all governments to freeze foreign bank accounts of these 
Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution bans all flights to and from Haiti, except regularly scheduled 
stops of commercial airliners. That provision is intended to squelch a drug 
trade that critics insisted is enriching the Haitian military. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution's general trade embargo -- prohibiting almost all goods from 
entering and leaving Haiti -- does not take effect until May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will report to the Security Council 
two days beforehand and inform it whether Cedras and his regime have decided to 
comply with an agreement they signed on July 3 at Governors Island in New 
York's harbor. They had pledged to resign and allow Aristide's return. Should 
they do so, the council presumably would have time to rescind the embargo if 
Cedras and Francois give in. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few exceptions to the total trade embargo, including essential 
food, medicine, books, propane gas for cooking and equipment used by 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that all these sanctions will remain in place until: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cedras, Francois and army Chief of Staff Philippe Bamphy retire. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proper environment is created for free and fair legislative elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proper environment is created for the deployment of the U.N. mission with 
military trainers and public works engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aristide returns as president. 
</P>
<P>
 In the resolution, the council drew a devastating picture of life in Haiti 
under the military regime, as it condemned "the numerous instances of 
extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, abductions, rape 
and enforced disappearances, the continued denial of freedom of expression and 
the impunity with which armed civilians have been able to operate and continue 
operating."

JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 6.4%, IGNITING FEARS OF INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The national unemployment rate dipped to 6.4% in April as the robust economy 
created a larger-than-expected 267,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported 
Friday, but the good economic news rattled jittery stock and bond markets, 
which fell amid fears that inflation may accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 California unemployment rose to 9.6%, up from 8.6%, and analysts were 
disappointed with the figure. But they also saw signs that the state's economy 
is improving slightly. Many of the additional unemployed Californians were job 
seekers who re-entered the market after being discouraged for so long that they 
had stopped actively looking for work. They had not been counted in recent 
unemployment statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, "people are being drawn back into the labor force" but the 
economy is not yet creating enough jobs to fill their expectations for 
returning to work, said Thomas Plewes, associate commissioner of labor 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The state gained a meager 4,500 jobs in April and total employment still 
remains more than half a million below its 1990 peak. "It sure isn't much of a 
recovery," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House news conference, a jubilant Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said that the national jobs report, with unemployment falling from 6.5% in 
March, "gives us a lot to crow about." But stock and bond investors were not 
impressed: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip shares fell 26.47 points to 
close at 3669.50, after plunging more than 53 points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Falling bond prices led to higher interest yields, with the key 30-year 
Treasury bond soaring to 7.55%, up from 7.33%, and reaching the highest level 
since December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Reserve Board, which has hiked rates three times since February, 
will be under pressure when its policy-making committee meets May 17, to drive 
up the cost of money yet again to calm the markets. Higher interest rates would 
slow the pace of economic activity, presumably preventing the kind of rapid 
rise in prices that investors fear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no immediate visible signs of inflation: consumer prices rose just 
2.5% in the year ending in March. However, the financial markets are fearful 
that a falling jobless rate could lead to labor shortages, upward pressure on 
wages and a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is sticking to its forecast of steady economic 
growth without any overheating of prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's impossible to outguess the markets and I'm not really going to 
try," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers, told the White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say to those market participants who might have a concern about 
inflation . . . that this report is showing us, if you look over the past year, 
average hourly earnings have only increased about the same rate as inflation . 
. . " Tyson said. "So we really have a very good cost situation and a good 
competitive situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty for wary investors is whether shortages of workers will occur 
as unemployment falls and whether product prices will rise as output comes 
closer to capacity in various industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the April report may cause some indigestion on Wall Street as another 
indication of inflation, we believe that sufficient excess capacity still 
exists to hold the line on inflation over the next several months," said Robert 
D. Barr, deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the longer term we expect that the higher short-term interest rates 
engineered by the Federal Reserve will prevent a new outbreak of inflation," he 
said. Further, it's likely that the Fed will continue to ratchet up interest 
rates "at least a couple of more times."  
</P>
<P>
 The gain of 267,000 jobs would have been even larger but for the strike in the 
trucking industry, which idled 70,000 workers, Katherine G. Abraham, the 
government's commissioner of labor statistics, told a hearing of Congress' 
Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, health services and retail trade all showed increased employment 
for the month, she said. "Growth in April was especially strong in eating and 
drinking places and in auto dealers and service stations."  
</P>
<P>
 In manufacturing, employers are still hesitant to hire new workers, preferring 
to pay overtime to existing employees. Overtime hit 8.4 hours a week in the 
auto industry, and 10 hours at sawmills. The average workweek in manufacturing 
was 42 hours, the highest level since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA economist Kimbell and other experts had predicted that Southern 
California would get a boost from spending to rebuild earthquake-ravaged 
freeways, buildings and homes. Kimbell said, however, that the improvement in 
construction, where 1,300 jobs were added in the state during the month, does 
not seem to be spreading to other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be giving us less stimulus than we counted on," he said. Los Angeles 
County's jobless rate, always volatile because of the small sampling on which 
it is based, leaped to 9.9% in April, from 9.4% in March. Yet the county 
figures -- which, unlike the federal and state statistics, are not adjusted for 
seasonal trends -- also offered a small bit of encouragement: The number of 
people with jobs inched up by 9,000 to 3,981,000 during the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Reich said that California "is trailing the rest of the 
country by about a year" in moving from recovery to expansion. "Northern 
California is about on par with the rest of the country. Southern California is 
way behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big hits in California continue to be in the defense areas," said Joseph 
A. Wahed, chief economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. Still, he 
added, the job losses are growing smaller in those industries and "they aren't 
dragging us down the way they were two or three years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahed said that the losses in defense and related industries finally have 
grown smaller than the gains in such areas as construction, retailing and 
services. The bottom line, he said, is that "there will be slow improvement in 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 California continued to post the highest unemployment among the 11 big states 
whose unemployment rates are reported along with the U.S. figures every month. 
The next-highest jobless rates were reported for New York, at 8.2%, and 
Florida, at 7.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest unemployment was in North Carolina, at 3.9%, followed by Illinois, 
5.5%, and Michigan, 5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mix of unemployment has changed markedly" this year, BLS commissioner 
Abraham said. For example, the number of job losers in California -- people who 
were laid off or dismissed -- was 688,000 last month, down significantly from 
781,000 in March. The number of re-entrants -- people encouraged enough to go 
back into the market -- was 494,000, up from 417,000 a month before. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown used the new figures to attack Gov. Pete 
Wilson, issuing a statement which said that "there's a 49-state recovery party 
going on and California wasn't invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for Wilson's reelection campaign, said that Brown's 
attack was the work of a desperate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old Kathleen Brown understood that California's economic difficulties 
have been caused by national and international forces beyond the control of any 
individual," he said. "Before Kathleen Brown gets too happy about the idea of 
Californians being thrown out of work, someone ought to explain to her that the 
reason the percentages changed is because more people than ever before have 
entered the work force."

 TULIP TIME: Robert H. Schuller, pastor of Garden Grove's Crystal Cathedral, 
will receive an unusual honor today: a tulip is to be named after him. . . . 
Attending a national flower exhibition in Holland, the famous clergyman will be 
on hand for the dedication of the "Dr. Robert H. Schuller Tulip," a deep orange 
flower with large petals, developed by a Dutch horticulturist who admires him. 
Says a church spokesman: "He was almost brought to tears when he first heard of 
it."

has absolutely nothing to do with the weather," said one marketing executive. 
"The only purpose is to get more people to the stadium."

EUROPE; DUTCH LEADER BOWS OUT AS STEP TOWARD ROLE ON LARGER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While the strong showing of minor parties in the Dutch national elections 
earlier this week was big news in the Netherlands, it is another development 
from the poll that is likely to cause the greatest ripples beyond the country's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote that has also brought the Netherlands a new dominant party after 
nearly 12 years signaled the end of national politics for one of Europe's 
longest-serving and most popular leaders, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubbers' decision to retire from the national scene -- a decision he announced 
well before the elections -- is one step in a larger political drama that 
centers on the succession to what is, at least potentially, one of the most 
powerful jobs on the Continent: president of the European Union's Executive 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubbers reportedly wants the job and is now free to pursue it actively. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the ballots were still being counted Tuesday as the Dutch government 
announced that it will formally propose him as a candidate to succeed the 
incumbent president, Frenchman Jacques Delors, whose term expires at the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors' successor is expected to be chosen by the 12 European Union leaders -- 
collectively known as the Council of Ministers -- at their next summit meeting, 
scheduled for the end of June in Corfu. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Union's Executive Commission exerts enormous influence in 
shaping the direction of EU policy, in addition to administering a budget of 
nearly $80 billion and running an army of 10,000 pampered employees known as 
Eurocrats. 
</P>
<P>
 During Delors' decade on the job, the European Union has grown from a 
tentative, incomplete customs union into a single, unified market committed to 
the goals of political and monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
 The next commission president faces a series of daunting tasks. These include 
finding ways to eliminate the barriers that still separate the affluent EU 
nations from the former Communist states of Central and East Europe and to 
steer the Union intact through a potentially explosive 1996 review of the 
Maastricht Treaty, the accord that commits member states to political and 
monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors' successor must also consolidate the union's enlargement if Norway, 
Sweden, Finland and Austria join as planned next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubbers, 54, has frequently been mentioned as a logical choice for the task. 
His 11 1/2 years as a head of government, his commitment to federalism and the 
European ideal give him excellent credentials. His pedigree as a politician 
representing the moderate right from a small country also fits well as a 
successor to Delors, a French socialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors himself openly endorsed Lubbers as his successor about 18 months ago as 
"the right person in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a true European, has fresh ideas and is capable of innovation," Delors 
told a radio interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dutchman is no shoo-in. Some of those most familiar with the nature of 
EU decision-making argue that Lubbers, once the acknowledged favorite, now 
faces an uphill battle for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 These sources note reports that the Union's two biggest powerbrokers, German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand, have cooled on 
Lubbers and agreed to back the lesser-known Belgian prime minister, Jean-Luc 
Dehaene. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehaene, a year younger than Lubbers, is considered a skilled negotiator and 
an instinctive consensus-builder who impressed nearly everyone with his adept 
handling of the Union's affairs during the second half of last year when 
Belgium held the Council of Ministers' rotating chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of at least two other prominent figures have also been mentioned as 
possible candidates: Irish national Peter Sutherland, who, as the head of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, managed to bring the recent world trade 
talks to a successful conclusion, and Leon Brittan, the EU's chief negotiator 
in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brittan, although exceptionally well qualified for the job, is viewed 
skeptically by continental EU leaders, in part because he served loyally for 
seven years as a Cabinet member under former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, who made a sport out of belittling the EU's unity goals.

CONSENSUAL SEX WITH GIRL, 13, RULED RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who argued that a 13-year-old girl had consented to have sex with him 
lost his bid Friday to have his statutory rape conviction overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the girl are now married and have a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Jason Lee Griffith's claim that the 
state's rape law is unconstitutional because it assumes those under age 16 and 
unmarried cannot consent to sex. 
</P>
<P>
 It is legal to have sex with somebody that young if those involved are 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith was 22 and Chastity Lunsford was 13 when she got pregnant in 1992. 
Their son was born that December. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple got married a month later, with the consent of the girl's mother, 
while Griffith's case was pending in Kenton Circuit Court. Griffith pleaded 
guilty to second-degree rape in March, 1993, and was sentenced to five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal, Griffith claimed that it was unconstitutional to make sex 
between adults and minors legal if they are married but a criminal act if they 
are not married. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the state's "only reason . . . for treating married and unmarried 
persons differently . . . is that, under Judeo-Christian theology, only persons 
married to one another are permitted to have sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the court, Judge John Gardner said that the law had a "purely 
secular purpose" -- to protect minors from sexual exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 By requiring a parent's consent for marriage, "the state has already taken 
steps to protect" married minors, Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith's attorney previously vowed to appeal to the state Supreme Court if 
they lost at the appeals court level.

'MIRACLE MILE' YIELDS ANOTHER MILLIONAIRE JACKPOT WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So many lottery jackpot winners have purchased their tickets along the 
"Miracle Mile" that a sign outside of town reads "$150 million won (so far)." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is time to update the sign: Another multimillion-dollar winning ticket 
has been sold on South Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Factory worker John Staninecz Jr., who turned in a ticket Thursday worth $6.5 
million, is the fourth person since 1990 to buy a jackpot winner along Fond Du 
Lac's business district, which has five lottery machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought one ticket, one single dollar," Staninecz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miracle Mile reputation attracts ticket buyers nationwide. Last July, 
people came from all 50 states and Canada to buy tickets for a $111-million 
drawing. The jackpot was won by Leslie Robins, a teacher who lived a short walk 
from the South Main Street supermarket where he bought his winner. 
</P>
<P>
 A $19.6-million ticket was sold April 28, 1990, at a grocery store across the 
street from that supermarket. And a ticket worth $21 million was sold Aug. 15, 
1990, at a convenience store a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our turn," said Phillip Moses, manager of Ma & Pa's Grocery & Deli, 
where Staninecz made his $1 investment Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be the next. I can guarantee it," said Tammy Reines, manager of the 
Kwik Trip convenience store, which has Miracle Mile's only lottery machine that 
has not sold a jackpot winner. "Patience. You just got to have patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery officials said they do not suspect foul play, but they refuse to guess 
the odds of so many big winners being sold within less than a mile of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Staninecz, who has worked for 29 years at a Mercury Marine Inc. outboard 
engine factory, won the jackpot in Wisconsin's Megabucks game. The three 
previous jackpot winners were for the multi-state lottery called Lotto 
America's Megabucks.

JAPAN OFFICIAL RETRACTS WAR DENIALS; ASIA: MINISTER APOLOGIZES FOR DISAVOWING 
TOKYO'S AGGRESSION 50 YEARS AGO. CRITICS SEEK HIS RESIGNATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Amid official protests from China and South Korea, Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano on Friday withdrew his statements claiming that the 1937 Rape of Nanking 
was a "fabrication" and disavowing Japan's aggression in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised news conference, he said he will accept Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision about his future in the Cabinet that Hata 
formed eight days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Winding up a four-nation tour of Europe, Hata noted in Brussels that Nagano 
had withdrawn his comments and apologized. The prime minister, who is to return 
today, said he hopes to work with his fellow Renewal Party member as justice 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party -- the No. 2 party in 
Hata's coalition -- and the opposition Liberal Democrat, Socialist and 
Communist parties all called for Nagano's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 His claims struck at the heart of a new policy launched last August by former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Hata -- who was deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister in Hosokawa's Cabinet -- to frankly acknowledge Japan's record 
of colonialism and aggression and apologize wholeheartedly to its victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincere self-reflection, Hata has said, is necessary if Japan is to win the 
trust of its neighbors and play a significant political role in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The justice minister, 71, who was a 23-year-old captain in the Imperial Army 
when World War II ended and rose to chief of staff of Japan's postwar army, 
told the Mainichi newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that the Rape 
of Nanking was a "fabrication" and that Japan had been forced by "other foreign 
nations" to "rise up to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's ultimate motive, he added, had been "to liberate colonies and firmly 
establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Nagano declared that "my recent remarks about history were 
inappropriate. I wish to withdraw them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he "cannot deny that the Nanking Great Massacre did occur." Estimates 
of the number of Chinese soldiers and civilians killed after the Japanese army 
took over Nanking in 1937 that range from 3,000 to 300,000 had made him doubt 
whether the incident could be called "a Great Massacre," he said. But he said 
he now realizes that even if the number of victims had been 1,000 or 2,000, "it 
still can be called 'a Great Massacre.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unfortunate incident for which (we) must apologize to the Chinese 
people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano said his description of the war as designed to free colonies was a 
"self-conceited, self-righteous" excuse that could not be used to justify 
Japan's Pacific war. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he agreed with Hata, who rebuked him late Wednesday, in saying that 
Japanese "must face directly the fact that many peoples of other countries 
suffered unbearable pain by our aggressive acts. This must not be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano made his comments to the Mainichi newspaper as part of a standard round 
of interviews that all ministers give major newspapers separately after they 
are appointed to the Cabinet. But his remarks came at a particularly bad time. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election campaign last summer, Hata had emphasized that Japan must face 
its past honestly; Hosokawa had followed up this view by flatly declaring at 
his first news conference that Japan's Pacific war, which began in 1931 in 
Manchuria, was "a war of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hosokawa apologized on trips to South Korea and China, both of Japan's 
neighbors indicated that they were finally ready to put to an end to decades of 
demands for heartfelt apologies they had failed to win from Japan under 38 
years of Liberal Democratic Party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But in both China and South Korea, reaction to Nagano's remarks was swift and 
virulent. 
</P>
<P>
 China's Foreign Ministry called in the Japanese envoy in Beijing and "demanded 
the Japanese government treat this matter seriously and severely." In Shanghai, 
President Jiang Zemin expressed his displeasure to Bunpei Hara, the visiting 
Speaker of Japan's upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's foreign minister, Han Sung Joo, called in Japan's ambassador and 
demanded that "appropriate measures" be taken. Korea's colonization, which 
began officially in 1910, ended with Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.

RUSSIA PLANS ALTERNATIVE TO WEST'S PEACE PARTNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON and TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia will develop an alternative to the Partnership for Peace program and 
offer its proposal at a meeting of NATO and other European defense ministers in 
Brussels on May 24, Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev suggested a new Asian-Pacific collective security agreement, with 
Russia acting as a bridge between Europe and Asia, but he offered no details. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Russian initiative could create a diplomatic headache for the 
United States, which has sought to soothe wounded nationalist Russian pride, 
while discouraging Russia from free-lance diplomacy in the Middle East, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other strategic hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these efforts, anti-Western and especially anti-American sentiment 
here is rising, fueled by indignation over the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb 
positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and charges, repeated Friday by Prime Minister 
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, that the West is closed to Russian products. 
</P>
<P>
 "They smile at us broadly and nicely, but when it comes to actions, thousands 
of reasons are found to bar us from Western markets," Chernomyrdin said in an 
interview with Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a government newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev's comments, which went beyond previous Russian official statements 
rejecting the Partnership for Peace plan, were equally acid. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the "infamous" NATO-sponsored military-cooperation program -- which 
Russia promised to join, then rejected last month -- is unacceptable. NATO 
should not be permitted to throw its military weight around or usurp the 
Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in peacekeeping 
operations, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev said he objects even to the name "Partnership for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot possibly create a Partnership for War, can we?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, apparently referring to North Atlantic Treaty Organization actions in 
Bosnia, Grachev added: "When they say one thing and do another, is it a real 
partnership?" 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials saw Grachev's statements as more Russian posturing intended to 
secure a status-enhancing "special role" for Russia in a program that 15 
non-NATO countries -- including almost all of the former Soviet satellites -- 
have already joined. 
</P>
<P>
 One official who declined to be named said NATO had received assurances last 
week that Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev would sign the Partnership 
for Peace agreement "in the near future." Kozyrev said publicly last month that 
Russia would not sign. 
</P>
<P>
 But a key Russian lawmaker called that view "wishful thinking." Most of the 
Russian public -- and the Parliament -- continues to hold a demonized view of 
NATO, a holdover from decades of Soviet slogans that depicted the alliance as 
the military arm of the Imperialist West, lawmaker Vyacheslav Nikonov said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a mistake not to sign," Nikonov said. The Partnership for Peace 
program is so cosmetic that Russia loses little by signing -- but would risk 
isolation if it refuses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace consists of two parts: a general agreement to 
cooperate with NATO in principle, which NATO officials say cannot be altered 
for Russia, and a specific agreement that lays out the ways in which each 
nation wants to cooperate. The latter could be broadly worded to give Russia a 
role commensurate with its status as the biggest military power in the region 
and include issues -- such as curbing terrorism and nuclear proliferation -- on 
which Russia and the West are already cooperating, U.S. and NATO officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO will continue to spurn Russian hints about wanting to be present when 
NATO debates and votes on important issues.

 Prime Minister John Major insisted Friday that he will not resign after the 
ruling Conservative government suffered a thrashing in local council elections 
across Britain.

 In a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street, Major replied to critics who 
would dispute his leadership: "If anybody chooses to engage in that fight, they 
will find me standing there waiting for them. I will meet a challenge whenever 
it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide defeat of Conservative candidates in Thursday's elections -- 
conducted at the city and county levels -- was the worst in modern times, with 
the Tories winning 27% of the total vote and suffering a net loss of 400 local 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 While the elections were clearly influenced by purely parochial concerns, 
politicians agreed Friday that voters had also expressed grave dissatisfaction 
with the Conservative government, which has been plagued by recession, higher 
taxes and a sense of a lack of strong political direction. The main opposition 
Labor Party won 41% of votes cast, while the Liberal Democrats climbed to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Party leader John Smith called the vote "the best result in local 
government in our history." Liberal leaders were equally jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers said the balloting was a reflection of the Conservative 
government's unpopularity and Major's inability to project himself as a strong 
national leader. But analysts also noted that the government in power 
invariably loses votes in midterm elections, and the government need not 
necessarily call national elections for three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Major predicted that the Tories will rally long before then, saying: "The 
Conservative Party that I care about is a good deal bigger than any election 
setback. We must now pick ourselves up and fight back. And that is precisely 
what I intend to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Carlisle, a Conservative member of Parliament, called for Major's 
resignation on Friday and threatened to mount a challenge to his leadership 
this autumn. Carlisle is not considered a serious challenger, but the mere fact 
that he would oppose the prime minister is viewed as a reflection of the 
disarray and vulnerability of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar challenge in 1990 to Margaret Thatcher's party leadership resulted 
in her forced resignation -- which led to Major's ascension as prime minister. 
He won a national election in his own right in 1992.

ELIZABETH II, MITTERRAND INAUGURATE CHANNEL TUNNEL; EUROPE: THE HEADS OF STATE 
MEET IN CALAIS, THEN TAKE HISTORIC RIDE ON LE SHUTTLE IN THE QUEEN'S 
ROLLS-ROYCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II and French President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated the 
English Channel tunnel Friday, the first land link since the Ice Age between 
the island of Britain and the European Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both heads of state opened new rail terminals in their respective capitals of 
London and Paris before meeting at Calais, France, for a ride through the 
tunnel, which cost $15 billion and took seven years to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen, speaking in French, described the tunnel, dubbed by many the 
Chunnel, as one of the world's "great technological achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 "To rejoin what nature separated some 40 million years ago has been a 
recurring dream of statesmen and engineers for several centuries," the queen 
said. "This is the first time in history that the heads of state of France and 
Britain have been able to meet each other without either of them having to 
travel by sea or air." 
</P>
<P>
 After traveling through the tunnel by a sleek Eurostar train from a new 
terminal at Victoria Station in London, the queen met Mitterrand for ceremonies 
in Calais, then they both got into her Rolls-Royce and boarded Le Shuttle for 
the return trip to Folkestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Shuttle and Eurostar are the twinned trains that will carry passenger cars 
and freight trucks through the tunnel, one tube in each direction with a 
service tunnel separating them that can carry emergency vehicles. Motorists 
will drive their vehicles onto the trains at each end for a half-hour, 31-mile 
trip in either direction, then debark to expressways at Calais or Folkestone. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of delays in the arrival of special tunnel cars and communications 
equipment, the passenger traffic service will not start until sometime in the 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chunnel completion itself has been plagued over the years by delays and 
cost-overruns -- the project cost almost double the original estimates. 
Further, the British have been years behind the French in providing a 
high-speed rail link to the Chunnel. For the next several years, while their 
French counterparts zip along, trains on the British side will travel at speeds 
well below 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, some experts questioned the safety and reliability of the 
Chunnel, burrowed well under the channel seabed. To counter any terrorist 
threat, teams of police will be poised at entrances with equipment to detect 
explosives, the operators say. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the Chunnel will soon offer a three-hour rail journey between 
London and Paris or Brussels. Ferry operators claim that they will eventually 
be able to lower their prices and suggest that their services will be more 
reliable, especially in the upcoming early months when post-construction bugs 
are still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Chunnel supporters say the rail trip between London and Paris or Brussels 
eventually may be reduced to little more than two hours; they see as many as 15 
million people making the trip every year -- with 60 trains a day, each 
carrying up to 800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 On a political level, some in Britain suggest that the physical link will bind 
this country closer to the Continent.

FIRE BREAKS OUT IN RUSSIAN NUCLEAR REACTOR; NO RADIATION PERIL REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire broke out Friday at the world's second-largest fast-breeder nuclear 
reactor, in Russia's Ural Mountains, but officials said that radiation levels 
are normal and that there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke poured from the Beloyarsk reactor, 25 miles north of Yekaterinburg, but 
firefighters eventually put out the blaze, the Interfax news agency said, 
quoting the regional civil defense unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's nuclear plants, now funded by some government aid but mostly by 
consumers, face a money shortage that often means they take shortcuts in safety 
measures, environmentalists and nuclear officials charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the government recorded about 20,000 violations of safety rules. 
Many were blamed on the shortfall in revenue since Russia began market reforms 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire Friday at the Beloyarsk reactor was caused by leaking liquid sodium, 
said Hans-Friedrich Meyer, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquid sodium is used as a cooling agent to transfer heat away from the 
reactor and to generate steam for the turbines. It burns easily when it comes 
in contact with water. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary evaluation put the accident between zero and one on the 
International Nuclear Events Scale, meaning "no influence on the environment," 
Meyer said.

YEMENI FORCES' AIR AND GROUND WAR INTENSIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Yemeni forces launched air and missile attacks on the capital, Sana, 
and northern troops advanced on the southern port of Aden on Friday in the 
worst fighting since the two Yemens united four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest battles blew apart what remained of the fragile thread that has 
held together the Arab world's poorest country since the former Marxist south 
and the conservative north came together. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemen's official Saba news agency said southern forces, numerically inferior 
to the army of the north but with superior air power, fired five Russian-made 
Scud missiles at Sana. 
</P>
<P>
 The missiles, launched from bases near Aden 180 miles away, caused no 
casualties or serious damage, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 A north Yemen official said the capital also came under repeated southern air 
attacks.  
</P>
<P>
 He said raiding southern warplanes had dropped bombs at random on Sana 
"causing damage to some civilian areas." Seven southern plans were reportedly 
shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos, President Ali Abdullah Saleh issued decrees firing the 
country's oil minister and the governor of Aden, members of the southern Yemen 
Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 North Yemeni forces said in a statement they were advancing on Aden on four 
fronts and would not stop until they took the former capital of South Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting has trapped an estimated 1,500 Westerners in the rugged country 
on the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The French navy earlier 
Friday evacuated about 560 foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Further evacuations were planned by France, Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest battles, following pitched air and artillery fights between 
northern and southern forces Thursday, have cut Yemen off from the rest of the 
world, and it is impossible to verify rival claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemen's fragile union has been under threat because of rivalry between Saleh 
and Vice President Ali Salem Beidh, a southerner.

BISHOPS URGE WORLD TO STOP ARMING AFRICA; RELIGION: ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM THAT 
VIOLENCE-RACKED CONTINENT SEEK INTERNATIONAL HELP IN ENDING WEAPONS SALES FROM 
RICH NATIONS. THEY ALSO PLEAD FOR DEBT RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a powerful appeal for international help, African bishops of the Roman 
Catholic Church on Friday urged the world's rich nations to stop arming warring 
factions in Africa and to ease the debt burden on a continent scourged by 
violence and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals came in the closing document of a monthlong congress of church 
leaders from Africa summoned by Pope John Paul II, a frequent observer at the 
bishops' deliberations until felled last week by a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope is mending, and while he will miss Sunday's closing ceremonies, he is 
bound to be cheered by both the tenor and content of conclusions reached by the 
300 bishops from a region where Catholicism is growing quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 A 71-point "Message of the Synod" released here Friday ranges broadly among 
issues of principal concern to the African church. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls for greater efforts to blend Catholic teachings with African 
realities and for an expanded dialogue with traditional African religions and 
with Muslims. It urges a strengthening of the family, respect for the role of 
women, support for refugees, displaced people, the poor, sick and victims of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing African leaders, the bishops demand politicians "who wish to serve 
rather than be served . . . (who) hold in check the lust of political hegemony, 
both internal and external, which sow the seeds of division and hate which give 
rise to wars." 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops applaud African military officers for their service but add 
bluntly, "We remind them, however, that they will have to answer before God for 
every act of violence against the lives of innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 The synod conclusion reasserts Catholic teaching on the celibacy of clergy and 
on the sanctity of life, attacking a U.N. conference in Cairo on population 
control that has also aroused papal ire. 
</P>
<P>
 The African bishops decry "a deliberate intention to impose, with strong 
financial backing, on the nations of the world as a whole the liberalization of 
abortion, the promotion of a lifestyle without moral reference and the 
destruction of the family as it was willed by God." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all condemn this individualistic and permissive culture which liberalizes 
abortion and makes of the death of the child simply a matter for decision by 
the mother," they say. "We condemn the enslavement of man to money, the new 
god, through which pressure is put on the poor nations to force them to choose 
options in Cairo which are contrary to life and morality." 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops, who are asking the Vatican for greater authority to resolve local 
matters of Catholic practice, are equally assertive in their view of the 
responsibility of the world's rich nations toward a continent where war abounds 
and poverty is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is imperative that there be a stop to arms sales to groups locked in 
conflict in Africa," the bishops say, asking "people of goodwill in the 
Northern Hemisphere" to pressure their countries to get out of the arms 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 For the bishops, sub-Saharan Africa's crushing debt -- which exceeds one 
year's output of goods and services from the region -- is a millstone that 
undermines development and breeds instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of urgency to find a just solution to the problem of debt, 
which crushes the greater part of the peoples of the continent and which 
renders futile every effort at economic recovery," the bishops say. "Together 
with the Holy Father and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, we ask 
for at least a substantial, if not a total, remission of the debt. We also 
simultaneously call for the formation of a more just international economic 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing a synod that is expected to strengthen the African church by promoting 
a more trans-African search for problem-solving, the bishops also demand 
international respect for their land and peoples, saying, "We ask our brothers 
and sisters of other continents to see to it that due respect is given to 
Africa and Africans, as well as to those of them who have immigrated to the 
Northern Hemisphere."

HUNGARY NOSTALGIC FOR 'GOULASH' DAYS; ELECTIONS: A PAINFUL PATH TO CAPITALISM 
HAS VOTERS UPSET. AN EX-COMMUNIST WHO PUT THE FIRST TEAR IN THE IRON CURTAIN 
LOOKS SET TO PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The shambling, stooped figure and squinty countenance of Gyula Horn rekindle 
memories of a time that many here now look back on as this nation's heyday. The 
last days of Communist rule, when Horn served as foreign minister, unfolded in 
an atmosphere of inspiration and daring as Hungarians paved the way to freedom 
for an enslaved empire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Horn who refused to deport East German refugees to the dictatorial 
regime they had escaped. Inflicting the first decisive tear in the Iron 
Curtain, he cut through a security fence on the border with Austria five years 
ago to symbolically break down the barrier between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-noticed party functionary until the late 1980s, Horn took the 
whispered words of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to heart, 
spearheading an internal political revolution that led to the first free 
elections in East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, four years after that first vote swept Horn and his reform-minded 
Communist brethren from power, his regenerated Hungarian Socialist Party is 
poised for a comeback in Sunday's second post-Cold War election. Despite 
campaign muckraking by the governing parties that sought to cast him as a 
secret police thug and an election-eve car accident that sent him to the 
hospital with an injured neck, Horn appears set to capitalize on Hungarian 
nostalgia for the gentle days of "goulash communism." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest opinion polls show the largest share of decided voters favoring the 
Socialists, upward of 31% and rising as fence-sitters make their choices. 
</P>
<P>
 That is nearly twice the support voiced for the next-most-popular party, the 
liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Many expect the alliance to join forces 
with Horn's party to form a left-leaning government after what is likely to be 
a widely fractured vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing appeal of the Socialists has made them the political force to be 
contended with and moved parties once staunchly opposed to any alliance with 
former Communists to accept the front-runners as potential partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 61, has left his options open by declining to declare himself a 
candidate for prime minister. He may be holding back that political plum as a 
coalition inducement to the Free Democrats, who have ardently pushed Gabor 
Kuncze, 44, a technocrat, for the top government job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been decided yet, and we are quite gripped by anxiety at the 
prospect of such a coalition," conceded Ivan Peto, president of the Free 
Democrats and a former dissident during the Communist era. "But there may be no 
other alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Peto brushed off the possibility of an alliance with the incumbent Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, a center-right party that is trailing in fourth place because 
voters blame it for the economic hardships that have mounted over its four-year 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-collar laborers, struggling pensioners and the 13% of Hungarian workers 
idled by the painful transition to capitalism are following the trend set last 
year in Poland by reconsidering the Socialists, who at least provided them 
subsistence wages and steady work. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are honest, hard-working people -- not like the crooks in government 
who have brought us only new troubles," Zsuzsa Apali, 26, a bookkeeper, said at 
a Friday night Socialist rally. Like many young workers, she is forced to live 
at home with her unemployed parents because she cannot afford her own housing, 
and they need her income to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forum, led by the late Prime Minister Jozsef Antall until his death in 
December, and two smaller coalition partners chalked up the honor of being the 
only East European government to serve out its first full mandate. But it 
failed to fulfill promises to transfer industry from state to private 
ownership, while inflation has ranged from 20% to 40% each year, and the 
jobless rate climbed steadily upward. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling coalition has also been criticized by Western human rights agencies 
for exerting undue influence over state-controlled radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the electronic media wrath has been directed against the Socialists. 
But the campaign appears to have backfired since the April 29 airing of a 
highly provocative claim that Horn worked as a secret police operative and beat 
anti-Communist demonstrators after the failed 1956 revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "His popularity has only increased," Peto said of Horn. "People have learned 
not to trust anything they see or hear on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn missed his last pre-election rally before today's mandatory day of 
campaign silence after suffering a broken wrist and fractured vertebrae in a 
car accident late Thursday while returning from campaigning in the eastern city 
of Miskolc. 
</P>
<P>
 Few at the closing rally outside party headquarters here showed much concern 
that the injury, likely to keep Horn in the hospital for a week, would set back 
the Socialists' chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know who they want to vote for. If anything, the Socialists will do 
better because there will be a show of sympathy" because of the accident, said 
Jozsef Nagy, a 38-year-old roofer who supported the Forum four years ago but 
plans this time to back Horn's party. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Socialists' commanding lead in the polls, little is likely to be 
decided in Sunday's first ballot for the 386-seat Parliament. Many of the races 
for individual seats are likely to require a second-round vote on May 29.

TEEN-AGER'S MOTHER DECRIES FLOGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mother of American teen-ager Michael P. Fay on Friday denounced the caning 
of her son a day earlier as torture after a briefing by a U.S. consular officer 
who was allowed to visit him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say that I am extremely disturbed.I'm extremely upset," said Randy 
Chan, 46. "This was torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, received four lashes with a thin rattan cane 
Thursday afternoon as part of a sentence for spray-painting cars and other 
offenses allegedly committed in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay reportedly was "hurt" by the caning but nevertheless appeared to be in 
relatively good spirits Friday. He was able to sleep Thursday night and to walk 
normally and sit down Friday when talking to the consular officer.

 Collins, recommended to President Clinton by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), 
was one of 13 judges confirmed by voice vote. She will serve in the Central 
District, based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins joined the district attorney's office in 1978 and served on the 
Webster Commission, which investigated the Los Angeles Police Department's 
performance during the 1992 riots. She rose to the rank of assistant district 
attorney, becoming one of two top aides to Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti.

FOOD LABELING RULES DELAYED FOR CAN MAKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an action that could affect enforcement of the nation's new food labeling 
rules, a federal judge on Friday granted a temporary reprieve to manufacturers 
of soft drink cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing "the serious nature of the issues raised" by the canners, U.S. District 
Judge Stanley Sporkin issued an order in Washington barring the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration from enforcing its rules against can manufacturers until a 
May 16 court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The labeling rules take effect for the rest of the food industry on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the order is limited to can manufacturers, it could force the FDA to 
delay across-the-board enforcement of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were to apply the rules to other industries, they would just be 
inviting them to file lawsuits and get exemptions for themselves," said Michael 
Kershow, attorney for the Can Manufacturers Institute, which won the temporary 
restraining order. "The FDA might think it is best to apply the ruling broadly 
while the order is in force." 
</P>
<P>
 An FDA spokesman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The can manufacturers, arguing the labeling rules have saddled them with 
millions of dollars worth of useless inventory, want enforcement of the rules 
postponed until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Sunday, food manufacturers must provide specific nutritional 
information on food packages. Manufacturers must also adhere to strict 
definitions of such nutritional buzzwords as "light" and "low fat." Many foods 
already have these labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The can manufacturers said they are not prepared to meet the Sunday deadline 
because the FDA misled them about how the rules would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centers on the timing of the FDA's so-called "labeled and filled" 
test. On March 31, the agency said that any package filled after May 8 must 
have the new nutrition label. 
</P>
<P>
 Canners said that until the March 31 rule was issued, FDA officials had led 
them to believe that the old-label packages could be produced up to May 8, and 
filled afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've amassed a sizable inventory of cans not yet filled with beverages," 
Kershow said.

LAWMAKERS POP QUESTION; MAN'S INTENDED VOTES AYE

 It was a legislative proposal like no other. Television reporter Brian 
O'Donoghue got the Alaska House to pop the question Friday to an unsuspecting 
Kate Ripley, a reporter for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.Right on the House 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Larson read into the record an official legislative citation that 
spoke of "a certain joint venture that has potential for being even more 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Be it resolved that the 18th Alaska State Legislature assist Brian O'Donoghue 
in popping the question, the question being: Shall Kate marry Brian?" Larson 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ripley sat stunned at the press table, her mouth agape, O'Donoghue left his 
camera and knelt in front of her with an Alaska-size diamond ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripley hugged O'Donoghue, grabbed his hand and escaped into the relative 
privacy of the House hallway. When the smiling couple re-entered the chamber, 
House Speaker Ramona Barnes asked Ripley to deliver her answer into Larson's 
microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is yes," she said. The House erupted in applause. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donoghue, who reports for KTVF in Fairbanks and KTVA in Anchorage, and 
Ripley have been dating for two years. When not covering the legislative 
session in Juneau, they live in Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 A crush of lawmakers, aides and reporters later congratulated the couple in 
the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donoghue said Ripley had been dropping hints about marriage but had not been 
pressuring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be the best thing the Legislature's done this year," Minority Leader 
Fran Ulmer said.

SERIAL KILLER GACY LOSES 3 APPEALS; EXECUTION BY INJECTION SET TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Gacy lost appeals in three courts Friday and authorities assembled 
a rapid-response legal team to counter any last-minute moves to buy time for 
the convicted serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy, 52, is scheduled to die by lethal injection early Tuesday.He was 
convicted of murdering 33 young men and boys between 1972 and December, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy lost appeals Friday in Cook County Circuit Court, U.S. District Court and 
the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be a long, busy weekend anyway," Gacy's attorney John 
Greenlees said. "It appears now it's going to be longer and a lot busier than 
we had thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals variously argued that he was out of town when several of the 
killings occurred, was mentally incompetent and that execution by injection is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no merit to any of the claims Mr. Gacy has brought, and I don't think 
there's any merit to any claim he could bring in the future," said Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Arleen Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was originally scheduled to die June 2, 1980, but appeals have kept him 
alive.

$700,000 LAWSUIT ACCUSES CLINTON OF SEX HARASSMENT; COMPLAINT: PAULA CORBIN 
JONES SAYS THEN-ARKANSAS GOVERNOR MADE ADVANCES TOWARD HER IN 1991. PRESIDENT'S 
LAWYER CALLS CHARGES 'TABLOID TRASH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, filed an unprecedented 
lawsuit Friday seeking $700,000 in damages from President Clinton, whom she 
accused of making sexual advances in 1991 while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the President, attorney Robert S. Bennett denied the allegations 
detailed in the suit and dismissed them as "tabloid trash." He told a news 
conference in Washington: "Quite simply, the incident did not occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was said to be the first ever filed against a sitting President for 
personal conduct alleged to have occurred before he was elected. Under legal 
precedent, presidents are largely immune from suits stemming from acts 
committed while in office, but there is no precedent governing suits like that 
filed by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the suit faces many tough legal hurdles, its graphic description 
of the alleged encounter between Jones and Clinton is virtually certain to 
embarrass the President and to bolster efforts by some Republicans to smear his 
reputation. Both the filing and Bennett's response drew hordes of reporters 
from news organizations across the country and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who said she rebuffed Clinton's advances, is believed to be getting 
legal and financial assistance from conservative Republican groups with whom 
she has allied herself in the past. But her attorneys, Gilbert K. Davis and 
Joseph Cammaratta of Fairfax, Va., declined to say how they were hired or who 
would pay their legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's defenders -- and even Jones' sister, Charlotte Brown -- have 
portrayed her as a gold-digger whose chief purpose is to profit financially 
from her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "This suit is about publicity, it's about talk shows, it's about money, and I 
understand from recent press reports (that) potential book contract profits 
have been divvied up," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones pledged in a statement read to the news media by her lawyers that she 
would donate all proceeds from the case to charity. Jones, who now lives in 
California, made no public appearance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is not about money," Jones said in the statement. "This case is 
about character and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Named as a co-defendant in the suit is Danny Ferguson, a former Arkansas state 
trooper and Clinton bodyguard whom Jones claims persuaded her to go to a hotel 
room on May 8, 1991, where she met the then-governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was then a $6.35-an-hour employee of the Arkansas Industrial Development 
Commission and was working at the registration desk at a commission convention 
at the time she claims to have met Clinton. Because Clinton, as governor, was 
technically the chief executive of the commission, she argues that his alleged 
overtures constituted sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the statute of limitations for a sexual-harassment complaint has 
long since passed, her suit makes a broader claim that may be more difficult to 
prove: that Clinton violated her civil rights. She also alleges conspiracy, 
emotional distress and defamation of character. 
</P>
<P>
 In lurid detail, Jones claims in her lawsuit that she was persuaded by 
Ferguson to go to the governor's hotel suite, where Clinton admired her hair 
and "curves" and tried to put his hand under her clothing and kiss her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones escaped his grasp initially, she said, and sat down on a sofa in the 
room. He then moved to her side, she claimed, lowered his trousers and 
underwear and asked for oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones rebuffed him again, according to the suit, Clinton replied: "Well, 
I don't want to make you do anything you don't want to do." He then allegedly 
asked her not to tell anyone what had happened, saying: "You are smart. Let's 
keep this between ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit contends that Jones can describe identifying characteristics on 
Clinton's body, presumably to help her prove her claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones contended that she shared her recollections of the incident with friends 
and relatives but made no official complaint, fearing that she could lose her 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, she could have filed a sexual-harassment complaint with the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the alleged 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her decision not to pursue a legal complaint, she said, she was 
subsequently placed in a position at the commission that deprived her of 
advancement, and she said she felt threatened whenever she saw the governor and 
Ferguson. She concluded that her refusal to surrender to Clinton's advances had 
made her a target of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jones said, she did not decide to pursue her complaint until she read 
an article in the January issue of American Spectator magazine, a conservative 
journal, saying that a woman named "Paula" who was once escorted to Clinton's 
hotel room by Ferguson told the trooper that "she was available to be Clinton's 
regular girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Jones said in her suit, she decided to discuss the matter 
publicly to make it clear that she had resisted the alleged advance.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Feb. 11, Jones first told her story at a news conference in Washington in 
connection with a meeting of Republican conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton denied her story, she said, she decided to file suit against him 
because she felt the President had branded her "a liar." She insisted that she 
has never sought anything more than a simple apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett contended, however, that Jones sought to extort money and a job 
opportunity from the White House as well as an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GOP sources insisted that Bennett tried to head off the suit on 
Thursday by entering into negotiations with Jones' lawyers, the President's 
lawyer denied that Clinton ever entertained the idea of issuing an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones originally hired Danny Traylor, a Little Rock attorney, to represent her 
in the case. But Davis and Cammaratta joined the case this week after Traylor 
contacted a number of conservative groups, seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers James Risen in Washington and William C. Rempel in Los 
Angeles contributed to this story.

BOBBITT DENIES HE ATTACKED HIS FIANCEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt pleaded innocent Friday to a misdemeanor count of domestic 
battery, hours after he was arrested for allegedly shoving his fiancee into a 
wall during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt -- the man who gained international attention when his wife severed 
his penis -- was released on $7,100 bail pending a June 3 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is just a huge misunderstanding," he said in a statement 
released by Aaron Gordon, a spokesman for both Bobbitt and his 21-year-old 
fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, Bobbitt, 26, and Kristina Elliott were involved 
"in a verbal argument before Bobbitt grabbed her right forearm, causing a 
bruise, then shoved her into a wall, causing a bruise." 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance when he 
was arrested about 3 a.m., the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott was "more emotionally hurt than anything," Gordon said. The spokesman 
released separate statements from Bobbitt and Elliott in which they reaffirmed 
their love for one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a Virginia jury found Bobbitt's estranged wife, Lorena, 
innocent by reason of insanity for cutting off Bobbitt's penis. Surgeons 
reattached it.

LEGAL STRATEGY COULD FOCUS ON IMMUNITY; LAW: CLINTON'S LAWYER MAY ARGUE THAT 
PRESIDENT CANNOT BE SUED FOR ACTIONS THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE TAKING 
OFFICE. EXPERTS SEE LACK OF PRECEDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Can a President be sued for something he did before he was elected? 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's new lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, appears to be laying the 
groundwork for a legal argument that a sitting President cannot be sued for 
actions that may have occurred before taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 But other legal experts said Bennett will have a hard time finding a precedent 
in law for the claim that the President is immune from civil suits arising from 
his pre-White House days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you permit the President of the United States to be sued and permit the 
case to go forward, . . . think of the consequences," Bennett said Friday at a 
press conference called to blast the $700,000 civil rights and defamation case 
against Clinton filed by Paula Corbin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose every prisoner in an Arkansas jail who has been denied a pardon 
could file a suit against the President and when a lawyer tried to throw it 
out, he could say: 'Well, I want to have some pretrial discovery. Let's take 
some depositions.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, your President would be tied down for 365 days a year being asked 
questions by lawyers and there is something wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that courts have clearly ruled that to prevent a paralysis of the 
presidency and to avoid harassment of the officeholder by frivolous lawsuits, a 
President cannot be sued for official acts while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal experts questioned whether Bennett's attempt to expand the legal 
doctrine of presidential immunity to include acts performed before assuming 
office would hold up. The question has never been tested in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert J. Miller Jr., who represented former President Richard Nixon in a 
civil suit brought by a whistle-blower, said the Supreme Court in that case 
(Nixon vs. Fitzgerald) unambiguously stated that a President was immune from 
civil suits arising from his official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bennett could argue that some of the concepts discussed by the court -- 
namely that the President should decide issues of the nation and not be 
subjected to suits for damages -- could support an argument that a sitting 
President should be immune to actions arising from acts before his presidency," 
Miller said. "But that is not the holding of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress and judges are protected from civil damage suits over 
their official acts and statements, but they have no such immunity from claims 
over non-official activities. 
</P>
<P>
 No public official is protected from criminal charges for actions in or out of 
office, as former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and numerous others have 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney William Kilberg, of the Washington office of the Los Angeles law firm 
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, said Bennett's chief fear is that the case will 
proceed to the discovery stage, which Bennett himself said could open "a 
Pandora's box" of unrelated allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Bennett is doing is what any good lawyer would do -- maybe doing it 
better -- which is to accuse the accuser and to try to get (the suit) dismissed 
before any discovery goes forward," said Kilberg, who was solicitor general in 
the Labor Department during the Gerald R. Ford Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he hopes to avoid is discovery, which could produce the Anita Hill 
syndrome, when others will come forward and authenticate enough of her (Jones') 
story to lend credibility to those allegations that only she and the President 
know are true or not."

NRA, GUN CONTROL FORCES PLAN FOR MORE CLOSE COMBAT; POLICY: PROPOSALS TO 
LICENSE, FINGERPRINT FIREARMS OWNERS ARE BEING HATCHED. WEAPONS LOBBY THREATENS 
ELECTORAL REVENGE AGAINST LEGISLATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After Thursday's dramatic House vote to ban 19 types of assault weapons, both 
sides along the gun control siege line are reloading for the next round in 
their long-running war. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with enthusiasm after the victory, gun control proponents are hatching 
plans for follow-on measures -- including proposals to require that all gun 
owners be licensed and fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. is promising continued efforts to fight the ban in 
the final crime bill -- and threatening retaliation in November against 
legislators who crossed it on the bitterly contested vote. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a single vote separating victory and defeat in Thursday's House 
showdown, NRA spokesman Bill McIntyre said that the group is contemplating a 
renewed blitz to prevent inclusion of the assault weapons ban in the final 
crime bill that emerges from a House-Senate conference committee. The Senate 
narrowly approved a nearly identical ban last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do what we can to make sure no gun ban becomes law," McIntyre 
said. "It's not over until it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they take such threats seriously. "We're not 
done yet," said George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to President Clinton. "We 
haven't gotten an assault weapons ban yet. It would be wrong to be complacent." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, most observers believe that Congress, after all the agony of passing 
the ban, is unlikely to change course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is pretty much over," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). "The 
House has spoken; the Senate has spoken; the public has spoken. It would take 
some pretty tricky legerdemain to (delete) it and I don't think the leadership 
in the House or Senate will go along." 
</P>
<P>
 The more pressing question may be whether Congress will follow the assault 
weapons ban with further gun control measures. And the answer to that may pivot 
on what happens in November to legislators who opposed the NRA on the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control advocates said that Thursday's vote -- following last November's 
passage of the Brady bill, which has imposed a waiting period on handgun 
purchases -- suggests that fewer legislators fear the NRA, long one of 
Washington's most powerful lobbies. To reverse that perception and slow the 
momentum behind gun control, the NRA may have to prove in November that it can 
still punish its enemies by defeating them at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't do that," said one ranking Republican Party operative who has 
worked closely with the NRA in the past, "they are heading for more of the same 
as the assault weapon ban." 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment reflects the critical link between the NRA's legislative 
success and its capacity to influence elections, both through campaign 
contributions and grass-roots activities from their 3-million-plus members. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 election, the NRA contributed more than $1.7 million to 
congressional candidates -- more than any other ideological or single-issue 
political action committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more importantly, the organization spent about $950,000 on 
campaigns for and against individual candidates, according to the center's 
figures. And it devoted substantial additional sums to communicating 
endorsements and opposition to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their secret is they do a lot of voter contact and a lot of voter turnout," 
said the Republican operative. "Most of these PACs will give you $5,000 and 
walk on their way. They also have a massive grass-roots organization. . . . 
It's very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 But many believe that the NRA's massive electoral machine, like a tank caught 
in a monsoon, may be the victim of a shifting climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole gun issue has changed from a right to bear arms to a crime control 
issue and that makes it a lot more palatable for members of Congress to cross 
the NRA," said Stu Rothenberg, editor of a Washington-based political 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet even Thursday's vote shows that the NRA still carries a substantial 
stick in Congress. Given polls showing that more than 70% of the public 
supports the ban, the House vote was remarkably close. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural districts, where the NRA's reach is the longest, almost two dozen 
House members who deserted the organization on the earlier Brady bill shifted 
back to oppose the ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving this week's struggle so narrowly, the instinct at the White 
House is to move cautiously on other gun control measures, one senior official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the dam has broken," the official said. "Thursday wasn't 
exactly a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the official said, the Administration is committed only to 
pushing its proposal to increase to $600 the licensing fee for gun dealers in 
an effort to weed out fly-by-night operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer and other gun control advocates want to go further -- although they 
acknowledged that Congress is unlikely to do more than begin discussing 
additional proposals in this session. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), Schumer has introduced legislation 
that would require all gun owners to be licensed and to undergo a background 
check that includes fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition the bill would require that all gun sales -- including those 
between private individuals -- be registered with law enforcement officials, 
would prevent anyone from purchasing more than one gun monthly and would impose 
its own set of new requirements on gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun Control Inc., the principal gun control lobby, is pushing an even more 
ambitious measure that would add to those provisions a ban on "Saturday night 
special" handguns and a prohibition on gun sales to individuals convicted of 
violent misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the two victories gun control advocates have enjoyed this 
congressional session, both those measures still face an uphill battle, most 
observers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrowness of Thursday's vote suggests that, although rising anxiety about 
crime has eliminated the clear advantage opponents of gun control have long 
enjoyed in Congress, it has not tipped the field toward proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you can read from Thursday's vote is that crime is a paramount 
concern," said the senior White House official, "not that the NRA is dead or 
Americans are rushing to embrace gun control."

FINAL GOODBY FOR 3 IN FAMILY KILLED BY AUTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old John Vaccarello took a last walk with his mother Friday. His 
hand firmly guided her mahogany coffin up the aisle of a church. His eyes never 
left two other coffins -- one for each of his sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the final goodby for Cathy Vaccarello and her daughters. They were 
killed, police said, by a drunken driver who was indicted as the three were 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Vaccarello, 47; her husband, Giovanni, 51; Maria, 18; and Concetta, 17, 
were run down Sunday as the family left a party in the borough of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Meyers, who had his license suspended 26 times and has at least one 
drunken-driving conviction, was driving 70 m.p.h. at night with his headlights 
off and ran a red light, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury found the behavior "so wanton, so deficient in moral conscience 
and concern, so devoid of regard to the lives of others and so blameworthy" 
that it indicted him on three counts each of murder, reckless manslaughter and 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was charged with assault and vehicular assault and driving while 
intoxicated. If convicted, he faces life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers is being held in jail without bail until his arraignment, scheduled for 
May 26. Meyers' attorney, Andrew Worgam, said his client is "completely sorry 
that it's happened and he's completely sorry (for) the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccarello survived, but has serious head, neck and leg injuries. He left a 
hospital briefly to attend a private funeral service for his family in 
Brooklyn, but he was not at Our Lady of Guadalupe church for a larger 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Young girls in plaid uniforms, teen-agers wearing white varsity sweaters, 
college students and friends jammed into the 2,500-seat church. 
</P>
<P>
 John, who stayed behind the night of the party to help a cousin clean up, 
helped carry his mother's coffin from the church, tears welling in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's priest, Msgr. Angelo Brugli, choked back sobs during the service 
each time he spoke of the Vaccarellos, first in English and then in Italian for 
Mrs. Vaccarello's mother and father, who flew in from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were planning to come next month to attend graduations for Concetta and 
John," said Sister Frances, a first-grade teacher who taught all three 
Vaccarello children. "Instead, they come for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Concetta, a high school senior, was a team leader for her school's Students 
Against Driving Drunk chapter. She helped plan a campaign that was supposed to 
be presented next week, but was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Concetta won a scholarship and planned to attend St. John's University in the 
fall. Maria, a Brooklyn College student, hoped to become a doctor.

PANEL BACKS CLINTON'S DEFENSE SPENDING BUT SHOWS CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The defense spending plan approved by the House Armed Services Committee hews 
to President Clinton's budget while expressing concern that the military not 
become a "hollow force" unable to handle more than one regional war. 
</P>
<P>
 The $263.3-billion spending plan for fiscal 1995, approved Thursday and 
released Friday, is slightly below Clinton's request and adjusts some 
Administration priorities. It also finances a new aircraft carrier and stops 
short of killing the troubled C-17 cargo plane. 
</P>
<P>
 With the budget now headed for the House floor, outlines of military 
priorities for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 are emerging, although the 
Senate Armed Services Committee is still deliberating. At a time of declining 
defense spending, the military will depend increasingly on mobility, and so the 
big-dollar items in the budget include air transport, landing ships and the 
"power projecting" carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade of defense spending reductions means fewer people will be asked to do 
more. The committee accepted an Administration proposal to double to 180 days 
the time that could be served by reserves in a presidential call-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the government is confronting the need to buy weapons it may not 
need in order to preserve the factories that build them. For that reason, the 
committee added $78 million for six Apache attack helicopters to avoid a 
seven-month production gap at a McDonnell Douglas Corp. plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason for including $3.7 billion toward the $4.5-billion carrier in the 
1995 budget was to protect jobs at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. 
in Virginia and prevent specialized subcontractors from going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sign of the times, the committee said it opposed allowing defense 
contractors to write off merger costs until it studies the issue in more 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bill closely follows Administration priorities, it is critical of 
some White House initiatives and recommends greater emphasis in such areas as 
the comfort of troops and preventing sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel approved a Republican amendment opposing use of Pentagon money to 
finance United Nations peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clinton requested a 1.6% military pay raise, the committee recommended 
2.6%. The estimated $500-million cost was offset by reductions in overhead 
elsewhere in the budget, the committee said. It included $40.8 million for a 
"comprehensive quality of life construction program" for troops stationed in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also moved up the effective date of cost-of-living increases for 
military pensioners at a cost of $376 million.

CLAS RULING AWAITED AS FUROR GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Opponents of the California Learning Assessment System have obtained sections 
of the 1994 exams, but promised the judge in a key Los Angeles lawsuit Friday 
that they would not be disseminated until he makes a ruling in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien said Friday that he will rule early 
next week on the bid by the United States Justice Foundation to require 
parental permission before schools can give the tests to students. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other developments Friday in the spreading controversy over the 
statewide achievement tests, which critics claim invade students' privacy or 
contain inappropriate passages in the reading and writing portions of the 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the board of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District voted 
to postpone testing of eighth- and 10th-graders, which had been scheduled to 
begin Monday, until all seven board members can discuss the exams in a meeting 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, state Department of Education officials said they are likely to 
seek a court order next week against the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District in Lancaster, which on Thursday night reaffirmed its refusal to give 
the tests. Three other districts also have refused.  
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of California School Administrators asked the Education Department 
not to release this year's test results until scoring problems can be ironed 
out, and to provide more complete information about the exams.  
</P>
<P>
 The tests are being given this spring to more than 1 million public school 
students in grades four, five, eight and 10. Scoring is to be done over the 
summer, with results to be released during the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely hailed as a major step in the drive to improve education by getting 
students to think and write about more complex subjects, the exam system has 
come under attack on scoring procedures and on contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the copyrighted exams, as with other standardized tests, are kept 
confidential to protect their fairness and validity, several groups have been 
allowed to review them in an attempt to assuage concerns about their contents. 
School board members have been reviewing the tests privately, and state 
legislators will get their first look on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some school board members have said they see no problem with the 
tests, others have expressed concerns. Newport-Mesa board member Martha Fluor 
said Friday that five questions on the exams upset board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would never vote to administer those under any circumstances," she said. 
"The State Department of Education has placed us in an untenable position. I am 
appalled." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles lawsuit, brought against the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, is being widely watched for its expected ruling on whether the tests 
delve into students' personal lives in violation of the state Education Code.

WOMAN CONVICTED IN SLAYING OVER DISPUTE ABOUT SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who was ordered to stub out her cigarette after lighting up in a 
no-smoking section was convicted in the shotgun slaying of one of the 
restaurant patrons who complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Daphnye Luster, 22, was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder, assault 
with a deadly weapon and possessing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Luster was with five children, including her 3-year-old daughter, at a Denny's 
restaurant in San Pablo when she got into an argument with Rachelle Houston and 
four other women at another table because she was smoking in the nonsmoking 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the group complained to the manager, who asked 
Luster to put out the cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Luster left the restaurant but returned about 3 a.m. Sept. 25, 
armed with a shotgun and a crossbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Luster fired one shot at Houston's car as she drove away, hitting her in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Stuart Hanlon argued that the gun went off accidentally and 
said Luster armed herself because she was afraid of the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Luster wept as the verdict was read. Hanlon declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Luster faces a prison sentence of 25 years to life. Sentencing was set for 
June 2.

ARCHEOLOGISTS FIND WORLD'S OLDEST PAVED ROAD IN EGYPT; HISTORY: EIGHT-MILE 
STRETCH OF FLAGSTONES WAS USED TO MOVE BASALT BLOCKS FROM A QUARRY TO THE NILE 
FOR TRANSPORTATION TO MONUMENTS AT GIZA AND SAQQARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American researchers have discovered the world's oldest paved road, a 
4,600-year-old highway that linked a basalt quarry in a desolate region of the 
Egyptian desert to waterways that carried basalt blocks to monument sites along 
the Nile.  
</P>
<P>
 The eight-mile road is at least 500 years older than any previously discovered 
road and is the only paved road discovered in ancient Egypt, said geologist 
Thomas Bown of the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, who reported the discovery 
Friday at a regional meeting of the Geological Society of America in Durango, 
Colo.  
</P>
<P>
 "The road probably doesn't rank with the pyramids as a construction feat, but 
it is a major engineering achievement," said his colleague, geologist James 
Harrell of the University of Toledo. "Not only is the road earlier than we 
thought possible, we didn't even think they built roads." 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers made an additional discovery in the quarry at the northern end 
of the road: the first evidence that the Egyptians used rock saws for cutting 
the basalt into blocks. "This is the oldest example of saws being used for 
cutting stone," said archeologist James K. Hoffmeier of Wheaton College in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's two technologies we didn't know they had," Harrell said in a telephone 
interview. "And we don't know why they were both abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 The road was discovered in the Faiyum Depression, about 45 miles southwest of 
Cairo. Short segments of the road had been observed by earlier explorers, Bown 
said, but they failed to realize its significance or follow up on their 
observations. Bown and his colleagues stumbled across it while they were doing 
geological mapping in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The road was clearly built to service the newly discovered quarry, where the 
heavy black basalt was laid down by volcanic eruptions about 30 million years 
ago. Bown and Harrell have found the camp that housed workers at the quarry, 
and numerous potsherds and artifacts date the site to the Egyptian Old Kingdom 
that began about 2600 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The road appears today to go nowhere, ending in the middle of the desert. When 
it was built, its terminus was a quay on the shore of Lake Moeris, which had an 
elevation of about 66 feet above sea level, the same as the quay. Birket Qarun, 
the lake that is now at the bottom of the depression, has a surface elevation 
of 148 feet below sea level, reflecting the sharp change in climate in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Moeris received its water from the annual floods of the Nile. At the time 
of the floods, the river and lake were at the same level and connected through 
a gap in the hills near the modern villages of el-Lahun and Hawara. Harrell and 
Bown believe that basalt blocks were loaded onto barges during the dry season, 
then floated over to the Nile during the floods to be shipped off to the 
monument sites at Giza and Saqqara. 
</P>
<P>
 The road was constructed with flagstones, large slabs of stone that were laid 
on the sand without any surface preparation. The nature of the stones varies 
according to location. "It's clear they just used whatever was handy," Bown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The road is a little over six feet wide -- "almost exactly four cubits," Bown 
said. Although the main road is just under eight miles long, branches at the 
quarry bring the total to about 11 miles.  
</P>
<P>
 Bown said that in some areas the Egyptians tried to join flagstones that had 
similar shapes so that they fitted neatly, but that in other areas "they just 
jumbled them together." Nonetheless, he added, "it's very clearly engineered." 
Ancient Highway 
</P>
<P>
 The world's oldest paved road, an eight-mile stretch built 4,600 years ago, 
has been discovered in the Egyptian desert. It linked a quarry to waterways 
that carried basalt to the Nile River.

FIRST DAUGHTERS RECALL PAIN AND PRIVILEGES OF WHITE HOUSE LIFE; PRESIDENCY: 
THEY TELL OF SPECIAL TREATMENT, AS WELL AS THE GLARE OF PUBLIC ATTENTION AND 
CRITICISM OF THEIR FATHERS.

 Luci Baines Johnson remembers going to sleep to the echoes of protesters 
outside the White House yelling "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many boys did you kill 
today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Hoover Brigham, granddaughter of President Herbert Hoover, recalls a 
time during the Great Depression when the mother of a childhood friend forbade 
them to play together. "She's responsible for your father losing his job," 
Brigham remembers the woman telling her friend. At an unusual gathering Friday 
at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, women who grew up in the White House 
talked about how the experience was a decidedly mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ford Bales, for example, got to have her senior prom at the White House. 
And Johnson's marriage was the first White House wedding in 50 years, one that 
was celebrated on the cover of Life magazine and beamed to every household in 
the country.  
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson also recalled when a Secret Service agent yanked her out of her 
high school Spanish class after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew right at that moment that my life would never be the same, and it 
wasn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former First Lady Nancy Reagan introduced the panel, saying that each woman 
would bring a "human dimension to the presidential events of the last six 
decades." This history, she said, was "too important to leave to the 
historians."  
</P>
<P>
 Bales remembered being the first person to throw a Frisbee on the Great Wall 
of China (with cartoonist Garry Trudeau), and shaking hands with Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung, whom she remembers as overly forward toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bales and Johnson were both teen-agers and shared the discomfort of spending 
their formative years in what they called the nation's big glass house or the 
nation's fishbowl. Bales said there were wonderful benefits to being the 
daughter of the President, including getting to meet celebrities and getting 
VIP treatment at rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved Rod Stewart and was ecstatic when I got to go backstage," she said. 
"The flip side of that was that the tabloids were reporting a week later that I 
was engaged to Rod Stewart." 
</P>
<P>
 Bales and Johnson recalled going on dates while being shadowed by Secret 
Service agents and having their personal lives reported on in the press. But 
Hoover, who lived at the White House from age 3 to 6, said she had only nannies 
keeping her in line.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Later on we did get driven to school by the Secret Service," she said. 
"I remember they had a big blue roadster with a rumble seat, and if we were 
good they'd let us sit back there." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Reagan, who was grown and married when her father took office, said 
her memories centered on the White House. "I don't think there is a warmer or 
more hospitable place," she said. "I was always aware that our time there was 
finite, and I felt privileged. When it came time to leave, I cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people who came to hear the discussion seemed impressed by this 
insider's view of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was magnificent," said Vee Rosevear of Modesto, who came with her 
husband to hear the talk. "I found myself in tears more than a couple of times. 
. . . It really shows the personal side of things, to see the humanity of these 
people we read about." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the intent of a new exhibit at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Norton Smith, library director, said the event and the exhibit were 
ways to bring history alive. He said the shared experiences of the women on the 
panel and the more than 40 First Ladies featured in the exhibit transcend 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a special relationship that binds them all together," he said.

DOW DONATES LAND TO CONSERVANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 113-acre parcel of land, located in the Santa Ana Mountains of southern 
Riverside County and owned by the Dow Chemical Co., has been donated to the 
Nature Conservancy of California for management as a wildlife preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, in an area zoned for estate-size residential development and valued 
at about $1 million, will serve as a wildlife "steppingstone" linking the 
7,000-acre Santa Rosa Plateau wildlife preserve near Temecula and the Cleveland 
National Forest to the west, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exceedingly valuable land that is beyond our reach for purchase," 
said Steve McCormick, executive director of the Nature Conservancy, which 
assists in the acquisition of private land for the protection of wildlife and 
plant habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly transferred Dow land is mostly grasslands with stands of Engelmann 
oaks, a threatened species once prevalent throughout coastal Southern 
California.

UC SALE OF REDWOOD LAND TO TIMBER FIRM CANCELED; ENVIRONMENT: PURCHASE IS 
REJECTED AFTER FUROR OVER THE FATE OF ANCIENT TREES. OFFICIALS HOPE 
PRESERVATION GROUP WILL BUY THE PROPERTY, PROVIDING MONEY TO EASE BUDGET 
PROBLEMS.

<P>
 University of California President Jack W. Peltason announced Friday that he 
is canceling the sale of a grove of ancient redwoods near Santa Cruz after 
reports of the sale prompted an outcry by alumni, students, faculty, neighbors 
and political officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have taken the unusual step of rejecting all bids which have been received 
for a 410-acre tract of forest and pasture which contains old-growth redwoods," 
Peltason said. "The university again will pursue discussions with parties 
willing to purchase the real estate and donate it to a public use." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the university tentatively agreed to sell the land to the Eel River 
Saw Mills of Humboldt County for $2.38 million. University officials said the 
money would be used for student aid and help ease the school's budget crisis. 
The university hopes to sell the property to a preservation group and use the 
proceeds for student assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Pister, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, said he urged Peltason to take the 
action after a barrage of calls, letters and electronic messages protested the 
sale of land that contains a stand of 1,000-year-old trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got E-mail from Colorado," Pister said. "I got telephone calls and letters. 
We raised the panic button for a lot of people, and I'm glad we could take the 
pressure off that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pister said he hoped protesters understand the pressure the 
university has been under to find new sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pounding on us to find resources to keep the university running 
and to keep this place financially accessible to the students of California," 
he said. "We were caught in a dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
 Pister said the land was put out for bid only after unsuccessful efforts last 
year to find a buyer who would preserve the property, half of which was deeded 
to the university in 1942 and the rest of which was purchased in 1952. Pister 
said the school decided to dispose of the land after determining it no longer 
had any "programmatic" use. The school had operated a campground on it from 
1967 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the standpoint of the university, it had become surplus property," 
Pister said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to about 38 acres of old-growth redwoods, the land has younger 
redwoods, Douglas fir, oaks, meadows and grasslands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Grover, a representative of Eel River Saw Mills said Friday that the 
firm did not plan to contest the university's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Pister said that in looking for a new buyer, the university would ask for at 
least $2 million, the minimum price stipulated in its original request for 
bids. He noted that the San Francisco-based Save the Redwoods League had bid 
$2.1 million, and said he hoped the nonprofit organization remained interested 
in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll sell it if it's not in the neighborhood of the offer we 
got before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dewitt, executive director of Save the Redwoods, said he was elated by 
the university's change of heart and indicated that his organization still was 
interested in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league would be pleased to talk to the university about the future of the 
property if the university so desires," Dewitt said.

SEISMIC GRANTS UP TO $5,000 TO BE OFFERED TO QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disaster officials announced Friday that they will send out 250,000 letters 
next week offering up to $5,000 in earthquake retrofitting funds to homeowners 
who file applications for less than $10,000 in federal assistance to repair 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of retrofitting that would qualify for the additional federal grants 
includes bolting houses to foundations, strapping water heaters to walls, and 
bracing chimneys, cripple walls or mobile homes, according to state and federal 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay a set amount -- such as $50 
to strap water heaters -- for each specific retrofitting operation, with the 
maximum grant of $5,000 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of Emergency 
Services, and John W. Eldridge Jr., a federal hazard mitigation officer, made 
it clear that the retrofitting money would go only to those who apply for 
earthquake repair assistance. The deadline for applications has been extended 
to July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews and Eldridge disclosed the plans at a news conference concluding a 
two-day workshop in Pasadena sponsored by FEMA and the Office of Emergency 
Services. About 100 local and state officials gathered to discuss what 
additional steps need to be taken to guard to the maximum extent from future 
quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea broached during the discussions was the possibility of mandatory 
strengthening of all private homes in seismically risky areas.  
</P>
<P>
 But this was dismissed as being politically infeasible. L. Thomas Tobin, 
executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission, noted that a 
mandatory residential retrofitting bill won legislative approval in 1990 but 
was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin said no such proposal is being considered and that although the state 
recommends retrofitting, it remains up to homeowners whether to undertake it. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews and Eldridge said the letter to go out next week will contain a 
brochure outlining the kinds of retrofitting that might be advisable at the 
time earthquake repairs are performed.  
</P>
<P>
 They added that the federal Small Business Administration will also encourage 
retrofitting by adding up to 20% to loan amounts for those applying for 
assistance of more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to recommend a number of amendments to the state's existing hazard 
mitigation plan based on the ongoing studies of the Northridge quake," Eldridge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, broken sprinkler pipes caused by the earthquake led to 
flooding that severely damaged many offices. "A small fix could have prevented 
a serious loss," he said, "so that should be part of the new plan."

<P>
 A group of UC Santa Barbara students ended a nine-day hunger strike Friday 
after administrators pledged to improve the campus's Chicano studies 
department, one of the oldest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued to protesters, administration officials agreed to double 
the faculty assigned to the department by 1997, and to put a proposal for a 
Ph.D. program on a "fast track."The department now has the equivalent of 3.5 
full-time faculty positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus administrators also said they will renew efforts to fund a community 
center in the nearby Isla Vista area, and attempt to increase by 20% annually 
recruitment of Latino students from Santa Barbara County and three contiguous 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, the campus will discontinue serving grapes at its dining 
units in observance of a United Farm Workers boycott.

2 SECURITY GUARDS SHOT TO DEATH IN SEPARATE INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two security guards, one of whom was unarmed, were fatally shot within 24 
hours in separate attacks that security firm owners say underline the dangerous 
nature of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent killing, at a Stuart Anderson's Black Angus restaurant in 
Burbank early Friday, a man walked up to security guard Walter H. Thomas III, 
who was patrolling the parking lot, and fired several times, hitting Thomas at 
least twice, witnesses and Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, Eddy Sanchez, 32, was shot during a struggle with bank robbers 
at Hanmi Bank near 1st Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two or three incidents like this is highly unusual, especially in such a 
short period of time," said Thomas Wathen, chairman of Van Nuys-based Pinkerton 
Security and Investigations. "But the more security guards there are out there, 
the more likely it is to happen. It's very dangerous out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, the shooting of the unarmed guard was preceded by at least two 
fights and three arrests during a night in which patrons crowded into the 
restaurant's bar for $2 shots of tequila and beer, police and employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 After one of the brawls, police arrested three men who were still in custody 
when the security guard was gunned down, Burbank Police Sgt. Scott Wilson said. 
But employees said Friday that friends of the men had threatened them after the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'We're gonna get you,' " said one of the employees, all of whom 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's manager and officials of the restaurant chain declined to 
comment about the shooting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other slaying, Sanchez apparently did not immediately realize that the 
bank was being robbed when three men entered the building about 11 a.m., said 
Lt. Ken Lady of the Los Angeles Police Department robbery-homicide division. 
When he did, police said, Sanchez approached two of the men and was struggling 
with them when a gun went off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez was armed, but did not draw his weapon, police said. After the 
shooting and robbery, the three men ran out of the bank and escaped, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank employs two guards. The other guard, who is Sanchez's cousin, had 
gone on a break moments before the robbery, Lady said. Sanchez's security firm, 
API Security, did not return phone calls seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards have the sixth-riskiest job in the country, with a homicide 
rate of 3.6 per 100,000, according to a National Institute of Occupational 
Health and Safety study done earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job is extremely dangerous, probably more dangerous than being a police 
officer because of lack of backups, lack of equipment and lack of training," 
said Walter Cranston, owner and operator of Cranston Security Services in North 
Hollywood. "Armed or unarmed, it's not going to make a difference," Cranston 
said. "The state training is minimal. It's next to nothing. (The guards) are 
not mentally prepared to deal with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Angus, a popular watering hole on 1st Street in downtown Burbank, 
had hired an outside security firm to police the parking lot and agreed to 
discontinue its heavily attended $1 drink nights when Burbank police and 
Alcohol Beverage Control officials complained about frequent fights at the 
club, said ABC district administrator Jim Smith.

$9 MILLION SETTLES SUIT OVER DESERT PROJECT; MAY TOUCH O.C. FIRM; COURTS: THE 
DEAL INVOLVES ALLEGATIONS OF FLAWED CONSTRUCTION AT A 960-UNIT GOLF RESORT 
CONDOMINIUM. ONE BUILDER DID NOT SETTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of a golf resort condominium development in Palm Desert settled a 
construction defect suit for $9 million Friday -- much of it reportedly coming 
from a major Orange County builder's liability insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement agreement prohibits either side from revealing the developer's 
name, but the lawsuit that started the lengthy negotiating process was filed in 
Riverside Superior Court in 1991 against Newport Beach-based Presley Cos. and 
several affiliated companies and partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, by the homeowners association at the 960-unit Palm Desert Resorter 
complex, identified Presley Cos. and its Presley of Southern California 
subsidiary as principal members of the partnership that planned and developed 
the 18-hole golf course and the surrounding condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Presley were not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was signed Friday by the project's developer and two of three 
general contractors that built homes in the complex, said attorney Thomas E. 
Miller, who represented the homeowner association. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that the agreement calls for the insurance companies for the 
developer, its partners and two of three general contractors who built homes in 
the resort complex to pay $7 million to the homeowner association. An 
additional $2 million is to come from insurance companies representing a 
variety of subcontractors, architects, engineers and materials suppliers 
involved in the project, which was built during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The third general contractor, Affiliated Construction Co. in Palm Desert, did 
not sign the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said trial on a suit seeking more than $12 million in damages from 
Affiliated Construction has been scheduled for July 5. Affiliated built the 
first 512 units in the resort complex, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Affiliated Construction, president Richard R. Oliphant said he was not able 
to comment because of "a gag order." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliphant also was listed in the 1991 suit as a partner in the development 
partnership Presley formed to oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has offices in Irvine, Los Angeles and several other Southern 
California cities, is one of the attorneys who pioneered the field of 
construction defect law in the late 1970s in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not confirm that Presley signed the settlement. He cited the 
confidentiality agreement in the settlement in declining comment on the suit he 
filed against Presley and others nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller did say, however, that the suit had been scheduled for trial this 
summer and that the court appointed Judicial Arbitrator Mediation Services 
Inc., of Orange, to mediate the case in an effort to arrive at a pretrial 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The private arbitration service got the case in October and helped hammer out 
the settlement, Miller said.

MICROSOFT FOUNDERS INVEST IN FIRM SEEKING AIDS CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founders of Microsoft Corp., 
have invested $10 million in a company that will use computers to find 
treatments for AIDS and cancer, officials at the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin Molecular Corp. said the investment by the two software tycoons is the 
start of a major fund-raising effort for the biotechnology concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment represents the second major project on which Gates and Allen 
have joined forces this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In March they each invested $10 million in a Mobile Telecommunications 
Technologies Corp. project to develop a nationwide two-way personal 
communication system. Microsoft contributed an additional $30 million to that 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 While Allen stepped down from any daily role at Microsoft in 1983 after he was 
diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, he has been extremely active in recent months 
with his own portfolio of companies, focusing heavily on applications for the 
information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology firm, based in suburban Bothell, Wash., said it plans to 
develop treatments for AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis through computer 
analysis of DNA sequence information, said Mark Pearson, president and chief 
executive officer of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said Darwin was founded in 1992 with $2.8 million in seed money and is 
now in a second phase of private financing. He declined to say how much money 
the company hopes to raise.  
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said Gates and Allen were attracted to the biotechnology company 
through several personal connections, including work in molecular evolution 
done by Dr. Leroy Hood, a professor at the University of Washington who holds a 
chair endowed by Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also is a director of ICOS Corp., another Bothell-based biotechnology 
company whose chairman, George Rathmann, is a founder and director of Darwin.

GOURMET BREWS; SPECIALTY COFFEE HAS BECOME A HOT COMMODITY IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans are thirsty for a really good cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, more consumers are sipping gourmet coffee made from 
specialty beans from boutique roasters and paying a hefty premium, industry 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has opened doors for companies like mine . . . to satisfy consumers who 
want to have a good cup of coffee," said Phil Johnson, president of Millstone 
Coffee Inc., a privately owned coffee roaster in Everett, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Seattle-based Starbucks Corp., whose gourmet coffee cafes are perking 
up across the country, many small roasters sell beans to consumers, but not a 
cup of java. 
</P>
<P>
 Those that do sell coffee by the cup, like Heritage Coffee Co., a roaster / 
retailer in Juneau, Alaska, tend to be regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Pacific Northwest, where some 50% of the coffee sold is gourmet, 
consumers in other parts of the country tend to buy virtually all of their 
coffee in large cans of well-known brands sold in supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the gourmet coffee craze mounts, experts say specialty beans will be 
available in everything from convenience stores to grocery stores, some of 
which will feature do-it-yourself mini-roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in sunny Orange County, coffee is a hot commodity.  
</P>
<P>
 DiedrichsCoffee, a family-owned coffee roaster and retailer in Costa Mesa, has 
seven gourmet coffee cafe locations in the county and plans for more. Despite 
the competition from other gourmet coffee retailers, Diedrichs has done well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first coffee roasters in Orange County. It runs in our veins," 
said Martin Diedrich, 35, son of company founder Carl Diedrich. "The quality of 
our coffee, the friendliness and experience of our staff, are all responsible 
for our success." 
</P>
<P>
 He questioned whether some of the entrepreneurs recently entering the coffee 
business have the experience and preparation necessary to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this coffee craze and it reminds me of a gold rush. But to be a 
gold digger is hard work, and people don't realize that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another local coffee roaster, Alta Coffee Warehouse & Roasting Co. in Newport 
Beach, is also busy with plans to market its specialty roasted coffee to 
retailers and restaurants throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also got tentative plans to open another coffeehouse in the Newport 
Beach area," said owner Steve Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, given the anticipated growth, the gourmet coffee industry will not be 
spared taking a lump or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a considerable amount of consolidation in the industry," said 
Grady Saunders, president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America and 
president of Heritage Coffee. "Companies will merge and companies will be 
bought," he told an industry discussion group this week. 
</P>
<P>
 If local roasters' share of the $5-billion U.S. coffee market reaches a 
critical mass where major brands start feeling the pinch, the big companies are 
likely to respond aggressively with new products and potentially lower prices, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the winners from the company standpoint in the (gourmet) category 
will be those who stick with the quality they started with and not be overly 
tainted by any pricing factors that come into the market," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 But if more consumers develop a taste for naturally decaffeinated 
hazelnut-flavored coffee from hand-picked Arabica beans, will there be enough 
to go around? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nugent, a senior vice president at DeanWitter who specializes in gourmet 
coffee, said roasters will have to integrate vertically, making investments in 
coffee plantations and mills, to insure a source of supply. 
</P>
<P>
 If demand for gourmet coffee continues to grow, experts say, the beneficiaries 
will be the producers, who have seen prices drop recently to near historic 
lows. Quest for the Best Americans have discovered high-quality coffee and are 
consuming more every year. U.S. retail sales trend: Java Consumption 1979:

BRIEFLY: CURRENCY TRADER TOLD TO SELL ASSETS TO REPAY INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Huntington Beach man has been ordered to sell off numerous assets -- 
including property, a boat and two life insurance policies -- to help reimburse 
investors who pumped nearly $11.1 million into his defunct currency trading 
business from 1990 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about $3 million has been recovered so far, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final judgment issued April 25, a federal judge in Los Angeles noted that 
Roger C. Briggs and a Northern California associate, William L. Telander, 
former operators of Southwest International Exchange in Huntington Beach, 
diverted much of the company money to personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 They had promised investors returns of 25% to 48% a year from their foreign 
currency trading activities, but actually used funds from their newer investors 
to make alleged interest payments to the earliest investors, said Sandra J. 
Harris, assistant regional director of enforcement for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The final judgment orders Briggs to pay $1.4 million, but acknowledges that he 
is unlikely to be able to raise that amount in the sale of his assets and says 
he will not be responsible for the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Telander was not ordered to make a repayment, Harris said, because he is 
expected to be ordered to make restitution when sentenced in a related criminal 
case in which he has pleaded guilty to felony fraud charges. No criminal 
charges were filed against Briggs.

 Safety Components International, an automotive air-bag maker, raised $13.2 
million Friday in an initial public offering that had investors bidding up the 
price much of the day before cooling a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot stock, which trades on the Nasdaq electronic system, rose almost 23% 
in value from its $10 offering price before settling down to close at $11.625 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Components is a spinoff of Valentec International Corp., a Costa Mesa 
company that remains the majority owner with 2.3 million of the new company's 
3.9 million shares. If it holds, Friday's price run-up added $4.2 million to 
the value of Valentec's stake in its subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with they way it went," said W. Hardy Myers, chief financial 
officer of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Components was formed by combining Valentec's auto air-bag unit and a 
small metal fabrication subsidiary in Ohio. The new company said in its 
prospectus that it intends to use proceeds from the stock sale to pay down the 
bulk of its debt and increase manufacturing capacity to handle anticipated 
growth in the air-bag market. 
</P>
<P>
 The company makes more than 2 million air bags a year and estimates that its 
production could double by 1997. It employs about 550 people at factories in 
Mexico and Europe and at a small fabric-cutting facility near its Costa Mesa 
headquarters. Its air bags are used in systems that TRW markets to Ford and its 
Lincoln-Mercury division and to Toyota and Mazda in Japan and Mercedes Benz, 
BMW, Audi and Volkswagen in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Safety Components been a separate business in the final quarter of 1993, 
it would have posted a $146,000 profit on revenue of $6 million, compared to an 
$356,000 loss on sales of $2.2 million in the last three months of 1992, 
according to the company's prospectus. 
</P>
<P>
 While air bags are mandatory for most cars in the United States, they are an 
extra-cost option in Europe and Asia. Competitive pressures, however, have made 
the safety device a popular item overseas, and car companies in those countries 
are increasing their orders for air-bag systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor reaction to Friday's public offering showed there is strong faith in 
the future of the air-bag market and that, in turn, signals a renewed faith in 
the economic recovery that must occur to spur worldwide production of the autos 
that use air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Components is one of several vendors supplying air bags to TRW Vehicle 
Safety Systems Inc., which is one of the world's major manufacturers of 
completed air-bag systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampshire Securities Corp. in New York, as underwriter for the offering, 
guaranteed the sale of the stock. It holds a 30-day option to buy up to 240,000 
additional Safety Components shares, 160,000 from the company and 80,000 from 
Valentec.

BRIEFLY: PRUDENTIAL LAYS OFF 57

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prudential Home Mortgage Co., facing a slower market for its fixed-rate loans 
with the recent rise in interest rates, laid off 57 workers at its loan 
processing center here this week as part of a 12% reduction in staff 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs at the Costa Mesa facility, one of the company's four loan 
processing centers across the nation, cut Prudential's staff here to 205, a 
spokesman for the Clayton, Mo., lender said. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs, announced Thursday, came with four weeks notice and a severance 
package that includes health-care benefits, outplacement help and continuation 
of other benefits for limited periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Home Mortgage, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. in Newark, 
N.J., said earlier this week that it would lay off a total of 600 workers 
systemwide.

O.C. EARNINGS: CARELINE INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine-based ambulance services company had a first-quarter profit of 
$865,000, or 6 cents per share, on revenue of $19.86 million.This was up from 
net income of $173,000, or 2 cents per share, on revenue of $4.33 million the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is largely attributable to the nine acquisitions the company 
completed before the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 CareLine, which went public in December, recently announced plans to acquire 
several competitors -- two in Philadelphia and one in Texas -- in deals that 
would make it the nation's second largest emergency medical services provider, 
transporting more than 750,000 patients annually and employing more than 3,000 
workers.

O.C. EARNINGS: CAM DATA SYSTEMS REPORTS DROP IN 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CAM Data Systems Inc. said its second-quarter profit declined 70% to $52,000, 
or 3 cents a share, from $177,000, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.Revenue 
for the period ended March 31 was $3.2 million, up 3.2% from $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a manufacturer of point-of-sale and inventory management systems 
for small- and medium-sized retailers and wholesalers, said the earnings 
decline was related to increased research and the costs of restructuring a 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of its fiscal 1994, CAM Data reported a $155,000 profit, or 
8 cents a share, down 44% from $278,000, or 14 cents a share. Revenue climbed 
12%, however, to a record $6.4 million from $5.7 million a year earlier.

UNDERWEAR FIRM BETTING ON THE POWER OF INTERNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you get pants onto a twentysomething? The Internet, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Joe Boxer's new ad strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 On bus shelter posters and billboards in California, the designer underwear 
maker features a torso-down picture of a model wearing bright yellow boxer 
shorts painted with a happy face. 
</P>
<P>
 After its slogan, where one might expect to find an address, phone number or 
store name, there's only: "Contact us in underwear cyberspace; Internet! 
joeboxer@jboxer.com" 
</P>
<P>
 Cryptic to many, perhaps, but not to the plugged-in. 
</P>
<P>
 The young and computer savvy are prime customers for Joe Boxer Inc., a 
privately held San Francisco company known for wild designs and wilder 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Its executives figured that electronic mail would be a hip way to stay in 
touch with them. 
</P>
<P>
 So, a few months ago, Joe Boxer gave up its toll-free phone line for an 
address on the Internet, the worldwide network of private, public and academic 
computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The number had been used to direct people to stores that sell Joe Boxer 
boxers. But e-mail has given the company more contact with the customers who 
use it. About 15 to 20 messages arrive a day and each gets an individual 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens up one-on-one communication. Rather than calling an 800 number and 
getting an operator who just has some information, they get the Joe Boxer 
culture -- really wacky and really real," said Tessa Graham, the company's 
international coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we can have real communication with our customers," she said. "They 
can directly ask us the specific question they want to ask. And it lets us find 
out who these people who love our underwear are." 
</P>
<P>
 There's more and more commerce on the Internet. Many computer companies have 
e-mail access to their customers and more non-technical businesses are entering 
the electronic arena. 
</P>
<P>
 One, The Internet Mall, offers everything from books to flowers. But for most, 
e-mail is only an adjunct to more traditional marketing and service. Joe Boxer 
seems to be one of the first non-technical companies to make e-mail its primary 
method for talking to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been using the e-mail address since February. The ads began 
last month in San Francisco and Los Angeles and appeared in Details magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very smart campaign," said John Hoag, director of marketing at 
BARRNet, an Internet service provider in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having an e-mail address is becoming as important in business as having a 
telephone number. There are 20 million people on the Internet. We'll definitely 
be seeing more of this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages Joe Boxer gets range from perky to risque. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a student at Brandeis University," one man wrote. "I used your campaign 
for a paper I had to write about advertising. I got an A and to celebrate my 
girlfriend bought me a pair of the (Nose Not Included) boxers."

 Supermarket shoppers may soon tally up their own groceries electronically as 
they wheel through store aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at this week's supermarket industry expo got a preview of "portable 
personal shoppers." The scanning device lets shoppers record the price of each 
item as it is taken from the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers first register their bank account numbers, then keep a running total 
of purchases and generate their own register receipts. A cashier does a visual 
check of the tallied purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shopping cart was radical and revolutionary when it was introduced in 
1936," said an industry consultant. "This is the logical evolution of 
self-service."

OFFSPRING: ON THE VERGE OF FULL-GROWN SUCCESS; POP MUSIC: THE OUTLOOK'S BRIGHT 
FOR THE O.C. PUNKS, WHOSE SINGLE 'COME OUT AND PLAY' IS GETTING TONS OF AIRPLAY 
AND WHOSE RECORD SALES ARE ZOOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As 1994 began, the Offspring were just another obscure punk band hoping they 
could make it to the next gig without a mechanical breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus motor would seize up on the road to Bakersfield. The transmission 
would give out en route to Arizona. When they finally got the engine rebuilt, 
the four band members drove across country on a winter tour, shivering all the 
way because they couldn't get the heater to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful, but it would cost too much to fix it," said drummer Ron Welty. 
"We were punk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 With its school bus body still bearing the green paint job and Holiday Inn 
logo from its previous incarnation as a hotel shuttle, the Offspring's chariot 
now sits ready in a cul-de-sac in a peaceful suburban subdivision. This time it 
has to be in good working order: Suddenly, the Offspring appear to be going 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, alternative-rock station KROQ put the band's song "Come Out 
and Play" into regular rotation, playing it every three or four hours. That 
rare break for a punk band on a small, independent label already is having a 
ripple effect. Following KROQ's lead, stations around the country are picking 
up on this insinuating, deftly constructed track. The Offspring's fortunes had 
been on the rise even before "Come Out and Play" started generating numerous 
request calls from KROQ listeners. While band members Welty, Bryan Holland, 
Greg Kriesel and Kevin Wasserman were trying to stay warm on their bus last 
winter, sales of their 1992 release, "Ignition," were heating up. The 
Offspring's label, Epitaph Records, had managed to place several songs from the 
album with producers who make action videos for fans of surfing, snowboarding 
and skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff was almost immediate. According to Holland, the band's singer and 
songwriter, in a matter of four months sales shot from 16,000 to 46,000 -- an 
impressive total for an independent punk release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were selling to the punkers, and we hit this group of people we didn't 
know existed," Holland said. "They're real enthusiastic, and there's tons of 
them. It's a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one drawback as the Offspring began delving into 
surf-skate-snowboard culture: Newly introduced to the sport, Welty broke his 
right arm about a month ago on a snowboarding run at Big Bear. He was punk 
about it, though: When the Offspring were flown to Valdez, Alaska, recently to 
play at a snowboarding convention, Welty, who couldn't hold a stick, kept the 
beat by attaching one to his cast. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Smash," the band's third album, came out in mid-April, there was a 
substantial corps of new fans waiting for it. Andy Kaulkin, Epitaph's marketing 
director, says 75,000 copies have been shipped to stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The label, which has been hailed for its ability to top the 100,000 sales mark 
with hard-core faves Bad Religion and Pennywise, smells the possibility of a 
hit that could cross over to the much larger alternative crowd (as always, MTV 
will be the final arbiter of that). Billboard's "Heatseekers" chart, which maps 
the progress of new and developing artists, pegged "Smash" as the 
hottest-selling record in that category in the Pacific region last week and 
placed it at No. 16 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Major labels are already sniffing around, as they have been wont to do with 
promising indie bands since Nirvana showed how lucrative a melodic, 
punk-leaning sound could be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring don't seem to be letting any of this go to their heads. Sitting 
around a table last weekend in the pleasant, walled-in back yard of the home 
where bassist Kriesel grew up, they came off as a relaxed, down-to-earth, 
good-natured bunch who are eager to see what happens next but have no great 
hankering for rock stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in obscurity for most of their 10-year existence, the Offspring 
see a touch of absurdity in their suddenly unfolding success. Wasserman was 
nonplussed after Holland finished quoting the band's KROQ airplay statistics: 
"A tinny little punk band from O.C.?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring seem an unlikely bunch to be playing punk rock, let alone making 
a success of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With his long, blond hair and pink and dimpled cheeks, Holland looks more like 
a candidate to play John Boy in a remake of "The Waltons" than somebody you'd 
expect to see howling above a teeming mosh pit. At 28, he is a doctoral 
candidate in microbiology at USC, but if he ever went back to the band's common 
alma mater, Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, the cherubic rocker would 
probably be asked to produce a hall pass. He uses "Dexter" as his stage name: 
"I thought 'Dexter' was cool, because it's geeky," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead guitarist Wasserman, 31, wears eyeglasses with thick frames, and his hair 
falls far down his back -- two things he has in common with that bona fide 
geek, Garth of "Wayne's World" fame. Drummer Welty is 23 and boyish despite his 
Vandyke beard. Kriesel, 29, has intense, deep-set eyes and a clipped haircut, 
making him the only member who looks the punker type. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Offspring's punk roots run deep, and are largely home-grown. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, when an older brother brought home some early Orange County 
punk records, Holland was smitten by the melodic sound of such bands as Agent 
Orange, the Adolescents and T.S.O.L. Kriesel, his buddy from the school 
cross-country team, soon came to share his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Killing time one night in 1984 after failing to get into a sold-out Social 
Distortion concert at UC Irvine, the two decided to take up instruments and 
start their own band. They called it Manic Subsidal, then changed the name to 
the Offspring when they got nothing but blank looks ("Manic Sub-what?") from 
the few folks who even took notice. Wasserman joined in 1985, and Welty, all of 
16 at the time, took over on drums in 1987. The other members had to get his 
grandmother's permission before they could take him on road trips. 
</P>
<P>
 For its first album, in 1990, the band sought out producer Thom Wilson, 
wanting to work with the man who had overseen favorite recordings by the 
Adolescents, T.S.O.L., the Vandals and Dead Kennedys. By then, Wilson was 
making his living as an audio engineer for network television shows and hadn't 
produced a punk record in years. But he was flattered that the Offspring were 
fans of his work, and he saw possibilities in the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very raw, but they had a real spark of promise that I recognized 
immediately," Wilson said from his home near Santa Cruz. "I liked the way they 
phrased things, the germ ideas of songs." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, Holland had learned to craft catchy, sing-along chorus melodies for 
songs that typically offer acerbic but alert commentaries on everything from 
geopolitics to relationship pitfalls to the difficulty of remaining an 
individual in a world that rewards conformity. After striking out in efforts to 
land a record deal, the band caught the ear of Bad Religion guitarist Brett 
Gurewitz, who signed them to his label, Epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of "Ignition" rose above standard hard-core pummeling. With 
"Smash," the Offspring have come into their own with a full album's worth of 
solid songs. Many of the tracks feature not just one good musical hook but 
several, and Holland carries them with an interesting voice, part reedy and 
part chesty, that calls to mind a less bleaty Ozzy Osbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to work with producer Wilson on all three albums, the Offspring 
learned to arrange their material in a way that seduces as well as it hammers; 
the band can deliver an aural bludgeoning when it counts but also can hold and 
surprise the listener with a progression of musical ideas. "Come Out and Play" 
is an especially strong example. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with a sparse, funky beat, then tosses in a catchy, quotable spoken 
tag line -- "you gotta keep 'em separated" -- that any rapper would love to 
have come up with. Next, the band uncoils a snaky, Arabic guitar figure 
inspired by Agent Orange by way of Dick Dale's "Misirlou." Then it gets into 
meaty rock guitar rhythms that recall the Kinks' "Destroyer." With all this 
going on, the lyrics are secondary, but they deliver a sardonic broadside 
against the idiocy of settling disputes with gunplay: 
</P>
<P>
 By the time you hear the siren, it's already too late.  
</P>
<P>
 One goes to the morgue, and the other to jail,  
</P>
<P>
 One guy's wasted, and the other's a waste.  
</P>
<P>
 With success looming, the Offspring are starting to make certain adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is preparing for a degree of backlash from those in the punk crowd 
who think any exposure beyond the hard-core clique amounts to betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's unique to punk," Holland said. "As soon as you get popular, there's a 
small part of the audience that will turn against you: 'Those guys are on KROQ 
now. I hate 'em.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting sales have allowed Welty to quit his job at a muffin shop and Kriesel 
to stop working as a printer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend and parents are actually excited now because they think I'm 
going to buy them things," Welty said. Wasserman, the head custodian at an 
elementary school, is taking a leave of absence. Like Welty, he has a young 
child to support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holland is the one left in something of a bind. The rock 'n' roll road 
beckons, but so do the viruses he is trying to clone in his doctoral research. 
</P>
<P>
 (It's a nice irony that one of the first Orange County punk songs widely heard 
on KROQ was "Amoeba," the 1980 Adolescents anthem in which a sentient microbe, 
symbolic of hounded punk youth, plots vengeance against the scientist who has 
been treating it as a worthless specimen. Now punk is mainstream and 
respectable, and the author and singer of the latest local punk hit is, in 
fact, a scientist who pokes around with microbes. Holland hopes his 
virus-cloning research will have applications in the treatment of genetic 
diseases.) 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said he called Greg Graffin, Bad Religion's singer, for advice on 
juggling punk rock and academia. Graffin is pursuing a doctorate in 
evolutionary biology at Cornell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to do both," Holland said. "He took a leave of absence. I don't 
think I could get away with it" because his studies require regular laboratory 
work. "If it comes down to it, I'm going to quit school, because I don't want 
to pass up what's happening now."

POP BEAT: SOLO'S FINE FOR KRISTIN HERSH, BUT SHE LIKES HAVING MUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristin Hersh has made one of the year's most acclaimed acoustic albums, but 
don't expect the 27-year-old singer and songwriter to exchange her band -- 
Throwing Muses -- for an unplugged solo career. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark-haired mother of two shudders at the idea of becoming an acoustic pop 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do appreciate this (attention), but the band is home to me," she says. "I 
like the smell of stale beer and cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat, often jocular Hersh has garnered respect from rock's underground 
since the early '80s through Throwing Muses' surreal pop sound. On her own in 
the acoustic "Hips and Makers," her first step outside the Muses, she exposes 
her raw talent in spare numbers with little ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are nevertheless intense, with Hersh's throaty-then-airy voice 
dipping in and out of the unassuming guitar work. Her lyrics often are biting 
and painful, with sarcasm hidden in seemingly sweet moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which features R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe on one track, is being 
supported with a solo tour that includes stops tonight and Monday at the Roxy 
and Sunday at McCabe's, following a scheduled show on Friday at the Coach House 
in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mean for it to be a solo album," says Hersh, who recorded it in a 
horse barn down the street from her home in Newport, R.I. It was done in three 
days with producer Lenny Kaye, guitarist with the groundbreaking Patti Smith 
Group in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to record the songs I'd written after falling in love with the 
acoustic guitar on the road with the Muses," she continues. "I would bring it 
to my hotel room every night and play. The simplicity and physicality of that 
instrument invited very intimate, small and gutsy songs, which I was really 
attracted to. But as far as I knew, people at large only listened to big, 
glossy pop music. This was little, raw and weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking her new material on the road without the comfort of a full band proved 
unnerving for Hersh at first. "I was terrified! The thought of having people 
sit and stare at me for an hour and a half sounded like a nightmare for them 
and me. So I would take out my contacts and get really drunk so I couldn't see 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten easier since I realized I'm not responsible for other people and 
equipment, and I just set a piece of wood in my lap and play. I'm not a 
performer with a capital P. I just adore the music." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hips and Makers" revolves around Hersh's personal life, and she "thought 
maybe it was inappropriate for publication because I don't believe in making 
music talk for you. It should be the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I could see my life picture splattered all over it. I had to take a giant 
step back and listen, and it didn't seem to suffer from my life being in it. It 
wasn't brought down by it and still seemed magic. Talk about your ego! I 
thought I was the only person with a dorky little life. Well, duh, it's 
universal!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was born in Georgia but grew up in Newport, R.I., where her hippie 
parents, both teachers, played Patti Smith, the Doors and Neil Young at home. 
"I didn't have to buy those albums, but did have to deal with the fact that 
they were actually cool even if my parents liked them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father taught her to play guitar at age 9 and by 14 she'd started Throwing 
Muses out of the local hard-core punk scene with her new stepsister Tanya 
Donelly, who left the Muses a few years back to form the band Belly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was placed in accelerated courses through high school and entered 
college early, but left after her junior year when she became pregnant. Around 
that time, the band became the first U.S. group to sign with Britain's 
eccentric 4AD label, which released the Muses' first two albums. The group 
switched to Sire Records around 1987 and since then has released five more 
albums. Hersh already has made most of the Muses album and plans another solo 
acoustic record. 
</P>
<P>
 Her upbeat persona seems the antithesis of the defeat that surfaces from time 
to time in her music. The contrast has spurred descriptions of Hersh that range 
from bubbly housewife to dark artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be called a perky housewife over suicidal poetess any time," she 
says forcefully. "I have bipolar disorder and am diagnosed as schizophrenic. A 
lot of people know it and use it to say I'm that kind of poet. I can't say 
enough that being sick is humiliating and has nothing to do with being a good 
poet or musician. 
</P>
<P>
 "So any time they want to call me a giddy housewife, it's just fine with me. 
I've never been anything but goofy." 
</P>
<P>

BURBANK-MANHATTAN SWITCHEROO; IT'S NO COASTING IN THE LATE-NIGHT BATTLE: 
LETTERMAN AND LENO GO ON THE ROAD, LOOKING TO BUILD UP AUDIENCE LOYALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle for late-night network television dominance intensifies during the 
next two weeks when David Letterman and Jay Leno invade each other's home 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, Letterman, the late-night leader since switching his New 
York-based series from NBC to CBS this season, will originate his show from Los 
Angeles for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, on May 16, the Burbank-based Leno will return the favor, pulling up 
stakes for a week and taking his NBC "Tonight Show" to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all, of course, part of the networks' May ratings sweeps hype, but there 
is something more involved here, as both Letterman and Leno acknowledged in 
interviews: 
</P>
<P>
 Both are disappointed with their ratings in the other guy's back yard, and 
they hope their forays help erase the home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 New York and Los Angeles are the nation's top two TV markets and thus are 
critical to the success of both Letterman and Leno, whom some industry 
observers believe benefit naturally from the community loyalty of their home 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The two comedians, while planning to switch coasts on the weekends before 
their sweeps excursions, have already made preliminary visits, shooting comedy 
sequences to beef up their shows -- indicating the competitive importance they 
attach to their trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the brief move West by Letterman and his staff, the late-night host 
cracked: "It's the largest civilian airlift in the history of aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the sweeps and promotion factors in the visit, he added: "We 
want to try to give our ratings in Los Angeles a shot in the arm. They've 
always been a little less than rewarding, from my point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people at CBS are doing their best to make us feel comfortable -- they 
want us to come back, like, every three or four months. They're hoping that we 
will establish this as our second home." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite CBS' refurbishing of the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York for the 
Letterman show, does that indicate that any thought has been given to an 
eventual move of his series to Los Angeles, the way Johnny Carson brought "The 
Tonight Show" West? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's active, no," says Letterman, who formerly owned a home 
here. "Who knows what the future holds? But I think for the time being, we've 
had such good luck in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny -- whenever I mention it in New York City that we'd be doing the 
shows in Los Angeles for a week, people start to boo. So you begin to think, 
gee, is this really a good idea?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, well-known for his on-the-road comedy gigs throughout the years -- which 
helped to build his popularity -- seems to like the idea of visits to other 
cities. What, specifically, does he think can help improve his ratings showing 
in New York? 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked New York because that's where 'The Tonight Show' originated," he 
says. "There's a lot of history with 'The Tonight Show,' and we should try to 
capitalize on that. If it works, we'd like to go to a lot of other cities as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno and "Tonight" caught some flak when their live show in Boston with the 
"Cheers" cast following the sitcom's finale got out of hand amid wild partying, 
but the comedian nonetheless maintains: "There was excitement, and people like 
to see you get out on the road and do something a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 Where else would he like to take "Tonight"? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Boston. I like Chicago. I like Detroit. I like Texas. You know, when I 
had Ann Richards, the governor of Texas, on, she said if I would bring the show 
to Austin (the state capital) for a week, she'd be my co-host and sit in every 
night and do the kind of Ed McMahon things. She sent me a letter confirming she 
would do it. I think it might be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, both Letterman and Leno have loaded up on guests they are 
counting on to boost their showings in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Los Angeles, Letterman's scheduled list includes Bette Midler, Billy 
Crystal, Magic Johnson, Michael Keaton, Elvis Costello and Ray Charles. In New 
York, Leno will count on such names as Bill Cosby, Michael J. Fox, Spike Lee, 
Farrah Fawcett, Sam Donaldson, Julio Iglesias and Cindy Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting the advance sequences for their visits proved instructive for the 
comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have done it without coming out there (to Los Angeles)," says 
Letterman, "but we wanted to make sure that the week we were in Los Angeles was 
loaded with special stuff. I mean, normally we don't have the luxury of that 
kind of production schedule. But we wanted it to be a little like our first 
week of shows, so we took the extra time." 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples? 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a day with Zsa Zsa Gabor going to fast-food places. Then we did 
various little location tours. We interviewed valet parking attendants. We went 
door to door taking a survey regarding our shows from California. We also spent 
the day with Florence Henderson." 
</P>
<P>
 And the differences in attitude toward his show in Los Angeles and New York? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's a little different," says Letterman, "because there's not so much 
very special about another TV show in Los Angeles. I mean, you're driving to 
work on the Ventura Freeway and you're stopped in traffic next to Jamie Farr. 
</P>
<P>
 "From an emotional standpoint, for us doing the show in California, we just 
feel like we just happen to be another project in production, whereas here in 
New York City -- despite the fact that there is a lot of television here now -- 
we kind of feel like, geez, we got this big theater, we got a show and I think 
that we all feel a synthetic sense of importance that you wouldn't get in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Letterman doesn't expect his show to project a different attitude 
in L.A. -- but Leno feels the opposite about doing his program in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," says Leno, "I think you do adjust the attitude of the show. I think we 
can be a little more, sort of, in-your-face. We shot a bunch of stuff in New 
York on the subway, on the streets. When you walk on the street in Los Angeles, 
you meet a guy and then 50 feet later you meet somebody else. In New York, it's 
somebody every six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite trailing in the ratings, Leno thinks his "Tonight Show" is "doing 
great. This has obviously been David's year, and it's a great success story. 
But I think also that when we went against the Olympics with their lead-in (for 
Letterman), we still only dropped to a 4.3 from a 4.6 or 4.7 (rating). That's 
pretty good. That shows you have a core of people staying with the show." 
</P>
<P>
 The Letterman-Leno battle to succeed Carson on "The Tonight Show" so 
captivated the American public that HBO is planning a film based on "The Late 
Shift," the book by New York Times reporter Bill Carter that chronicles the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman had been wooed by NBC to take over "Tonight" this year, even though 
Leno already had the job. And Leno calmly acknowledges NBC's interest in 
retaining Letterman: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the type of thing where, as I've said, no matter what happens, everybody 
walks away a millionaire. I mean, egos may get bruised, but this isn't Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Sizing up audience interest in the late-night story, Leno adds: "It's the 
classic struggle everyone's involved with. I mean, if you take David's 
situation -- underappreciated at NBC -- it's a wonderful story in that it 
translates into everybody's story of what they think their own life would be: 
Your boss doesn't appreciate you, you leave, your boss tries to keep you, you 
say no, you go across the street and you build a bigger business than your 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the kind of story I would make fun of, were I not directly 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno also speaks matter-of-factly about the decline of Arsenio Hall, who once 
threatened to kick the comedian's butt as a competitor but whose show now is 
going off the air May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both in the same business," says Leno. "It's still better for TV and 
the business to have him on than to have him off. I would much rather have 
Arsenio and David on than reruns of 'Night Court' and 'Roseanne' and all these 
sitcoms. I mean, if people would rather see a show they've seen 13 times than a 
brand-new show, how do you compete with that?"

FAYE SAVES HER VOICE FOR 'SUNSET'; MUSICAL: THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT DUNAWAY WAS 
OFFERED THE PART OF NORMA ANGERS SOME INVOLVED IN THE DEAL. NOW THE ACTRESS 
SAYS SHE'LL STAY QUIET UNTIL THE DETAILS ARE WORKED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faye Dunaway was doing a lot of singing Friday, but not much talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after she was offered the role of Norma Desmond for the Los Angeles 
production of "Sunset Boulevard" on Thursday, her manager Bob Palmer talked to 
the Associated Press and Dunaway called Variety columnist Army Archerd. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Brown, spokesman for producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, expressed 
anger that the news had been released before contract negotiations were 
completed. Lloyd Webber refused to comment on the offer, Brown said, because 
there was nothing to say until the deal is done, which is expected by all 
parties involved. That won't be until Monday, at the earliest, according to 
Dunaway's agent. On Friday, Palmer released a statement from the actress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love going back to the theater, this time with music -- a whole new 
dimension. But, while the details are being worked out, I want to stay as quiet 
as possible, stay in training and prepare for the work ahead. When I start 
talking I sometimes go to the point of exhaustion, and I mustn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the deal is completed, Dunaway will take over the role after Glenn 
Close leaves on June 26, although the exact date has not been determined. 
Dunaway is due to shoot the feature film "Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold" 
during the week preceding Close's departure, and, Palmer said, the film may 
require a few days of shooting in Mexico in July. An understudy would play 
Desmond after Close leaves when Dunaway is not available. Close is scheduled to 
do Desmond on Broadway beginning in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Dunaway is hard at work training her voice for the role. 
Vocal coach Bob Corff said he worked with Dunaway for an hour Friday morning 
and planned to begin training again at 6:30 p.m. in a session that would go on 
"until one of us falls over." 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Smith has been offered the co-starring role of Joe Gillis opposite 
Dunaway, after Alan Campbell -- the current Joe -- leaves with Close on June 
26. Campbell also is slated for Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, unlike Dunaway, has a track record as a singer. He recorded six albums 
for Columbia Records, won a Tony nomination for "The Pirates of Penzance" on 
Broadway and performed in a wide variety of other musicals on Broadway and 
national tours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunaway's only professional singing gig appears to have been the 1989 TV 
movie, "Cold Sassy Tree," in which she sat at a piano and sang ragtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway trained with two vocal coaches over two months as preparation for 
auditioning for the role of Norma. Her first audition, with producer/composer 
Lloyd Webber's musical supervisor David Caddick, was March 29. She sang for 
Lloyd Webber on Tuesday in a room at the Bel-Air Hotel; he called her Thursday 
to tell her she had the role. Among the other contenders who sang for Lloyd 
Webber last week were Rita Moreno and Diahann Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway's voice "has transformed in a short time," said Corff, who also 
trained Close, Campbell and the London cast's original Joe Gillis, Kevin 
Anderson, for the show. Dunaway has "a very rich, deep speaking voice" and 
began her lessons as an alto -- but "now she can sing the soprano parts too. 
I've seen her voice expand faster than anyone I've ever worked with." Asked 
about her sense of pitch, Corff said it's "good now, and improving." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the most amazing worker," Corff added, "with phenomenal focus and 
concentration. The harder we work, the stronger she gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway hasn't yet sung at the Shubert Theatre. Corff acknowledged the 
acoustical differences between a large theater and a studio or hotel room. But, 
with amplified sound systems, he added, "if you can sing, you can sing any 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate for people to think they're going to hear Kathleen Battle," said 
Palmer, Dunaway's manager and publicist. But he emphasized that Dunaway has 
"the dramatic quality and all the right instincts" as an actress. Dunaway is 
best known for her starring roles in the films "Bonnie and Clyde," "Chinatown" 
and "Mommie Dearest," and she recently starred in last fall's CBS-TV comedy 
series "It had to be You," which was canceled after just four episodes had 
aired. Probably her most prominent L.A. stage role was as Blanche DuBois in "A 
Streetcar Named Desire" at the Ahmanson Theatre in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 53, Dunaway will be slightly older than Norma's age in the script -- 
50. She's also older than her predecessors in the role -- Close, Patti LuPone 
and Betty Buckley in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other actresses who were rumored to be in the running to replace 
Close, besides Moreno and Carroll, were Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, Chita 
Rivera, Diana Ross and Raquel Welch. Most of them or their representatives 
denied they were angling for the role.

AL VIOLA FITS VOLUMES BETWEEN CAREER BOOKENDS; JAZZ: DECADES AFTER GAINING FAME 
WITH PAGE CAVANAUGH'S TRIO, THE GUITARIST FINDS HIMSELF PART OF THE GANG AGAIN. 
IT WAS QUITE A RIDE IN BETWEEN, TOO.

 Al Viola's career has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist gained renown working with pianist Page Cavanaugh's trio. Viola 
played with Cavanaugh's combo from 1946-49, during which they appeared in three 
films, including 1948's "Romance on the High Seas," starring Doris Day and 
directed by Michael Curtiz.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were like the white Nat King Cole trio, but we were different in that we 
all sang," says Viola, 73, recalling those with Cavanaugh and bassist Lloyd 
Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the veteran with the round, silky tone and spiffy execution appears 
again with Cavanaugh's trio, which he rejoined five years ago. The pianist, 
guitarist and bassist Phil Mallory perform at Orange Coast College in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't sing anymore," said Viola, his blue eyes flashing. "I'm over 70 years 
old, and I don't give a damn about singing."  
</P>
<P>
 In the home he shares with Glenna, his wife of 48 years, Viola has mementos 
that tell you: Between his first gigs with Cavanaugh and his latest, the 
unpretentious musician has had a wonderful whirl. 
</P>
<P>
 There are framed letters, like the 1960 note from then-senator John F. 
Kennedy, thanking Viola for helping in his campaign by performing on "High 
Hopes," behind then-Democrat Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the photos: Viola with JFK as president (the guitarist performed 
at the White House with singer Julie London); with Cavanaugh's trio, and with 
Sinatra -- at the now-defunct Gilmore Field in Hollywood in the '50s and at the 
Great Pyramid of Giza in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn native Viola became one of Los Angeles' most reliable studio 
performers, playing on more than 500 albums with everyone from June Christy and 
London to Jimmy Witherspoon and Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
 He's played on countless TV and film soundtracks, among them "The Godfather" 
-- he's the solo mandolinist who performed the now-classic theme -- "West Side 
Story" and "Blazing Saddles." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was involved in studio work, the music was tops," Viola said of his 
most active period, the mid-'50s to the late '70s.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the high point of Viola's career was his association with Sinatra, 
with whom he performed intermittently from 1946 to 1980, from the Sands in Las 
Vegas to the Parthenon in Athens. He played on such albums as "Nice 'N' Easy," 
"Only the Lonely" and "Ring-A-Ding-Ding!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The big hits -- 'My Way,' 'New York, New York,' 'Strangers in the Night' -- I 
was on all of those," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola can be heard on the recently released "Sinatra and Sextet: Live in 
Paris," which documents a 1962 performance at the Lido nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know we were taped until this CD came out," Viola said. "In 
Europe, Frank and I did 'Night and Day,' just the two of us. I'd go out in 
front, and he'd introduce me. That was a thrill, a bit scary and a challenge, 
because he never does a song the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his studio career, Viola has done well as a jazz man, having recorded 
19 albums under his name. He's also appeared both as a band leader and with 
others, including reed man Buddy Collette. 
</P>
<P>
 When he played with Cavanaugh in the late '80s for a couple of weekends in the 
San Fernando Valley, Viola didn't foresee another lengthy relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Page had been working solo in Vegas for six years," Viola said. "When you 
play solo, you don't have to worry about time, and at first, (Cavanaugh's) time 
was terrible. But by the second night of the second weekend, it was all 
jelling, and I said to him, 'You've got yourself a trio.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh, Viola and bassist Mallory now work at the Money Tree in Toluca 
Lake. There they offer, as they promise to at OCC, seamless interpretations of 
standards and arcane numbers from Hollywood musicals of the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, there are no written arrangements for this stuff," Viola said. 
"Page and I just have chemistry. We just hit it. That's the way it's always 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Page Cavanaugh Trio, with guitarist Al Viola, plays tonight at 8 in the 
Robert B. Moore Theatre, Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa.

 Talk-Show Extremes: The North Carolina Supreme Court has been called in to 
decide whether Phil Donahue will be allowed to tape and televise the planned 
June 15 execution of David Lawson, who was convicted in 1980 of killing a man 
while burglarizing his home near Concord, N.C. Opposing the taping: the North 
Carolina attorney general's office, which this week asked the state Supreme 
Court to issue a permanent stay of the videotaping. But Lawson wants the 
execution televised. In an early court hearing, he said he wants "his life's 
story to serve as an example to others of the effects of child abuse, clinical 
depression and the dangers inherent in a life of crime." A decision is expected 
next week.

 Cable Comeback: Young Indiana Jones will ride again on the Family Channel. 
George Lucas is executive-producing four original cable movies, based on the 
ABC series "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles," which was canceled last year 
because of low ratings. The first movie, "Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood 
Follies," will air in November and will star series lead Sean Patrick Flanery. 
The ABC series was known for shooting around the globe and focusing on 
historical characters. Lucas, who is also planning a fourth feature film 
starring Harrison Ford, hopes to create enough footage to turn Indiana Jones 
into an educational multimedia program for children. ART

drawings worth more than $1 million, purchased this week by the Baltimore 
Museum of Art. The new works will join 23 other Warhol pieces at the museum, 
including his famous "Campbell's Soup Cans." That gives the Baltimore Museum 
the second-largest holding of Warhol paintings of any museum in the world, 
officials said. Only the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, slated to open May 
16, will have a larger collection. Baltimore officials declined to reveal how 
much they paid for the works. The works span from 1975 to 1986, a year before 
Warhol died. POP/ROCK

JAZZ NOTES: AT 63, GUITARIST JIM HALL RECORDS HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most often, memoirs are published in book form. But guitarist Jim Hall -- who 
in his four-decade career has offered his clear-water sound and biting sense of 
swing with such greats as Sonny Rollins, Ella Fitzgerald, Itzhak Perlman and 
Paul Desmond -- has chosen to gather his memorable moments in song form. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's latest album, "Dedications & Inspirations" (Telarc), contains musical 
refections on the likes of Charlie Christian -- the monumental Benny Goodman 
guitarist who has been the primary influence for electric guitarists from Wes 
Montgomery to B.B. King -- Rollins, "The Far Side" cartoonist Gary Larson, and 
Hall's wife, Jane, a psychoanalyst and sometime composer. Homages to Claude 
Monet, Henri Matisse and Joan Miro are thrown in to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 63, who leads a splendid trio with bassist Scott Colley and drummer Bill 
Stewart on Sunday at the Jazz Bakery, wrote "Bluesography" for Christian and 
folk-blues guitarist Huddie Ledbetter, known as Leadbelly. The selection 
contains portions of "Grand Slam," the first solo by Christian that Hall ever 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Street Dance" is for Rollins, with whom Hall performed and recorded in the 
early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sonny was a terrific leader," Hall says of his days with the tenor giant. "He 
was always concerned about whether we -- bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Ben 
Riley -- had enough money, and he was careful about how we dressed. We had 
uniforms that were each a different shade that complemented our various skin 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall says he was deeply influenced by Rollins' climactic, unaccompanied 
cadenzas, where at the conclusion of a tune, "he would take the tune apart and 
put it back together." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dedications & Inspirations" is, likewise, an unaccompanied effort, as Hall 
plays either solo or with overdubbed effects on all tracks. It's the type of 
project he never intended to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find solo playing boring after about 10 minutes. I even got bored with 
Segovia," he admits. "So I tried to think orchestrally, like Duke Ellington, to 
keep it interesting for me, and the listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall now has new respect for the genre. "I filled in for Joe Pass in Europe, 
playing solo, and that was tough," he says. "It was hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (310) 271-9039. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard No No-Show: Saxophonist Bob Sheppard, who was listed as a "no show" 
in an April 27 review of a Freddie Hubbard concert in The Times, was actually 
not scheduled to appear with the trumpeter. Sheppard, who was once Hubbard's 
regular saxophonist, says that he has not played with him for two years. He was 
listed incorrectly on the program for Hubbard's April 25 appearance at Union 
Station through a series of misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was traveling in Japan with Steely Dan at the time and had never accepted 
that engagement," says Sheppard. Hubbard's manager, Michael Davenport, 
concurred, noting that he was aware that Sheppard was not contracted to 
perform, and that he had neglected to inform officials of the Da Camera 
Society, who promoted the event.

COUNTRY'S FANFEST '94 WARMS UP SLOWLY; MUSIC: LONG LINES AND DELAYS GREETED 
FANS AT THE START OF THE POMONA EVENT. BUT THOSE WHO STUCK IT OUT WERE REWARDED 
WITH SOME FINE LIVE PERFORMANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Country music fans are perhaps the most loyal and patient of all music fans. 
That's a good thing for the organizers of Fanfest '94 in Pomona, where those 
attributes were at times tested to the limit.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just the long lines at the Fairplex for star autographs -- some fans 
waited for more than six hours to get Travis Tritt to sign copies of his new 
autobiography Thursday, par for the course in the country world. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stuck it out during the four-day inaugural Southern California 
country festival modeled on the wildly successful annual Fanfare in Nashville 
were ultimately rewarded with some fine live performances, most notably 
Thursday's headlining set in which Dwight Yoakam was joined by bluegrass great 
Ralph Stanley. But there were some glitches and snafus, especially on opening 
day Wednesday, which left even some of the most ardent country fans 
disappointed and disgruntled. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday afternoon, Jim and Penny Watkins, from Fontana, had already 
decided that they would not return for the remaining three days, although 
they'd purchased $99 passes for the whole festival.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the money, but when you prepare yourself for something 
good and don't get it, it's irritating," said Jim Watkins, while sitting by the 
main music stage in the middle of the Fairplex racetrack at about 4 p.m., when 
only one of six scheduled music performances had taken place.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Alexander, president of Fanfest Inc., the company putting on the event, 
acknowledged the problems and complaints as birthing pains of what he hopes 
will become a rival to the Nashville festival.  
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday evening, improvements were evident, both in the operation of the 
event and the mood of the fans and participants. The music, although running an 
hour behind schedule by Thursday night, kept moving pretty well thanks to a 
revolving double stage (take note, "Lollapalooza") and the efficient "Hot 
Country Nights" TV show house band providing backing for short, crisp sets by 
country stars both new (Doug Stone) and old (Charley Pride). 
</P>
<P>
 Over in the pavilions, vendors selling everything from indoor Jacuzzis to 
salsa, for the most part seemed pleased with the setup, although some near the 
autograph tables were concerned about the lines blocking traffic to their 
booths. In general, a sense of optimism for the final two days of the fair 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be hard for any remaining musical act to top the set by Yoakam 
and Stanley. With Yoakam's band providing mostly acoustic backing, the 
35-minute set was a capsule lesson in both country roots and possibilities, 
combining bluegrass soul and verve with a sexy rock friskiness that stands 
apart from virtually any other act in the field.  
</P>
<P>
 * Fanfest '94, benefiting earthquake relief and the Feed the Children program, 
concludes today, beginning at 11 a.m. at the Fairplex facility, L.A. County 
Fairgrounds, 1101 W. McKinley Ave., Pomona. Among the today's performers are 
Tracy Lawrence and Toby Keith. (800) 550-3267. Tickets are $30.

VERDICT IS IN: U.S. VIEWERS LOVE O.C. TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Move over Luke and Laura. These days, daytime television watchers are glued to 
the real-life drama of Claire and Tony, the high society Orange County couple 
whose bitter palimony battle is being broadcast live from Santa Ana on Court 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the cable network that broadcasts trials from all over the country, and 
this week network officials say they have been been swamped with hundreds of 
calls from viewers hooked on Maglica vs. Maglica: women who are rooting for 
Claire to triumph over her greedy lover, men who grouse that the network's 
female commentators are unfairly biased in favor of Claire and insist that she 
is the greedy one. 
</P>
<P>
 For those just tuning in, Claire Maglica is suing Anthony Maglica for half of 
Mag Instrument Inc., a flashlight empire she estimates is worth $400 million. 
He is the company's president. She is the executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls and letters to Court TV have not been tilted overwhelmingly in favor 
of either Claire or Anthony Maglica and aren't necessarily split along gender 
lines, said Debby Fry Wilson, vice president of public and governmental affairs 
at the network.  
</P>
<P>
 But emotions are running high. 
</P>
<P>
 Just listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Maglica case, I resent the fact that your analysts all favor the 
plaintiff. In this case, it is very clear that Claire is an embezzling liar and 
Mr. Maglica is an honorable man," said one middle-aged man from the 
Southeastern United States, who called the network last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound harsh? Consider this counterpunch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Maglica is making a career out of being a poor, old, misunderstood, 
befoggled, poor-English-speaking, heart-of-gold foreigner struggling to make 
good in America," one man said on April 18. "Everyone is dancing to his tune, 
and he should get an Academy Award." The Anaheim Hills couple have rubbed 
shoulders with U.S. presidents, sent generous contributions to the Republican 
Party and made headlines last year when they airlifted a blinded Bosnian boy to 
California for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the Maglicas lived together for more than 22 years and were known 
to many as husband and wife, they never married. An Orange County Superior 
Court jury began deliberating Wednesday in their palimony trial, which has been 
broadcast live for the past six weeks on Court TV. The 3-year-old, New 
York-based cable network is available to more than 14 million households 
nationwide. It is carried by some Los Angeles County cable companies, but is 
not available in Orange County unless you have a satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
 If Claire Maglica prevails, legal experts say, the case could lead to the 
biggest palimony settlement ever, because there is so much money at stake.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, 60, and Anthony, a 64-year-old Croatian immigrant, worked side 
by side for more than two decades, turning a small machine shop into the 
Ontario-based Mag Instrument Inc., maker of the popular Mag-Lite flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 She says Anthony vowed to her repeatedly that they would always share 
everything; He says he made it perfectly clear the houses and business belonged 
only to him. 
</P>
<P>
 So who do viewers believe? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bless her if Claire can get even five dollars from this fellow who she lived 
with for 20 years," said one woman over 55 years old who declined to say where 
she was calling from. One young woman called in asking for Claire's address "so 
I can write her words of support." 
</P>
<P>
 But some sneered, complaining about gender bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guest commentators in the Maglica case are women and are favoring Claire 
Maglica. This is one-sided," one young man from the Northwest said. "The women 
need to be more fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry Wilson said that Court TV, also known as the Courtroom Television Network, 
keeps track of its daily calls from viewers, transcribing the comments and 
recording each caller's age range and where they are calling from. Viewer calls 
peaked at about a thousand a week during the Los Angeles murder trial of Lyle 
and Eric Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that all of the network's commentators are attorneys, and that if 
they issue opinions, they do so based on their professional expertise, not 
their emotions.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issues in this case really hit home," said Fry Wilson. "It's a trial that 
anyone can identify with, being that it's a domestic dispute, and unfortunately 
half our population will go through these kinds of issues -- splitting the 
family assets, or separating business assets." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegiances of some viewers have shifted as the couple's attorneys have 
taken turns presenting their cases. While early responses favored Claire 
Maglica, Fry Wilson said that some viewers turned against her as Anthony 
Maglica's defense attorney presented the mogul's side and brought up 
allegations that Claire Maglica had forged American Express statements in order 
to get fatter reimbursements from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed Claire Maglica all the way. But after watching the forgery charge, 
I voted her down the tubes. I wouldn't give her a dime," one middle-age man 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been calls from armchair lawyers who offered tips for the 
attorneys representing the Maglicas.  
</P>
<P>
 So rapt is the audience that interruptions have provoked an immediate 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Maglica trial is possibly the most important trial of this type ever 
tried, but we are being deprived by a sideshow like Kevorkian," one middle-age 
man griped on April 21, as the network switched back and forth between the 
Maglica trial and Jack Kevorkian's Detroit trial on assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Another viewer slipped outside for just a few minutes to dash to the post 
office and was enraged to find Jack on the tube -- not Tony and Claire -- when 
he returned, Fry Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen in a long time," said another 
female caller. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, too suddenly for some, Claire and Tony disappeared from the 
screen. The eight women and four men on the jury had slipped behind closed 
doors to decide the couple's fate, and viewers were forced to go cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Maglica?" callers asked over and over. "What happened in the Maglica 
case?"

JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 6.4%, IGNITING FEARS OF INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The national unemployment rate dipped to 6.4% in April as the robust economy 
created a larger-than-expected 267,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported 
Friday, but the good economic news rattled jittery stock and bond markets, 
which fell amid fears that inflation may accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 California unemployment rose to 9.6%, up from 8.6%, and analysts were 
disappointed with the figure. But they also saw signs that the state's economy 
is improving slightly. Many of the additional unemployed Californians were job 
seekers who re-entered the market after being discouraged for so long that they 
had stopped actively looking for work. They had not been counted in recent 
unemployment statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County the unemployment rate stayed flat at 6.7% in March, the most 
recent month for which figures are available. Because the monthly jobless 
statistics for the individual counties are computed after the state and 
national rates, the April figures for Orange County won't be released until 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, "people are being drawn back into the labor force" but the 
economy is not yet creating enough jobs to fill their expectations for 
returning to work, said Thomas Plewes, associate commissioner of labor 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The state gained a meager 4,500 jobs in April and total employment still 
remains more than half a million below its 1990 peak. "It sure isn't much of a 
recovery," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House news conference, a jubilant Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said that the national jobs report, with unemployment falling from 6.5% in 
March, "gives us a lot to crow about." But stock and bond investors were not 
impressed: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip shares fell 26.47 points to 
close at 3669.50, after plunging more than 53 points earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Falling bond prices led to higher interest yields, with the key 30-year 
Treasury bond soaring to 7.55%, up from 7.33%, and reaching the highest level 
since December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Reserve Board, which has hiked rates three times since February, 
will be under pressure when its policy-making committee meets May 17, to drive 
up the cost of money yet again to calm the markets. Higher interest rates would 
slow the pace of economic activity, presumably preventing the kind of rapid 
rise in prices that investors fear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no immediate visible signs of inflation: consumer prices rose just 
2.5% in the year ending in March. However, the financial markets are fearful 
that a falling jobless rate could lead to labor shortages, upward pressure on 
wages and a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is sticking to its forecast of steady economic 
growth without any overheating of prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's impossible to outguess the markets and I'm not really going to 
try," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers, told the White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say to those market participants who might have a concern about 
inflation . . . that this report is showing us, if you look over the past year, 
average hourly earnings have only increased about the same rate as inflation. . 
. . " Tyson said. "So we really have a very good cost situation and a good 
competitive situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty for wary investors is whether shortages of workers will occur 
as unemployment falls and whether product prices will rise as output comes 
closer to capacity in various industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the April report may cause some indigestion on Wall Street as another 
indication of inflation, we believe that sufficient excess capacity still 
exists to hold the line on inflation over the next several months," said Robert 
D. Barr, deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the longer term we expect that the higher short-term interest rates 
engineered by the Federal Reserve will prevent a new outbreak of inflation," he 
said. Further, it's likely that the Fed will continue to ratchet up interest 
rates "at least a couple of more times." 
</P>
<P>
 The gain of 267,000 jobs would have been even larger but for the strike in the 
trucking industry, which idled 70,000 workers, Katherine G. Abraham, the 
government's commissioner of labor statistics, told a hearing of Congress' 
Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, health services and retail trade all showed increased employment 
for the month, she said. "Growth in April was especially strong in eating and 
drinking places and in auto dealers and service stations." 
</P>
<P>
 In manufacturing, employers are still hesitant to hire new workers, preferring 
to pay overtime to existing employees. Overtime hit 8.4 hours a week in the 
auto industry, and 10 hours at sawmills. The average workweek in manufacturing 
was 42 hours, the highest level since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA economist Kimbell and other experts had predicted that Southern 
California would get a boost from spending to rebuild earthquake-ravaged 
freeways, buildings and homes. Kimbell said, however, that the improvement in 
construction, where 1,300 jobs were added in the state during the month, does 
not seem to be spreading to other industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be giving us less stimulus than we counted on," he said. Los Angeles 
County's jobless rate, always volatile because of the small sampling on which 
it is based, leaped to 9.9% in April, from 9.4% in March. Yet the county 
figures -- which, unlike the federal and state statistics, are not adjusted for 
seasonal trends -- also offered a small bit of encouragement: The number of 
people with jobs inched up by 9,000 to 3,981,000 during the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Reich said that California "is trailing the rest of the 
country by about a year" in moving from recovery to expansion. "Northern 
California is about on par with the rest of the country. Southern California is 
way behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big hits in California continue to be in the defense areas," said Joseph 
A. Wahed, chief economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. Still, he 
added, the job losses are growing smaller in those industries and "they aren't 
dragging us down the way they were two or three years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahed said that the losses in defense and related industries finally have 
grown smaller than the gains in such areas as construction, retailing and 
services. The bottom line, he said, is that "there will be slow improvement in 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 California continued to post the highest unemployment among the 11 big states 
whose unemployment rates are reported along with the U.S. figures every month. 
The next-highest jobless rates were reported for New York, at 8.2%, and 
Florida, at 7.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest unemployment was in North Carolina, at 3.9%, followed by Illinois, 
5.5%, and Michigan, 5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mix of unemployment has changed markedly" this year, BLS commissioner 
Abraham said. For example, the number of job losers in California -- people who 
were laid off or dismissed -- was 688,000 last month, down significantly from 
781,000 in March. The number of re-entrants -- people encouraged enough to go 
back into the market -- was 494,000, up from 417,000 a month before. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown used the new figures to attack Gov. Pete 
Wilson, issuing a statement which said that "there's a 49-state recovery party 
going on and California wasn't invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for Wilson's reelection campaign, said that Brown's 
attack was the work of a desperate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old Kathleen Brown understood that California's economic difficulties 
have been caused by national and international forces beyond the control of any 
individual," he said. "Before Kathleen Brown gets too happy about the idea of 
Californians being thrown out of work, someone ought to explain to her that the 
reason the percentages changed is because more people than ever before have 
entered the work force."

 GUN RUSH: For some gun lovers, assault weapons are as good as gold. And now 
that the politicians in Washington have passed legislation to outlaw many of 
them, enthusiasts are rushing to purchase the dwindling supply before it's too 
late. . . . "There is a drastic increase of people coming in," says Randy 
Linkmeyer, owner of Art's Guns in Canoga Park. "People are saying that it's now 
or never."

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Smokey Bear is one lucky bear. In honor of Smokey's 50th 
birthday and to help promote the fight against forest fires, Hungry Valley Road 
near Gorman has been changed to Smokey Bear Road (B20) . . . The Valley is no 
stranger to unusual names. There is, for example, Bambi Place in Granada Hills, 
Nimrod Street in Lake Hughes and Heaven Avenue in Woodland Hills.

<P>
 FLOWERS: Besides designing bouquets, florists play Freud in the hours leading 
up to Mother's Day as shoppers search for the proper arrangements (above). 
"It's a little like being a hairdresser," said one Valley florist (B1). . . . 
But, though FTD expects 1.3 million orders this Mother's Day, it still ranks 
second behind Christmas as the busiest flower season. 
</P>
<P>
 HIDEAWAY: Believe it or not, there are more than just horses in Sun Valley's 
La Tuna Canyon. In fact, there's Valley Christian, one of the largest 
evangelical Christian schools in the country, with nearly 1,900 students on its 
30-acre campus . . . Sadly, the school must say goodby to elementary school 
Principal Victor Frendt, who doubled as a bus driver in the early days (B13).

 ELECTRIC CARS: Chrysler announced this week it's going electric in 1998, but 
will consumers be charged up about it? Absolutely, says Mark Toczynski, general 
sales manager of a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Canoga Park. He says the new 
minivans, if they have sufficient power, will be a big hit. . . . "They'll be 
great," he says. "You won't need to put gas and oil into them." Michael Arkush

6,800 STAND TO LOSE JOBS IF HUGHES CLOSES DEFENSE PLANT IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The possible closure of Hughes Aircraft's principal defense plant in Orange 
County, which could mean the idling of 6,800 employees, would deal a 
devastating blow to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Though defense cuts are anticipated despite the region's economic recovery, 
the abrupt shutting of the city's largest employer would take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this could cause a substantial impact in Fullerton's economy," 
said Anil Puri, economist for Cal State Fullerton, adding that he predicts 
"major defense contractors will continue making cutbacks for two to three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crushing blow if it comes to pass," said Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) 
Catlin, a former Hughes employee. He said the defense contractor would be 
missed as a good corporate neighbor that supported the city's cultural 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any downsizing would certainly be a big loss to Fullerton," he said. "The 
employees buy gasoline and shop in the stores and any type of downsizing would 
be unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he learned 
only Friday that Hughes was considering the closure of its Fullerton facility. 
He indicated the county would immediately begin trying to formulate a strategy 
to prevent such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's at the top of my agenda," said Riley, who has also been participating 
in talks with Taco Bell executives in an attempt to keep that company in Orange 
County. "I was surprised to learn about this. But the climate today is such 
that companies are finding it more expensive to keep their operations up." 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs are a fact of life at defense plants, but that is of little 
consolation to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think lobbying is going to help us," said one Hughes employee, who 
asked not to be identified out of concern for his job. "I don't think people 
get used to living on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 26, Hughes executives told employees they are evaluating whether to 
shut a major plant, possibly the one in Fullerton, in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton plant, which consists mostly of engineering staff, makes air 
defense equipment, battlefield radar, shipboard display systems and 
anti-submarine warfare equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees learned in a four-hour meeting with Hughes Vice Chairman Michael 
Smith that the Fullerton facility might close as part of cost-cutting measures. 
He said layoffs would definitely occur. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Hughes announced a restructuring that would combine some divisions 
into three main operating groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesman Dan Reeder also said no decision will be made until 
midsummer, and he gave no indication on the numbers of workers who might lose 
their jobs or face relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 37-year-old plant survives the review, its work force might actually 
grow as it absorbs dislocated workers from another plant. Reeder said the plant 
survived a similar review two years ago, when the corporation decided instead 
to relocate a plant from Canoga Park to Tucson. Other plants under review are 
one in Long Beach and two in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said the company is proceeding with a plan to sell 150 acres of the 
Fullerton plant's 350 acres for a residential subdivision of up to 2,000 homes. 
The company has more than 2.8 million square feet of office space at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction at the Hughes plant seems divided into expressions of Angst or 
fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the prospects of layoffs did not surprise a group of Hughes 
managers and retirees who meet monthly at Lamppost Pizza in Buena Park, not far 
from the Fullerton plant. The mood among the Hughes veterans was mixed. Some 
took the news in stride and some were upbeat; others expressed gallows humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing a plant is an option," joked one manager, who would not give his 
name. "But suicide is an option too. It's a stupid option. The rumors are old 
news. The only thing they've done is form a task force so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Another manager said he had no idea whether the task force would seriously 
consider shutting the whole plant and laying off everyone. It also might be 
difficult for the company to sell the entire property, or to quell the 
animosity among employees who would not want to commute to the other remaining 
plants, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one plant employee said he was just plain scared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought a house last week and now this happens," he said nervously. "This 
company doesn't do a good enough job of communicating with the employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said that the company is trying to make a quick decision because it 
knows how much anxiety the thought of a plant closure can cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of job losses is old news at the Hughes plant in Fullerton. As a 
result of sliding defense budgets and the end of the Cold War, the company has 
steadily shed employees from a peak of 15,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stupar, a 10-year Hughes employee, was laid off from his job as a program 
manager at the plant in 1991. He now holds a number of part-time jobs teaching 
classes on business ethics at local universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me is seeing a company like Hughes that is closing plants and 
downsizing for the sake of profit," he said. "I see people's jobs being lost 
and I see technology being lost. They're not looking at tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first arrived at Hughes (in Fullerton) I was amazed at the resources 
and technology that they had," he said. "The possibility that it might close is 
a tragedy."

NO MINOR MANIA; ROBERTSON PLAYS IN SHADOW OF BIRMINGHAM'S MOST FAMOUS BARON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a young left fielder in the Chicago White Sox farm system, Mike Robertson 
hopes one day to tangle with the Green Monster, the famed, 37-foot-high 
left-field wall in Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Robertson is only on the double-A level, the Birmingham (Ala.) Baron 
will have to make do with his battle against the Plastic Menace, the 
not-so-famed, four-foot-high barrier that separated him from a throng of 
Michael Jordan admirers last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, a former Servite High School and USC standout, already had been 
fully enveloped by Jordan-mania. There wasn't a day during a season-opening 
home stand when he wasn't interviewed by a newspaper, television or radio 
reporter, part of the media crush surrounding his new teammate, who, until he 
retired, was the world's greatest basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 But the absurdity of it all really hit home when Birmingham hit the road for 
the first time in mid-April. Awaiting Robertson in Chattanooga's Engel Stadium 
was an orange, plastic temporary fence, much like the ones used in construction 
sites, running from the left-field corner to the center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence enabled Chattanooga to extend the left-field picnic area so another 
700-800 paying customers could pack themselves onto what normally is the 
playing field to get a glimpse at Jordan. But it also reduced the dimensions 
from left to center field by about 30 feet and eliminated the warning track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ridiculous," Robertson said. "I went over that thing a few times going 
for balls. There were four or five homers hit over it in two games. They 
stuffed as many people out there as they could. Some of the owners down here 
are pretty greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were a bit of a nuisance during the Chattanooga series, but for the 
most part Robertson has enjoyed all the attention that comes with being part of 
Jordan's supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two dozen reporters and photographers were on hand for the first home 
stand, and the Barons have been met by similar media mobs at every road stop. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the crowds. Birmingham team President Bill Hardekopf had to 
hire two temporary workers to handle the ticket-order crush before the season 
opener. One day the phones rang so often he had to go to his car phone just to 
make a call out. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham's home attendance is up 54% over last season, and the response on 
the road has been as overwhelming. Chattanooga crammed 13,600 into a stadium 
that normally seats 7,500 for Jordan's first game there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nashville had averaged 882 in eight home games before Birmingham visited. In 
two games against Jordan and the Barons, Nashville drew 16,842 and 16,852. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like he's a rock star," Robertson said. "People absolutely love him, 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans come to see Michael, but it's guys like Mike -- Robertson, that is -- 
who benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real easy to get up and excited when there's a big crowd," said 
Robertson, who was among Southern League leaders in batting (.353), runs batted 
in (22), doubles (13) and extra-base hits (17) through Thursday's game. 
"There's a buzz of electricity in the air during games, even in batting 
practice. Last year during BP, there was no one in the stands. It was a real 
tedious thing to do every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with the media, the cameras and fans, it's sort of a big league 
atmosphere. It's been more exciting coming to different parks every night. It's 
always a grind playing every day, traveling by bus, battling the heat and 
humidity, but it's been more enjoyable doing your daily chores this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has made another dreaded part of minor league life more bearable. Just 
before the Barons embarked on their first trip, the former NBA great bought a 
$350,000 bus, which has 35 reclining seats, plenty of leg room, six television 
sets and a videocassette recorder, for the team to travel the Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot better than last year's bus," Robertson said. "That one was pretty 
beat up, the seats didn't work, there was hardly any leg room. This one is more 
spacious and it has more TVs. Everyone asks me if there's a spa and a bar in 
it, but I haven't seen that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The other question Robertson hears a lot: So, what's this Jordan guy like? 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was weird playing baseball with the greatest basketball player of 
all time," Robertson said. "But now he seems like a regular guy. I've gotten to 
know him pretty well. He's a great person and athlete -- that shows on the 
field and off. He plays hard and treats us like equals." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said Jordan stays in the same hotels and eats meals with the team. 
About the only special treatment he receives in Birmingham is a secured parking 
spot for his black Porsche behind the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Barons realize they're in the presence of greatness. After all, 
have you ever heard of a double-A player signing autographs for opposing 
players while he's shagging balls during batting practice? Jordan did for a 
handful of Carolina Mudcats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan is not so huge that he can't ask a minor leaguer for some batting 
tips. When he was struggling early in the season, the man who led the Chicago 
Bulls to three NBA championships and the U.S. basketball team to two Olympic 
gold medals had a little chat with the 23-year-old who . . . well, he was an 
All-Orange County, first-team selection in 1987 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I were talking about hitting early in the season, and I likened it to 
basketball," Robertson said. "When you're driving down the lane, you don't 
think about where your hands or feet are, it just comes naturally. I told him 
not to worry so much about where his hands were, just see the ball and hit it. 
That seemed to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jordan rattled off a 13-game hitting streak after the conversation and 
pushed his average above .300. He has since cooled off and was hitting .265 
through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has all the ability, it's just a matter of playing the game and playing 
hard, rather than thinking about every little maneuver," Robertson said. "Will 
he make the major leagues? That all depends on if he succeeds at each level he 
goes to. You need to see him play a full season. That tells you what kind of 
player he is."

NCAA COMPOUNDS WASHINGTON PENALTIES; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NEW SANCTIONS WOULD BAN 
HUSKIES FROM TELEVISION FOR 1994 SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of Washington football program, already under the thumb of 
Pacific 10 Conference sanctions, has been assessed additional penalties by the 
NCAA Committee on Infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest sanctions, which were announced at a Friday afternoon news 
conference at the Seattle campus, would prevent the Huskies from appearing on 
television for another season, through 1994. The NCAA also added another year 
of probation to the original penalty, thus extending the time to the summer of 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's decision caught Washington administrative and athletic 
department officials by surprise and prompted a vow to challenge the proposed 
NCAA penalties. An expedited hearing before the committee is scheduled June 5 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're emotionally very upset," said Washington President William P. 
Gerberding, who was informed of the additional penalties in an April 27 letter 
sent by David Swank, chair of the NCAA Committee on Infractions. "I'm extremely 
upset and have been since I received the letter." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute is a Los Angeles-based summer jobs program that 
employed numerous Washington players but often required them to do only minimal 
work. According to the committee, this constituted a lack of institutional 
control, most notably by "the athletics staff in general, and the football 
coaching staff in particular." So disturbing was the problem, especially as it 
related to the jobs program in Los Angeles, that the committee added sanctions 
to the original Pac-10 penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerberding said Friday that the university accepted the committee's findings 
and acknowledged once more that the summer jobs program was poorly monitored. 
But in its official response to the committee, Gerberding wrote that the new 
punishment was "excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 In what surely will be Washington's argument against the increased punishment, 
Gerberding's letter to the NCAA outlined a six-point defense statement. In 
short, the school said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The penalties affect "innocent" student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The violations, while major in nature, were unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This is Washington's first NCAA football violation in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- School officials, coaches and players have cooperated fully with all 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The university took immediate remedial actions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NCAA penalties are inconsistent with those levied most recently against 
Auburn and Texas A&M, two programs that Washington insists committed more 
grievous violations that the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the penalties will have serious financial ramifications. The 
Pac-10 television sanctions already have cost Washington about $1.4 million in 
revenue, and Athletic Director Barbara Hedges warned that additional lost TV 
earnings would force her to make "adjustments" within the athletic department. 
The Huskies are scheduled to appear on ABC telecasts Sept. 3 at USC, Sept. 10 
at Seattle against Ohio State and most likely Sept. 24 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies appeared on five ABC regional telecasts last season, but were not 
allowed to collect fees for those appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee on Infractions report also appears to justify the Pac-10's 
initial penalties, which put Washington on two years' probation, banned the 
program from postseason appearances in 1993 and 1994, banned the team from 1993 
television revenue and reduced the number of official recruiting visits and 
available scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Those penalties caused the abrupt resignation last August of Don James, the 
longtime Husky coach who said he could no longer work in a conference "that 
treats its players and coaches so unfairly." As it turns out, Washington should 
have considered itself lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like they're shooting a dead horse," Husky tight end Mark Bruner 
said of the NCAA sanctions. "We've already served half our time. No matter what 
the hell they do or what they say, they're not going to stop us. The only way 
we're going to be defeated is if the Huskies defeat themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time the NCAA has added penalties to conference sanctions 
in major cases. As recently as March, the committee imposed additional 
probation to the Washington State track and baseball teams.

SEQUELS PROMISE OLD THRILLS; BOXING: FOUR WORLD TITLE REMATCHES INCLUDE 
CHAVEZ'S QUEST TO REGAIN GLORY AFTER FIRST DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Double or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Risking their reputations and seeking various combinations of respect, 
redemption and ridiculous riches, four pairs of fighters are scheduled to renew 
acquaintances at the MGM Grand Garden tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight could mean the end of Julio Cesar Chavez as a power in boxing. Or it 
could be the beginning of his last surge to greatness. Tonight could erase 
former or current luminaries Terry Norris, Julian Jackson and Azumah Nelson 
from anybody's list of elite fighters. Or it could start them all back on the 
road to dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Or given the state of boxing these days, it could simply set up four more 
re-rematches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest card in the world," said World Boxing Council 
middleweight champion Gerald McClellan, one of the few participants not prone 
to overstatement. "This is the one." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of the big, of course, is Chavez's chance to prove that his 
knockdown and then defeat at the hands of Frankie Randall, 32, amounted to 
nothing more than a slip-up, a careless, WBC super-lightweight title-losing 
moment after 89 victories, 77 knockouts, and a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall (49-2-1, 39 KOs) is in the first title defense of his career and has 
been a touch edgy in recent days. He took everything Chavez had to throw at him 
in their first fight Jan. 29, and sent back even harder, sharper shots, 
spilling Chavez in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who says he barely trained for that fight, still complains about two 
points that were deducted from him by referee Richard Steele because of low 
blows. Mills Lane is scheduled to referee the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's going to be just the same as the first fight," Randall said. "Why 
should I do anything different? I won." 
</P>
<P>
 To summon him out of his self-described recent lethargy, Chavez, 31, has 
brought in trainer Emanuel Steward, who handled Evander Holyfield successfully 
for his successful rematch against Riddick Bowe last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Randall camp says it isn't concerned about any changes Steward makes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankie wanted Julio as quickly as possible," said Randall's trainer, Aaron 
Snowell. "Because Julio can remember what happened last time, and he can come 
in with whatever style he wants, but once he feels Frankie's punches, it's 
going to be just like last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we've worked so good together, because I've never tried to change 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez is not subtle about his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will kill him slowly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the other fights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- WBC junior-middleweight champion Simon Brown (41-2, 30 KOs) vs. Norris 
(37-4, 23 KOs) -- Dec. 18 in Puebla, Mexico, Norris tried to annihilate the 
30-year-old Brown, who had backed out of two previous matches, and got knocked 
out in the fourth round -- and lost his title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my head on straight this time," said Norris, 26, adding that he has 
cooled his desire to knock out everybody he faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an old veteran at this," Brown said. "I'm going to pull some more tricks 
out of the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 -- McClellan (30-2, 28 KOs) vs. Jackson (49-2, 45 KOs) -- Last May 8 here, the 
two heavy hitters slugged at each other from the opening bell, with underdog 
McClellan getting up from a low blow and knocking out Jackson in the fifth 
round to take his title. 
</P>
<P>
 McClellan, 26, has won 20 consecutive fights and, with another victory over 
the 33-year-old Jackson, could edge into the pound-for-pound best fighter 
debate and force Jackson out of the middleweight picture for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fight could either make me or break me," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- WBC super-featherweight champion Nelson (37-2-2, 26 KOs) vs. James Leija 
(27-0-2, 13 KOs) -- Although it was overshadowed by the controversial Pernell 
Whitaker-Chavez draw that followed it last Sept. 10 in San Antonio, the draw 
for Nelson-Leija was equally bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Leija, 27, seemed to control Nelson, 35, early, then tired as Nelson stormed 
back in the later rounds. The fight was first announced as a decision for 
Nelson, then had to be corrected minutes later when an addition error was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is the longest-running champion in the sport, and was devastating in 
his last rematch, an eighth-round technical knockout of Jeff Fenech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows what I do in a rematch," Nelson said. "Leija is a good boxer, 
but he's not in my class. If this guy goes the distance with me, no question, I 
will retire." Tonight's Fights

MAZZONE GOT MORE TICKETS; ROSE BOWL: UCLA BOOSTER BOUGHT TOTAL OF 733 TICKETS 
FROM FIVE OTHER PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelo Mazzone, the UCLA booster who purchased 4,000 of the school's allotment 
of 1994 Rose Bowl tickets, also bought enough tickets from other Pacific 10 
Conference schools to control nearly 5% of all tickets to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone bought 733 tickets from five other Pac-10 schools, sometimes making a 
donation for the opportunity, a Times investigation has shown.  
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Atty. Gen. James E. Doyle, whose office is investigating the UCLA 
ticket sale and how it might have forced University of Wisconsin fans to pay 
exorbitant prices, said Mazzone's additional purchases from other Pac-10 
schools were troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that information is correct, it certainly makes it worse in my eyes 
because it shows that this is an individual that was attempting to buy up and 
speculate in tickets," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone has yet to comment publicly on any of his ticket purchases and did not 
return phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's decision to sell Mazzone such a large block of tickets -- approved 
personally by Chancellor Charles E. Young -- has angered UCLA and Wisconsin 
fans who either failed to get tickets for the game or paid exorbitant prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Young apologized for the transaction but said UCLA officials 
underestimated the demand and feared they would be stuck with unsold tickets. 
Demand for tickets for the game, which marked the Badgers' first Rose Bowl 
appearance in 31 years, was the highest in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Times investigation, Mazzone bought: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 350 tickets from Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 232 tickets from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 80 tickets from Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 51 tickets from Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 20 tickets from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the 733 tickets, Mazzone had to, in some cases, make donations to the 
school involved. Mazzone, a former associate athletic director at UCLA, made a 
$100,000 donation to the UCLA athletic scholarship fund when he was allowed to 
buy the Bruin tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since each of the eight Pac-10 schools outside of Southern California received 
500 tickets, that means Mazzone controlled 733 of the available 4,000 tickets, 
or 18.33% of that market. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not buy any tickets from USC, Stanford or either Washington school. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,000 taken from UCLA's allotment of 41,586 as the Pac-10 team in the game 
represents almost 10% of that total. So, overall, Mazzone controlled 4,733 
tickets, which is 4.68% of the 101,237 tickets sold for the 1994 game between 
UCLA and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began when 1,000 or more Wisconsin fans wound up without 
tickets promised by ticket agencies. It triggered a class-action suit in 
Wisconsin and an investigation by Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said the Wisconsin investigation is continuing and the spokesman for the 
California attorney general said its own probe into the matter is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone paid face value of $46 for the Rose Bowl tickets he bought. Some 
tickets close to game time were being sold for as much as $1,000. The Times has 
reported that the majority of Mazzone's tickets were purchased by the Brooks 
Ticket agency in Los Angeles, but it has not been established how much he 
received. Ticket scalping is legal in California except on the premises of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 3083 by Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D -- Coronado), passed this week by the 
California Assembly, would regulate ticket brokering. It next goes to the State 
Senate, with the hope that passage would be in place in time for this summer's 
World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 UC spokesman Mike Alva said Friday that the office of the General Counsel of 
the Regents is examining the circumstances as a result of the class-action suit 
filed by Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of the normal process for the general counsel's office handling a 
lawsuit, the office is conducting fact-finding," said Alva. "There is not any 
investigation or review outside of the scope of the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal, Mazzone has bought Rose Bowl tickets for three years, but the number 
he received for the '94 game was far below his previous orders, said Jesus 
Mena, a spokesman for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone did not make a donation to the school this time, but, in previous 
years, he bought most of the available tickets and made small donations, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought 300 of the 500 tickets for the 1992 Rose Bowl game and donated 
$2,300 to $4,300 to the athletic department, Mena said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1993 Rose Bowl, Mazzone bought 277 of the 500-ticket allotment and 
donated $550 to $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Cal athletic director Bob Bockrath said that Mazzone, whom he had met 
in athletic circles a decade before, approached him a couple of weeks before 
the 1992 game about buying unsold tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year he bought the ones we couldn't sell," said Bockrath, now 
athletic director at Texas Tech. "If you're not in the game, people don't have 
an interest in going." 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Bockrath said, he called Mazzone, offering tickets to the 1993 
game. He said Mazzone didn't take all the available tickets and the rest were 
donated to a church youth group. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that Mazzone bought additional tickets to the '94 game beyond the 
previously reported 4,000 further alarmed Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's interesting, very interesting," he said. "This just adds to the 
substance and the perception of a problem that already exists. I'm concerned. 
We need to tighten up those tickets that we have for both conferences before we 
start offering them to ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some years the supply exceeds the demand. Some years, the demand exceeds the 
supply. But we have to show some discretion. I can't see the ticket buyer 
receiving priority over 21 schools (the total of the two conferences). That's 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Delany also said the overall allocation of tickets, just under 51,000 to the 
Pac-10 and 21,000 to the Big Ten, is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need something more equitable," he said. "This is not 1950. We are 
supposed to be equal partners with the Rose Bowl. If it's not going to be 
equal, we ought to at least do a better job of making it closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we have to monitor the marketplace better. The last thing we need is to 
have the scalpers and the ticket agents getting priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Ten has not been taken care of, but we never imagined a situation 
like this. We are going to have some decisions to make, but we hope to get it 
remedied. Our conferences share so much, this has to be done in fairness to the 
followers of both. We're talking about the fabric of the relationship of both 
conferences."

WET FORECAST DOESN'T WORRY HOLY BULL FANS; KENTUCKY DERBY: EARLY FAVORITE 
DEFEATED DEHERE ON A SLOPPY TRACK LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one has ridden more wire-to-wire Kentucky Derby winners in the last 18 
years than Angel Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been only three -- Bold Forbes in 1976, Spend A Buck in 1985 and 
Winning Colors in 1988 -- and Cordero was aboard the first two. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, the favorite in today's 120th Derby, will try to copy those three 
winners at Churchill Downs. Fourteen rivals are out to thwart him, and about 
130,000 fans are expected to be here, on a day that might be even soggier than 
Friday. The forecast is a 90% chance of rain and temperatures in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be only the third off Derby track in the last 24 years. Sloppy going 
generally helps front-runners such as Holy Bull, who was listed at 8-5 in the 
morning line Thursday based on his seven victories in eight starts, including 
the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes in his last two tries. He was 5-2 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven-furlong Futurity at Belmont Park in September, Holy Bull led all 
the way on a sloppy track and beat Dehere, last year's juvenile champion who 
was eliminated from the Triple Crown races because of injury early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On a track labeled good for the 1 1/16-mile Fountain of Youth Stakes at 
Gulfstream Park in February, Holy Bull was sixth and last, but a temporary 
breathing disorder, not the running surface, was given as the reason he ran so 
poorly. Dehere won the race, beating Holy Bull by 24 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it's not muddy," Holy Bull trainer Jimmy Croll said of the Derby. "I 
want everybody to have a fair track. But if it is off, I'll change his shoes 
and put on stickers." 
</P>
<P>
 Stickers are attachments that give horses better traction in mud, much as 
cleats help football players on wet fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, who roomed with Wayne Lukas in Arcadia for about six months more than 
a decade ago, when the trainer was between wives and the jockey was trying to 
crack the West Coast circuit, is rooting for Lukas' Tabasco Cat today. 
</P>
<P>
 But in looking at the Derby with his head instead of his heart, Cordero gives 
Holy Bull a big chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way he can lose is if somebody goes with him (early)," he said. 
"He's the big guy in the race, and somebody's got to hit him first. It's like 
in boxing, the only chance you'd have against Mike Tyson is to try to hit him 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, when only nine horses ran in the Derby, no one in the field could 
deliver an early knockout against Bold Forbes, who had won the Wood Memorial by 
4 3/4 lengths with his front-running style two weeks before. The presumed hole 
in Bold Forbes' resume was the same as the flaw in Holy Bull's, that he would 
be unable to last 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Honest Pleasure was also a front-runner. He came to Churchill Downs on a 
nine-race winning streak and was sent off as the 2-5 favorite, the lowest odds 
on a horse in the race since the Citation-Coaltown entry in 1948. Bold Forbes, 
trained by the late Laz Barrera, was the 3-1 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to go to the lead unless my horse broke bad," Cordero said. 
"There was another horse in there, Cojak, who had good speed, but it turned 
into a two-horse race. I was going out there with my horse, and if I got beat, 
I got beat. There was no way I was going to try to set off those other horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest Pleasure (and jockey Braulio Baeza) came at us four times, but by 
beating him to the lead, we took his weapon away. At the eighth pole, I thought 
he had me, but my horse didn't give up. He was so tired as I pulled him up 
(past the wire). He went down to one knee he was so tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Bold Forbes ran third in the Preakness, but came back to win at 1 1/2 miles in 
the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shocked me in the Belmont," Cordero said. "That was a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spend A Buck had won twice in April by 20 lengths at Garden State 
Park, Cordero was going to stalk the only other front-runner, Eternal Prince, 
in the 1985 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even thought a couple of other horses might go (to the lead)," Cordero 
said. "Sometimes there are jocks who like to steal to the front, just so 
everybody can see them on TV. But Eternal Prince didn't break good, and when we 
got off to 23 (seconds for the first quarter mile), my horse was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even ask my horse to break that fast, but when he did, I just let 
him go. On the first turn, we were so far ahead, I looked back and couldn't see 
any horses behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Spend A Buck was ahead by six lengths after half a mile and won by 5 3/4. That 
was the largest winning margin since Assault's eighth-length victory in 1946, 
and none of the winners in the eight years since Spend A Buck have won by more 
than 3 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus seems to be that Holy Bull will either win this Derby by a Spend 
A Buck-like margin, or finish far back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gets away like Spend A Buck did, he'll be hard to catch," Cordero said. 
"He's got the speed and the power and the class." Today's Kentucky Derby 
</P>
<P>
 The Run for the Roses. The best two minutes in sports. It takes place today at 
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where 15 3-year-olds will vie for the first 
jewel of the Triple Crown. It has been 16 years since Affirmed won the Kentucky 
Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, but until today's race is final, 
all are contenders to accomplish the rare feat. RACE FACTS

 Rain seems a sure bet today in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast is a 90% chance of rain. But the National Weather Service held 
out at least some hope that the Kentucky Derby won't be run in a downpour, 
calling for "a few periods of showers and thunderstorms."

<P>
 The high should be in the upper 60s, with southwest winds at about 15 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Derby to be run on a track labeled anything other than fast or good 
was in 1989, when Sunday Silence ran the 1 1/4 miles in 2:05 on a muddy track. 
That was the same time Tim Tam ran in 1958, which had been the last time the 
track had been labeled muddy. There have been 24 Derbies run on off-tracks in 
the previous 119 runnings of the race. THE FIELD 04,25,20,21,06 No. Horse

RAMS GET CHRIS CHANDLER AS BACKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' search for a backup to quarterback Chris Miller ended Friday when 
they signed free-agent Chris Chandler to a one-year contract worth $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler's salary includes a $500,000 base salary and a $100,000 signing 
bonus.His signing comes a day after Jack Trudeau, who worked out for the Rams 
earlier this week, signed a one-year deal with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram coaches have wanted Chandler since he visited Rams Park March 7, the day 
Miller signed with the team. They invited him back for a workout Wednesday and 
agreed to contract terms Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris is an outstanding acquisition for our team," said Joe Vitt, Ram 
assistant head coach. "He brings athleticism and veteran leadership as a solid 
backup behind Miller." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, 6 feet 4 and 225 pounds, has completed 585 of 1,066 passes (54.9%) 
for 6,769 yards and 34 touchdowns in his six-year career, which started in 
Indianapolis in 1988. He was traded to Tampa Bay before the 1990 season and 
split the 1991 season between the Buccaneers and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 His best season was in 1992, when he started 13 games in place of an injured 
Timm Rosenbach and completed 245 of 413 passes (59.3%) for 2,832 yards with 15 
touchdowns and 15 interceptions. He was a reserve last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also expect to receive by Monday the signed contract of free-agent 
wide receiver Greg McMurtry, who agreed to terms on a one-year, $500,000 deal 
with the team on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Richard Buchanan, who spent part of last season on the Rams' 
practice squad, signed a one-year deal with the team Wednesday. Also, the 
Chicago Bears came to terms with free-agent tight end Marv Cook, a former Pro 
Bowl selection with New England who had worked out recently for the Rams.

NEWSWIRE: JACKSON, TREADWELL CUT BY GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Mark Jackson and kicker David Treadwell got a lesson in the new 
economics of the NFL on Friday when they were released by the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Clarence Jones, a seldom-used three-year veteran, was also released 
after the team had rescinded its contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of Jackson and Treadwell, two former Denver Broncos who followed 
Coach Dan Reeves to the Giants, was a sign of the salary-cap times. Jackson, 
the Giants' leading receiver last season, had signed a three-year, $5-million 
contract in 1993, but he became expendable when the Giants drafted Thomas Lewis 
of Indiana in the first round and traded a draft pick to Denver for Arthur 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell, who led the Giants in scoring and made 25 of 31 field-goal 
attempts, had signed a two-year contract last August, but he was not used on 
kickoffs. The Giants preferred Brad Daluiso's long-distance kicks and he will 
get a chance to do both jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants also signed six free agents, among them punter Kurt Bloedorn of Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Browning Nagle, considered the New York Jets' quarterback of the future only a 
year ago, also felt the salary-cap crunch when he was released a day after the 
Jets signed Jack Trudeau. Indianapolis released Trudeau last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Nagle signed a contract that would have paid him $875,000 next 
season. Trudeau signed for $1,725,000 over two years, adding an additional 
burden to the salary cap of $34.6 million a team.

MORNING BRIEFING: RYAN MIGHT BE THE TICKET FOR CARDINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Season-ticket sales reportedly jumped from 27,000 to 40,000 the day the 
Arizona Cardinals hired Coach Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a surprise to me," Ryan told Chris Jenkins of the San Diego 
Union-Tribune. "I went to Philly and we sold 20,000 the first year. I figured 
the same thing would happen here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know I'm a winner. They're putting their money on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Ryan: He plans to use versatile Chuck Levy, the team's second-round draft 
choice from Arizona, on two-point conversion plays next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan told the Arizona Daily Star that quarterback Steve Beuerlein probably 
won't be on the field for two-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is take advantage of the situation," Ryan said. "I'm 
not going to worry about hurting Beuerlein's feelings. If it does, I'm not 
going to worry about that too much, either."

 Night light: Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson says baseballs are more 
juiced than ever this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching a fly ball by Kansas City's Gary Gaetti land in the upper deck 
at Tiger Stadium, Anderson remarked that the baseballs now have a lively glow 
and if you "take a baseball to bed with you, it will keep you up all night." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Before the NBA playoffs, former Laker Byron Scott, now with Indiana, had 
played in more postseason games, 142, than the rest of the Pacers combined, 
137.

 Turnoff: Tom Pukstys, the American record-holder in the javelin, said that he 
used to admire baseball players when he was younger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a guy that used to play for the Cubs named Rick Reuschel," Pukstys 
told Track & Field News. "But then I see this guy and all I see is him chewing 
tobacco, spitting -- a real heavyset guy -- it just didn't appeal to me that

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; CHAVEZ NEEDS THIS VICTORY FOR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez left this city three months ago, defeated and deflated, his 
face marked and swollen, his explanations bitter and betraying his frayed 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 At home in Culiacan, Mexico, after suffering a stunning defeat at the hands of 
Frankie Randall, he went into seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would cry," says his wife, Amalia. "He was depressed. His mind was 
everywhere else but at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Julio Cesar Chavez, hero to a nation and one of the great boxers of this 
era, going to let it end like this? Eighty-nine victories, one draw, and then . 
. . tears? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit, yes, I was sad," Chavez says. "Until I started training. 
That's when my attitude changed." 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't worry that his aura of invincibility has been damaged forever 
by the knockdown he suffered against Randall? 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Berlin wall fell down and they've accepted it, why not Julio?" Chavez 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at the same MGM Grand arena where he lost, Chavez gets his chance to 
avenge the majority decision that went to Randall on Jan. 29, his opportunity 
to back up his statements that he lost not because he was beaten by a better 
man, but because he had lost his love for boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps more than anything, tonight's rematch is Chavez's opportunity to 
set the stage for one last, triumphant year of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 If he cannot get past Randall, even those in Chavez's camp agree, he will 
never be considered among the greatest of boxing's stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to win this fight, and he has to win it impressively," says trainer 
Emanuel Steward, brought in recently to improve Chavez's regimen and style. 
"Otherwise he will go down in history as fighter who was well promoted, well 
maneuvered, had a great record, but never did hold up against the top-notch 
American fighters." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great statistics, but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, if he beats Randall, Chavez can propel himself back into a rematch 
against Pernell Whitaker, who is generally considered to have dominated Chavez 
in their infamous draw last Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he might go on fighting after a Whitaker rematch -- Chavez has 
repeatedly said he wants to fight Whitaker in September and retire in 1995 -- 
what would be a better valedictory for a fighter who has already had 27 title 
bouts? 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat by Randall seems to have focused Chavez on his path toward 
retirement, perhaps because he had never previously felt his own boxing 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he trained only 17 days for the first fight, treated it as if it was 
merely another sparring session, and that he was suffering from sore legs and 
ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's that we're getting old," he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept drinking (during training)," is how Steward puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ankle problem, Chavez says, might require surgery after tonight's fight, 
and Chavez has to realize that his body, now 31, will not withstand the 
pressure forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the prospect of being able to leave the sport on his own terms -- instead 
of in tears and fumbling for excuses -- what revived him? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very determined, very, very concentrated," Amalia Chavez says. "It's 
like what I remember he was like when he first started in boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 Steward says his only problem has been keeping Chavez from over-training. 
Chavez, for his part, says he hasn't trained with such fervor since he knocked 
out Edwin Rosario in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that there really weren't any real strong challengers out there," 
Chavez says. "I was always winning, winning, I took winning for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 If Chavez wins tonight, promoter Don King has dates set for Chavez to fight 
Meldrick Taylor in a rematch of Chavez's controversial 1990 victory, and 
possibly a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chavez rarely mentions any possible future opponents other than Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last month if he felt he had something to prove after he had the 
controversial draw with Whitaker and then was knocked down and beaten by 
Randall, Chavez snapped: "Do you think I have something to prove? After 90 
fights?" 
</P>
<P>
 After a pause, he continued: "I'll prove it to them on May 7. And then I 
expect to fight Whitaker and prove that one wrong too. Don't worry about the 
time frame. I, more than anyone, want to fit Whitaker into that schedule before 
I retire." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez has another, more poignant, motivation tonight: the memory of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the man expected to be the next president of Mexico before he 
was assassinated last month in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was from the northern part of Sonora, Mexico, not very far from 
Culiacan, and had been friendly with Chavez for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew him before he was a candidate, of course," Chavez says. "I had spoken 
with him that morning that he was assassinated." 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview in his hotel room, Chavez took a call from the outgoing 
president, Carlos Salinas, who, Chavez later said, was lending him a plane 
after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez says after he defeats Randall, he will fly directly to Sonora and lay 
his gloves on Colosio's grave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: A story in Friday's editions on Randall included several 
inaccuracies. Randall has a 49-2-1 record. He was 22-0 before losing to Edwin 
Rosario in 1985, and he did not lose to Fred Pendleton on July 4, 1986. That 
fight was a 12-round draw. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 As a sure sign of how strange the heavyweight division has suddenly become 
after Michael Moorer's upset of Evander Holyfield last month, the short list to 
find the appropriate opponent for Moorer's first title defense is headed by 
none other than almost-50, almost-retired, former television star George 
Foreman. Another possibility is almost-as-old Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 With World Boxing Council champion Lennox Lewis committed to other fights 
through this year, Moorer's camp is mulling an offer from Foreman's promoter, 
Bob Arum, who says Moorer could be guaranteed as much as $8 million, with 
Foreman taking a large cut of the pay-per-view money. Foreman, believing Moorer 
is vulnerable to any big heavyweight, wants the fight badly, Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lennox is not available, and I want a fight that will make the most money," 
said Moorer's manager, John Davimos. Moorer's trainer, Teddy Atlas, has given 
the go-ahead on fighting Foreman, Moorer apparently isn't against it, and the 
financial possibilities might surpass what could be earned against anybody 
except Lewis or Riddick Bowe, whom the Moorer camp doesn't want to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Davimos and Dan Duva, Moorer's promoter, had a meeting scheduled for Friday 
night in Atlantic City, N.J., to hash out the offers from "three or four 
different people," according to Duva, for an anticipated fall defense. The 
potential Foreman negotiations are further complicated by his recent statements 
during the end of TVKO's live telecast of the Moorer-Holyfield fight, Foreman 
implying that Moorer got the decision only because Duva, who was both Moorer 
and Holyfield's promoter, wanted it that way. That infuriated Duva, and 
Foreman's comments were edited from the HBO rebroadcast last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Duva, also Pernell Whitaker's promoter, said he wouldn't be watching tonight's 
Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie Randall fight with any particular interest. "Pernell 
would like to fight the winner of Chavez-Randall," Duva said. "But I don't 
think Don King will allow the winner to be beaten up that bad."

KENTUCKY DERBY AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times staff writer Bill Christine takes a look at the 15 horses running in 
today's Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in order of post position with 
starts, victories, seconds, thirds and earnings: 
</P>
<P>
 1. SOUL OF THE MATTER 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 6. W -- 3. P -- 1. S -- 2. Earnings: $205,700. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of Kandaly and Strodes Creek might write songs about their horses, 
but composer Burt Bacharach is here to win a race. Bacharach says that a 
musical tribute to Soul Of The Matter might come later. An upset would make the 
son of Private Terms the first West Virginia-bred to win a Derby. Trainer 
Richard Mandella and his veterinarians and blacksmiths have been battling a 
cracked hoof all year, but in his last two starts, the patched-up Soul Of The 
Matter won the San Felipe at Santa Anita and ran second to Southern Rhythm in 
the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 2. VALIANT NATURE 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 5. W -- 2. P -- 1. S -- 1. Earnings -- $421,500 
</P>
<P>
 The owner and breeder of Valiant Nature, former doughnut magnate Verne 
Winchell, is more than a casual participant. Ninety minutes after his colt's 
second-place finish to Holy Bull in the Blue Grass at Keeneland, Winchell was 
in Valiant Nature's stall alongside trainer Ron McAnally, examining minor leg 
cuts. "Isn't Verne something?" said his wife, Joan Winchell. "He even brought a 
flashlight." Valiant Nature has the same breeding as Tight Spot, a grass 
champion for Winchell and McAnally. "He's coming up to the Derby great," 
McAnally said. "Now it's just a question of whether he's good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 3. POWIS CASTLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 6. W -- 3. P -- 3. S -- 0. Earnings -- $229,421 
</P>
<P>
 Two necks and a nose have prevented Berry Gordy's colt from being undefeated. 
Gordy is hoping that he will have the same luck in his first Derby that he did 
with Argument, who won the Washington D.C. International for the Motown Records 
founder when he was new to the game. Trainer Rodney Rash is new to the Derby, 
but not to racing, having worked for Charlie Whittingham for 16 years before 
forming his own stable in 1991. Chris Antley, a new riding force in Southern 
California, has ridden Powis Castle in both of his second-place finishes this 
year and won the Derby with Strike The Gold in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 4. HOLY BULL 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 8. W -- 7. P -- 0. S -- 0. Earnings -- $990,760 
</P>
<P>
 Other trainers are wondering whether the Derby favorite's flipped-palate 
problem is behind him. That condition restricted his breathing and might have 
led to his only defeat. Trainer Jimmy Croll's equipment changes -- a different 
bit and a tongue tie -- have been successful in the two races since. "Mr. 
Croll's an excellent horseman," said trainer Gary Jones, whose Fali Time was 
moved up from fifth to fourth via a disqualification at the 1984 Derby. "But 
I've had a lot of horses with that problem, and you're never sure that it's 
going to go away forever." 
</P>
<P>
 5. ULISES 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 5. W -- 4. P -- 0. S -- 1. Earnings -- $33,221 
</P>
<P>
 He is an 11-1 shot in the parimutuel field, and might be the best bet to 
finish last, but he might get in Holy Bull's way early, giving the 
come-from-behind contenders a chance. Four of his five races were sprints in 
Panama, where few good horses race, but in the Lexington at Keeneland he hung 
on for third against Southern Rhythm and Soul Of The Matter. 
</P>
<P>
 6. MAHOGANY HALL 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 6. W -- 3. P -- 0. S -- 2. Earnings -- $153,610 
</P>
<P>
 The only horses this Woodman colt has beaten -- in two races at the New 
Orleans Fair Grounds and Turfway Park at Florence, Ky. -- weren't good enough 
to get to the Derby. His closing run in the Blue Grass for third behind Holy 
Bull and Valiant Nature was an illusion. The truth is, against good horses in 
his last two races, Mahogany Hall has been beaten by 25 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 7. STRODES CREEK 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 4. W -- 2. P -- 1. S -- 1. Earnings -- $122,600 
</P>
<P>
 Sons of Halo have won the Derby -- Sunny's Halo and Whittingham's Sunday 
Silence -- but Strodes Creek has history to overcome. He was unraced as a 
2-year-old, has raced only four times, has never won beyond a mile and never 
won a stake. "Those are the kind of things that will eventually be broken," 
Whittingham says. Arthur Hancock, the breeder and one-third owner of Strodes 
Creek, has his own rebuttal: A rarely seen bald eagle was recently spotted 
resting on a fence at Hancock's farm. "Charlie's the Bald Eagle and we see one 
at the farm," Hancock said. "Maybe it means something."

 8. GO FOR GIN 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 9. W -- 4. P -- 3. S -- 0. Earnings -- $399,540 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Nick Zito's hope hasn't won a significant race since November and 
couldn't get past Irgun in the stretch of the Wood Memorial in his last start. 
Chris McCarron got the mount when Jerry Bailey moved on, first to Irgun, then 
to Blumin Affair when Irgun was injured. An off track would help Go For Gin's 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 9. TABASCO CAT 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 9. W -- 5. P -- 1. S -- 1. Earnings -- $483,037 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas' horse has run well on a variety of tracks and has two 
victories and a second -- behind Brocco in the Santa Anita Derby -- in his last 
three tries. "We'll have no excuses," says Lukas, starting at least one horse 
in the Derby for the 14th consecutive year. In a year when many trainers are 
running their horses less -- the average number of starts for this Derby field 
is six-plus -- Tabasco Cat will be making his 10th start. 
</P>
<P>
 10. BROCCO 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 6. W -- 4. P -- 2. S -- 0. Earnings -- $968,550 
</P>
<P>
 His Santa Anita Derby victory was only a month ago, but Brocco looks like a 
different horse -- heavier, more muscular. His 1:00 3/5 five-furlong workout 
Monday was solid. His is a case of a horse being brought up to the Derby with 
nary a hitch. The only negative: Too many in the press box are picking him. 
</P>
<P>
 11. SMILIN SINGIN SAM 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 8. W -- 3. P -- 2. S -- 0. Earnings -- $241,005 
</P>
<P>
 When Albert and Dana Broccoli bought Brocco, they changed his name from 
Anytime Kris. Cot Campbell, who manages the Dogwood Stable syndicate that 
campaigns Smilin Singin Sam, wasn't enamored of the name that came with his 
$30,000 purchase, but the new owners haven't sprung for the $100 that the 
Jockey Club would charge to change it. After all, six of the last 11 horses 
winning the Derby had names that began with S. Arthur Hancock can see the 
reasoning in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 12. SOUTHERN RHYTHM 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 6. W -- 4. P -- 1. S -- 0. Earnings -- $205,655 
</P>
<P>
 This colt sharply rebounded from a dismal fourth in the Jim Beam Stakes to win 
the Lexington over Soul Of The Matter by 2 1/2 lengths. If it helps, some 
horsemen have selectively long memories. When Southern Rhythm drew No. 12 for 
the Derby, Buddy New, one of his owners, said, "That's a good omen. He broke 
his maiden from the 12 hole." 
</P>
<P>
 13. BLUMIN AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 8. W -- 2. P -- 4. S -- 0. Earnings -- $430,155 
</P>
<P>
 A closer who's always close at the wire, Blumin Affair hasn't won in five 
starts since beating allowance horses at Santa Anita in October. Trainer Jack 
Van Berg said that his horse is probably fitter than Alysheba was before his 
Derby victory, but the spacing of Blumin Affair's last two races could have 
been better. "I would have preferred an extra week," Van Berg said. "Either an 
extra week between Remington Park and Oaklawn Park, or an added week between 
Oaklawn and here." Blumin Affair was second, as usual, in both the Remington 
Park Derby and the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 14. MEADOW FLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 7. W -- 3. P -- 1. S -- 1. Earnings -- $200,900 
</P>
<P>
 Before his victory in the Flamingo, Meadow Flight was struggling in the 
allowance ranks and beat only one horse in the Swale Stakes at Gulfstream Park. 
He scored his Flamingo victory at 26-1. 
</P>
<P>
 15. KANDALY 
</P>
<P>
 * Starts -- 5. W -- 3. P -- 1. S -- 0. Earnings -- $246,050 
</P>
<P>
 "Go Kandaly Go" goes the song of the Louisiana Derby winner's 25% owner, Ron 
Lamarque. Hey, it worked for Lamarque's partner, trainer Louie Roussel, with 
Risen Star in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. But Lamarque can't start 
singing until the far turn, when Kandaly usually starts doing his serious 
running.

NOVEL DOESN'T STRAY FROM THE MANE IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey turned trainer Bill Shoemaker has a new profession -- mystery writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stalking Horse," a novel about a jockey unjustly banned in a race-fixing 
scandal, is the first of a three-book deal Shoemaker has with Fawcett Columbine 
publishers, a division of Random House.The two other books will be released in 
subsequent Kentucky Derby weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker, 62, paralyzed from the neck down since a 1991 auto accident, said 
he wrote the book with help from Dick Lochte, a mystery novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like mysteries," Shoemaker said. "In a way they remind me of watching a 
race. There's a starting point, then a period in which some surprises happen 
and finally you're in the home stretch and then somebody wins and somebody 
loses. The fun is trying to figure out who the winner will be." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's hero, jockey Coley Killebrew, will be a continuing character, 
Shoemaker said. Having retired from riding in 1990 after winning a record 8,833 
races, Shoemaker has since trained horses such as Diazo, which ran in the 1991 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mention in the book of a mistake Coley made in a Kentucky Derby," 
Shoemaker said. "I made the same mistake in the same race." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker misjudged the finish in the 1957 Derby and stood up early on Gallant 
Man, who was beaten by Iron Liege. MIKE DOWNEY

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FUMO DI LONDRA MAKES RIGHT DATE, NOT RIGHT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching Fumo Di Londra run on the first Saturday of May was what Sid and 
Jenny Craig had in mind when they bought the Irish-bred colt late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The race the Craigs were thinking about for today, though, wasn't the $107,500 
Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Derby was the target, but that plan was scrapped after the son of 
Indian Ridge finished last on March 6, 31 lengths behind Tabasco Cat, in the 
San Rafael Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Fumo Di Londra's first race on the main track, and after that 
debacle, trainer Ron McAnally decided to return him to the turf, on which he 
had won three of seven and was worse than third only once racing in Italy, 
England and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring rain, the one-mile Spotlight will be run on the grass, and Fumo Di 
Londra is the 2-1 favorite against seven opponents. The Spotlight is the first 
in a series of three races for 3-year-olds on the turf. The two others are the 
Will Rogers at 1 1/16 miles and the Cinema at 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Given 24 days off after the San Rafael, Fumo Di Londra has had six workouts 
since March 30, all on the turf. He went an easy half mile in 49 1/5 on 
Thursday. Alex Solis will ride him and they have the inside post. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the eight horses in the Spotlight are coming in after victories 
and Screaming Don's was a complete surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent off as the longest shot in the field at nearly 51-1, the Lyphard's Ridge 
gelding rallied to win the California Derby on April 16. Trained and owned in 
part by Lanny Sharp, Screaming Don had been badly beaten in the Southwest and 
Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark., and had never won a race 
anywhere except Turf Paradise in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Adalberto Lopez, who has done well since moving to northern California, rode 
Screaming Don in the Cal Derby and he has the mount again today. 
</P>
<P>
 The other colt looking for a second consecutive victory is Timbalier, who is 
running only the third race of his life for trainer Chris Speckert. 
</P>
<P>
 A son of Sovereign Dancer, he finished a fast-closing third at 62-1 in his 
debut after breaking well behind the field, then stretched out and broke his 
maiden on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Timbalier has trained sharply since and his breeding says he should handle the 
turf. With Eddie Delahoussaye busy riding Strodes Creek in the Kentucky Derby, 
Corey Black will ride Timbalier. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field includes Gracious Ghost, who has beaten only one horse 
in his last three starts; Halloween Treat, Unfinished Symph, who will race on 
Lasix for the first time; Sharp Phase and Crowning Decision, who scored his 
only victory by 6 1/2 lengths over the Hollywood Park turf last Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Spotlight is one of 17 races on which Hollywood Park will offer betting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Kentucky Derby, there will be five additional stakes 
simulcast from Churchill Downs. Post time for the first of those stakes -- the 
American Turf -- will be at 10 a.m. Two races from Golden Gate Fields will also 
be simulcast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North, who was originally scheduled to race next in the Californian 
in June, might run in the $150,000 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't etched in stone, but if he continues to do as well as he's been 
doing, we'll probably enter him," trainer David Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weights for the Mervyn LeRoy will be released Sunday. The Wicked North is 
scheduled to work that morning at Santa Anita.

CIF LETS OLD ELIGIBILITY RULES STAND; PREPS: NEW OPEN ENROLLMENT POLICY WON'T 
MEAN EASIER TRANSFERS FOR ATHLETES, AT LEAST FOR NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school athletes hoping to take advantage of the state's new open 
enrollment policy will have plenty of stumbling blocks regarding eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Interscholastic Federation Council, which governs high school 
sports in the state, voted down a motion Friday that would have granted 
immediate athletic eligibility to any student who transfers to a school within 
his district. 
</P>
<P>
 By this July, all public school students in California will be allowed to 
transfer to schools within their district, space permitting. The new 
legislation has created havoc for the CIF, which has strict transfer rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to comply with the new law, the CIF proposed granting immediate 
eligibility to intradistrict transfer students as long as the move was not for 
athletic purposes. After three hours of debate, however, most of the council 
members said the rule was too lenient and difficult to enforce. Many feared the 
shopping of athletes and building of all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sac-Joquin Section, one of 10 sections in the CIF, proposed an amendment 
that would have allowed a student one open enrollment transfer during high 
school to maintain eligibility. That was also voted down. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the council does not meet again until October, sections must adopt their 
own policies to deal with open enrollment. Several sections, including the City 
Section, said they will probably maintain current rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF usually only grants athletic eligibility to transfer students who have 
a change of residency or obtain a special permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get back to the office Monday, I will send a letter to all of our 
schools informing them that the old rules still apply," said Barbara Fiege, 
City Section commissioner. "I anticipate some angry calls from parents, but I 
think this is the best thing for the City. Instant eligibility could create a 
real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, said he will propose a rule 
change to his Executive Committee next month. He will ask it to grant immediate 
eligibility to open enrollment transfer students as long as the move is made 
before the start of the school year and is not for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 By failing to adopt a statewide policy, however, the CIF council faces several 
potential problems. It risks lawsuits by parents who could claim it is not 
following state law. And by granting sections autonomy on the issue, it 
increases the difficulty of ever coming up with a uniform rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is going to find out that (state) legislation supersedes 
everything else," said Andy Patterson, the CIF's attorney. "If there are 
conflicts, legislation will win out." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Byrnes, CIF commissioner, said this is the most difficult issue to face 
the state in many years, and he was not surprised by the heated debate. He is 
uncertain of the CIF's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may send it back to committee," Byrnes said. "Or we might do something 
else. I don't have many answers, but there are rules on our books that give our 
sections the right to deal with these matters on their own. So it is not a 
crisis yet."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; MINOR LEAGUE RELIEVER IMPROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers' top minor league reliever last season, right-hander Todd 
Williams, pitched well Thursday night in Albuquerque, an encouraging sign 
considering his elbow appeared destined for surgery during the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has a side-arm motion, suffered a torn ligament in his elbow in 
the Dominican Republic and did not pitch during the spring. The injury, which 
could still require surgery, appears to be healing with rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the disappointments of spring training because Todd had 
thrown well enough in the Dominican to be on a major league pitching staff," 
said Fred Claire, executive vice president. "He threw the ball well last night, 
and we will keep putting it to the test, but it is important if he has surgery 
to do it soon, so it does not impact next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 23, had 21 saves during the 1993 season, tops in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bruise on Barry Bonds' right elbow could sideline him for a week, Giant 
Manager Dusty Baker said. Bonds was available to pinch-run Friday but was not 
allowed to take batting practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I got hit there, I was out for four days," Baker said. "It's hard when 
you get hit there, because you have ball hitting on the bone and there is 
nothing to absorb the shock. I'd rather have this happen now than later." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, asked if Brett Butler's home run Thursday night gave credence to the 
juiced ball theory, said: "Butler's good for two or three homers a year. Now, 
if he already had two or three, then I'd say the ball is juiced." Butler had 
one home run last season. . . . Before Friday's game, Dodger starters had 
pitched into the seventh inning only three times in the seven games on this 
trip, which has put a strain on the bullpen. Manager Tom Lasorda said that's 
why he stayed with Ramon Martinez Thursday night, rather than removing him 
during the seventh inning when he started struggling. . . . Chan Ho Park will 
make his fourth start of the season tonight for double-A San Antonio. . . . For 
the record: Double-A Pitcher Nelson Castro was not released Thursday, as 
reported. Castro was designated for assignment, which means the Dodgers have 10 
days to remove him from the 40-man roster via trade, release or by reassigning 
him to a club in their system if he clears waivers. . . . Left-handed pitcher 
Kevin Rogers, who has been experiencing circulatory problems in his left arm, 
was put on the 15-day disabled. Left-hander reliever Pat Gomez was promoted 
from triple-A. . . . Despite reports that the Giants are interested in Ron 
Gant, General Manager Bob Quinn said he will not fit into their financial 
plans. The Giants, with a payroll of more than $40 million, already are 
committed next season to five players for $21 million. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISARCINA A HIT IN THE NO. 9 SPOT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina is going to be in the lineup almost every day no matter what 
he's hitting, so Manager Buck Rodgers considers the shortstop's early-season 
offense a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you get offense from a defensive player, it's a huge plus," Rodgers 
said. "It's like having a second designated hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina had a .306 batting average before Friday night's game and hit his 
first home run since June 11, 1993 in the third inning.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's always great to put together a month like that," DiSarcina said, 
"especially when you stay consistent and avoid the fluctuation between highs 
and lows." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said much of DiSarcina's success can be traced to his positive 
attitude as the No. 9 hitter in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to take pride in your role, whatever it is," DiSarcina said. 
"Some guys may take hitting ninth as a (slight), but I take it as a challenge. 
You can't just throw your bat up there and hope to get a hit. You lead off 
innings, you come up with men on base, it's a challenge." 
</P>

 Oakland first baseman Mark McGwire, who has been in Houston the last two days 
undergoing examinations on his sore left foot, was found to have a stress 
fracture in his heel. He was put on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to 
April 30. "We were hoping against hope that it was just scarred tissue in 
there," Manager Tony La Russa said, "but the good news is that, according to 
the timetable I heard, it's only going to be a month." . . . Jim Edmonds, who 
sat out five games after being hit in the neck with an errant throw while 
running to first base April 26, got his second consecutive start at first base. 
He struck out three times Thursday and twice more in the first two innings 
Friday. "My timing's just a little off," Edmonds said. "I guess that's how it 
is when you take a week off." JOHN WEYLER

</P>
<P>
 If a buyer isn't found within seven months, the Haas family could sell the

PARRISH FINDS PATIENCE IS HIS STRONG POINT; BASEBALL: HE RETURNS TO THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES AS A BACKUP CATCHER FOR THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Lance Parrish grinned that familiar grin, crossed his massive arms and leaned 
back against his locker with a look of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 This was two months ago, early in spring training. It had been a very nice day 
for the 37-year-old catcher. He had homered and thrown out a runner to help the 
Tigers defeat the Phillies in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a job," Parrish said that day. "I don't feel I'm just here as 
a guest." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Parrish found a job. It just didn't happen to be in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish couldn't unseat Mickey Tettleton or Chad Kreuter, so he elected to 
start the season at Toledo, Ohio, home of the Tigers' top farm club. He kept 
hoping either Tettleton or Kreuter would be traded for the pitching help the 
Tigers so desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Toledo because in my heart I deeply wanted to play for the Tigers 
again," Parrish said. "I thought it was going to happen. I figured the only 
marketable players they had (for pitching help) were either Mickey or Chad." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. Then he got a call from Pittsburgh. The Pirates were looking 
for a backup catcher. Parrish checked with the Tigers one last time. They told 
him they were sticking with Tettleton and Kreuter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish headed for Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I had been talking about maybe moving back to Michigan," Parrish 
said. "We made a lot of friends there in the old days. I was hoping that when 
my playing days are over, I could stay in the organization, maybe get into 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 That still might happen. Parrish was a big favorite of Tigers manager Sparky 
Anderson. It was Anderson, after all, who invited Parrish to spring training as 
a non-roster prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's happy to be back in the majors," Anderson said. "But his one regret was 
not coming back with the Tigers. It's too bad that couldn't work out, because 
he never should have left here in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I told him not to worry, that if I stay in this game, our paths will 
cross again. I think Lance would make a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Parrish was the toast of Detroit. He was a 27-year-old catcher 
whose home runs had helped the Tigers win the World Series. But he wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many baseball players, Parrish wanted big money. His agents told him he 
was worth it. Jim Campbell, the Tigers' general manager at the time, said he 
couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after the 1986 season, Parrish became a free agent and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife still gets mad at me for leaving the Tigers," Parrish said. 
"Sometimes, I'm sorry I did, too. But I had to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 He has played for four teams since then, being released by the last three: the 
Angels, Seattle and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The word was that he was washed up, that he had lost his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps plodding along, doesn't he," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pirates, he has been reunited with Pittsburgh manager Jim Leyland, 
who coached Parrish in instructional ball in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why I had such a positive attitude all through spring training," 
Parrish said. "I know a lot of people looked at me as just an invitee. But I 
looked at it as competing for a position." 
</P>
<P>
 As fate would have it, the winning pitcher in that long-ago spring game was 
Mark Leiter. The Tigers couldn't seem to find any use for him, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Leiter is in the starting rotation of the Angels. He is 2-2 with a 3.71 
ERA. That is far better than any of the Tigers' starters, whose ERA's range 
from Tim Belcher's 9.91 to Mike Moore's 5.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange business, this baseball.

DISSENTING SIMI VALLEY PARENTS MEET WITH PRINCIPAL; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: 
ATTORNEY REPRESENTING PLAYERS TO SEEK RESTRAINING ORDER ALLOWING SCYPHERS TO 
RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Baseball parents remain dissatisfied with officials at Simi Valley High after 
three of their representatives met Friday with principal Kathryn Scroggin 
regarding suspended Coach Mike Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Celusta, the leader of the group and mother of senior pitcher Nathan 
Celusta, has retained attorney Lawrence Trygstad to represent the players who 
will seek a temporary restraining order that could return Scyphers to the team, 
possibly as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trygstad said he hopes to speak with the school board on Monday and have a 
hearing on Tuesday. The players contend that Scyphers' suspension at this point 
in the year -- only three games remain in the regular season -- adversely 
affects the team, Trygstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be no compelling need to suspend Coach Scyphers at this 
point, so why not let the season play out so the team is not damaged and then 
conduct the investigation?" Trygstad said. "If any discipline were to be 
warranted, it could always be imposed at a later time." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, who brought the Simi Valley baseball program into national 
prominence during his 16 years as coach, was removed on Tuesday pending police 
and district investigations into possible financial and disciplinary 
improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 angry parents gathered at Simi Valley High early Friday morning 
to question school officials about the subject of the investigation. Police and 
school officials have refused to discuss the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin would allow only three parents into her office, Celusta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes, included Scroggin, assistant 
principal Denise Vale, assistant superintendent Susan Parks, Celusta, and 
parents Irene Michael and Kathy Kozlowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't (answer any questions)," Kozlowski said. "I basically just 
thought they talked in circles." 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin could not be reached for comment, but school board member Debbie 
Sandland said she believes the investigation of Scyphers is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sorry for the situation and my sympathies go out to the kids in the 
program and to their parents," Sandland said. "I'm sure it is a very difficult 
time for them but just because (Scyphers) is successful (on the field) doesn't 
mean we can turn our back on very serious concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting ended, Fred Boyer, the father of junior Brett Boyer, angrily 
confronted Scroggin outside the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked her a couple questions but we didn't get any answers," Boyer said. 
"There were a couple things I was upset about. . . . It sure does upset me, 
especially when the police have interviewed my child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the questions they asked my son kind of led me to believe they are on 
a witch hunt for Scyphers. I don't think they have anything, I think they are 
looking for something." 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Weaver, the mother of senior Jeff Weaver, asserted that the district 
violated its own policies this week because players were interviewed by police 
about Scyphers without a school official present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about that, too," Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers admitted he accepted $2,000 from an adult baseball league in return 
for use of the baseball field at Simi Valley High, a violation of state law. He 
also admitted to paying his assistant coaches with a portion of the money, a 
violation of Southern Section rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say police have questioned players about a team disciplinary practice 
in which players bid for the right to paddle each other. Such paddling is 
prohibited by the state disciplinary code, according to a state official. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though some parents might question those practices, they fear Scyphers' 
reputation has been unfairly tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for Scyphers because, if you agree with his coaching or 
whatever, they've kind of ruined his reputation," Boyer said. "I don't agree 
with everything he does, but I certainly think he's being mistreated."

ROYAL PRINCIPAL SAYS MAYE'S STORY CHECKS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal High has exonerated baseball Coach Dan Maye, who violated Simi Valley 
Unified School District policy by failing to report a payment made last year by 
an adult baseball league to reserve the high school's baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon what information I have, Mr. Maye did everything he could to do 
things properly," Royal Principal Mike McConahey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Thursday that Ted Severns, past president of the Thousand 
Oaks chapter of the National Adult Baseball Assn., said he paid Maye's brother, 
Steve, $250 to reserve the fields for games on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Maye, a minor league pitcher who was a member of his brother's coaching 
staff last year, has admitted receiving money from the NABA, but said it was 
less than $125. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Maye acknowledged he knew about the payment, but said he told Severns, 
"The school district should have received the money." 
</P>
<P>
 According to McConahey, Dan Maye "might have been remiss not reporting what 
happened," but added, "Unless some other information comes to my attention, the 
case is closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The NABA also provided baseball equipment to Newbury Park High last year in 
exchange for use of that school's fields without the knowledge of the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fabricius, Newbury Park's coach, said he accepted baseballs, batting 
helmets, bats and a home plate from the league because he "was skeptical" about 
taking a check. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated calls to the office and home of Newbury Park Principal Charles Eklund 
and to the office of athletic director Teri Scarpino on Friday were not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The admissions by Maye and Fabricius came after Simi Valley removed Mike 
Scyphers as baseball coach on Tuesday pending a police investigation into 
charges of financial and disciplinary improprieties.

VAN BUREN HAS ARRAIGNMENT DELAYED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 Ventura County prosecutors were granted a one-week extension Friday to 
determine if they will file charges against all-state football player Leodes 
Van Buren of Newbury Park High, who is suspected of firing a gunshot into his 
girlfriend's home last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren appeared in Ventura County Municipal Court on Friday for a scheduled 
arraignment, which was postponed for the second time at the request of the 
district attorney's office.His arraignment is now scheduled for May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 18, was arrested April 8 on suspicion of firing a single shot 
through the back door of Marcie James' home, after allegedly engaging in an 
argument with James, 19, a pitcher on the Moorpark College softball team. No 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Van Buren denied pulling the trigger, saying a companion did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors asked for the postponement because they and the 
sheriff's department are continuing their investigation into Van Buren's 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steven Hintz allowed Van Buren to remain free on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, a 6-foot-1, 190-pound wide receiver, helped Newbury Park win the 
Southern Section Division III championship last fall. He finished his high 
school career as the state's leader in receptions and receiving yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a scholarship to play football at Colorado. School officials have 
said the scholarship is in jeopardy pending the outcome of the case. KENNEDY

GLENDALE'S POWELL, WRIGHT SUSPENDED; COLLEGE TRACK: IN VIOLATION OF TEAM RULES, 
THE FRESHMEN WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE THE REST OF THE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hurdler Drue Powell and long jumper Mike Wright of the Glendale College track 
and field team have been suspended from competition for the rest of the season 
for violating team rules, Glendale Coach Tom McMurray said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two freshman athletes will not compete in today's Southern California 
junior college preliminaries at San Diego's Balboa Stadium.The preliminaries 
serve as the qualifying meet for the Southern California championships on May 
14, followed by the state championships at Cerritos College on May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray would not elaborate on the specifics of the violations, other than to 
say they occurred this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, the 1993 state high school champion in the 110-meter high hurdles for 
Reseda High, won that event in last week's Western State Conference 
championships at Bakersfield College. He has a personal best of 14.61 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a former three-sport standout at Glendale High, completed the 
requirements for a high school diploma at a Glendale continuation school last 
year before playing basketball for the Vaqueros last winter and competing in 
track this spring.  
</P>
<P>
 He has a personal best of 23 feet 9 1/2 inches in the long jump and finished 
second in the WSC championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Powell and Wright cannot compete for Glendale for the rest of the 
season, McMurray said, they are welcome to compete for the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Powell nor Wright could be reached for comment.

RESEDA'S ARREOLA GETS PUNCHED OUT; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: HE IS SUSPENDED FOR 
SEASON AFTER HITTING CHATSWORTH'S LACOUR DURING POSTGAME HANDSHAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe postgame handshakes aren't such a good idea after all. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Reseda High's Alonzo Arreola was suspended for the remainder of 
the season Friday for punching Chatsworth's Bryan LaCour in the stomach as the 
teams shook hands after a West Valley League baseball game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jeff LaCour, whose son was not hurt in the incident, said he has 
dismissed the idea of filing charges against Arreola. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over and done with," LaCour said. "The Chatsworth administration told me 
he would be suspended for the rest of the year. I'm satisfied with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred just a few weeks after the debate over the exchange of 
postgame pleasantries made national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a vote by Marmonte League administrators banned postgame handshakes 
because of the tendency for tempers to flare between players. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the ban was rescinded a few weeks later after coaches and 
administrators were bombarded with inquiries and criticism from media 
throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, emotion ran high during Chatsworth's 7-2 victory. Moments after 
the final out, Arreola, a senior third baseman, caught LaCour by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspended him on the bus on the way home," Reseda Coach Mike Stone said. "I 
talked to the whole team about it, including Alonzo. I made the decision before 
I talked to anyone at the school. I told the administration this morning what 
the decision was and they went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said his players were the target of barbs from the Chatsworth bench 
throughout the game. Stone also said LaCour stepped on Arreola's toes when the 
players met at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the incident, LaCour's father said he would consider filing 
assault charges against Arreola.

PIERCE FACES PLAYOFF EXCLUSION; COLLEGE BASEBALL: BRAHMAS, CONFERENCE 
CO-CHAMPIONS, MUST WIN TODAY TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A POSTSEASON BERTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To some it might sound like sour grapes, but Pierce College baseball Coach Bob 
Lofrano believes there is a flaw in the Western State Conference rules that 
determine divisional winners in case of ties. And his team could pay dearly for 
it today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been freaking around with our by-laws every year and it's getting 
ridiculous," Lofrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas have posted an excellent record (25-15, 17-8 in conference play) 
and tied Bakersfield for the South Division championship. Still, Pierce might 
not qualify for the Southern California regionals that start May 13 because of 
the WSC tiebreaking rules installed this season, the first for divisional play 
in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce needs to defeat Moorpark today at 1 p.m. at home to be considered for 
an at-large berth in the regionals. Moorpark was the North Division's 
second-place representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The predicament developed when Pierce lost on Thursday to Valley and had to 
share the South title with Bakersfield. Under the tiebreaking formula, 
Bakersfield earned an automatic berth into the playoffs and will meet Cuesta -- 
the North Division winner -- in a one-game playoff today to determine the WSC's 
No. 1 team for seeding purposes in the regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tiebreaker between Pierce and Bakersfield was head-to-head 
competition, but they split their four games. The second tiebreaker -- records 
within the division -- produced the same result. Each team was 14-6. Next in 
line was their results against Glendale -- the division team with the next-best 
record -- but the Brahmas and Renegades each beat the Vaqueros in three of four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The next team in line was Valley, which Bakersfield defeated four times. 
Pierce had defeated the Monarchs in their three previous games this season 
before Valley upset the Brahmas, 7-5, Thursday in the conference finale. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Pierce must face Moorpark to determine the Nos. 3 and No. 4 seeded 
teams from the conference. Only the top two teams are guaranteed automatic 
berths in the regionals and the third-seeded team has a fighting chance of 
gaining an invitation. The fourth team probably stays home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't we think of this before?" Lofrano said. "The teams (Pierce and 
Bakersfield) end up in a co-championship and you have to play for a third-place 
seed? It's ludicrous."

PUSHING INCIDENT ACCOUNT BY UMPIRE IS QUESTIONED; HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS: SCHOOL 
ADMINISTRATORS SAY VIDEOTAPE SHOWS KATELLA SOFTBALL COACH DIDN'T SHOVE GAME 
OFFICIAL TO GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One day after Katella softball Coach Rhonda Weyer pushed an umpire and a 
player during a game against Esperanza, people who viewed the incident on 
videotape have questioned umpire Mike Callahan's version of what transpired. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella Athletic Director Tom Danley said Friday night that three school 
administrators viewed the tape and told him that Callahan remained on his feet. 
Callahan told The Times he had been pushed to the ground by Weyer before she 
grabbed Esperanza catcher Julia Cappelli and pushed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan, who indicated he mailed a report to the Southern Section office on 
Friday detailing Weyer's ejection from Thursday's Katella-Esperanza softball 
game, left Friday for a 10-day trip and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident took place after Cappelli landed on top of Mendy Van Son, who was 
tagged out while trying to score the game-winning run in the bottom of the 
seventh inning of a game Esperanza eventually won in 12 innings, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyer, in her eighth year as Katella's coach, would not comment on either her 
status as coach or the incident as described by Callahan, but Esperanza Coach 
Cyndi Watson said Friday that Callahan did not fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Weyer) pushed (Callahan) to get to Julia but I don't recall seeing him 
knocked to the ground," said Watson. "But that's secondary to the fact she 
grabbed an opposing player." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Whitney, Katella's assistant athletic director and an assistant with the 
junior varsity softball team, spoke to Weyer on Thursday and that night 
recalled Weyer's account to The Times: "The catcher pounced on our (runner) and 
she went up to see if our player was OK, and she pushed the catcher out of the 
way and went on to see if our player was OK. Mike Callahan was going to write 
it up for CIF and indicated to Rhonda that he had to eject her even though he 
felt she was just going to aid her player. That's what she recounted to me."

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; COLD RAIN THREATENS OPENING ROUND OF 
MUCH-ANTICIPATED PRACTICE RUNS

 Prospects of a cold rain for today's opening round of practice for the 78th 
Indianapolis 500 dampened the spirits of crews as they unloaded cars and 
equipment Friday in Gasoline Alley. 
</P>

 With 109 cars entered -- only eight shy of the 1984 record -- teams were 
hoping for as much running time as possible before next Saturday's pole 
qualifying. The 33-car starting field for the May 29 race will be determined by 
four-lap (10-mile) time trials the next two weekends.

 Twelve rookies passed their orientation tests last week, one stage of which 
was running on the track at speeds of more than 200 m.p.h. Included were five 
Americans -- Scott Sharp, Bryan Herta, Mark Smith, Dennis Vitolo and Brian Till 
-- along with Jacques Villeneuve and Ross Bentley of Canada, Mauricio Gugelmin 
and Marco Greco of Brazil, Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, Fredrik Ekblom of Sweden 
and Hideshi Matsuda of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Herta took his test in A.J. Foyt's car, fueling speculation that the 1993 Indy 
Lights champion from Los Angeles might get the ride left vacant when Davy Jones 
and Foyt parted company last week.

 Indy car champion Nigel Mansell is especially eager to get started. Last year 
at this time he was in a Florida hospital, recuperating from back surgery. 
Although he arrived late in the week, he passed his rookie test and qualified 
eighth on the first day of trials before finishing third in the 500.

<P>
 "For me, Indianapolis last year was a bit of a blur," the English champion 
said. "I'd only just come off the operating table 10 days before. I'm just 
amazed, when I look back, that I got through the whole last week. So I'm 
looking forward to being there the whole time this year, and enjoying it as 
opposed to just putting up with it." SHAV GLICK

DOCTORS: SENNA DIDN'T DIE AT SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors who treated Ayrton Senna after he crashed during the San Marino Grand 
Prix have denied allegations that the Brazilian driver died at the Imola track. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna's brother, Edoardo, and some news reports suggested the 34-year-old 
Formula One star died at the scene Sunday, and that it might have been covered 
up to avoid the summoning of a coroner and an immediate investigation, causing 
the race's postponement. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Prix organizers must pay heavy penalties to commercial sponsors and 
television networks if a race is not held on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna, a three-time Formula One champion, was pronounced dead at 6:40 p.m. at 
Maggiore Hospital in Bologna, about four hours after he crashed at about 180 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital director Giuseppe Guerra said in a statement that medical reports 
"unequivocally show that Senna died at 6:40 p.m. Sunday when his heart stopped 
beating." 
</P>
<P>
 "Speculations about the truthfulness of what was reported by the doctors is 
injurious to their professionalism," Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, a 16-year-old Senna fan fatally shot herself in Curitiba, 
Brazil, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported. "I've gone to meet Ayrton 
Senna," Zuleika da Costa Rosa said in a note.

BOBBITT ACCUSED OF ASSAULT ON HIS ROOMMATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Bobbitt -- the man who gained international attention when his wife 
severed his penis -- was back in the headlines Friday, accused of roughing up a 
former topless dancer with whom he had been living. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas police said Bobbitt appeared to be "under the influence of alcohol 
or other substance" when he grabbed Kristina Elliot by the arm and shoved her 
into a wall at their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman suffered bruises but did not require medical treatment, according to 
Aaron Gordon, a spokesman for the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said the incident was "a misunderstanding that got blown out of 
proportion." He said Elliot, 21, was "more emotionally hurt than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she planned to press charges against Bobbitt, Gordon said, "It's 
about 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada law does not require the victim of domestic battery to pursue 
prosecution for an arrest to be made or charges filed. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report said the two were involved "in a verbal argument before 
Bobbitt grabbed her right forearm, causing a bruise, then shoved her into a 
wall, causing a bruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were required by Nevada law to hold Bobbitt for at least a 12-hour 
cooling-off period.

 John Sutro, a former president of the State Bar of California, civic leader 
and descendant of a pioneering California family, has died. He was 88.

 Sutro, who headed the State Bar from 1965 to 1966, died Monday at his home 
after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a partner in the San Francisco law firm bearing his family name, 
Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, from 1935 to 1971. He served as president of the San 
Francisco Bar Assn. and chairman of the Federal Judiciary Committee of the

FERDINANDO SCARFIOTTI; WON OSCAR FOR FILM ART DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ferdinando (Nando) Scarfiotti, the production designer who won an Academy 
Award for art direction of the epic 1987 film "The Last Emperor," has died. He 
was 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarfiotti died April 30 in Los Angeles after a brief illness, spokesman Henry 
Penner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian designer was responsible for the look of such stylish films as 
"Last Tango in Paris," "Scarface," "The Sheltering Sky" and 1992's "Toys," for 
which he was also nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scarfiotti was the most influential film designer of the last three decades," 
said director Paul Schrader, who worked with him on "American Gigolo" and other 
films. "His work has influenced an entire generation of directors and 
designers." 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary producer David O. Selznick coined the hazy term "production 
designer" in the 1930s to describe the tasks of William Cameron Menzies on 
"Gone With the Wind." The job is both conceptual and practical, involving 
coordination of art draftsmen, set designers and decorators to make color, 
light, locations and props reinforce a script. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Scarfiotti) was one of the best production designers that ever 
was," said director Barry Levinson, who had worked with Scarfiotti on "Toys." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won his Oscar for "The Last Emperor," a period piece filmed in 
Beijing's historic Forbidden City, Scarfiotti championed work on modern 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past is there to be studied and seen," he told The Times in 1990, "but 
the present is a changing reality. The challenge is to make a statement and 
look at it with a fresh eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarfiotti's most recent work was on the not-yet-released film "Love Affair," 
starring Warren Beatty and his wife, Annette Bening. 
</P>
<P>
 Born near Rome, Scarfiotti studied architecture at the University of Rome. 
Encouraged by Italian director and family friend Luchino Visconti, he combined 
his interests in theater and architecture to become a production designer. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked with Visconti on several operas, including "La Traviata" in Spoleto, 
Italy, and "Der Rosenkavalier" at London's Covent Garden, and on the film 
"Death in Venice." The film won him Britain's equivalent of an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Scarfiotti began working with director Bernardo Bertolucci on such 
films as "The Conformist," "Last Tango in Paris" and ultimately "The Last 
Emperor," which won nine Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall and elegant Scarfiotti, known for his wit and personal style, also 
put his visual stamp on films for Billy Wilder, Peter Bogdanovich, Brian De 
Palma and Michael Apted. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarfiotti is survived by his mother, Luisa of Rome; his longtime companion, 
Nicolas Valle; a brother, Emanuele; a sister, Giovanna DeVergottini, and a 
niece and nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Jeffrey 
Goodman Special Care Clinic.

MARVIN MILES, 82; FORMER TIMES AEROSPACE EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marvin Miles, retired aerospace editor of the Los Angeles Times who flew with 
Howard Hughes, was on a first-name basis with such aviation pioneers as Donald 
Douglas and the Lockheed brothers and was among the first reporters to witness 
both atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Melanie Meyer, said her father was 82 when he died Thursday at a 
Glendale hospital of complications of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles began at The Times in 1935 and became aviation (later aerospace) editor 
in 1941. He retired in 1976, having become almost as well known in aviation 
circles as the people he wrote about. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the jump seat of jets breaking the sound barrier, and was aloft when 
the first airborne hydrogen bomb was dropped at Bikini atoll in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the first demonstration of an atomic cannon and the third test of the 
atomic bomb, was among the first journalists allowed behind the Berlin Wall, 
and swapped stories about these and other adventures with fliers Chuck Yeager 
and Pappy Boyington. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his longtime friendship with Hughes, he was part of a panel that in 
1972 used a phone hookup from the Bahamas to interview a man said to be the 
billionaire recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting questions to Hughes based on their long relationship, Miles said he 
was satisfied that it was indeed the mysterious industrialist on the other end 
of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes had helped arrange the interview to deny that he had anything to do 
with a biography that was to be published by McGraw-Hill, in which author 
Clifford Irving said he had worked closely with his subject. Hughes repeatedly 
denied ever talking to Irving, much less meeting him regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving was later imprisoned for grand larceny in connection with the sale of 
the fake biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles' awards ranged from organizations such as the Air Force Assn. to the 
national Aviation Writers Assn. to the Civil Air Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Betty, another daughter, Marilyn, and six 
grandchildren.

 The last survivor of a wartime bomber nicknamed "Big Jeff" took the controls 
of one of the last surviving B-17s and piloted it over the Southern California 
coastline.  
</P>
<P>
 Clutching the controls to guide the old war bird, Kingsbury, now 73, was able 
to let loose of feelings that have haunted him since Aug. 19, 1943 -- the last 
time he flew a Flying Fortress. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the day his lumbering, 30-ton aircraft was riddled by machine gun 
fire from German Messerschmit fighters. One wing was nearly blown off. Two of 
the plane's four engines were on fire. Five crew members lay dead or dying in 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Crippled and falling from the sky, the "Big Jeff" was surrounded by enemy 
attackers. Kingsbury, 22, gave the order to bail out. The four crew members in 
the front of plane struggled into their parachutes and jumped 19,000 feet over 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the bombardier and the navigator couldn't swim. My engineer was a big 
strong guy, but he didn't know celestial navigation and wouldn't know which way 
to swim at night," Kingsbury said. The co-pilot apparently floated his 
parachute toward the sea, instead of directing it toward land. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Kingsbury 32 hours to swim 21 miles through shark-infested waters to 
the Italian shore. There, he was captured and held for 22 months as a POW. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew was like a family," Kingsbury said Friday as he waited to climb into 
the B-17 parked at the Palomar Airport in Carlsbad. In his hand was a framed 
photograph of the men of the "Big Jeff" posing with Kingsbury's pet dog, named 
Little Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of problems being the sole survivor. I've wondered if I did 
the right thing. What could I have done? I spent a lot of sleepless nights. 
Nobody knew about it except my wife, Kay. I finally went to a psychiatrist over 
it." Kingsbury's buddies at a South Gate B-17 veterans groups arranged Friday's 
odyssey.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon it was time to take off. Kingsbury climbed into the back of olive-drab 
bomber, squeezed past the waist guns and made his way across a narrow bridge 
over the bomb bay to its cramped cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dead ringer for "Big Jeff," Kingsbury decided. Restored at a cost of 
$675,000, the old B-17 is flown across the country each year by a nonprofit 
historical group, the Collings Foundation of Stow, Mass. It will fly with a 
B-24 in and out of Orange County, Torrance, Camarillo, Riverside and Pomona 
airports during the next week, and $7 public tours will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-17 lifted off and turned lazily over the coast. Collings Foundation 
pilot Ted Stewart turned over the controls as the bomber reached the ocean. 
"Level off at 2,500 and make a 360 to the left," he told Kingsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired plumbing contractor complied. The noise from the plane's four 
engines was drowned out by the roar of wind rushing through the openings for 
the B-17's waist guns and the open hatch atop its 19-foot-high fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 The turn was smooth. The smile was wide. "For a while there I had your lives 
in my hands," Kingsbury said with a laugh after climbing out of the pilot's 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kingsbury, the flight ended too soon at Orange County's John Wayne 
Airport. As the bomber taxied to a stop, he gazed around the cockpit one last 
time. He was glad to be climbing out of the plane, not bailing out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old sounds and smells are here," he said. "This has brought a lot of 
memories back." 
</P>
<P>
 This time they were different memories, though. There was no longer any doubt 
for Kingsbury. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's cramped interior made it clear that he could not have helped the 
men in the back. And its controls affirmed that there was no way to fly the 
"Big Jeff" to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a sluggish old thing," Kingsbury said. "I thought I'd never have a 
chance to fly one again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was remembering all the good times I had with the crew. I was in heaven."

POOL EXCAVATION REVEALS HUMAN BONES; CRIME: GRISLY DISCOVERY SHOCKS EXCLUSIVE 
SAN MARINO. NEIGHBORS RECALL MYSTERIOUS GOINGS-ON IN THE HOME AND A YOUNG 
COUPLE THAT VANISHED NINE YEARS AGO. 
</P>

<P>
 The person they found, whoever he or she was, had the misfortune to be the 
apparent victim of a murder. The murderer, whoever he or she was, had the poor 
taste to bury the dismembered body in a back yard in the exclusive city of San 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were not saying much Friday, other than to confirm that the trisected 
skeletal remains had been unearthed during a swimming pool excavation behind a 
spacious home on Lorain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the neighbors were talking a lot -- about the young man and 
woman who had been living there and disappeared nine years ago, about a 
mysterious tenant, about the young man's mother, who died in poverty a few 
years later, and about how crimes such as this are not supposed to occur in 
places such as San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I live on the north side of Huntington (Drive)," a trim woman in a spiffy 
tennis outfit told reporters gathered in front of the two-story house on Lorain 
Road. "This is on the south side. Some people call this 'Sub Marino.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed Friday that the remains 
found Thursday afternoon -- buried about four feet deep in three plastic bags 
-- apparently belonged to one person. Detectives said that person "may have 
been a previous resident missing since 1985." 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino police said there were two residents of the Lorain Road home on 
whom missing persons reports were filed in 1985 -- Jonathan Sohus and his wife, 
Linda Sohus, in their late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said it had not been determined whether the victim was a 
man or a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators had little to add, except to say that the current 
residents of the house -- Ray Parada and his wife -- are not suspects in the 
case. The Paradas moved in a few months after the Sohus couple disappeared, and 
rebuilt the house, virtually from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the neighbors, some of whom have lived on the quiet, tree-lined street 
for decades, who were able to provide a history of the place that stretches 
back more than 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Ruth (DiDi) Deidrick moved there at about age 12 in 1928, when her 
parents built a modest, Spanish-style house, one of the first homes in the 
newly subdivided neighborhood, according to Mary Ann Kent, who lives down the 
block. After Ruth's father and mother died, she continued to live in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruth was such a free spirit . . . very artsy," Kent said. "She was married 
several times . . . there were four, maybe five husbands, I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, Ruth had a son, Harry. And when she married Bob 
Sohus, they adopted another boy, Jonathan, known throughout the neighborhood as 
Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the adoption, Bob and Ruth Sohus divorced. Harry, who had 
become an adult, moved out, and Ruth Sohus was left to raise Jonathan alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She adored the ground he walked on, and she tried to be a good mother, but it 
takes two to raise a kid," Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "DiDi was sweet, but she drank a lot," said another neighbor, Lynda Morck. 
"The place was several degrees below slovenly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny was a loner," Kent said. "He started getting into mischief." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jonathan grew to adulthood without serious trouble, the neighbors said. He 
worked at various jobs and continued living in the home with his mother. An 
elderly woman rented an apartment at the rear of the property for a while, and 
after she left, a man moved into the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The man -- no one remembers much about him -- was living there when Jonathan 
married Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny said they were going somewhere for a job interview and then to Europe 
for a delayed honeymoon," Kent said. "They just disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 "They never got to the airport," Morck said. "DiDi kept asking everyone if 
they'd seen Jonathan. No one had." 
</P>
<P>
 "When DiDi filed the missing persons report, the police told her: 'They're 
over 21. If they want to drop off the face of the earth, they can do it,' " 
Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent said the disappearance left DiDi Sohus heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
 "And by then, she was impoverished," Morck said. "She moved to a trailer camp, 
and a year or two later, she died." 
</P>
<P>
 The home was sold to the Paradas. Like many of the once-modest houses south of 
Huntington, the structure was largely dismantled and rebuilt into the 
substantial home that stands there today. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, contractors began work on another improvement, a new swimming 
pool at the rear of the property. Pool builder Jose Perez said a small tractor 
was digging a hole for the pool Thursday when the grisly discovery was made. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent murder is the first homicide to be investigated in San Marino 
since a Taiwanese businessman was shot to death in the driveway of his home on 
Bradbury Road in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only the fourth murder in the history of San Marino," said the woman in 
the tennis outfit, who identified herself only as "Kathy, the killer tennis 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice, quiet town," Kathy said. "We're said to be better known for 
our good school system and our manicured lawns."

GRAND JURY TO HOLD HEARING ON MALIBU BLAZE; INVESTIGATION: SEVERAL OTHER 
FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE AT THE SCENE NOV. 2 SAY THEY BELIEVE THE SUSPECTS ARE 
TELLING THE TRUTH. OFFICIALS DISCOUNT A THEORY THAT A DOWNED POWER LINE IGNITED 
THE FLAMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Roughly half a dozen witnesses have been ordered to appear at a three-day 
grand jury hearing later this month as prosecutors attempt to assess the case 
of two Southern California firefighters accused of igniting last year's deadly 
Malibu/Calabasas fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who are expected to appear are the two suspects -- Nicholas A. 
Durepo, 24, and Steven R. Shelp, 29 -- and several people with whom prosecutors 
believe the two men may have discussed their activities on Nov. 2, the day of 
the fire. Their girlfriends and other people close to Shelp and Durepo are 
scheduled to appear for the hearings, which have been set for the week of May 
16, sources close to the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have denied any wrongdoing. No charges have been filed against either 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming hearings will mark the third time that the grand jury has heard 
evidence in the case, although the two previous sessions were reportedly brief 
ones. Already, grand jurors have taken testimony from the parents of Yumi 
Sakaida, a close friend of Shelp. Durepo and Shelp have told investigators that 
they spent part of the day of the fire at the Sakaidas' house in Topanga, and 
the parents reportedly were questioned about the two men's whereabouts during 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pulled in some of Durepo's friends," one person familiar with the case 
said. "They went after people who he had just spoken to." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp, who was a volunteer firefighter at the time of the Nov. 2 blaze and has 
since been hired by the Los Angeles City Fire Department, has denied any 
wrongdoing and told some friends that he believes the fire actually was caused 
by a downed power line along Old Topanga Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 That view is echoed privately by some firefighters, including some of those 
first to arrive on the scene of the Nov. 2 blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they did it," said one firefighter whose company was among the 
first to arrive at the originating point of the Malibu fire. "I don't think 
this investigation focused on how the fire started but on how to get these 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other firefighters who helped battle the blaze, all speaking on the 
condition that they not be identified, said they saw a power line down in the 
charred ruins of the field where the fire started, and passed that information 
on to arson investigators. In addition, a number of residents recall that their 
power went out before they saw signs of fire, leading them to the conclusion 
that an electrical line might have sparked the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But as new details trickled out Friday regarding the status of the 
investigation, law enforcement sources and power company officials said 
detectives eliminated that possibility early on in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. County fire and sheriff's homicide (units) both investigated the 
cause of the fire extensively," said Kevin Kelly, a spokesman for Southern 
California Edison. "Our information is that there was no power pole involvement 
in the starting of the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick LaSance, the electro-mechanic foreman in charge of the area for the Los 
Angeles Waterworks, also was summoned to the fire scene days after the blaze to 
help sheriff's investigators determine if the utility's telemetry wires could 
have been a factor. The 24-volt telephone wires -- those closest to the exact 
origin of the fire -- allow the utility to determine if there is water in two 
tanks just above the origin of the fire, but those wires were also ruled out as 
a potential cause of the blaze, according to a utility official. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no signs of arcing from a downed power line in the area, said one 
source familiar with the investigation, adding that authorities believe the 
line came down after the fire had begun, not before. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Ablott, an arson specialist with the Sheriff's Department, led the arson 
investigation and ruled out the possibility of power lines causing the fire. At 
a news conference last November, Ablott told reporters he had determined that 
the fire was arson only after ruling out every other possibility -- a common 
approach in arson investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence of an accidental fire or anything to indicate that the 
fire was accidentally started," Ablott said that day. "There's only one thing 
that could cause that to ignite . . . and that's an open flame." 
</P>
<P>
 Ablott's work was reviewed and approved by other arson specialists, sources 
close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having dismissed the power line as the culprit, investigators theorize that 
Shelp and Durepo chose the hillside location because they thought they could 
start the fire there and still contain it. 
</P>
<P>
 The area where the fire started is next to a 400,000-gallon water tank, has 
two fire hydrants nearby and is bisected by roads, which can act as fire 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that the two young men, both of whom were experienced 
volunteer firefighters, picked that location because they felt they could put 
out the hillside blaze and then be hailed as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 That theory of the incident, however, has been sharply contested by the 
suspects, who insist that they happened upon the fire just as it was taking 
hold. In interviews shortly after the blaze, the two men said they had spotted 
the fire as they were driving by in Durepo's blue pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two men have not been available for comment this week, they 
previously said they tried their best to extinguish the blaze. Witnesses recall 
the two men spraying the fire with a garden hose -- which had been hooked up to 
a fire hydrant using a special adapter that Shelp and Durepo told investigators 
they obtained from a passing plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators so far have not been able to locate that plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 When one area resident, Ron Mass, was badly burned in the blaze, Shelp and 
Durepo tried to assist him as well. Photographs from the scene show the two of 
them spraying Mass with water and tending to him in the bed of Durepo's pickup 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing those acts of heroism, friends and relatives of Shelp and Durepo have 
characterized the investigation as the work of overzealous and misguided 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firefighters, including some of those who met Durepo and Shelp on the 
morning of the Malibu blaze, agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Several firefighters -- all of them speaking anonymously because they said 
they had been warned by the Fire Department management to refrain from giving 
interviews -- said Friday that they remembered seeing Shelp and Durepo along 
Old Topanga Canyon Road during the early moments of the Malibu blaze. Those 
firefighters said the two men were acting anything but suspiciously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys weren't nervous at all," said one. "They were just anxious to help 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another: "I feel that these were just two guys that tried to stop and 
help and were in the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the firefighters interviewed Friday said they had been questioned 
by authorities conducting the probe and felt that those investigators were bent 
on identifying Shelp and Durepo as suspects.  
</P>
<P>
 "From the thrust of their conversations with us," said one, "they were out to 
get these guys from minute one."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PLANE SHOW GIVES LIFT TO YOUNG, OLD

 Before the cloud bursts Friday, vintage airplane enthusiasts gathered to view 
a World War II B-17 bomber and other restored airplanes on view this weekend at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit group based in Massachusetts restores the planes and flies them 
around the country to display them and to teach people about the aircraft used 
to defeat the Axis powers. 
</P>
<P>
 A fully restored B-17 Flying Fortress flew Friday from San Diego and landed 
about 4 p.m. before a small audience. A B-24 Liberator bomber was scheduled to 
accompany the B-17 but had engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It was expected to land late Friday to be on display along with a P-38 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the World War II era, more than 12,000 B-17s were produced and 4,750 
were lost in combat. Now, less than a dozen are flyable. 
</P>
<P>
 The B-24 dropped more bombs and flew more combat missions than any other 
aircraft during WWII. 
</P>
<P>
 The P-38 was the first long-range fighter and was used primarily as fighter 
escort for bomber squadrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Furlong, 70, a Marine Corps airplane mechanic during WWII, brought his 
grandson to see the planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Furlong said it was interesting to see the B-17, 13-year-old Aaron 
Davis, his grandson, eagerly inspected the plane and waited to tour the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron has built 58 models of aircraft. He put his first one together when he 
was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the way they looked," Aaron explained. "I had heard stories from my 
grandpa and movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron, of Tustin, said it sometimes takes a month to paint and assemble a 
complex model. He's now working on a 200-piece model of a B-17, the very plane 
he came to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look majestic compared to the models," Aaron said, as he stood under the 
wing of the vintage plane. "You see all the detail." 
</P>
<P>
 R.E. "Bud" Kingsbury is all too familiar with the details of the B-17. He was 
shot down while piloting one over Italy in 1943, and was the only survivor out 
of a crew of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury was one of the two pilots who brought the plane to rest in front of 
the Martin Aviation terminal at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought back a lot of memories," said Kingsbury. The noise, the smell and 
the vibrations all brought to mind his bombing flights with crew members. "We 
lived together," Kingsbury said. "It was like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 The planes are on display at the Martin Aviation terminal, 19301 Campus Drive, 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior tours of the planes cost $7 for adults and $3 for children. People 
can view the outside of the planes for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing hours are from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. today and from 8:30 a.m. to 2 
p.m Sunday. WILLSON CUMMER

 Long before the S & L scandals . . . "The Great Los Angeles Swindle," a new 
book by Jules Tygiel, profiles C.C. Julian, a flamboyant oil and mining stock 
hustler who committed suicide in 1934 after being indicted for mail fraud. Some 
tidbits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prior to the big oil finds here early in this century, a reporter wrote that 
fuel was so scarce in L.A. that local businessmen would "utilize for their 
furnaces the dried manure of the streets."  
</P>
<P>
 * One con man observed in the 1920s that when it came to picking a victim for 
a get-rich scheme, "stock sellers know the average physician will fall quicker 
than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * The ads sent East by Julian for one mining venture "reportedly depicted 
ocean steamships laden with lead ore docked in Death Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 * Film rights to "What Price Fugitive?" the autobiography of Julian, was 
purchased several years ago by actor George Hamilton, who "has attempted to 
interest producers in a film based on Julian's version of events." 
</P>
<P>
 * One businessman indicted (though acquitted) on usury charges was L.A. 
plumbing magnate Harry M. Haldeman. His grandson was H.R. Haldeman, "a plumbing 
expert of a different sort (who) would become embroiled in his own celebrated 
scandal," Tygiel notes.

KING'S ATTORNEYS REST CASE IN CIVIL SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for Rodney G. King rested their case Friday after a former deputy 
chief for the Los Angeles Police Department took the stand and blamed former 
Chief Daryl F. Gates for King's beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Reiter, who retired from the department in 1981 and is a police 
consultant, said he was called a Judas by Gates after he criticized the police 
chief's management style. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, Chief Gates' actions created an organizational environment 
that could make an incident like the Rodney King beating likely to happen," 
said Reiter, the last of 22 witnesses called by King's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 After the attorneys rested their case, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies 
dismissed the jury for the weekend and heard a motion from the defense to drop 
seven defendants, including Gates and six remaining "bystander officers." 
Davies will also consider a request to drop former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and 
Officers Laurence M. Powell, Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy Wind from the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to take this motion very seriously," said Davies, who will take up 
the issue Monday. "If I feel people should be let out, they are going to be let 
out, and let the chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, King's lawyers dropped four defendants, leaving 11 defendants in 
the trial to determine whether punitive damages should be assessed in the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors have already awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' 43-year law enforcement career ended with his 1993 resignation after 
criticism over the King case and the riots that followed the not guilty 
verdicts in the state trial. Powell and Koon were convicted of violating King's 
civil rights in a federal trial last year and are serving 30-month prison 
terms.

<P>
 Palm readers, massage therapists and tarot card readers will appear at the 
three-day Psychic Faire this weekend at the Hyatt Newporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, which began Friday evening and ends Sunday, caters to both believers 
and skeptics, and it will feature a wide variety of supernatural and 
astrological experiences, said Kathleen Scott, fair organizer and veteran 
astrologer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 18 psychic guests will be Bonita Kent, a script channeler who claims 
she can write down the words being communicated to her by the dead; Natalie 
Kahn, who draw psychic portraits, and Diana Gale, creator of the radio show 
"Tap Dancing Through the Mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who has been practicing astrology for almost 20 years and has organized 
previous psychic fairs, said she doesn't expect people to believe the power of 
psychic phenomenon until actually seeing it done firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to see it for yourself," she said. "I have had psychics (coming to 
the fair) for their psychic readings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Newporter is at 1107 Jamboree Road in Newport Beach. The fair's 
hours are from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.

ELECTRIC CARS TOUTED AS PLANT OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists and businessmen used the dedication Friday of a Carson-area 
electric vehicle assembly plant to tout the fledgling industry the week before 
the California Air Resources Board votes on moving forward with its mandate for 
mass-produced electric cars beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the U.S. Electricar plant, which can convert up to 60 cars a 
month, demonstrates that adequate technology is available for major 
manufacturers to build the mandated 20,000 to 25,000 emission-free cars yearly, 
said the firm's chief operations officer, Carl Dean Perry. "The time is now," 
he said. "The quality, safety and reliability of the product are here." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the plant, which began training workers last year with the assistance 
of $210,000 in grants from the cities of Los Angeles and Anaheim, illustrates 
the limitations as well as the promise of the emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Electricar, headquartered in Sebastopol, Calif., and billed as one of the 
largest electric vehicle manufacturers in the world, plans to serve a niche 
market only, supplying vehicles to utility firms and fleet operators rather 
than to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials announced Friday that their first contract for the Los 
Angeles plant would be for the conversion of five Geo Prizm sedans and five 
Chevrolet S-10 pickups for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
Although the sticker price on the Geo Prizms is less than $13,000, the 
converted cars will cost about $40,000 each. The cost will decrease 
considerably as the industry grows, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles will have a maximum speed of 70 m.p.h. and be able to travel 50 
to 75 miles before needing several hours of recharging. 
</P>
<P>
 State Environmental Protection Agency Secretary James Strock said 
emission-free autos can in the long run provide an environmental and economic 
boon to the smoggy Los Angeles area, where manufacturing jobs have been drying 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which is due to increase its work force to 100 by year's end, has 
been billed by its owners as a "South-Central Los Angeles" facility bringing 
jobs to victims of the 1992 riots. However, it is actually in an industrial 
area near the intersection of the Harbor and San Diego freeways, more than 60 
blocks south of South-Central. The mainly Latino and African American 
employees, who earn from $7 to $14 an hour in the non-union jobs, hail from 
communities as far-flung as Long Beach, Santa Monica, North Hollywood, Anaheim 
and Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fantastic opportunity, and a good opportunity to make good things 
happen for the future," said electrical technician William Land, 23, a Leimert 
Park resident who joined the firm after completing a post-riot auto mechanic 
training program.

WOMAN ARRESTED IN ABDUCTION OF NEWBORN; KIDNAPING: A TIP FROM RELATIVES OF THE 
SUSPECT LEADS POLICE TO BOYLE HEIGHTS HOME WHERE THE BABY IS FOUND UNHARMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Baby Liborio Gonzalez Jr. was back in his mother's arms Friday, thanks to a 
late-night 911 tip from relatives of a woman suspected of randomly abducting 
the infant as he slept at White Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Susan Cervantes, 39, of Boyle Heights, who police said took the 
baby from his mother's bedside, was arrested without incident on suspicion of 
kidnaping. Police said Cervantes has daughters of her own but took the infant 
simply out of desperation to have another baby. She remained in custody Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was returned unharmed to his mother, Guadalupe Gonzalez, 34, at the 
hospital, less than a mile from Cervantes' house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words cannot express how scared I've been," Gonzalez said, crying as she 
clutched the baby after a morning news conference at the Hollenbeck Division 
police station. "I'm totally happy now." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Cervantes' relatives became suspicious after she returned home 
with the child. She reportedly told some of them that she gave birth to the 
infant while doing time in Los Angeles County Jail recently on a theft 
conviction. She told others that the baby was her grandchild, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were conflicting statements to family members once she had the baby 
back at the residence," said Lt. Mike Felix. "Family members started putting 
two and two together." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30 p.m. Thursday, police said, they received a call from a relative 
of Cervantes whom they declined to identify, telling them that the baby boy was 
at Cervantes' home in the 1100 block of Marietta Street. When they arrived, 
they found the infant still wrapped in his pink-and-blue hospital blanket, 
sleeping on Cervantes' bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix said Cervantes admitted to police that she took the child at random from 
the maternity ward of the hospital, in the 1700 block of Cesar E. Chavez 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was candid with us when we interviewed her," Felix told reporters. "She 
admitted going to the hospital with the intention to take the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Felix said the suspect had apparently slipped past the hospital's security 
system twice -- once on Wednesday evening and once on Thursday morning -- by 
telling staff she was there to visit her sister. Coincidentally, Felix said, a 
woman in the maternity ward shared Cervantes' last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once she got a visitor's pass, she was in the hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix said police believe that Cervantes intended to take a child on 
Wednesday, but was frightened away. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the hospital on Thursday, Cervantes passed though a 
card-key-controlled doorway to the maternity ward by following an employee. 
Police believe Gonzalez's room was an easy target, since the door was open and 
both mother and child were sleeping inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix said the woman then strolled out of the hospital, with the infant 
beneath a blanket positioned over her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was then seen being driven away in a gray car, driven by a man 
believed to be Cervantes' brother-in-law. Police initially detained the 
brother-in-law, but released him after detectives became convinced that he did 
not know what the woman was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix said the 911 call ended a 14-hour search. At one point, about 30 Los 
Angeles police officers were sent to the hospital to interview patients and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a little luck and guilty feelings from the suspect's relatives, it 
turned out OK," Felix said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's father, Liborio Gonzales Sr., 39, an Eastside truck driver who was 
not in the room at the time of the abduction, said he was thankful the boy was 
found unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm well because I have my baby back," he said. Although he said he did not 
fault the hospital for the incident, he added: "I don't know later on how I 
(will) feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators, meanwhile, said they were upgrading their security 
procedures to prevent future abductions. Already, additional guards have been 
added in the maternity ward, hospital spokesman Mark Newmyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reviewing our system and policies to make sure this doesn't happen 
again," Newmyer said. "Our staff has been taking this very, very personally. I 
think people wish they could have done more. . . . There were tears of joy when 
the baby was returned."

BUDGET PANEL OKS RIORDAN'S PLAN TO ADD OFFICERS; FINANCES: COUNCIL COMMITTEE 
ADVISES HIRING MORE LIBRARY AND RECREATION WORKERS. IT ALSO RECOMMENDS 
SEPARATING THE MAYOR'S PROPOSAL TO REORGANIZE THE CITY BUREAUCRACY FROM 
DELIBERATIONS ON SPENDING PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan will get his larger police force if a City 
Council committee has its way, but the city will also hire more librarians and 
recreation supervisors to improve library service and keep recreation centers 
open longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the park and library workers was among the most striking 
changes proposed Friday by the council's Budget and Finance Committee, as 
Riordan's $4.3-billion budget cleared its first major hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommended removing from the budget deliberations 
Riordan's ambitious plan for reorganizing the city bureaucracy. Mayoral 
deputies concede that the action means that the creation of two superagencies 
from eight departments and commissions will have to be delayed several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral chief of staff Bill McCarley said he was pleased the central theme of 
the budget -- hiring 450 more police and putting many more on the street 
through increased overtime -- remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad it was well received," McCarley said. "And even on the 
reorganizations, there is a commitment to move forward. Whether that is in July 
or September is not significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the budget committee, also praised the 
budget. "All of us want more police," he said. "That was why this budget was 
largely unassailable." 
</P>
<P>
 While approving the police plan, though, Yaroslavsky questioned whether it 
will succeed entirely in getting officers to sign on for overtime and holiday 
shifts. Most of Riordan's plan to put more officers on the street depends on 
this concept, but police officials conceded this week that they do not know if 
they can spend the entire $54 million he set aside for the extra hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget committee recommended holding half the overtime money in reserve, 
to be returned to the treasury if the Police Department cannot spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting to augment the library and parks budgets, the committee said it was 
trying to take a broader view of what is needed to make the city safer and more 
livable. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of $4 million to the budget of the Recreation and Parks 
Department would restore staffing to its levels of last July 1. That would mean 
that 35 recreation centers would stay open 38 hours a week. Their hours had 
been reduced to 25 hours weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks that have suffered reduced hours are mainly in middle-income 
communities, but the committee also recommended increased staffing at parks in 
lower-income areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money will also assure that restroom cleaning can continue seven 
days a week and that lawn mowing is not reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 In another recommendation, the committee would add $2.9 million to the Library 
Department's budget to bring staffing to the levels of a year ago. That would 
forestall threatened reductions in hours and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also assures staffing of the newly reopened Central Library and two 
San Fernando Valley libraries -- the Platt branch and Mid-Valley Regional 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg supported the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make the city safer only by hiring more police," said Goldberg, who 
is not on the committee. "Improving the quality of life in Los Angeles includes 
many things." 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the committee recommended: 
</P>
<P>
 * Amending Riordan's proposed tax reduction plan to include households, along 
with businesses. The mayor had called for removing a 7 1/2% surcharge on 
business taxes, imposed two years ago, but keeping an increase in residential 
fees to maintain trash trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget committee's action would reduce the business tax surcharge by half, 
or 3 3/4 percentage points. It would also cut the so-called sanitation 
equipment charge so that homeowners would pay $54 a year, instead of $72, and 
apartment dwellers would pay $36 annually, instead of $48. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doubling to $5 million funding for the controversial, church-sponsored Hope 
in Youth anti-gang program. Council members Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters 
had argued to the committee that the group, backed by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, 
was being given special treatment and not competing for funds as most community 
organizations do. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recommendation for the increased funds, Yaroslavsky and others 
said they will not give final approval until they get more evidence on how the 
anti-gang organization is spending its money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beefing up the recruitment of women into the Police Department with a 
$750,000 addition to the Personnel Department's budget. The council has 
directed that 43% of the force should be made up of women.

AL MARTINEZ: TOURIST OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My sister Emily felt it safe enough to fly down from Oakland the other day to 
visit L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 She telephoned first to make sure there wasn't something going on that the 
media was covering up, like a hurricane or a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 I assured her it was OK, that we were between disasters, but she'd better 
hurry. Two days later, she flounced into town like a Tourist of the Year and 
demanded to see the usual tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 So I took her to the Valley to view the earthquake damage, to the mountains to 
view the fire damage and to South-Central to view the riot damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd show you a carjacking in progress," I said, "but they occur unannounced." 
</P>
<P>
 Emily caught the sarcasm and glared at me the way she did when I was a kid and 
she was about to give me the Dutch rub for smarting off. It is a punishment by 
which the punisher rubs his knuckles against one's scalp. Not exactly a caning 
with wet bamboo, but painful enough. 
</P>
<P>
 She was most interested in the riot area because it was the second anniversary 
of the worst urban uprising in the nation's history this century, and she 
couldn't understand why people would burn down their own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of experts are still trying to figure that out," I said. "Unemployment, 
poverty, frustration . . . maybe all those things. It was the moral equivalent 
of a scream in the night." 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk like a writer," Emily said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because I am one. If I were an opera star, you'd get an aria." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South-Central bustles today with the same kind of activity that characterizes 
most communities in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of the riots have mostly disappeared. There's a gleaming newness to 
the main streets and intersections where fire and violence once prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 I know despair exists in the neighborhoods, but it isn't obvious. The boarded 
storefronts of small businesses blend into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily, however, wasn't fooled. "There are a lot of vacant lots with fences 
around them," she said as we drove slowly up one street and down another. "They 
look sad." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 391 vacant lots to be exact, Linda Griego would tell me later. She's 
executive director of Rebuild L.A., an agency that carries the vacancies on its 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The lots are RLA's symbols of despair, empty places to be filled with 
life-sustaining commerce, gaps in a social order that owes its people jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained to Emily the lots were once occupied by grocery stores and gas 
stations, pharmacies and coffee shops that had been burned to the ground and 
never rebuilt, for a lot of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them burn," I said to the Tourist of the Year. "I saw them being 
looted. Now the burners and the looters are wondering why they did what they 
did. There may never be answers." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's pride in jobs," Emily said, from out of that place in her that 
remembers the Great Depression. "It's what will make the difference here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I first began touring with Emily I resented her interest in a situation 
that is nothing to boast about. "Riot Capital of the World" will never be part 
of our logo. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was asking the kinds of questions everyone ought to be asking. Perhaps 
our urban chaos can offer lessons in progress that might defuse 
riots-in-waiting elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 One lesson is power. Not clenched-fist power, but the economic power that 
comes with combining 20 $1-million businesses in South-Central into a coalition 
of mutual interests with $20 million clout. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what Linda Griego is trying to do. Ninety percent of those businesses 
hire less than 50 people. But merge their goals, share their costs and combine 
their skills, and you've got power to borrow, power to grow, power to put more 
people to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The lopsided, tear-stained, mega-liberal viewpoint of the documentary "The 
Fire This Time" is that nothing changed after the Watts riots and nothing is 
changing after the riots two years ago. 
</P>

SWAMI'S TROUBLES TARNISH LIFE AT 'PALACE OF GOLD'; SECTS: ALLEGATIONS OF MURDER 
AND RACKETEERING HAVE REVERSED FORTUNES AT HARE KRISHNA OFFSHOOT'S WEST 
VIRGINIA CENTER. BUT DEVOTEES ARE GOING AHEAD WITH THEIR PLANS FOR A 
MULTI-FAITH COMMUNITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shroud of trouble hangs over the hilltop Palace of Gold, built as a 
glittering monument to the Indian swami who brought the Hare Krishna religion 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday in the 1980s as America's largest Hare Krishna community, New 
Vrindaban grew into a major tourist attraction with 250,000 visitors a year. 
The money was flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the federal "demons" -- as New Vrindaban leaders call them -- swooped in 
with search warrants and indictments, amid allegations of murder, fraud and 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada, spiritual leader of New Vrindaban's 
faithful, is awaiting retrial on federal racketeering charges. The busloads of 
tourists -- and their dollars -- have dwindled. And the mainstream Hare Krishna 
movement has distanced itself from New Vrindaban. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 250 remaining members of the New Vrindaban community are moving ahead 
with plans for a new multi-faith community and efforts to bring the tourists 
back to their marble-and-gold palace.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been smeared as being criminal and this and that, but if you look at 
the facts, it doesn't bear it out," says New Vrindaban spokesman P.K. Swami, 
45. "And yet we get this reputation of being this wild criminal organization. 
It's really unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations of violence and wrongdoing in the mid-1980s seemed as incongruous 
to the community as the Palace of Gold seemed out of place in the hills of West 
Virginia, about 80 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Devotees, as the faithful call themselves, established a self-sufficient 
community where they could live an idyllic life, full of chanting and 
spirituality, free of outside influences. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal prosecutors said New Vrindaban became a multimillion-dollar racket 
run by Bhaktipada through murder, beatings and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he did get more money, as he did get more devotees and more power, he just 
continued to build on that and tried to enhance that," said former U.S. Atty. 
William Kolibash, who twice prosecuted Bhaktipada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued very strenuously that that was really the key motive for the 
criminal actions that he took. He didn't want to lose all the financial support 
that he had and, more importantly, the power that he had that went along with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Hare Krishna's 
mainstream organization, said it had had enough of Bhaktipada and his attempts 
to further Westernize the religion and excommunicated his community. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhaktipada calls his community's troubles with the Justice Department a 
"struggle between the demons and the devotees." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being persecuted. That's human nature," Bhaktipada said. "You attack 
the things that are different, but that's not supposed to be true of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Bhaktipada, the son of a Baptist minister from Peekskill, N.Y., quickly rose 
in the Krishna hierarchy after becoming the first Western disciple of A.C. 
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for 
Krishna Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Prabhupada died in 1977 and devotees led by Bhaktipada expanded the temple and 
built a memorial to him. It opened to tourists two years later and the 
community flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dark side began to emerge in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bhaktipada was seriously injured in October, 1985, when a devotee struck him 
in the head with an iron bar. The devotee told authorities he wanted to 
"cleanse the church." 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1987, devotee Thomas Drescher was convicted of murder in the 1983 death 
of fringe member Charles St. Denis at New Vrindaban. Devotee Daniel Reid 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and testified against Drescher. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1991, Drescher was convicted in Los Angeles in the 1986 slaying of 
Stephen Bryant, a dissident devotee who went on a one-man crusade against the 
commune, accusing Bhaktipada and others of drug trafficking, prostitution and 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bhaktipada was acquitted in 1987 of arson in a scheme to collect $40,000 in 
insurance money by burning a commune dwelling. Drescher was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Krishna teacher's aide Frederick DiFrancisco was charged with sex 
offenses against a child at New Vrindaban in 1987. DiFrancisco pleaded guilty 
and went to prison for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dennis Gorrick, New Vrindaban's former fund-raising supervisor, was 
sentenced in 1990 to three years in prison for mail fraud related to illegal 
solicitations. Officials said more than $10 million was taken in. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal prosecutors' biggest victory came in 1991 when Bhaktipada was 
convicted of six counts of mail fraud and three counts of racketeering, 
including conspiring to kill St. Denis. 
</P>
<P>
 Devotee Terry Sheldon also was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy to 
commit murder and mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment charged that the community made and sold millions of caps, 
bumper stickers and T-shirts bearing copyrighted and trademark cartoon 
characters and sports logos, netting at least $10.5 million between 1980 and 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors suffered a setback last July when a federal appeals court granted 
Bhaktipada and Sheldon new trials because of improper testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a plea agreement, Sheldon on March 14 was sentenced to five years 
in prison on a conspiracy count involving the death of Bryant. Bhaktipada is 
scheduled to go to trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made an incredibly costly effort to get rid of this community," 
P.K. Swami said. "I think the taxpayers should start wondering what they're 
doing, whether it's worth the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Kisser, executive director of the Chicago-based Cult Awareness 
Network, said denial of the allegations against Bhaktipada is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have grave concerns about the direction this movement is going to take, 
given its past history and current members who don't seem to want to bring 
Bhaktipada to any accountability," Kisser said. "That's not a good indicator." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, about 250 people, a third of them children, live in New Vrindaban. 
There were as many as 700 people in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite legal fees and a decline in financial support, the community plans a 
"spiritual village." 
</P>
<P>
 The vision calls for 22 sites where different religions can establish villages 
to promote their faiths. All of the villages would then be known as the "City 
of God." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course tourism is a nice byproduct, but we really want to see a 
fundamental principle here inspire other people," community planner Murti Swami 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who visit are quick to compare it with former religious communes in Waco, 
Tex., or Jonestown, Guyana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't appreciate being compared to groups like that, but we get that 
because a lot of people don't understand our community," P.K. Swami said.

 C orruptio optimi pessima is an old Latin saying meaning "the corruption of 
the best thing is the worst kind of corruption," says Michael O'Neill, director 
of the Institute for Nonprofit Organization Management at the University of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why religious organizations especially should pay attention to their 
own ethical behavior, O'Neill said, "including how they treat their employees 
and volunteers, and how they communicate with their membership." 
</P>
<P>
 As the moderator of a hands-on workshop on ethics and philanthropy titled "Are 
We Still the Good Guys? Ethics and the Nonprofit Sector," O'Neill will take 
time off from teaching at the Jesuit university to talk to Angelenos about some 
of the main ethical issues and challenges that people in religious and other 
nonprofit organizations face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be assumed about people in any organization that they will 
behave well just because they're in business to do good," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, scheduled for May 24 at the Japanese American Cultural and 
Community Center in Little Tokyo, will pose realistic ethical dilemmas for 
small panels to tackle with help from the audience. Participants will confront 
such thorny issues as nepotism and HIV testing for employees. Potential 
problems will be explored in the areas of financial management, fund raising 
and marketing, board of director activities, and human resources management. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 16 panelists will be Father Gregory Boyle, director of Jobs for the 
Future, Delores Mission; Linda Griego, chief executive officer of RLA, and 
Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill noted that the nonprofit sector of the economy accounts for 1.4 
million organizations with a money flow of about half a trillion dollars a 
year, 8 million paid staff and 90 million volunteers. He said about half of all 
charitable giving in the United States goes to religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jean Gilbert, a conference organizer who is chairwoman of the ethics 
education committee of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Society of 
Fund-Raising Executives, said it is important to heighten awareness of ethical 
behavior in nonprofit organizations "so that we don't endanger philanthropic 
giving -- which comes down to helping individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was ranked 48th among 50 large cities for philanthropic giving in 
the February issue of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, O'Neill said. But he 
cautioned that the study may not reflect ethnic giving patterns in cities as 
diverse as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A study titled "Ethnic Philanthropy" just published by his institute examined 
practices of giving, sharing and volunteering in eight ethnic communities in 
the San Francisco area. It showed that members of minority communities are "as 
likely as in the dominant culture to share money, food, housing and clothing, 
but in a much less formal way. And ethnic philanthropy in America is even more 
likely to be linked to religious tradition than white philanthropy," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The ethics workshop, sponsored by the local chapter of the National Society of 
Fund-Raising Executives and the California Community Foundation, is set for 
8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. May 24, at the Japanese American Cultural and Community 
Center, 244 S. San Pedro St., Los Angeles. A $35 fee includes a box lunch and

REMEMBERING MOTHER'S DAY -- BEHIND BARS; FAMILY: THE SOCIAL COSTS OF KEEPING 
65,000 MOTHERS IN PRISON ARE TOO HIGH, SAY CHURCH MEMBERS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
ADVOCATES. THEY WILL CALL SUNDAY FOR ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Religious News Service

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many mothers, Sunday will be a day of hugs and kisses, flowers and candy. 
But for women behind bars, Mother's Day is no occasion for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined that the mothers among the 87,000 women in U.S. prisons won't be 
ignored this Mother's Day, more than 130 religious and secular groups across 
the nation will be trying to raise public awareness about their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 The national campaign is being led by JusticeWorks Community in Brooklyn, 
N.Y., which provides services for current and former women prisoners and their 
families. The organization is based at the Church of Gethsemane in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Former prisoner Cheryl Mobley, a JusticeWorks staffer, will participate in 
special services Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of two who served four years on a drug-related charge, Mobley recalls 
that Mother's Day was one of the days she most dreaded while in prison. It was 
a day of separation, guilt and loneliness, she says, and she doesn't much like 
it even now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish sometimes I didn't have to acknowledge the day," Mobley said. "I don't 
really like facing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother's Day still evokes those old feelings for Mobley. It's also a reminder 
that she and her family are still imprisoned by the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former husband kept her son and daughter away from Mobley during her 
incarceration. As a result, Mobley and her children remain distant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They understand what happened and I hope the day comes that we can be 
reconciled," she said of her son, now 22, and her daughter, now 18. "But I'm 
not a part of their lives anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Mobley's experience is all too common, event organizers say, which is why 
Sunday's event has a theme: To imprison a mother is also to imprison her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Connie Baugh, pastor of The Church of Gethsemane, said the event is 
designed not only to draw attention to the plight of women prisoners but also 
to launch a national movement to seek alternatives to incarcerating mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The social costs of incarcerating women are enormous, Baugh said. Of the 
87,000 women in U.S. prisons, 65,000 have dependent children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobley was in some ways lucky: Her former husband raised their children and 
did "an excellent job." But too often, children are placed in foster homes or 
put in the care of resentful relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 This breakdown of families could be prevented, Baugh said, if a few steps were 
taken. Mandatory sentencing guidelines, she said, could be reviewed in the 
cases of mothers, because the guidelines -- often used in drug-related cases -- 
are largely responsible for the 224% increase in the women's prison population 
over the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other steps include sentencing reforms that would establish special 
dispensation for qualified women who have young children, and the development 
of community-based centers that would allow female prisoners to maintain 
contact with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's event will involve 12 national prisoner and women's rights groups 
joining forces with nearly 100 local congregations across the country. Through 
the network of organizations and congregations, some 20,000 brochures, buttons 
and paper flowers -- the symbol selected to represent the plight of mothers in 
prison -- will be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Baugh calls the event a way to counter the commercialization of Mother's Day 
and open the nation's eyes to the forgotten women. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobley said her own mother will be attending church with her Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows how painful the day is for me," Mobley said, but added that the 
service is a way for her and other former prisoners to join in common cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for us to come forward," she said.

A KEY QUESTION FOR ANY TEST; CLAS EXAMS MUST HAVE PUBLIC SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The integrity of the innovative California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) 
tests is under attack. What started as a small but vocal campaign by special 
interest religious groups is beginning to mushroom into doubts raised by a 
cross section of parents and educators. If these tests, which deserve a smarter 
defense than they have received so far, are to have any political chance of 
survival, public confidence must be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of complaints have been lodged against the new, academically 
rigorous tests, which were administered last year and are being given again 
this spring to more than a million public school students in the fourth, eighth 
and 10th grades. The bulk of the complaints have focused on the content of the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 AVALANCHE: At first the objections were laughably silly and easily dismissed; 
contortions of some of the literature passages led some opponents to actually 
complain that a story with a description of a snowball fight was too violent. 
But rumors grew and before long there were more questions. Some parents asked, 
appropriately, do these new tests elicit "feelings" instead of critical 
thinking? Do test questions probe the personal or family life of a student? 
Before long, questions that were never on the test were being circulated as 
examples of what the test offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education, protective of the confidentiality of the 
test, seemed to forget that there would be no tests to protect without 
broad-based political support -- from parents, teachers, school boards and the 
holder of the purse strings, the Legislature. The department denied that any 
questions were inappropriate, but when questioning parents sought more 
reassurance they too often were told, in effect, trust us. By the time the 
department, under pressure, agreed that individual students could opt out of 
the now-controversial tests, opponents were on to their next move, demanding in 
a pending lawsuit that the tests not be given without advance written parental 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIVACY ISSUE: Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), the sponsor of the bill 
that created CLAS, knows he now needs to shore up political support for the 
tests. He is sponsoring legislative amendments that among other things would 
expressly prohibit questions on the test that relate to students' or parents' 
personal beliefs about family life, sex, morality or religion (a restatement of 
the state Education Code); require an independent panel review; require samples 
from previous tests be made available to the public. The bill aims at 
addressing legitimate privacy and access concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's bill deserves support because it would move to reassure and better 
inform confused parents, the overwhelming majority of whom do not support the 
narrow political or religious agendas espoused by many vocal critics of CLAS. 
What most California parents do support is testing that helps cultivate and 
measure children's critical thinking skills to prepare them for joining the 
work force of the 21st Century. And that's just what CLAS was designed to do.

WHAT'S THAT SMELL IN HERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there no limit to the cynicism and gall of the cigarette industry? Now 
comes the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. with a cute new promotion putting the 
puckish images of Old Joe Camel and his fellow cartoon dromedaries on 
"collector's packs" of its Camel cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 This just two weeks after tobacco executives prevaricated, dodged and slunk 
before a congressional committee looking into the addiction and disease caused 
by their product. 
</P>
<P>
 This after studies showing that children as young as 6 are familiar with Old 
Joe, that adolescents are being drawn into smoking at alarming rates and that 
Camel's share of the youth market has grown since the cartoon advertising 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 The daunting news from the most recent surgeon general's report on smoking and 
health is that one of every three youngsters in this country uses tobacco by 
age 18 -- despite all the warnings about the clear and present dangers of 
smoking and chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reynolds move is a clever marketing device, one obviously meant to link 
the product directly to the advertising that uses the rakish and hip cartoon 
caricatures of animals. The company asserts that the advertising is not aimed 
at youngsters, that the new cardboard packs are, as a spokeswoman put it, "just 
a fun thing" for current adult smokers. And it rests on the free-speech 
guarantees of the First Amendment. 
</P>

 We smell in all this more than just the foul odor of secondhand smoke. As Big 
Daddy said to Brick in Tennessee Williams' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof": "What's 
that smell in this room? Didn't you notice it, Brick? Didn't you notice a 
powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room?"

BASEBALL WATCH; DREAM TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Gina Satriano it's a long way from Malibu to Charlotte, N.C., but there 
she will be on Sunday with her 23 teammates in their debut as the Colorado 
Silver Bullets, the first women's professional baseball team since the 1950s. 
They will be the first women to play against men's semipro and minor league 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may dismiss women in baseball as a mere marketing gimmick by the team's 
sponsor, Coors Brewing, which is putting up $3 million to promote the Bullets. 
But the team -- 11 of whose members are from California, nine from Southern 
California -- is about women leaving jobs and security to pursue their dreams 
on the field . 
</P>
<P>
 Others have preceded them. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball 
League, which lasted from 1943 through 1954, was virtually forgotten until 1988 
when the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., recognized the 545 women 
who played. Then there was the movie "A League of Their Own." 
</P>
<P>
 In World War II chewing gum magnate P. K. Wrigley, the Chicago Cubs' owner, 
came up with the league as a diversion for war-weary Americans and as insurance 
for club owners in the event the draft wiped out the rosters of the male 
baseball clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 There were marketing considerations then, too. Teams were named the Daisies, 
Peaches, Belles, Lassies and even Chicks. The players wore skirts and makeup -- 
and went to charm school. Today's Bullets need learn only how to autograph 
baseballs. If Satriano and her teammates are as successful as we think they'll 
be, baseball may never be the same.

FACE THE TERRIBLE TRUTH; DENIAL OF JAPAN'S WAR CRIMES BY YET ANOTHER OFFICIAL 
ILL-SERVES THAT NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's new justice minister has denied that the infamous Rape of Nanking in 
1937 ever occurred, and says he should know because he was there. That 
assertion understandably provoked official indignation in China. As the heavily 
documented record shows, Japan's conquering army carried out an orgy of murder 
and rape after it seized the south China city of Nanking, now known as Nanjing. 
The 1948 war crimes tribunal in Tokyo put the number of Chinese killed at 
upward of 155,000. Still, Shigeto Nagano, who was a soldier at the time, said 
the other day it never happened. Moreover, he asserted that Japan's war in Asia 
lacked aggressive intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Called to account by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Nagano made a public apology 
for remarks he called "inappropriate"; others would more accurately 
characterize them as astonishingly insensitive and politically stupid. The 
apology is unlikely to soften this latest blow to Japan's foreign relations and 
its image, especially in China and South Korea, which suffered most from 
Japan's aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagano's assertion that the bloody record of Japan's misdeeds in China is all 
a "fabrication" is typical of the inability or refusal of some older Japanese 
especially -- not all of them ultranationalists -- to honestly confront the 
darkest and cruelest chapters of their country's past. It's only in recent 
years that prime ministers and the emperor himself have been willing to 
acknowledge publicly, if sometimes in the most elliptical way, that Japan waged 
aggressive war in the 1930s and '40s.  
</P>
<P>
 The long silence of the political leadership had its counterpart in Japanese 
schools. Textbooks and teachers have traditionally glossed over the war years 
and the atrocities they included. Only now are the first glimmerings of candor 
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarks like Nagano's fuel the suspicions about Japan's intentions that linger 
in Asia nearly half a century after World War II ended. Even when withdrawn 
under pressure, such remarks also encourage those Japanese who insist that the 
Asian war was meritorious and honorable. Nagano's crude comments are only the 
latest reminder of the failure of some Japanese to come to terms with an 
aggressive past.

HISTORY OF BOSNIAN CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles William Maynes' column "Is There Any 'Right' Bosnia Policy for 
Clinton?" (Opinion, April 24) contains numerous misstatements of fact. He is of 
course free to speculate on the most appropriate response from the Clinton 
Administration on the resolution of the Bosnian conflict. He is not, however, 
free to manipulate history in support of his thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynes claims that anti-Serb excesses of World War II are "fueling the current 
conflict" and somehow justify current Serb aggression. Although he must know 
that atrocities were committed by all sides during that war, he omits 
completely the excesses committed by the Serbian fascists, led by Milan Nedic, 
against all non-Serbs and especially the Muslim population during this time 
period. Serb Chetniks succeeded in "cleansing" most of the 86,000 to 103,000 
Muslims who perished during the war; their ideological successors are 
continuing the tradition today in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in occupied parts of 
the Republic of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian propaganda also purports that the 500-year-old Croatian coat of arms 
is a fascist symbol simply because it was used by the Croatian Ustashi 
government. However, the checkerboard coat of arms configuration during this 
period was different than the other Croatian flags and, furthermore, Maynes 
forgets or is ignorant of the fact that the checkerboard coat of arms has 
appeared on every Croatian flag since the year 1582. As for the rehabilitation 
of war criminals in Croatia or the naming of public squares after them, I defy 
Maynes to offer a single example. Although there was a street and a school 
outside Zagreb named after Mile Budak, a Croatian playwright (and former member 
of the Ustashi government), these names were recently changed at the initiative 
of the city council, which found them objectionable.  
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the importance President Franjo Tudjman places on such 
issues, it is important to note that he personally initiated a recent premiere 
of "Schindler's List" in Zagreb and took that occasion to express his deepest 
apologies for the excesses committed in Croatia during World War II and for the 
Nazi-fascist racist laws.  
</P>
<P>
 In light of the facts, both past and present, it would behoove Maynes to join 
the rest of the international community in condemning Serbian aggression.

INDULGING IN MOVIE THEATER POPCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial concerning movie theater popcorn ("Purging Popcorn," April 27) 
has a kernel of truth in it. Splurging on hot buttered popcorn is often more 
enjoyable than watching the stomach-churning junk that frequently tries to pass 
for entertainment up on the big screen. An occasional binge does no real harm. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Americans really want information and a choice. Information on 
ingredients contained in the foods they eat and the opportunity to choose a 
diversity of products. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wait until shoppers read of the high-fat content in the foods they 
purchase when more comprehensive labeling becomes effective this month. Who 
will be willing to purchase vegetable soup with 25 grams of "fat calories" per 
serving? And who wants to go to a movie theater and scarf down a bucket of 
popcorn equal to a half-dozen cholesterol-oozing Big Macs? 
</P>
<P>
 America's corporate food makers better wake up and smell the popcorn.

we turn around, someone, somewhere takes away something good to eat! 
</P>
<P>
 I figure I go to the movies about four or five times a year, if that much. So 
what if I indulge in some super-fatty popcorn? You have to eat popcorn at the 
movies. I mean, it's a written law somewhere, right? Let no man take away my 
movie theater popcorn! 
</P>
<P>
 These days going to the movies is an indulgence in itself, when one figures in 
the price of admission, parking and snacks, anyway. So what's the difference if 
one partakes of popcorn no matter what it's popped in? In the grand scheme of 
things a little indulgence every so often is good for one's soul.

WELFARE FRAUD STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your April 26 article on the recent study examining welfare fraud in Orange 
County suggests that California officials may be misguided in cracking down on 
welfare fraud. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The fraud rate for all Aid to Families With Dependent Children cases is not 
"only about 4%"; that number refers to the amount of fraud detected through the 
quality-control process, a system designed primarily to find errors by welfare 
officials, not fraud. The truth is, since 1970, a range of studies have put the 
rate of welfare fraud anywhere from 10% to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a better estimate of welfare across the entire AFDC population, the 
state will conduct additional studies. Even if the fraud rate is only 4%, the 
cost of fraud in all welfare programs is a staggering $750 million every year. 
Given that efforts to fight welfare fraud are extremely cost-effective ($28 in 
savings for every dollar invested), it's wise to step up our efforts now. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Orange County study, we stand by it. It made sense for us to look 
at highly suspicious cases like the ones examined in Orange County, in which 
adults denied working but claimed they were supporting their families on a 
welfare grant intended for one person. We anticipated a high level of fraud, 
but what we found exceeded all of our expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are hard to impugn: Fraud was discovered in 62% of the cases 
investigated at a cost of millions of dollars to taxpayers. It doesn't mean 
that fraud is 62% statewide; we've never maintained that it did. It does mean 
that welfare fraud may be a greater problem than we ever imagined.

WASHINGTON PENALTIES MAY BE COMPOUNDED; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NCAA PROPOSES BANNING 
HUSKIES FROM TELEVISION FOR 1994 SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA has proposed taking the Washington football team off television in 
1994, another major blow for a beleaguered program that received a two-year 
bowl ban from the Pacific-10 Conference last year, the school said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington officials said they plan to challenge the NCAA's proposed 
additional penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're emotionally very upset," Washington President William Gerberding told a 
news conference attended by Athletic Director Barbara Hedges and football Coach 
Jim Lambright. "I'm extremely upset." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies found out about their new punishment in a letter dated April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "In determining these proposed penalties, the suggested finding of lack of 
institutional control was considered with the other violations already 
admitted," said the letter signed by David Swank, chairman of the NCAA 
Infractions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disappointment to me when you're expecting something positive instead 
of negative," Lambright said. "But it's just a proposed penalty, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedges said she thought Washington had a chance to convince the NCAA to 
rescind its proposed TV ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important point is this is a new process. It's very new," she said. "I 
don't think you can rely on what has happened in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the NCAA informed the Huskies it was proposing putting 
Washington's football team on probation for the 1995 season. The additional 
probation would be through Dec. 31, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the additional one-year probation does not mean that much -- other 
than to warn the Huskies strongly to keep their program clean -- since 
Washington still would be eligible for the 1996 Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA also proposed the disassociation of Husky boosters James Kenyon, Roy 
Moore, Clint Mead and Jim Heckman from the athletic programs for an additional 
year to the summer of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington will challenge the new penalties before the NCAA June 5 in Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies said they expected to hear the results of their challenge two to 
three weeks after appearing before the Infractions Committee in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA told the Huskies it found a lack of institutional control with their 
summer jobs program in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new NCAA proposed punishment -- on top of the Pac-10's penalties last Aug. 
22 that caused Coach Don James' same-day resignation -- surprised Washington 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambright had to tell his four team captains, including prize running back 
Napoleon Kaufman, the bad news. The other co-captains are tight end Mark 
Bruener, and linebackers David Killpatrick and Donovan Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, a senior-to-be, elected to stay at Washington for his final season, 
passing up the NFL draft in order to improve his draft status with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington expected a lighter sentence from the NCAA than it got from its own 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an optimistic person," Lambright said. "I kind of like to think that 
things are going to go right. The general feeling of the captains was one of 
concern first and then understanding that the legal means have to take their 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Pac-10 slapped Washington with a two-year bowl ban for NCAA 
rules violations and took away the school's football TV revenues to the tune of 
about $1.3 million for the 1993 season. Washington also lost 10 scholarships in 
1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 did allow Washington to play on TV last season and the Huskies had 
five of their games televised -- against Stanford, Ohio State, Cal, UCLA and 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the violations found by the Pac-10 were improper loans to athletes, free 
meals provided to recruits and improper employment of athletes by boosters. The 
conference also cited a lack of institutional control over funds provided to 
students hosting recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedges said an additional year without TV revenue would cost the Huskies 
another $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a question if the NCAA can legally take the Huskies off TV next 
season because ABC-TV already has announced it plans to regionally televise 
Washington's games against USC in Los Angeles Sept. 3 and against Ohio State in 
Seattle Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA might have to put off the television ban until the 1995 season if the 
TV contracts don't allow it to act against Washington next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington posted a 7-4 record, including a 5-3 Pac-10 mark, last season under 
Lambright, James' former longtime defensive coordinator, after going to three 
consecutive Rose Bowls under James. 
</P>
<P>
 James coached at Washington for 18 seasons. He is now retired from coaching. 
In 1991, Washington went 12-0 and earned the national championship in the USA 
Today-CNN coaches poll.

VIOLA'S SEASON IN DOUBT; BASEBALL: BOSTON RIGHT-HANDER GOES ON 60-DAY DISABLED 
LIST AND NEEDS ELBOW SURGERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN HORGAN, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Red Sox had braced themselves for the worst news about Frank Viola's 
injured left elbow and that's pretty much what they got Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to team physician/owner Arthur Pappas, Viola needs surgery to repair 
muscles and a partially torn ligament on the inside of the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox placed Viola, 34, on the 60-day disabled list, but he will be out 
at least until September and probably is finished for the season. "September 
would be optimistic," Pappas said. "Next year, there is, in reality, an 
opportunity for him to come back and pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Viola said he has no plans to retire, he conceded the injury could 
be career-threatening. "If I'm meant to pitch again, I'll pitch again," he 
said. "I'm not really thinking about that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, which Viola said he was assured was not related to his off-season 
surgery to remove bone chips from the elbow, occurred Tuesday night as he 
pitched to the Mariners' Eric Anthony. Viola's pitch sailed well wide and it 
was clear he was in pain. "I actually think I did it on the pitch before that," 
Viola said. "It felt funny and I just tried to shake it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Pappas said three structures must be examined: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The muscle group coming off the bone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ligament on the inner side of the elbow that is torn. "If it is 
partially torn, it can be repaired," Pappas said. "If it is completely torn, it 
would have to be replaced with a ligament or tendon from somewhere else in his 
body." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ulna nerve. "He hasn't complained of any of the symptons of damage to 
the nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 Viola, in the final season of a three-year contract, will seek a second 
opinion Monday in Virginia from Dr. Richard Caspari, who removed the bone chips 
from Viola's elbow Sept. 29. He may seek a third opinion before deciding by the 
end of next week who will perform the surgery. Viola was asked if he believes 
he is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the ligament is secure enough and I'm just recovering from tendon surgery, 
I'd say I might be back by September," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Dan Duquette declined to give a timetable. "We'll have to wait 
and see what the surgery brings," Duquette said. "The best-case scenario is 
that he will have his elbow repaired and return to the team this season." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not sound as if Duquette expects the best-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious injury," he said. "This type of injury usually takes a year 
to heal after the surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Viola said he has to have surgery regardless of his future in baseball.

 "It's pretty plain what the injury is," Viola said. "It's got to be done, no 
ifs, ands or buts. I can't use my arm the way it is. It's got to be repaired, 
even if it means all I do is rehab to a point where all I'm going to do is play 
catch with (his son) Frankie or coach a team and be able to throw BP. But it's 
going to be a nasty rehab no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Viola, who won the 1988 Cy Young Award (24-7, 2.64 earned-run average) while 
with the Twins, is 175-146 in his career. He's 1-1 with a 4.65 ERA in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox will need another starter Tuesday night against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be filling Frank's spot from within the organization," Duquette said. 
Manager Butch Hobson wants to promote right-hander Gar Finnvold and give him 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola had never missed a start until last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think it's hit home yet," he said. "I guess it could have 
happened 10 years ago. But it's something I know I can fight through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox replaced Viola on the roster by purchasing the contract of 
infielder Carlos Rodriguez from triple-A Pawtucket. Rodriguez also will serve 
as insurance in case shortstop John Valentin's right knee injury is serious. 
Valentin had a magnetic resonance imaging Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 26, hit .324 at Pawtucket, with two home runs and 15 RBI. He made 
one error in 20 games. The Chicago White Sox claimed outfielder Bob Zupcic off 
waivers and assigned him to their Triple A team.

 It could happen . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 race in the American League West was a wild one. The Rangers had a 
five-game lead with 10 games to go.Because they lost eight of nine, their lead 
had been trimmed to one game by the Angels, who were on a tear with a 5-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last day of the season and the Rangers lost again, meaning an Angel 
victory at Chicago would close the season in a tie. The White Sox had already 
clinched in the Central, and in an effort to boost ticket sales, announced that 
morning that Michael Jordan would be the starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels then defeated the White Sox, 4-1, to match the Rangers' record at 
70-92 and force a playoff game at Anaheim the next day.

CHARGING THE BRUINS WITH TICKET EXTORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have followed the recent news about the UCLA ticket distribution for the 
recent Rose Bowl game with more than passing interest. I have felt that for the 
past three or four years the university's ticket policy has been scandalous.I 
have not written earlier out of "loyalty" to a great university from which I 
graduated in 1953, and from which I maintained season football tickets until a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I was perfectly content with my pair of 35-yard-line seats. I was also proud 
that through my company I was able to donate more than $50,000 to the UCLA 
Foundation over a period of years in the 1980s. But when the 1990s came, I was 
shocked to be asked to pay a stipend to a booster club in order to maintain my 
seats. In your "For the Record" of April 23, you state that the donation is 
required only for seat location improvement. That is not correct, at least in 
my case. There is outright extortion, as another of your letter writers 
asserted in the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the university has to alter its policy regardless of the loss of the 
number of scholarships to out-of-state athletes. Universities should lead the 
way in proper rules of behavior. I was told by the head of the UCLA ticket 
office when I refused to renew my seats that all the "big-time" schools do the 
same thing. My answer was that if it's morally wrong, my university should not 
go along with it. Well, it did.  
</P>
<P>
 I am disenfranchised and disenchanted, and now it seems the roof is going to 
fall on the integrity of the institution from the chancellor on down.

 Being a season-ticket holder since the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, I was 
distraught to hear all the talk about the Raiders going to Orlando, St. Louis, 
Baltimore, Oakland or the new city that seemed to pop up weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Al Davis moved the Raiders to Los Angeles, he was promised a 
state-of-the-art stadium and the almighty luxury boxes. To this day, he has not 
received them. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't Los Angeles build a new football stadium? We could pay for it like 
every other city, by raising the tax on hotel rooms and rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Please wake up and realize that a lot of cities will pay dearly for the 
greatest organization in sports. I don't want to fly to Orlando to see the 
Raiders play home games.

 Editor's note: What Davis was promised in terms of Coliseum renovation when he 
moved the Raiders here is in some dispute. Nothing is said in the contract on 
that point, and it was specifically stated by both parties when the contract 
was signed that there were no unwritten side agreements. Luxury boxes, 
according to the contract, were to have been built with $6.7 million that the 
Coliseum Commission gave Davis. *

INCREDIBLE LUCK REQUIRED MERELY TO BE IN THE DERBY; OVERVIEW: THE FACT THAT 
MOST OF THE TOP 3-YEAR-OLDS HAVE MADE IT TO LOUISVILLE MAKES IT A STANDOUT 
FIELD.

<P>
 The pitfalls between New Year's Day and the first Saturday of May are 
everywhere -- injury, illness, twist of fate, confrontation with the reality of 
limitation, human error. The combinations of those variables are infinite. 
</P>
<P>
 This, the harshest of racing's realities, explains in part why no 2-year-old 
champion has won a Kentucky Derby since 1979. It explains why the mere presence 
of any of the 15 horses in today's Kentucky Derby is a longshot. It also makes 
this field of 15 all the more remarkable. The only notable absences are Dehere, 
last year's 2-year-old champion, who was injured while training for the Florida 
Derby, and Wood Memorial-winner Irgun, who suffered a minor hoof injury after 
arriving here for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 This, the most difficult of all races to win and the most coveted, is not only 
compelling in its unusual depth for the 120th running, but in the fact that the 
central characters have endured virtually without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a plan in mind and you can't be interrupted," said Randy Winick, 
who trains Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Santa Anita Derby winner Brocco, second 
choice behind Holy Bull on the early wagering line and the most impressive of 
the Derby starters during his final days of training for the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much has got to fall into place. And you've got to have the horse to do 
it. If the horse doesn't cooperate, it's all out the window. This is a tough 
enough race to win under the best of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the barn in which Brocco has been quartered since arriving here 
more than two weeks ago, trainer Ron McAnally has spent the week tending to the 
final preparation of Valiant Nature for Saturday's once-in-a-lifetime 
assignment. His is the colt who denied Brocco the 2-year-old title last season 
when he upset the Breeders' Cup winner in the Hollywood Futurity. And this, 
McAnally believes, is his best chance to win a Kentucky Derby since 1962. He 
was derailed at the 11th hour when Donut King, winner of the Champagne Stakes 
as a 2-year-old, suffered a bruised hind hoof and was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, you've got to have a horse with the ability and the capacity to get 
the distance," McAnally said. "You've got to have a sound horse. And then, 
there's luck. No question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 When last they met, in March, Brocco was a head better than Valiant Nature in 
the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. Both made their initial starts of the new 
season and were behind upset winner Soul Of The Matter, who will be among the 
Derby starters Saturday, again in a longshot role with prospects complicated by 
nagging hoof problems that have interrupted his training. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the test is not between Brocco and Valiant Nature. Holy Bull is 
favored to overcome his pedigree and 14 opponents. There is support for Go For 
Gin, Strodes Creek, Blumin Affair, Powis Castle and Southern Rhythm as well as 
the two best 3-year-olds from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Brocco) is the horse to beat," Winick said. "It will take an 
excellent effort to beat this horse. I've been fortunate to be able to keep him 
on schedule. For a race this tough, that's important. You can't give anything 
away. But I feel great about this horse going in. He's right and he's ready." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally has the only horse in the field to have faced both Brocco and Holy 
Bull, to whom he finished second in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland three 
weeks ago. Valiant Nature ran the kind of race in the Blue Grass from which he 
figures to move forward Saturday and McAnally believes he saw a flaw in Holy 
Bull's armor that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Holy Bull) hit the finish line, he pulled himself up in about three 
jumps," McAnally said. "Unless the gray horse is that smart, maybe a 
mile-and-an-eighth is about as far as he wants to go. (Valiant Nature) galloped 
past him beyond the wire and must have been 20 lengths in front of him 
galloping out." 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature's experience, or lack of it, is McAnally's main concern. Then, 
there is the matter of Holy Bull. Winick, a study in confidence, is concerned 
only that the race develop in a manner that gives Brocco a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My horse will run his race," he said. "I just hope someone entertains (Holy 
Bull) out there. You can't give anything away."

YANKEE SCHEDULE GETS TOUGHER, STARTING WITH BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON HEYMAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So far, the Yankees' schedule has been a lot like the weather they've seen: 
mild and breezy. Things have been fairly fun in the sun out west, but now 
things get serious. The vacation is over. School's on. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place Boston Red Sox are coming to town starting Friday night and 
they're off to their best start since 1946. So the Yankees finally will get a 
real idea about where they stand. After playing 23 of 26 games against losing 
teams, the Yankees are looking at a real test, a real team. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if these new-style, low-key Yankees can't work up any legitimate hatred 
for the Red Sox (not even ex-Red Sox Wade Boggs can), they do understand it is 
different facing Roger Clemens than Miguel Jimenez. The Yankees and Red Sox 
both conquered the West (the Red Sox squashed it, going 13-2, including 11-0 
against California and Oakland), but now they'll find out how they stack up 
against each other, which is all that really matters anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankees ace Jimmy Key, who starts Friday night against right-hander Aaron 
Sele, in his usual no-frills, no-bull manner, said about the Red Sox, "They're 
playing as good or better than anybody in baseball. ... They're one of the 
teams we have to beat if we're going to win our division. We don't want to put 
a lot of emphasis on winning all three games, but we want to play well to show 
them we can hang with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees can't be certain what to expect this weekend, even from 
themselves. Twenty-six games in, their only winning opponent, the White Sox, 
beat them two out of three. Yes, they are 16-10, but it's a fairly hollow 
16-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees aren't overwhelming anyone, even themselves. They're biggest 
weapon so far has been the walk. They're on pace to walk 897 times, which 
amounts to 15.4 miles of walking. There has been little to become enthused 
about. "I don't think we've played as well as we're going to or are capable of 
playing. I think we're capable of better," Manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions they took into the season, these remain unanswered: Can 
they depend upon the bullpen? Will Jim Abbott and Melido Perez pitch to their 
ample abilities? Is Luis Polonia the leadoff answer? And can Mike Stanley, Mike 
Gallego, Paul O'Neill, Jim Leyritz and Randy Velarde repeat breakthrough 
seasons? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bullpen is looking a little leaky lately. Jeff Reardon blew Abbott's 
5-2 lead in their 7-6, 13-inning defeat to the California Angels late Wednesday 
night, capping a bad trip for the pen, which lost Steve Howe to injury and 
surrendered one big hit almost nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- People are making a fuss over Abbott's low radar-gun readings (opponents 
say he's in the 85-86-mph range), but he's still 3-2 with a 2.87 ERA so he's 
compensating with better pitching. Perez looks better after shoulder surgery, 
and now the question is whether the toe he injured by angrily kicking a 
Gatorade container will affect his start tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If there's a problem with Polonia, it's his base-running. Polonia, batting 
.280 at the plate and about that on the bases, said, "I always took risks, but 
for some reason it isn't working now. It's been bad all the time, there hasn't 
been one time I went and was successful. Eight times I've screwed up on the 
bases, somebody got a base hit right after that. I know, I'm counting, one by 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Among those trying to repeat huge seasons, O'Neill (.446), Velarde (.321) 
and Leyritz (.357) are actually doing even better. But Gallego (.216) and 
Stanley (.190) can't see where they were last season with a telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Yankees will start getting some more definitive answers to their 
mostly unanswered questions beginning Friday night, when the real tests begin.

COMMENTARY; HOLYFIELD SHOWED PLENTY OF HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the risk of glorifying the profane to make a point about Evander Holyfield, 
there is a truth undeniable: Boxing is the hardest game. It is the most 
demanding physically and the most demanding psychically. Only gladiators need 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 To move toward an understanding of those demands, do a simple thing. Hold your 
fists eye-high for three minutes while moving inside a 20-foot circle. Then 
extend those three minutes to a half-hour and throw a punch every five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, not so simple, try the gladiator part. Get in the ring with a man who 
wants to make real the dream expressed in 10 reverential words by a fighter now 
at ease in Indiana. Mike Tyson often said of the man across from him, "I want 
to drive his nose bone into his brain." 
</P>
<P>
 The point about Holyfield is that few fighters ever gave more of themselves to 
grace the mean game. It is his legacy that he twice won the heavyweight 
championship when with an ordinary effort he would never have been even a 
contender. His effort was extraordinary, even extraordinary times two. Had 
Muhammad Ali, to name a fighter, brought to his work the effort of Evander 
Holyfield, Ali for 20 years would have been undefeated and all but untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 With a training regimen unique to fighters, Holyfield made his body into a 
heavyweight's by adding 30 rock-hard pounds in five years. Ali came to 
greatness as a 205-pounder who, with a training regimen light on training, 
became a 230-pounder of suspect fatty content. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield's body became a temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali's temple became a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 An instance: Measuring Holyfield in 1987, publicist Kathy Duva recorded his 
height at 6-foot-1 1/2, his weight at 188 pounds and his chest at 44 inches. It 
was the waist measurement that furrowed Duva's brow: "Evander's waist is 
smaller than mine. So I added an inch to it." Still, the heavyweight's waist 
came to 29 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a year after Holyfield began workouts with fitness guru Tim Hallmark, 
who, among other torture devices, used the high-tech equivalent of a medieval 
rack, which stretched its victims not horizontally but vertically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim's got this one machine," Holyfield said, "where he straps your hands in 
and straps your feet in and then you've got to go like you're climbing a 
mountain, sometimes for 30 minutes. Man, I'd be dying. And it'd be aggravating. 
I'd be worn out. Here I was, supposed to be the best, and my sparring partners 
were beating me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then after some weeks the work began to catch hold. Finally, I got all four 
of my sparring partners in one day and I whupped 'em all." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a second. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that noise? 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a growling. Some fight fans are growling. They want a stop to 
this nonsense about Holyfield the temple and Ali the garage. It's no 
bodybuilding contest, they say. It's a fight. And they say if we're talking 
about fighters, Holyfield doesn't belong in the same sentence with Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed. No argument. At his best, Ali might have beaten anyone at his best. 
Boxing historians put Ali in the top five heavyweights; Holyfield might be in 
the top 25. No arguments there, either, for even a witness who saw greatness 
possible in Holyfield admits greatness was never realized. 
</P>
<P>
 No great fighter would lose to Michael Moorer, be knocked down by Bert Cooper 
and be bamboozled by grandpa Larry Holmes. Certainly those Holyfield fights 
were proof that something, somewhere, had gone wrong with the strongman who had 
knocked out the man who knocked out Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatility made greatness possible for Holyfield. He could move, punch and 
box. But in the Holmes/Cooper/Moorer/Riddick Bowe fights, Holyfield became a 
predictable fighter whose only defense was offense. He stopped moving and dared 
to fight even bigger men toe to toe. His tactics properly were denigrated as 
foolish, even suicidal. They certainly were not the tactics that once promised 
greatness for an intelligent fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? Visible symptoms suggested ego's domination of reason. 
Holyfield began changing important people. Trainers came and went; managers 
were fired, longtime relationships were ruptured. And it wasn't long before the 
Holyfield camp took on the Ali-esque odor identified with parasites sucking at 
the millionaire host. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, we may have a better explanation. At some time, for some reason, 
Holyfield's body betrayed him. He had a bad heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Holyfield lost to Moorer, a cardiologist said it was a miracle 
Holyfield finished the fight. His heart had lost elasticity; it could not pump 
the blood necessary to carry oxygen to a fighter's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one years old, a happy multimillionaire who has four children and the 
fame that lives with any heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield walked away 
from his gladiator's work and said, "I love life more than going into the ring 
and swinging. I can use my heart in different ways now instead of using my 
heart to scuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Good for him.

'PICASSO' SHOW A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR LACMA; ART: THE EXHIBITION, WHICH CLOSED 
SUNDAY, WAS FAR MORE POPULAR THAN SEVERAL PAST SHOWS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO 
ATTRACT A SIMILAR AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best news at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is that "Picasso and the 
Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar" was a hit. When 
the show closed an 11-week run last Sunday, total attendance reached 153,867 -- 
making it the 12th-best-attended exhibition in the museum's 29-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The show attracted a mere fraction of the people who packed into LACMA's top 
draws -- "Treasures of Tutankhamen," which brought 1,250,629 visitors in 1978, 
and "A Day in the Country," a 1984 show of French Impressionism attended by 
460,000 people. But "Picasso" brought nearly five times the 31,712 visitors of 
"Friedrich to Hodler: A Romantic Tradition, Paintings and Drawings From the 
Oskar Reinhart Foundation, Winterthur," the preceding attraction in the same 
galleries, and it proved far more popular than several past exhibitions of 
modern art that might have been expected to attract the same audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most visitors had to wait in line to see 60 portrayals of anguished 
female faces and to learn about Picasso's relationships with the women whose 
appearances he transformed so dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiastic reception provided a welcome boost to the museum, which has 
endured severe cuts in budgets and staff during the past two years, but it also 
came as something of a surprise. Although an advertising campaign sponsored by 
Paine Webber was expected to pay off and the show was open on Tuesdays (when 
the rest of the museum is closed due to an ongoing budget crunch), the 
installation was designed for relatively intimate viewing -- not for the large 
crowds that turned out to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Judi Freeman, a former LACMA curator who organized the show, confesses that 
even she was surprised by the response. "It reflects a combination of interest 
in the art and life of Picasso and a healthy respect for women," she said, in a 
telephone interview from the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Me. (Freeman 
resigned from LACMA to become Joan Whitney Payson curator in Portland, a 
position she has held since last August.) 
</P>
<P>
 "People responded on a personal-content level," Freeman said. "The exhibition 
gave them a sense of getting a look inside someone's life. People admired the 
strength of the art, but it's the biographical element that will be 
remembered." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding an unexpected hit to her resume has been a valuable learning 
experience, Freeman said. Despite the conventional wisdom that art should stand 
on its own merit, audiences want to make connections with the people behind the 
artworks that museums display, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that art has to be of certain caliber. It must be 
intrinsically interesting. But then it's a question of how to present it. If 
you just stick it on a wall, it's not going to be remembered," she said. 
"Everything in museums was made by somebody. We don't always know who that 
somebody was, but who that person was, is so intimately tied to the work that 
it can't be separated." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition will appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, June 
12-Sept. 4, and at the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 8-Jan. 8, 1995. Several 
works from a variety of collections are expected to be added at both locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Museum of Modern Art in New York is planning its own Picasso 
show, a survey of portraits, for 1996. The exhibition is being organized by 
William Rubin, MOMA's curator emeritus who recently disclosed his belief that 
the subject of many Picasso portraits from the 1920s was not his wife, Olga, 
but American socialite Sara Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's revelation has led to speculation about a Picasso movie exploring 
Picasso's relationship with Murphy. Meanwhile, Freeman has been approached by 
four filmmakers. It's too early to say if any of them will develop acceptable 
proposals, she said, but she hasn't ruled out the possibility.

THEATRE BEAT: 'REFLECTIONS' A R.A.W. LOOK AT FEMINISM AT WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern novelist Carson McCullers' "Reflections in a Golden Eye" focuses on 
an abused Army wife's emerging independence. At West Coast Ensemble, it is no 
coincidence that Toni Wilson titles her compelling study of feminism 
"Reflections in a Black Woman's Eye." The South is a mirror of South-Central 
L.A., she implies, and feminist struggles are color blind. McCullers and Wilson 
are soul "sistuhs." 
</P>
<P>
 So four women sit on stools, telling stories, repeating poems, singing songs, 
educating one another and their audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man is a man no matter what the color," says one of Wilson's charismatic 
actresses. Another agrees but then remembers her man: "His dark eyes bore into 
my very soul. Oh, he was my lover, my master, my god." A third laughs, adding: 
"Hey, my man watches that new Janet Jackson video and says my butt's too big!" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, they portray children, skipping in a circle, singing a nursery 
rhyme: "Big lips! Fat hips! Wide nose! Nappy hair!" 
</P>
<P>
 Just as quickly another mood descends. Now the women are oppressed by 
memories. "Why are you black women so loud?" one chants to the audience. "Why 
are you black women so pushy? Peek into my world and tell me what you see. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Round and round goes the kaleidoscopic world of Wilson's "Reflections," and 
sometimes it stops on a vibrant scene -- a spiritual sung by a church choir -- 
and sometimes it stops on a sentimental sequence -- a black child's experience 
in a white ballet school. We learn about men and women, welfare hell, the fire 
next time, fathers and mothers. They're specifically African American, but 
their lives are universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Minimally staged, the mix of monologues, poetry, song and slightly dramatized 
episodes resembles Ntozake Shange's "for colored girls who have considered 
suicide/when the rainbow is enuf." What's missing is the historical urgency and 
emotional rage that fueled the seminal feminism of Beah Richards' 1950 classic 
"A Black Woman Speaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-directed by Wilson and Gammy Singer, this brief, fragmented work is far 
from perfect. But that's by design, as the production is part of the theater's 
provocative development program, R.A.W. (Radical Alternative at West Coast). 
There's definitely enough raw material to shape into a satisfying production. 
The core performers -- Sherria Seward, Elizabeth Jean-Paul, Jean Marie 
Hamilton, Rhonda Walker -- coupled with five dynamic gospel singers -- Vonna 
Bowen, Bobbye D. L. Gooden, Sherry D. Green, Nelva Sandefur, Ejaye Tracey -- 
collaborate like a seamless ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw out the lifeline," they sing in gospel harmony during a simulated 
church meeting, "someone is drifting away." It's a sermon this city might be 
wise to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Reflections in a Black Woman's Eye," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood 
Blvd., Hollywood. Mondays-Thursdays, 8 p.m. Ends May 26. $10. (213) 871-1052. 
Running time: 1 hour.  
</P>
<P>
 'Company Policy': Rage and Vision 
</P>
<P>
 "The first play to deal with Black rage in corporate America" is the written 
claim made by Michael Ajakwe Jr., about his "Company Policy" at the Hudson 
Backstage. The subject is "Buppies" -- upwardly mobile African Americans in a 
small Los Angeles insurance firm. Hired because of affirmative action laws, a 
black woman and a black man are forced to compete during their "probationary 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright-director Ajakwe credits David Mamet for "inspiration," and indeed 
"Company Policy" could be seen as an African American "Glengarry Glenn Ross," 
especially since it includes an office scam involving salesmen's "leads." 
</P>
<P>
 Ajakwe has a distinctive playwright's voice and knows this territory. 
Sometimes the plotting is amateur, sometimes the dialogue disintegrates into 
diatribe, and often the white characters are caricatures. But there is genuine 
vision inside his raging rhetoric as well as sobering political lessons, 
however awkwardly staged. Underneath these office politics simmers an 
intelligence that understands discrimination on all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly unnerving is the abusive exploitation of a male professional by 
his female boss. Feminists may not like the reverse sexism, but Ajakwe 
convincingly demonstrates why laws protecting workers against abuse of power 
are rarely enforced. "Just like a sister," angrily responds the insurance 
salesman to a co-worker who witnessed his treatment. "Quick to criticize and 
slow to support." 
</P>
<P>
 "Company Policy" is packed with misogyny, stereotypes, polemical speeches and 
bitterness -- just as promised. Despite clumsy dramaturgy, it delivers a 
scathing, imperfect, disturbing profile of black rage among "successful" 
African Americans. Ajakwe may not be the first to explore office politics 
through a black perspective, but he is definitely a playwright to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Company Policy," Hudson Backstage Theatre, 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Saturday matinee, 4 p.m. Ends June 4. 
$10-$12. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 'Ars Erotica' Falls Short at Fountain 
</P>
<P>
 Director Stephen Sachs is often brilliant with established classics. This last 
year witnessed his inspired revival of "The Boys in the Band" and his rigorous 
treatment of " 'night, Mother." But when Sachs helps develop new material, the 
result is oddly turgid. Case in point: "Ars Erotica" at the Fountain Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Jay Alan Quantrill desperately requires an editor for his tortured 
exploration of art and pornography. The subject is a 1912 censorship trial of 
Austrian Expressionist artist Egon Schiele (portrayed hysterically by Walt 
Goggins as a kind of Germanic Blanche DuBois). The plot Ping-Pongs between a 
jail cell and a hearing room. Pompous aesthetic debates are choreographed like 
a ponderous courtroom drama, but what the material requires is an 
Expressionistic treatment -- outrageous self-expression and sexually disturbing 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "Ars Erotica" censors itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ars Erotica," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends May 21. $15-$17.50. Running 
time: 2 hours. 'Children': Wanna-Be Cops and Rockers 
</P>
<P>
 At the Lost Studio, playwright Matthew Weiss may want "Slow Children" to be a 
sluggish, infantile farce that lampoons the heavy-metal rock world. Let's hope 
so. Among its prestigious East Coast developers are the New York Playwrights 
Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow-witted, wanna-be rocker Rikki (Craig Borten) has handcuffed a policeman 
(Ben Meyerson) to a bed in his grungy Hollywood pad. We learn the cop was about 
to arrest Rikki, who instead made a "citizen's arrest." The absurd turns 
preposterous when the cop's female partner is also captured. She falls in love 
with Rikki, who realizes that he's always wanted to be a cop. Since her partner 
always dreamed of becoming a heavy-metal rocker, everyone lives happily ever 
after. Change the uniform and exchange identities and you have a ludicrous 
"Mrs. Doubtfire Goes Grunge." 
</P>
<P>
 Now we know why they're called metal-heads. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Slow Children," Lost Studio, 130 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends May 15. $12.50. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1

ROYAL CLAPTRAP, STAR TURNS AND SUBTLE POETRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ever-optimistic management at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
heralded the Royal Ballet agenda on Thursday as "A Gala Programme." The tone, 
like the spelling, suggested something very grand and veddy British. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the event resembled nothing so much as a royal grab-bag -- sometimes 
distressing, sometimes risible, sometimes silly, sometimes touching and, thank 
goodness, sometimes illuminating. Stylistic consistency obviously was not the 
issue here. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst came first. It came, alas, in "The Judas Tree," which represents 
Kenneth MacMillan's valedictory. The late choreographer's final hour with the 
Royal Ballet was not his finest. 
</P>
<P>
 In this contrived and convoluted exercise in contemporary obfuscation, 
MacMillan tried desperately to be trendy. Also bleak and deep. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned to Brian Ellis for a timidly discordant score that wallows in 
ancient-modernist cliches. He turned to Jock McFadyen for a quaint 
London-junkyard set, complete with discarded cars, looming skyscraper and 
convenient scaffolding (the better to hang you by, my dear). 
</P>
<P>
 Within this urban-life-is-hell milieu MacMillan offered some blights of his 
own. He toyed with a mystical mumbo-jumbo narrative that fused Grand Guignol 
melodrama with Biblical symbolism. He gave his dancers a movement vocabulary 
that clumsily juxtaposed rough-and-tumble theatrics with snatches of 
ballet-is-beautiful artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject, we think, is betrayal. The Judas of this tortuous tale -- 
identified in the, er, programme, as The Foreman -- hangs out with 13 
pretty-boy hoods (remember the Sharks and Jets?). They dabble in competitive 
beefcake display, rumble on command, eye each other all too knowingly, model 
yellow rain-slickers in moments of turmoil, and pay homage to the old bromide 
(Ogden Nash, I think) that claims seduction is for sissies but a he-man likes 
his rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape victim turns out to be The Woman -- ah, those fraught-with-meaning 
names. She happens to wear a tight little bathing suit, and she spends a lot of 
time tugging at its crotch. She also wraps herself in a saintly sheet when the 
spirit dictates. The London press tells us that she represents a combination of 
Madonna (not the declining superstar) and Magdalene. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the soggy saga reaches its merciful end (not a second too soon), a 
Jesus-esque figure turns up for a kiss-the-other-cheek ritual, two murders are 
committed, another ballerina is rushed into the wings under a sheet (we see 
only her toe shoes), and, oh yes, the Foreman makes gimmicky but fatal use of 
the noose prop. 
</P>
<P>
 It all must mean something. Frankly, my dear, MacMillan doesn't let us give a 
darn. Claptrap. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance looked good, but it hardly mattered. This exercise wasn't 
about dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 As the titular whatever, the vaunted Irek Mukhamedov crouched, contorted, 
crawled, cowered, sprawled, leapt and popped his eyes with distorted yet 
disciplined Bolshoi bravado, despite an onstage accident that left him a 
bloodied finger. Viviana Durante suffered the cruel indignities of the 
eternally feminine victim with fragile prettiness. William Trevitt seemed 
competent as the Foreman's Christ-like friend. (We think it was Trevitt; in 
this case, it was hard to tell the players even with a program.) Barry 
Woodsworth did what he could in the clangy orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, it was all uphill from here. Everything, of course, is relative. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle portion of the show focused on three contrasting duets. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoltan Solymosi, flamboyant if a bit primitive, partnered Darcey Bussell, 
radiant if a bit robust, in a fuzzy approximation of Balanchine's "Tchaikovsky 
Pas de Deux." Oddly and regrettably, this five-minute exercise turned out to be 
Bussell's only assignment in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Viviana Durante, now properly ethereal, came back to terra firma in Frederick 
Ashton's "Thais Pas de Deux," gallantly partnered by a seemingly narcissistic 
Stuart Cassidy. The perfumed exotica was bemusing. The bejeweled, blushing-pink 
hootchy-kooch costumes by Anthony Dowell (who had danced the premiere in 1971 
opposite the exquisite Antoinette Sibley) could not be described as refined. 
Still, one had to applaud the subtlety of the choreography -- all legato sighs 
and gestural whispers -- as well as the lyric finesse of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the local premiere of the "Herman Schmerman" pas de deux, a 
whimsically with-it essay by that all-American bad-boy, William Forsythe. The 
daring, long-legged Sylvie Guillem did her cool funky-punky thing, unblushingly 
sporting a Versace costume that left little to the imagination regarding her 
anatomy above the waist. Under the circumstances, Adam Cooper, her able 
partner, had to work doubly hard to sustain attention, even when he suddenly 
appeared in a tiny yellow skirt that matched hers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all good, clean, shrug-and-shuffle fun. Forsythe knows how to cope with 
the Tharper image. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillem returned after intermission as Natalia Petrovna, the bored and 
frustrated introvert who dominates Ashton's masterpiece, "A Month in the 
Country." The French guest-artist is a flashy, athletic ballerina blessed with 
legs that go on forever and can kick the stars out of the sky with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature would not seem to have intended her for the poetic understatement of 
Turgenev's Russian heroine as filtered through British sensibilities. This, 
after all, was a role created in 1976 for Lynn Seymour. The inherent ecstasies 
and agonies have been defined by such dissimilar interpreters as Antoinette 
Sibley, Natalia Makarova, Altynai Assylmuratova and Genesia Rosato. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an exaggeration to claim that Guillem made the most of Natalia's 
muted passions, or that she made the light and shade of Ashton's bittersweet 
sentiment palpable. Still, she moved with undeniably magnetic force, exuded 
instant glamour, made a commendable effort to suppress her bravura instincts 
and exerted stoic eloquence in the ultimate moment of denial. If she compelled 
more admiration than tears, one still had to be grateful for her intelligence 
and her restraint.

 She was ably if blandly partnered by Bruce Sansom as young Beliaev (not much 
chemistry here), and sympathetically supported by such vaunted Royal Ballet 
veterans as David Drew (Yslaev) and Derek Rencher (Rakitin). Anthony Bourne did 
nicely with the sprightly juvenilia of Natalia's kite-flying kid. Sarah Wildor 
was pertliness personified as Natalia's ward and Gail Taphouse tippy-toed 
knowingly through the piquant duties of Natalia's maid. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Gammon attended eloquently to the moonstruck piano music of Chopin 
recycled in the pit. Anthony Twiner conducted the responsive Pacific Symphony 
con amore. Julia Trevelyan Oman's decors retained their Mozartean elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 A civilized ballet, sensitively performed. At last.

Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, with a different program today 
at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 and 7:30. $20 to $70 at the box office, (714)

DEVOTED DAUGHTER KEEPS VOW WITH 'TRADING MOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Tia Brelis' bedtime story. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "Trading Mom" and it's a grown woman-child's gift to her mother, a 
mom she can no longer hold except through a cherished memory and tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Tia's mom, Nancy Brelis, divorced and mother of four, used to read stories to 
Tia and her siblings every night. Sometimes she would make them up. And 
sometimes she would ask for their input. Then, one day in 1966, she began 
weaving her best story, with contributions from her kids, into a book called 
"The Mommy Market." Tia was so proud of her mother's book that after years of 
promising to turn it into a film someday, she finally kept that promise, though 
not before her mother's death three years ago at 61. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting film, "Trading Mom," directed and written by Brelis and produced 
by Rafaella De Laurentiis (daughter of Dino), opens next week. The Trimark film 
stars Sissy Spacek, Maureen Stapleton, Anna Chlumsky and the late Andre the 
Giant, and tells the story of three children who have had it with their single 
mom and her demands. Wishing for a different mom, they visit their mysterious 
neighbor (Stapleton), who tells them of an ancient spell that can make people 
vanish.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually they put it to the test; their mother disappears and they head to 
the Mommy Market, a sort of one-stop shopping mall for the mother of kids' 
dreams. Problem is, the three mothers bought on trial don't quite work out, 
making the kids appreciate just what they originally had. 
</P>
<P>
 Tia Brelis, 38, was pregnant with her second child (her husband is Universal 
executive Casey Silver) when she first approached De Laurentiis about producing 
the $4-million movie. She was pregnant with her third when Spacek accepted the 
role as the mother and filming was set. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom got to see several drafts of the script before she died (of lymphoma 
cancer)," she says. "I just wish she could be here to celebrate it today. You 
know, it was her first book and she sat down and wrote it in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had always been this great thing I loved. The story came about because we 
used to tease her and say we would trade her in at the mommy market. But I was 
upset by it when I read it as a mother, because in her book it was about 
children who had no mother at all, which I changed. My mom said I corrected the 
flaw in the story, but any change I made I always felt it was almost 
sacrilegious."  
</P>
<P>
 And there was another tribute to her mother as well. "I got all of my mother's 
grandchildren in the film -- just bit parts, cameos, but they're in there. It 
was my gift to her."

FESTIVALS SHOWCASE ASIAN PACIFIC FILM TREASURES; MOVIES: TWO MAJOR EVENTS THIS 
MONTH DISPLAY THE REGION'S FILMS BUT POINT UP THE PAUCITY OF THEATRICAL 
OUTLETS, A SITUATION THAT MAY BE CHANGING.

 The ninth Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film and Video Festival will open May 18, 
establishing itself as the largest event of its kind in the country. This 
year's edition will showcase 112 works, including nine features in their 
American premieres and three more in their West Coast premieres. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors are the UCLA Film and Television Archive and Visual Communications, 
an L.A.-based Asian Pacific American media arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 14-year-old Hawai'i International Film Festival will present, 
for the first time in Los Angeles, its sixth annual Asia-Pacific Film Tour. It 
will stop at USC Sunday through Friday as part of an 11-city tour to display 
six recent features and four video documentaries focusing on Hawaiian history 
and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If these festivals attest to the growing awareness of the Asian Pacific 
cinema, they also call attention to the paucity of such films in local 
theaters. The old warning regarding foreign films may still be true: Festivals 
may be your only opportunity to see them. Yet happily this may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a near yearlong experiment, from April, 1993, to March, 1994, Rim Films, a 
subsidiary of Raymond Chow's Golden Harvest Productions, booked one of the 
screens at the Monica 4-Plex with only Hong Kong product. Golden Harvest 
ultimately decided to refocus its priorities, which include launching into 
Southeast Asian production, and got out of exhibition. It did prove, however, 
that there is an audience, mainly younger and racially and ethnically diverse, 
for Asian Pacific pictures. As a result, some of the more venturesome small 
distribution companies are considering taking a chance on Hong Kong product; no 
doubt they will be looking upon these two festivals with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly eight decades, except the World War II years, Los Angeles was never 
without a Japanese-language theater, and by at least the '60s those films were 
always presented with English subtitles. The long-defunct Toho La Brea 
attracted a largely non-Asian audience, especially when it presented samurai 
movies, and over the years such sadly missed theaters as the Kabuki, the 
Kokusai and the Little Tokyo Cinemas attempted to attract crossover audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 This has never been the case with the Chinese-language theaters, several of 
which continue to thrive without making any effort to reach beyond the Chinese 
community. Filipino films haven't had a local showcase since the Linda Lea on 
Main Street for at least a decade, and the Indian cinema, which at various 
times has had its own local showcases, has been co-opted by the near-instant 
availability of its films on cassette. Unsubtitled Korean films have been a 
staple at the Four Star Theater for years, but only with the recent "Two Cops," 
presented at the Vista (because of earthquake damage at the Four Star), has 
there been an attempt to reach non-Korean moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of these vicissitudes in exhibition is that the Asian Pacific cinema 
has as rich and varied a heritage as the American and European cinemas, 
especially the Japanese, who have been responsible for some of the greatest 
films made anywhere. It therefore seems a safe bet that both festivals will 
have their own treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawai'i Film Festival director Jeannette Paulson has been especially impressed 
with Xie Fei's "The Women From the Lake of the Scented Souls" (USC Norris 
Theater, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.), a strong women's drama that just happened to be 
UCLA's Asian Pacific Fest closing-night attraction last year; "Southern Winds" 
(Norris, Monday at 5 p.m.), an anthology film with contributions by four Asian 
directors dealing with the common theme of changing Asia, and "Act of War" 
(Norris, Friday at 8 p.m.), a video documentary, made collectively, on the 1893 
U.S. invasion of the independent kingdom of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a retrospective of a selection of '30s films by Yasujiro Ozu, one 
of Japan's greatest directors -- his 1952 "Tokyo Story" is a staple of all-time 
best lists -- UCLA/Visual Communications' offerings span "Canadian Tales," 
short works by Canadian Asian Pacific filmmakers, to the experimental work of 
Yoko Ono and a series of contemporary Korean films. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening-night attraction is Huang Jianxin's "The Wooden Man's Bride" (UCLA 
Melnitz, May 19, 7 p.m.), a folk tale about a woman forced to marry the wooden 
effigy of the man she was betrothed to, from the maker of the controversial 
"Black Cannon Incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Also from China: Zhang Yuan's "Beijing Bastards" (Laemmle's Grande, May 20, 9 
p.m.), described by film historian Tony Rayns, an Asian Pacific specialist, as 
a "seemingly free-form portrait of rock-generation kids in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Chung Ji-Young's "White Badge" (Melnitz, May 21, 7 p.m.) is the first Korean 
film to depict the experiences of that country's Vietnam War veterans, 300,000 
of whom fought alongside U.S. troops. Also highly touted is Beat Takeshi's 
Japanese gangster picture "Sonatine" (Melnitz, May 24, 9 p.m.).  
</P>
<P>
 "Sopyonje" (Grande, May 24, 7 p.m.), Korea's biggest box-office hit ever, is a 
sad tale focusing on the itinerant pansori singers of the '50s -- pansori is 
akin to the blues -- made by Korea's most celebrated director, Im Kwon-Taek. 
Carlos Siguion-Reyna's "I Will Wait for You in Heaven" (Grande, May 25, 7 p.m.) 
transposes Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights" to the Philippines in the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the UCLA/Visual Communications festival on May 29 at 7 p.m. in Melnitz 
Theater is Hong Kong filmmaker Clara Law's "Temptation of a Monk," an allegory 
set in the Tang Dynasty that deals with two imperial princes scheming to 
succeed to the throne.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BEETHOVEN'S 5TH, TWO PREMIERES AT PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A world premiere, a Los Angeles Philharmonic premiere and Beethoven: Esa-Pekka 
Salonen's penultimate program of the orchestra's winter season offered a little 
bit for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 And everybody seemed to show up; according to Philharmonic officials, the 
first of four performances of the music director's Rodriguez/Carter/Beethoven 
program sold out the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious reason was Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, which closed the program, 
but those who came only for that should have been pleased by the bonuses: the 
world premiere of a 90-second but splendid and ear-opening piece by Carlos 
Rodriguez; the Philharmonic's first performance of a 52-year-old work by 
Elliott Carter, and, counterbalancing the C-minor Symphony, a Beethoven 
overture, not coincidentally, in the key of C. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, in the half-century since his Symphony No. 1, has become celebrated 
for the seriousness, intellectual rigor and convoluted rhetoric of his style. 
That early work, though different in many ways from the admirable works which 
have emanated from the American composer's writing desk since the late 1940s, 
shares Carter's fatal virtue, complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds jolly, it sounds likable. As played with virtuoso jauntiness by the 
Philharmonic, it is accessible, brilliant, often tonal, even bucolic. But it 
has many layers, inner workings and continuous subtexts, and it is cram full of 
activity both melodic and mental. A first hearing -- which for most in this 
audience this was -- proved charming.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's contribution to the Philharmonic's 75th anniversary string of 
fanfares netted a joyous, pleasantly raucous and compelling short piece for 17 
players, 15 of them brass. "Fanfarria para Los Angeles" -- there's an 
angel/city pun in there -- commands attention, not least for all the music the 
33-year-old, New York-born composer makes resonate in less than two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 After all this welcome excitement before intermission, Beethoven's Fifth, 
afterward, continued the parade of breathlessness. Under Salonen's brisk 
leadership, the familiar work did not turn out over-fast or over-loud, though 
it flirted with both. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensemble proved reliable, solo lines clarified, tempos articulate, if pushy. 
The orchestra played splendidly. Yet one felt only a modicum of compulsion or 
conviction in the overall. What seemed missing was a certain transparency, a 
certain urgency that could have been achieved in a less goal-oriented and more 
probing reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the evening, much the same could be said about Salonen's staid, 
rather than spacious, leadership of Beethoven's "Consecration of the House" 
Overture. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Philharmonic's Rodriguez/Beethoven/Carter program will be 
played again Sunday at 2:30 and Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave. Tickets $6-$50, (213) 850-2000.

MUSIC REVIEWS; LACO SEASON FINALE DISPLAYS ENERGY AND IDENTITY CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For its final program of a financially troubled season, the Los Angeles 
Chamber Orchestra seemed, quixotically, intent on showing how expensive it 
could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Its program on Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium consisted of familiar works, 
guided by the propulsive yet sensitively shaping baton of Christof Perick and 
played by as many as 50 super-skilled musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Big music -- two Rossini overtures, those to "La scala di seta" and 
"Semiramide" -- surrounded Mozart's fragile Concerto for Flute and Harp and 
Schubert's big, "Unfinished" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Every measure of this crowd-pleasing agenda was marked by energy and 
cohesiveness, with the ensemble's celebrated wind principals -- clarinetist 
Gary Gray, oboist Allan Vogel and flutist David Shostac, the latter joined by 
harpist JoAnn Turovsky in the Mozart concerto -- delivering with optimum 
aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Unfinished" was lithe and lean, but hardly severe, its songs sung with 
natural grace and without dubious late-Romantic expressive enhancements. 
</P>
<P>
 These lofty accomplishments, however, also served to focus on the orchestra's 
identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 LACO's founding aim was to present relatively intimate repertory, chiefly from 
the 18th and 20th centuries, otherwise unavailable locally on a high 
professional level. Since then, LACO has increasingly encroached on "symphony 
orchestra" material, the fact that it may not have been intended for 
Philharmonic-sized forces notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's concert was grand and even subtle fun, with degrees of dynamic 
shading -- and volume -- that 20-some musicians could not have accomplished. 
But then the dozens of middle-period Haydn symphonies and neo-classical 
Stravinsky we rarely hear require something quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-ensemble Haydn costs much less to produce. But it's unlikely to elicit 
the high-volume audience delight of a walloping Rossini crescendo and climax. A 
choice must be made. HERBERT GLASS

POP MUSIC REVIEW ; QUEEN LATIFAH LIGHTENS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Latifah sure has lightened up. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, this 23-year-old New Jersey rapper, who performed at the 
Palace on Thursday, was caught up in being regal and stoically Afrocentric.Her 
concerts weren't really fun, but more like classes where fans were instructed, 
to a hip-hop beat, how to be a good, proud African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Now her show really is fun -- at the Palace, the Queen was not behaving 
regally at all. Decked out in baggy overalls, she romped gleefully around 
stage, egging the crowd to have a good time. On such message-heavy songs as 
"U.N.I.T.Y" and "Just Another Day" the emphasis wasn't on the lyrical content 
but on those ragingly funky beats laid down by her formidable backup band. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe having a second career -- starring in the hit TV sitcom "Living Single" 
-- has changed her priorities and loosened her up. But there's been no change 
in her rapping skills, which are as sharp as ever.  
</P>
<P>
 She always was one of the smoothest, most authoritative rappers around -- far 
superior to all the female competition and better than most of the males. And 
she hasn't succumbed to the gangsta-rap lure. She's still basically a pop 
rapper, managing to be sexy and maintain street credibility without resorting 
to vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solsonics, a mostly instrumental, jazz-oriented band, opened the show with 
a terrific set, playing rocking jams that were teeming with all sorts of 
textures -- including Latin, funk and soul -- in a multitude of combinations.

ART REVIEW; PIPPIN DETERMINED TO INVENT THE CAMERA ALL OVER AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people are wary in the presence of a camera precisely because a camera is 
a seeing machine: It lives to watch us, to catch us, to trap us in its gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the walls, too, had eyes, along with the car parked across the 
street, your mattress, your shoes and the stall of your shower? Steven Pippin 
has turned a washing machine into a pinhole camera, converted a bathtub into an 
instrument to record his naked body and rigged a toilet on the 
London-to-Brighton train to take pictures, by lining the bowl with 
photo-sensitive paper and adding developer and fixer with successive flushes. 
</P>
<P>
 However tongue-in-cheek, his work at Regen Projects breeds suspicion -- not of 
people but of things. Things are never neutral in this British artist's world; 
they are sly and greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pippin's bizarrely spectacular objects are alienated from their former 
functions, their creator is alienated from (or oblivious to) the history of 
photography. He is an anachronism looking forward to the 19th Century, perfect 
in the role of Louis Daguerre's ingenious but perverse younger brother, 
determined to invent the camera all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippin's persona is an important part of this ongoing project. His discreet 
wardrobe and furtive activities are revealed in film and video documentations 
typically shown alongside his photos. The latter are almost always images of 
the artist, as in the 1987 "Self-Portrait With Photo Booth." 
</P>
<P>
 This 67-foot-by-27-foot, black-and-white print was made with a photo booth 
transformed into a pinhole camera. The artist affixed a wooden panel over a 
doorway usually covered only with a curtain, and lined the opposite wall with a 
huge sheet of photo paper. Outside the booth, for the duration of the 20-minute 
exposure, Pippin faced the makeshift aperture, standing perfectly still. 
</P>
<P>
 The blurred image that resulted reveals a figure in a dark jacket, his hands 
held primly at his sides. Though the artist is indeed present, his body seems 
to mark an absence, like the chalk lines left behind at the scene of a crime. 
The photograph discloses that Pippin is an invisible man, a spy, a cipher. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similarly ghoulish vein, a 1993 series of toilet bowl images are so 
fuzzy, splotchy and stained, due to the incessant motion of the train in which 
they were made, they look like evidence of some unspeakable act. This time, 
however, Pippin, in the guise of victim/victimizer, has vanished entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest, somewhat different project is a mural-sized photographic negative 
that records a bleak stretch of desert. Taken with a beaten-up 
trailer-cum-pinhole camera, which is parked outside the gallery, the image 
makes a bid for the familiar kind of artistry Pippin has so far eschewed. More 
riveting than its Antonioni-like moodiness are the tire tracks the trailer has 
left behind in the sand. Here, the image becomes a record of the apparatus of 
its making, suggesting that things are not only sly and greedy, but 
solipsistic, too. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; THE GLORY OF 'ROMAN CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viewers can take a captivating journey to the ancient world courtesy of "Roman 
City," the latest animated and live-action special based on the work of 
author-illustrator David Macauley, who previously has documented how pyramids, 
castles and cathedrals were built. 
</P>
<P>
 In the live-action sequences, Macauley goes on location to explain the glory 
that was Rome's cities, and how their basic design -- with marketplaces, 
theaters, public baths and running water -- was exported throughout most of the 
known world. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially engrossing is Macauley's visit to the remains of the Colosseum of 
Rome, the greatest stadium of its day. He shows us what remains of the complex 
basement area, where gladiators and wild animals waited to be taken -- by 
elevator -- to the floor of the Colosseum, site of some of the most brutal 
entertainment ever provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The animation sequences tell of the construction of the fictional city of 
Verbonia in the frontier territory of Gaul (now France) around 27 B.C. These 
portions of the program are most interesting when revealing the construction of 
Verbonia; less successful are the subplots involving a mischievous daughter and 
a love-struck civil engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Roman City" is an engrossing look into the history of a fascinating 
civilization. The Romans' feats of civic endeavor would be unsurpassed in the 
Western world for 1,500 years. 
</P>

GARDENING; A NEW DAY DAWNS ON SUNFLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sunflower, popular as a design image and cut flower in recent years, is 
leaving in its wake a new garden favorite. While interest in the flower that 
Vincent van Gogh and others have found so irresistible has never really gone 
out of style, it is just now having its day in the sun in home gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes longer to generate new plants than it does new textiles and ceramics, 
hence the time lag between design trend and horticulture. But, while design 
trends come and go, plants put down roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers needed time to experiment with hybrids bred for ornamental rather than 
food production value before deciding on the best and producing enough for mass 
distribution. Nurseries needed to test the market before loading up on 
sunflower seed and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 And cutting-edge gardeners needed a season or two to see if they could 
incorporate these brash, in-your-face newcomers into their refined cottage 
gardens. Consequently, as a horticultural trend, sunflowers are just now coming 
into full flower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started about three or four years ago, when florists and bucket shops 
began offering a Japanese hybrid sunflower called 'Taiyo' as a cut flower, and 
customers came in asking if they could grow it in their own gardens," says Mary 
Lou Heard of Heard's Country Gardens in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 However, seeds were nearly impossible to obtain outside the florist trade at 
that time, she says. But soon other growers, quick to note consumer interest, 
began their own hybridizing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They changed the color, they changed the height of the plant, they changed 
the size of the center disk, they changed the size of the quills (petals), and 
they changed the growing habit to produce multibranching plants so there would 
be more flowers to cut," Heard says. "Then they picked the ones they liked and 
began propagating them like crazy to produce enough for the seed catalogue 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Heard ordered every sunflower variety she could get her hands on last year and 
tried them out in a test bed before deciding on which ones to propagate for 
sale at the nursery this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on staff and customer reactions, she concluded local gardeners are not 
bothered by the height of some of these plants, despite the limited size of 
their yards. Tall fellows like 'Henry Wilde,' which soars to seven feet, were 
as admired as the comparatively diminutive three-foot 'Sunrich Lemon.' 
</P>
<P>
 Any sun-kissed color seemed fine, too. The pastel yellow 'Valentine' was 
appreciated as much as the nearly mahogany 'Velvet Queen,' for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither customers nor staff responded to varieties where the proportions 
between quill and disk size were drastically altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't like pompon-like doubles without disks, or varieties that were 
all disk with just a fringe of petals," Heard says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted sunflowers to look like sunflowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Hackman of Fountain Valley already has the kind of cottage garden many 
less experienced gardeners still hope to achieve. Lots of roses, bearded iris, 
larkspur and foxglove in a soothing color combination of lavender, purple and 
pink with just enough jolts of white and butter yellow to keep things lively. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the midst of the polished refinement, Hackman found room for something 
as rowdy as 'Henry Wilde.' Though this variety of ornamental sunflower has the 
moderate-sized flowers normally preferred for cutting (five to six inches 
wide), the plant itself grows to an imposing seven-foot height. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackman sowed seeds in a patch of sunny bare earth near the block wall 
enclosing her back yard every few weeks from March through early August last 
year. Doing so provided her with a cut-flower supply -- as well as leftovers 
for the local avian population -- through early October. She's doing it again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays up the all-American quality of sunflowers by including rustic garden 
ornaments in the same area -- a small windmill, a wagon wheel and a wheelbarrow 
full of potted red geraniums. Also included in the vignette is a rusty metal 
bucket used as a planter filled with the dwarf sunflower 'Big Smile' ("So cute 
you want to hug it," Hackman says) underplanted with creeping zinnia 
(Sanvitalia) , which is a four-inch-tall sunflower look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more vivid contrast, she suggests combining 'Big Smile' with 
nasturtiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I particularly like 'Alaska' because of its pretty variegated leaves," 
Hackman says. "And 'Empress of India,' with its jewel-red flowers and 
blue-green leaves, would look smashing, maybe with some dark blue lobelia 
around the edges for even more color." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Weber-Fow of Tustin is an artist as well as a gardener, and she brings 
the same creative daring to her landscape. The lawn in front of her house has 
been converted into one big flower bed. Last year she planted a double row of 
ornamental sunflowers here, and not at the back of the border where you might 
expect, but up front, just behind the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember what they were, but I interplanted a tall variety with a 
shorter, boxier kind to help prop them up in the Santa Ana winds," says 
Weber-Fow. "It worked well, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The sunflowers screened out the view of the street and gave visitors wandering 
the meandering pathway through the wide border the feeling they were in an 
enclosed world. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was exactly the effect I hoped for," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber-Fow likes sunflowers with other hot-colored flowers, such as 
magenta-flowered amaranth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a combination they use a lot in Kansas -- which is where I'm from -- 
that I've always liked," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other partnerships that please her are tall marigolds, the red tubes of 
pineapple sage and the "last of the cosmos." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber-Fow did not deadhead her sunflowers, giving the birds a feast. They 
returned the favor by scattering seed, and she had volunteer plants emerging in 
her garden all through fall, winter and up through last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 This sight was a revelation to Colleen Mongan of Cowan Heights, a gardening 
friend, who had considered sunflowers strictly a summer annual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunflower colors look even better in fall, I've decided," she says. "I'm 
going to plant a second crop in August this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz Steinbach of Huntington Beach also used the sunflower screen idea last 
year, when he converted his parkway into a cutting garden devoted exclusively 
to ornamental sunflowers. Like Heard, he planted every variety he could lay his 
hands on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his favorites were 'Lemon Queen' ("gorgeous 10-inch wide flowers 
exactly the color of supermarket lemons"), 'Evening Sun,' ("dramatic bronzes"), 
'Italian White,' ("the flowers went on and on and on") and -- to harvest for 
his pet parrot -- the food sunflower, 'Russian Giant.' 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, there's the traditional way to use sunflowers -- in 
combination with summer vegetables. Mongan, for instance, finds them very 
pretty peeking up over green pole beans in her raised vegetable beds. And 
Hackman has a friend who grows sunflowers along with tomatoes, squash, peppers 
and pumpkins in her parkway every summer -- a sight that never fails to delight 
the neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've always hesitated to plant sunflowers because you thought they would 
overpower your small garden, reconsider this year. There are now ornamental 
varieties available in sizes as small as 18-inches high that even the tiniest 
yard can find room for. And they have the same cheery faces their taller 
relatives do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something very endearing about sunflower faces," Hackman says. 
"Whenever you look at one, somehow you just can't help but smile back."

INTERIORS; NATURALLY UNDERFOOT; PLANT FIBERS SUCH AS SEA GRASS, AGAVE AND 
COCONUT WOVEN INTO FLOOR COVERINGS ARE FINDING GREAT FAVOR BECAUSE OF THEIR 
TOUGHNESS AND VERSATILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, floor coverings woven from sea 
grass, agave, coconut and other plants should feel pretty smug these days. Long 
before synthetic ever came to be associated with floor coverings, these natural 
fibers were underfoot in homes -- often humble ones -- around the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the look of the fibers has proven so versatile in modern homes that it 
is being duplicated by manufacturers in conventional carpet materials such as 
wool. Those who opt for the real thing are finding it's readily available.  
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from dirt-cheap grass mats (about $4 a square yard) found at Cost 
Plus and Pier One Imports to high-end sisal-look-alike wool carpets by Karastan 
(about $70 a square yard) that mimic their poorer relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The natural fiber coverings come primarily from three sources: sisal, coir and 
reed. Each has its own particular look and characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisal (pronounced sigh-sul ) is made from the Mexican agave, renowned for the 
strength of its leaf fibers. These fibers are harvested as an annual crop and 
then machine-loomed into distinctive broadlooms. The advantage to sisal is its 
durability and the way dirt flows through it; the disadvantage is its ability 
to hold stains, which set permanently unless cleaned right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Coir is the tough, coarse fiber from the husk of the fruit of the coconut 
palm. After immersing the fibers in saltwater for months, they become pliable 
enough for spinning into yarn by hand. Later, the yarn is machine-loomed into 
heavy textured and durable broadlooms. Like sisal, coir is durable but also 
holds stains. In areas where no eating occurs, like an office or a living room, 
this generally isn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sisal and coir can crumble and shed fiber and dust, but the more 
expensive varieties that are latex- or vinyl-backed stop dirt falling through 
to the floor and impede shedding. This is particularly important when the 
covering is used wall to wall. Cut into long strips, these are good choices for 
stairs and hallways since they're strong and don't show traffic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed is made from the tall perennial grasses of saltwater marshes. This "sea 
grass," strong and long-lasting, is harvested at the end of the growing season, 
then machine-loomed into a natural material. Sea grass has the same advantages 
of coir and sisal, but it also repels stains with its natural saline coating, 
making it probably the most practical of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all these products are made from natural vegetable fibers, there are 
weaving irregularities, knots, stubs and slight color variations within the 
covering that give it character and texture. 
</P>
<P>
 "These fibers have been used for hundreds of years," said David Atwood of DWD 
Interior Design in Design Center South in Laguna Niguel. "They were originally 
used by the poor people. For example, in Egypt and Turkey people would use mats 
made of natural fibers to sit on when they journeyed into the desert. It was 
not considered a high-end item. Since it's come to the West, manufacturers have 
been experimenting more and more -- adding colors, mixing fibers and increasing 
sizes." 
</P>
<P>
 Most sisal comes from Mexico, but it's now also being brought in from the 
Philippines, Atwood said. The sisal is generally manufactured in natural or 
bleached colors, but about six years ago it was discovered that sisal could 
take dyes, so the manufacturers started experimenting with different colors and 
patterns. "The advantage to these darker colors is that they don't show stains 
as easily," Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisal, coir and reed area rugs with vinyl backing can be glued to a cement 
floor, or laid loose and then stuck down along the edges using double-sided 
tape, although this process may cause some slight bumping. Carpet pads aren't 
usually needed, although some people prefer them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coverings combine wool with sisal to make for a softer feel. "A lot of 
people like the look of sisal but they don't like to walk on it with their bare 
feet because it doesn't feel good to them. The wool and sisal blend makes it 
much softer and it can be used wall to wall. You do need an expert installer to 
do it properly though. Not just anyone is capable of the job since the 
carpeting is very heavy," Atwood said.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the nylon look-alike options is the Softer-Than-Sisal line by Unique 
Carpets, priced at about $28 a yard. It has about twice the density of an 
average carpet, which makes it very long-lasting, and, if it is paired with a 
dense pad, it can create wall-to-wall carpeting that is virtually 
indestructible, Atwood said. Since it is made of nylon, it comes in just about 
any color and is easy to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Because each type of material used in creating these carpets has advantages 
and drawbacks, the type chosen should reflect the expected pattern of use. 
</P>
<P>
 A sisal look-alike in wool was chosen by Sue White of White Design in Corona 
del Mar for two area rugs in a small condominium. "My clients wanted the look 
of sisal, but they didn't like the feel of it under their feet. Since the rug 
was to be in the living room, they chose a neutral-colored wool carpeting with 
a cotton twill edge banding around it. I had the corners mitered so that the 
ribbon did not form a bump by one strip laying over the other." 
</P>
<P>
 White feels that wool is more resilient than nylon and doesn't have the shine. 
"Sometimes they try to de-luster nylon, but wool has that property naturally. 
Wool is also inherently fire resistant." 
</P>
<P>
 The area rugs in this house work well with the contemporary furniture and the 
white oak floors, making the living room-dining room area both sleek and 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 These floor coverings are being used with all styles of decor, from the most 
casual to the very formal. 
</P>
<P>
 For beach houses, natural fiber area rugs and runners allow sand and dirt to 
fall right through, so sweeping up is easy. With the addition of wicker or cane 
furniture, a casual look is achieved. For a house full of ethnic art and 
artifacts, the sea grass carpeting works well under native kilim and Oriental 
rugs. In a more formal villa, sisal used over stone floors both deadens sound 
and makes for an intriguing mix of styles. In contemporary houses, natural 
fibers contrast well with brightly colored abstract paintings and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 When shopping for these carpets, it's worthwhile to look around, advises 
Atwood. "Right now the market is very competitive and most dealers will match 
prices to get your business. Usually there is an added charge of freight and 
sometimes the latex backing is also extra." 
</P>
<P>
 Few things take as much wear and tear as floor coverings and the growing 
popularity of these natural and quasi-natural fibers is testament to their 
durability, textural interest, color options and -- last but not least -- 
ability to fit into any size budget. Coir and Sisal Care 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some recommendations from manufacturers and carpet experts on caring 
for sisal and coir rugs: 
</P>
<P>
 * Visible and loose dirt should be picked up with vacuum cleaner. This is 
easily done because dirt will not cling to the hard, non-static fibers. Regular 
cleaning is necessary because loose particles of dirt reduce the life span of 
the floor covering with their scouring effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spilled water should be dabbed immediately with a cloth and then dried with 
a hair dryer. Quick action helps prevent water marks, which can form when 
dissolved dirt particles are drawn to the surface as the carpet dries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh stains should be cleaned promptly by scraping up solids and blotting 
liquids. To cut grease, dab with a cloth dampened with white vinegar. Another 
option is to use a small amount of seltzer water to help lift and diffuse the 
stain. Dry with a fresh cloth or hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 * K2R spot remover, available in many hardware and grocery stores, is 
suggested by manufacturers.

THESE PLANTS LIVE TO SOAK UP RAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunflowers have one major requirement. You guessed it -- plenty of sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rake up an area of bare soil in the sunniest part of your yard, broadcast the 
sunflower seeds, scratch a little dirt back over them, apply water regularly 
and stand back.That's really all there is to it, claim experienced sunflower 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 When hard pressed, they will admit to a few small problems. Birds may eat your 
seeds (unless you have a cat patrolling the yard) so it's best to do your 
sowing late in the day after birds have roosted for the night. Be prepared to 
put out bait for snails when your seedlings first emerge. In just a few weeks, 
though, the plants will be tough enough to be impervious to these garden pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hollyhocks, some sunflowers are subject to rust. Most gardeners, however, 
have a casual attitude about it and just pluck off the offending leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers, after all, are the epitome of summer and they, like it, are meant 
to be carefree. SHARON COHOON

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; NO NEED TO FIRE UP THE LAVA ROCKS; PORCELAIN 
BRIQUETTES BURN BETTER IN BARBECUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Q. I was recently given a used propane barbecue that's in fairly good 
condition, except that the lava rocks underneath are full of grease and are all 
over the place. Should they be stacked in some way to make the barbecue work 
right, and how do I clean them? 
</P>

<P>
 A. You really don't need to use lava rocks, says Tom Olsen of Yorba Linda 
Patio & Hearth. They tend to collect grease and cause a lot of flare-ups, which 
can ruin the food you're trying to cook. Their main purpose is to create a 
barrier between the food and the flame. 
</P>
<P>
 A better solution is to spend a little more and get porcelain briquettes. They 
won't break apart over time, and they get extremely hot and burn grease very 
quickly, which keeps them a little cleaner and allows some of the smoke flavor 
to rise back into the meat. With either type of rocks, you should just set one 
layer above the flame. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. One corner of our concrete patio has broken off into three big chunks. Is 
there a way to "glue" them back into place without having to mix up some new 
cement?

<P>
 A. You can try one of two things, says Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in 
Westminster. A concrete adhesive can be applied to the broken pieces and they 
can be set in place, or an exterior caulk can be used. The adhesive is best 
used with a sand and plastic cement combination, but if the area you're 
patching is under two inches, it may be too shallow and you're not likely to 
get a good bond.  
</P>
<P>
 The caulk has a good feel and makes it easy to set broken pieces together, but 
remember that it has some body to it, so you may find it changes the contour of 
the concrete, making one area higher than the other. Also, be sure to have a 
heavy object ready to place on the patched area until it's dry. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Q. I've been told that glass and mirror shops will buy used mirrors but 
haven't been able to find any that do. Where are they?

<P>
 A. If you're interested in selling an old mirror, you may want to place a 
classified ad, says Tammy Griffith of B & D Glass in Orange. Your mirror may 
look like it's in perfect shape to you, but over time, after thousands of 
cleanings and scratches, it loses some of its sparkle and it doesn't look as 
sharp as a new mirror. Many glass shops will pick up large pieces of glass or 
mirror and dispose of them for you as a courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 You could also call some local charities to see if they would have any 
interest in them. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We just bought a house that's half a mile from the beach, and we're looking 
at patio furniture. The set we want is wrought-iron, but is that wise, 
considering the salt air?

</P>
<P>
 A. If it's a good quality, baked-on finish, you shouldn't have a problem, says 
Gary Lillge of Crown Hardware in Corona del Mar. If the set you're looking at 
has a flat finish, you may want to spray it with a clean lacquer (the same kind 
used for brass fixtures near the beach) to help protect it. Keep it clean, of 
course, and examine it periodically for any signs of rust so that it can be 
taken care of before any significant damage sets in. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. My kitchen cabinets were painted two years ago with a latex semi-gloss. I'd 
like to paint over some of the doors that have become nicked and marred. But 
will that make the rest of the cabinets look bad? 
</P>

 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A. The key to doing a good job will be in preparation, says Barbara Brobst of 
Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. Kitchen cabinets are always tough 
because of the amount of traffic and smoke, which will discolor lighter shades. 
With a good household cleaner, wash all of the cabinets and try to remove any 
grease buildup. Use a soft sponge and try not to scrape the finish. When you're 
doing the doors that will be painted, you can clean a little more vigorously, 
then let them dry completely before painting.

BEFORE GETTING A CONTRACTOR FOR HOME WORK, DO THE HOMEWORK; REMODELING 
</P>

 Most everyone knows that when you're planning to hire a contractor for a home 
project, you need to ask for bids. But knowing how to interpret the bids when 
they come in is a little more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you know you're getting an accurate bid? Why is there such a range 
between high and low bids? And how can you be sure that the contractor really 
understands what you want? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're not doing the work yourself, all home-improvement projects 
require you to do some homework. 
</P>
<P>
 The clearer and more specific you are in telling the contractor what you want, 
the more likely you are to get it. That means making a lot of decisions and 
settling a lot of choices before you start talking to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Say, for instance, you would like to add a family room and turn an old pantry 
into a powder room. It isn't necessary to know what kind of nails to specify or 
how many board feet of lumber you'll need. But you do need to know about how 
big you want the room, what kind of ceiling and wall finishes you want 
(cathedral, nine-foot, paneling, drywall?), what kind of flooring you want in 
each space (wood or carpet for the family room, vinyl flooring or ceramic tile 
for the bath?), what kind of windows and doors you'd like (French, patio doors 
to outside?), what kind of fixtures and cabinets you want, and what kind of 
trim you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the decisions you make affect the price of the job. Spend some time in 
showrooms and home-improvement centers to get a better idea of what things 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Then make up a bid package for each contractor you consult. Include a rough 
sketch, pictures if you have them, lists of materials you want used, names and 
model numbers of fixtures and cabinets. The more information you can give the 
contractor, the more likely you are to get a reasonable, accurate bid. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't make up your mind about something, or don't know what your 
options are, or can't be specific about what you want, you are not only making 
it hard for the contractor to produce a good bid, you are setting yourself up 
for hassles later. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors are usually willing to make suggestions based on their experience 
with similar jobs. But they can't read your mind, and few of them have time to 
counsel you on every decision. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you appear too indecisive, you may have trouble getting bids, because 
contractors figure it will take too much time to work out details on a job they 
may not get anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have your package together, make sure you give the same information 
to each person bidding the job. If one contractor makes a suggestion you want 
to incorporate, make sure the other bidders have information on that. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bids come back, take time to study them carefully so you will know 
why they are different. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors base their bids on what it will cost them to do the job. Besides 
labor and materials, contractors have to figure in overhead -- which may 
include office rental, payroll, gas, insurance, licensing fees, worker's 
compensation taxes, liability insurance, Social Security and Medicare payments. 
(Employees are used to having the last two items taken out of their paychecks; 
remember that the employer has to match those payments, which amount to about 8 
cents on each dollar.) 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, a large company will have to charge more for its work to cover 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, large companies may be able to buy materials more cheaply 
in bulk and may be able to finish each job more quickly. With a smaller firm, 
you may deal only with the owner; the job may take longer, but you will be 
getting personal attention and can count on the same quality of work being 
performed every day. Problem resolution may be easier with a small company as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials costs can also differ widely from bid to bid. If you've been 
specific about fixtures and cabinets and what type of finishes you want, that 
will help. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may still be a wide range: One contractor may be planning to use 
R-30 insulation in the ceiling, while another is using only R-19. If you 
haven't specified fixtures, those prices can vary too. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't specified some items, such as light fixtures or appliances, the 
contractor usually includes an allowance for them. Allowances can be low or 
high; remember that the actual number will be based on what is bought. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a $600 light fixture, and the allowance is $120, you'll have to 
make up the difference, either by getting a less expensive item in another 
category or by paying the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything in the bid isn't clear, ask for an explanation. Work performed "to 
code" is often the minimum standard; you may want something more elaborate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For some people, price will always be the most important element. But remember 
that the lowest bid is not always the best bid. It could mean that the 
contractor left something out, is using cheaper materials or doesn't really 
understand what you want. You should be able to tell from reading the bids 
carefully what each contractor plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids are negotiable. If you like a particular contractor, but his or her bid 
seems a little high, discuss it. You may be able to work something out to lower 
the price -- doing painting yourself, for instance, or using less expensive 
trim. 
</P>
<P>
 (Remember that whatever it is, the bid covers only the work specified. If 
demolition turns up a surprise -- a number of termite-damaged joists that have 
to be replaced, for instance -- you will have to pay more for more work.) 
</P>
<P>
 Having your house worked on is a nerve-racking process at best. It's hard to 
prepare yourself for the loss of privacy, the disruption of routine, the dust 
and dirt, the tools underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, the process is so unsettling that it can never be a happy 
experience. That's another reason to do your homework well: The more you know 
about what is going on, the more you will feel in control of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a good bid and selecting a contractor you respect is a good first step 
on the road to enjoyable home improvement.

 A story in Friday's editions on Randall included several inaccuracies. Randall 
has a 49-2-1 record.He was 22-0 before losing to Edwin Rosario in 1985, and he 
did not lose to Fred Pendleton on July 4, 1986. That fight was a 12-round draw.
