LAST WITNESSES TESTIFY IN KING'S CIVIL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city rested its defense against Rodney King's civil lawsuit Tuesday and 
rebuttal witnesses were called in an effort to to mend any damage done to 
King's case during the city's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said the trial's first phase, addressing 
compensatory damages, will go to the jury after closing arguments today. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the city's 15 witnesses was George Brinton, an economist who said 
King would have earned no more than $500,000 for the rest of his life. Brinton 
estimated that King, 29, would have worked only to age 59 and probably would 
have had part-time employment because of slumps in the construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinton's testimony contradicted estimates from one of King's witnesses that 
the former construction worker could have made more than $1 million if he had 
been uninjured and able to work to age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 King's rebuttal witnesses included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Dilworth Thomas Rogers, a neurosurgeon who was recalled to dispute city 
claims that King's brain function problems were caused by alcoholism. Rogers 
said damage was localized to the left side of King's brain and "you would not 
expect it to be localized if it was caused by alcohol or a drug."  
</P>
<P>
 * Gerald Magid, King's probation officer, who said he interviewed the grocer 
who says King robbed and assaulted him in 1989. "The victim indicated to me he 
didn't believe Mr. King wanted to harm him," said Magid, who also said that Tai 
Suck Bai never said King hit him with a piece of metal, a claim Bai made during 
the current trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Timmy Fowler, King's parole agent, who portrayed him as a polite, model 
parolee until the beating. After the beating, Fowler said, King told him he had 
been "beaten like a dog" and had heard racial epithets from officers during the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of the trial will address individual liability of police 
officers and other defendants for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The city admitted liability but rejected King's demand for $9.6 million to 
settle the case. He refused an offer of $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were charged with King's beating and acquitted of most charges 
in a state trial, sparking three days of rioting in 1992. Two of the officers 
-- Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon -- were convicted later of violating 
King's civil rights and are serving 2 1/2-year prison sentences.

HELP FROM A STRANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently I had gone to the Beverly Hills Municipal Courthouse for a hearing. 
I parked in front of the building, and in my rush I failed to put a coin in the 
parking meter.Two hours later as I approached my car I saw what from a distance 
appeared to be ticket under my windshield wiper, but I was relieved to find 
rather a handwritten note on tissue paper: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Sir. It is now 2:00. Your parking meter ran out apx. 1/2 hour ago. I 
just put in another quarter. Hope you return by then. A Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 After the recent earthquake, strangers helping strangers proved in a large and 
dramatic way that man can still be decent and good to his fellow man. I think 
this incident proves in a little way that is still true.

 Blitzed and sometimes bewildered by the information revolution, the public is 
also vulnerable to exploitation. This is a frontier in every sense of the word, 
full of both technological possibility and opportunities for swindlers.Let the 
consumer beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the president of a trade group for wireless cable television 
ventures deplored the existence of scam operations within his own industry. 
Wireless cable grew out of decisions by the Federal Communications Commission 
in the 1980s to free up channels for commercial use. Dishonest promoters can 
inflate the potential for unwitting investors, thus opening the door for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, state authorities shut down several telephone boiler-room 
operations in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties for allegedly selling 
illegal investments. One major figure said to be behind the boiler room 
operations denied any wrongdoing, and State Corporations Commissioner Gary S. 
Mendoza said investigators would have to conduct a full review of seized 
materials before determining whether any criminal charges would be filed. But a 
word of caution is obviously in order. Mendoza said many investors were elderly 
people or others who lacked expertise to take such high risks. Investigators 
said the ventures took in as much as $30 million from more than 3,000 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is good to see state authorities move aggressively to protect 
consumers in an industry plagued by unscrupulous promoters, consumers can be 
their own best advocates by investing cautiously.

IF NOT MITCHELL, WHO WILL IT BE?; A CHANCE TO SEEK QUALITIES, RATHER THAN NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's announcement Tuesday that he has 
withdrawn his name from consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court 
leaves no obvious front-runner for the seat to be vacated this summer by 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun. Mitchell's withdrawal gives President Clinton a rare 
opportunity, in this, his second Supreme Court nomination, to focus less on 
individual "big names," their political assets and liabilities, than on the 
important qualities that Blackmun and the late Thurgood Marshall brought to the 
high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Blackmun was nominated by President Nixon as a reliable 
"law-and-order" conservative, over the 24 years he served on the high court 
Justice Blackmun became something of the court's conscience, ready to remind 
his colleagues that the cases before them involved real people facing very real 
and often very painful legal dilemmas. In that respect he had much in common 
with Marshall, who, because of his steadfast and eloquent commitment to 
constitutional guarantees of equal protection, exercised a profound influence 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mentioned as candidates to replace Blackmun could carry forward this 
commitment to civil liberties and public service. Among them are Los Angeles 
attorney Vilma Martinez, former head of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund; U.S. Solicitor General Drew Days III; Jose Cabranes, a federal 
judge in New Haven, Conn., and Amalya Kearse, a federal judge in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Blackmun's retirement was not unexpected. The justice said that he had 
informed the President last January that this would be his last term and a 
White House search for his replacement was already under way by the time of his 
April 6 announcement. Clinton must continue to move with all deliberate speed 
in filling this vacancy so that the new justice can take his or her seat on the 
bench when the new term begins next fall. In recent years, Senate hearings on 
Supreme Court candidates have become elaborately choreographed and drawn out 
affairs, with their outcome not always certain. Thus the President would not 
want to wait any longer than necessary in making a nomination.  
</P>
<P>
 But this Supreme Court nomination should not overshadow the continuing 
pressing need to fill the enormous number of vacancies on federal trial and 
appellate courts. A whopping 107 open judgeships remain; Clinton has made 
strides in filling the huge number of vacancies he inherited from George Bush, 
but as new judges take their seats, additional vacancies open, often due to the 
retirement of older judges. Almost half the vacancies now on the bench are more 
than two years old. The 9th Circuit Court, which includes California, along 
with courts in the District of Columbia and elsewhere have vacancies of 
particularly long duration. These open seats create backlogs in every courtroom 
and delays in seeking justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling these seats, along with Blackmun's seat on the Supreme Court, should 
be among Clinton's highest priorities.

CAN'T THEY GET IT STRAIGHT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House now acknowledges that Hillary Clinton's highly successful 
speculations in commodities didn't end in July, 1979, with a net profit of 
$98,537. Mrs. Clinton instead traded into 1980, and made a further profit of 
$6,498. That capital gain was apparently unremembered -- and not reported to 
the Internal Revenue Service -- until a short time ago. David E. Kendall, the 
Clintons' personal attorney, says his clients have subsequently atoned for 
their oversight by paying the Treasury $3,315 in taxes and $10,134 in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 One reads this latest gloss on the Clintons' astonishingly involved financial 
affairs from years past with a mixture of frustration and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 These responses are unavoidably prompted by the apparent inability of the 
Clintons, their lawyer, their staffs and all the help they have borrowed from 
inside and outside the government to get their story straight, once and for 
all. For weeks the White House has been releasing information about the 
Clintons' investments and tax returns. Yet, as the latest revelations show, 
nothing can yet be assumed to be definitive. Asked about earlier statements 
about Mrs. Clinton's trading that purported to be conclusive, a senior aide 
dismissed them as "inoperative," surely one of the most inapt word choices of 
the year. (Two decades ago "inoperative" achieved notoriety when President 
Richard Nixon's press secretary used it to disown previous assurances that 
there was nothing to the Watergate scandal.) 
</P>
<P>
 The White House now also concedes that Mrs. Clinton did not, as it had earlier 
maintained, handle all of her own commodity trades. Instead that was left to 
James B. Blair, a professional commodities broker and family friend. The White 
House does, though, continue to deny that Mrs. Clinton benefited from any 
favoritism. If so, she was either remarkably astute or remarkably lucky, making 
money in 26 out of 31 trades in an area where, commodities traders note, about 
three-fourths of neophytes can be counted on to lose money. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it all mean? The Clintons are now, presumably, square with the IRS 
and nothing illegal is known to have taken place. But what has again been shown 
is that they do have a credibility problem, and with each amendment and 
extension of their story that problem deepens.

THE SPIRIT OF THE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a big ceremony Tuesday, the earthquake-damaged sections of the busy Santa 
Monica Freeway reopened more than two months ahead of schedule. But the joy is 
muted with regret over the elimination of the freeway's car-pool lane and frets 
about two bridges that still need work. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly early reconnecting of the nation's most heavily traveled 
freeway is surely an occasion for celebration to those motorists who must 
regularly use it. However, the crash rebuilding program left two replacement 
bridges without adequate retrofitting; work to fix that will continue apace, at 
an additional cost of $300,000. The state's decision to proceed full speed 
ahead before retrofitting the bridges is perhaps questionable, when to have 
done the job right in the first place would have added only a few weeks to the 
project. But assuming no other serious problems surface with this reconstructed 
stretch of Interstate 10, there can be no doubt that the rebuilding project was 
a real achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the freeway's reopening should not end discussion of a car-pool lane for 
the I-10. One is planned or already in place for virtually every other regional 
freeway. Without an incentive to car-pool, too few people will do it. 
Unfortunately, Tuesday's traffic jams were evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
 The last four months have demonstrated that car-pools can work even on as busy 
a freeway as the Santa Monica. The idea should not die now. Car-pooling and 
other innovations arising from the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake show 
that California is moving again. Along with signs that the economy here may 
finally be recovering from its dreadful torpor, a new energy level from both 
government and the private sector, which cooperated so well on this project, 
will help revive California.

ZHIRINOVSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Records Show Zhirinovsky Had a Jewish Name," April 4: 
</P>
<P>
 It's just amazing -- exactly in the same year, 1945, when Hitler died, a man 
of Jewish heritage was born in the former Soviet Union who is now seen as a new 
Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist leader, is my age.Like 
Zhirinovsky, I came to Moscow from a Russian province after graduating from 
high school and like him I was admitted to Moscow State University. I see that 
we both were preoccupied by the same headache: His middle name has been Volf; 
mine, Aron. It was suggested that I change my middle name for a bribe of 500 
rubles. No doubt, the same manipulation with a last name was much more 
expensive. It's hard to imagine what it cost Zhirinovsky to give up such an 
"attractive" (in Russia) name as Eidelshtein. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky did not change his name because he was going to enter Moscow State 
University. While Jews were targeted in the course of admission to this 
prestigious college, I was not the only student officially listed as a Jew; 
there were dozens of motivated fellows with the same mark on their IDs. 
Zhirinovsky has changed his name and keeps his origin guarded because he has 
conceived an incorrigible hatred for Jews -- a hatred since his childhood, as 
Hitler had.

 * I can't help but notice that the apologists for recombinant bovine 
somatotropin don't bother to address the issue of desirability or 
necessity.There is, after all, no shortage of milk. Those cows are out there 
giving their all and it's plenty. They are already overworked -- and now this!  
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason for introducing this new production technique is that 
Monsanto is looking for big new profits. The senior vice president of Monsanto 
(letter, April 4) forgot to mention that little detail but it is inescapable.

 There is no need for the cows of America to be tormented in this way -- and 
besides, there will be consumer resistance, risk or no risk.

LOWERING THE CRIME RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with interest the March 30 interview with Culver City Police Chief 
Ted Cooke. His comments about prevention and working with juveniles are most 
commendable. His approach and experience deserve to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 It is when the subject turns to the death penalty, however, that his comments 
are misleading. California does in fact have the death penalty -- the graves of 
Robert Harris and David Mason demonstrate this fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Another startling error is his comment with regards to life in prison without 
the possibility of parole. He claims that if you receive this penalty you will 
only serve 5 1/2 years. In fact, if you receive life in prison without the 
possibility of parole, you serve exactly that. There are more than 1,000 people 
serving this sentence in California. The only way they will get out in 5 1/2 
years, or ever, is if the governor grants them clemency. It is misinformation 
such as Police Chief Cooke's public statements that influences juries toward 
giving out the death penalty. Fear that the person will be released has led 
many jury members to vote for death.

their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Los Angeles police officer assigned to a division specifically designed 
to take a proactive role in solving problems, I readily see the advantages to 
Culver City police officers led by Cooke.

not see that in those countries where the military controls everything there is 
dread and fear almost beyond our comprehension. In military-run countries, 
those with badges and guns are the ones who, under the guise of control, 
disappear people, lie about innocent prisoners, massacre thousands and are 
granted amnesty for their crimes. Ask Bolivian miners, El Salvador or Guatemala 
peasants or survivors of Argentina's "Dirty War" about the offenses that occur 
when the military is invited to restore order.

 * Perhaps it is time to re-examine some of the fundamental principles 
underpinning our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Founding Fathers decided that our system would be biased such that the 
guilty would be more likely to go free rather than the innocent be punished. 
From this principle comes the Miranda decision ("Convicted Slayer's Freedom 
Hinges on Timing of Miranda," March 29), the exclusionary rule and other laws 
intended to regulate and restrict the actions of law enforcement, to protect 
the rights of the guilty and innocent. Now, however, perhaps the citizenry 
would be willing to give law enforcement more flexibility in return for more 
aggressive law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than having the penalty for improper law enforcement be that the 
evidence or confession obtained thereby be inadmissible, maybe we should 
consider changing the system so that such evidence can be used, but if it is 
later determined that no crime had been committed, or if in fact no evidence is 
even turned up after an authorized search, the respective law enforcement 
agency would be civilly liable to the accused for damages resulting from the 
invasion. The point is that while there indeed needs to be some deterrent to 
prevent law enforcement from abuse, perhaps it should be in the form of 
compensation to the innocent and not benefit to the guilty.

 When the Statue of Liberty was erected in 1886, this country had 60 million 
people and plenty of resources. Today, the United States has 260 million 
residents, of whom 37 million are poor, 8.7 million unemployed, more than 35 
million without health insurance, hundreds of thousands homeless. We have a 
$4.5-trillion national debt. Our schools are overcrowded and underfunded and 
our freeways more congested than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing this nation in distress, the Clinton Administration promises that it 
will provide health care to all Americans, cut our welfare rolls, put our 
unemployed back to work, trim our national debt and improve our public schools. 
Yet how can these goals be achieved without first controlling the population 
growth in this country? 
</P>
<P>
 I am a first-generation immigrant. I also have 10 years' experience as an 
immigration paralegal. I recently joined the staff of Population-Environment 
Balance out of a recognition that the United States must encourage a 
replacement-level fertility rate of 2.1 or lower, concurrently adopt a 
replacement-level immigration policy of 200,000 people a year and enforce our 
immigration laws. These measures are necessary to protect the quality of life 
of Americans of all racial backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration contributes nearly 50% of U.S. population growth, considering 
immigrants' higher-than-average fertility rates. Every year, about 1 million 
immigrants enter the United States legally, while an estimated 300,000 arrive 
and stay illegally. The projected cost of providing universal health care to 
all existing Americans and legal immigrants is already alarming. Who will 
finance the cost of future legal immigrants and their U.S.-born children? 
</P>
<P>
 The usage of welfare by elderly resident aliens, not including naturalized 
citizens, increased 400% from 1982 to 1992. In 1992 alone, more than 90,000 
legal immigrants age 55 and over entered the United States. If we continue to 
admit elderly immigrants at this rate, how can we keep our welfare and Medicare 
rolls from soaring? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every week, we hear about thousands of our workers losing their jobs. 
Yet in 1992, more than 750,000 legal immigrants of working age were admitted to 
this country. In addition, we admit annually more than 60,000 foreign 
professionals on extended work visas. Many of these "temporary workers" enter 
skilled occupations, such as computer programming and engineering, where there 
have been massive layoffs. If the United States continues with an immigration 
policy that operates as if we had a labor shortage, how can we expect 
unemployed Americans and welfare recipients to find jobs? Donald Huddle of Rice 
University estimates that 2 million American workers were displaced by 1992 as 
a result of immigration since 1970, at a cost of $11.9 billion paid to U.S. 
workers in unemployment and other benefits. Huddle also estimates that in 1992 
alone, immigrants used services costing $42.5 billion in excess of taxes they 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy of the past 200 years was mostly labor-intensive. With advances in 
technology, our economy now requires highly skilled workers to prosper. Yet 
nearly two-thirds of the legal immigrants entering this country every year are 
low-skilled. Half of them enter occupations that are disappearing, where they 
compete mostly with poor minority workers. 
</P>
<P>
 This country does not even have the resources to provide an adequate education 
for current residents so that they may acquire the necessary skills to help the 
United States remain competitive. Where are we going to find tax dollars to 
educate the hundreds of thousands of legal immigrant children we invite to this 
country every year? 
</P>
<P>
 Even if all newcomers were to bring economic assets to this country, how can a 
state like California, which absorbs almost half of the U.S. immigrant 
population, deal with the growing problems such as water shortages and farmland 
loss? Nationally, an average of 1.5 million acres of arable land are lost 
annually to erosion and development due to rapid population growth. Our 
underground aquifers are being depleted 25% faster than the recharge rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) has introduced a bill to reduce the legal 
immigration ceiling to a base figure of 500,000 a year -- a commendable action, 
but the ceiling should be much lower. Given our finite fiscal and natural 
resources, we must aim for an all-inclusive ceiling -- legal immigration, 
amnesty, refugees, etc. -- of 200,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 In opinion polls, the majority of Americans, including 78% of Latino 
Americans, say they support a reduction in immigration, legal as well as 
illegal. Until our national leaders recognize that our current level of 
immigration far exceeds this country's carrying capacity, no real remedies to 
America's problems will be found.

A NAME FOR ONE WHO SURVIVED; NINETEEN YEARS LATER, A CAMBODIAN WOMAN GOES HOME 
TO HONOR HER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DIED IN THE KILLING FIELDS.

 She dreamed about salt. She dreamed about rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rice with salt was the best food you could eat. But back then, even eating 
dirt or the bark off of trees was good. Anything to fill your stomach. Even 
pebbles tasted like roast beef." 
</P>
<P>
 Samnang Siv Wilson, 36, once knew starvation intimately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed about a silly sandwich I used to love to eat at my favorite bistro 
in Phnom Penh," Wilson said. "It was a beautiful dream about a beautiful 
sandwich, I could smell it, taste it, but then I woke up and I couldn't help 
it, I started crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen years ago Friday, Wilson was 17 and pregnant when Khmer Rouge 
communist guerrillas led by Pol Pot ousted the U.S.-backed Lon Nol regime and 
took over the Cambodian capital. Her parents had arranged her marriage to a 
member of the Lon Nol military. Her husband, who was later accused of being a 
CIA spy and executed, tried to persuade his young bride to leave the country. 
But she wanted to remain with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very confusing," she says now. "I never read the newspaper. I wasn't 
political. I was young. I ask myself now why was I so stupid. I didn't even 
know what communism was."  
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson and other survivors of the Cambodian genocide, April 15, 1975, was 
the beginning of Year Zero or "the backward years," the start of a plan to 
reorganize the country into an agrarian utopia. "If you lived in the city, you 
were moved to the country," she recalled. "If you lived in the country, you 
were moved to another rural area. I was on the streets with hundreds and 
hundreds of people, looking for my parents. I never saw my family again after 
that day." 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization went awry when the guerrillas began a program of ethnic 
cleansing against anyone with Chinese or Vietnamese ancestry. Doctors, lawyers, 
Buddhist monks, artists and intellectuals also were purged. By the time South 
Vietnam invaded in 1979 and liberated the country from the Khmer Rouge, 
millions had been tortured, killed and dumped into mass graves known as "the 
killing fields."  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to give birth to my son under the Pol Pot regime. I was totally alone," 
Wilson recalled. "Looking back, I don't know how I survived. Many times I 
wanted to kill myself, but I didn't because I wanted to see my parents. I 
wanted to show my parents how I raised a boy by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, on the Cambodian New Year and to mark Year Zero, Wilson remembers her 
mother, father, brother and two sisters. All were accused of being CIA 
conspirators and killed. Wilson will honor them by fasting and becoming a 
Buddhist nun for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was walking through a minefield (in 1980) to the Thai-Cambodian border, 
I kept praying to Lord Buddha. If I live, I will become a nun. Since then, I 
have wanted to go home to honor my prayer."  
</P>
<P>
 So after 14 years in America, Wilson went back to her native Cambodia. Wearing 
a traditional white sarong, she will kneel and light candles and incense at a 
rebuilt Buddhist temple in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
 She also hopes to clean up her karma. "I stole food at night. I stole food for 
a pregnant woman. I stole food for older people. I never treated myself to real 
food. By doing for people, I gained merit to survive. But I did steal and for 
that I have to atone." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobel Peace Prize nominee Mohagaosanada, a Cambodian priest, will preside as 
Wilson makes offerings of flowers and incense, tea and sugar to her parents and 
to Lord Buddha. After she receives blessings from the monks, birds will be 
released over the temple, a symbol for the release of bad karma for herself, 
her family and her country.  
</P>
<P>
 Her teen-age son, Simiti Siv, will join his mother in the ordination by 
shaving his head and eyebrows. Wilson's only surviving brother, Sichan Siv, who 
was a special consultant on Southeast Asian affairs during the Bush 
Administration, also will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think about those times a lot," Wilson said. "I really don't know why 
the Khmer Rouge didn't kill me." Her voice trailed off. She grew silent, then 
smiled. Samnang is a popular name in Cambodia. In the Khmer language, it means 
lucky.

AMERICANS WILL TURN AWAY FROM WAR BEGUN IN TRICKERY; BOSNIA: IF THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS FINALLY READY TO INTERVENE, IT MUST COME CLEAN OR RISK LOSING 
THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans are justifiably proud of their country's contributions to world 
democracy. They have every right, therefore, to expect the same standards from 
their own government. Yet the Clinton Administration is shortchanging them on 
the vital matter of war in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 After an extraordinary series of conflicting statements from members of 
President Clinton's foreign-policy team, the Administration has thrown itself 
into the Bosnian fray. Claiming that it is acting as a sort of indentured 
servant of the United Nations and NATO, it is promoting the U.S.-led air 
strikes on Serb positions outside Gorazde as part of the search for peace. In 
fact, a more honest interpretation would be that, if these strikes reflect a 
larger strategy and are not simply a short-term operation to demonstrate 
civilian control over the military, the attacks constitute an act of war that 
nails the American colors to the Bosnian Muslim side. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will regard this as perfectly legitimate and long overdue. Fair enough. 
But subterfuge is an inauspicious beginning for a momentous foreign 
undertaking. It is all too reminiscent of the sleight-of-hand involved in the 
1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that set the stage for Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam 
build-up. Now as then, the Administration is exploiting a pretext -- in this 
case, the alleged need to protect a dozen U.N. peacekeepers stationed in 
Gorazde but by official accounts far away from the shelling -- to mask more 
wide-ranging aims. Already, spokesmen are talking about strikes on other towns 
throughout Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Official dishonesty played a major role in eroding public confidence for the 
Vietnam War. If history is not to repeat itself -- this time probably as farce 
-- the Administration should come clean with the American people at a very 
early stage. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let's look facts in the face. Military intervention in a civil war on 
behalf of one side to the disadvantage of the other constitutes an act of war. 
In war, Americans kill other people and may be killed themselves. By admitting 
that this is what is happening in Bosnia, the Administration will alert the 
country to the seriousness of its purpose and prepare it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, wars are fought for reasons and aims. What are these? The 
Administration has traced a very erratic course on whether American interests 
are involved in Bosnia. The time has come to let the American public into the 
secret of why, after more than two years of official vacillation and recent 
public disagreement, they should now support engagement in Bosnia. As for aims, 
what constitutes victory? Preservation of a unitary Bosnian state? A rollback 
of Serb gains to a specific proportion of Bosnian territory? Protection of 
certain named towns and villages from falling into Serb hands? Once again, all 
these may be legitimate objectives, but voters need to be assured that the 
Administration has thought things through. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, wars are fought to achieve victory with appropriate military means. A 
month ago, Defense Secretary William Perry commented about the fighting in 
Bosnia that it "still goes on in ways that are difficult to influence with the 
use of air power alone -- in particular the small arms, close combat fighting 
around many cities and villages in Bosnia." Does his advice still hold? In 
which case, the logical implication is that ground troops will have to be 
introduced at some stage. Will these be American, or have other countries 
volunteered their services? Or -- shades of Vietnam -- is the military 
accommodating its professional advice to the political needs of the day? 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, wars have unintended consequences. To date, there are few good things 
to say about the Bosnian conflict, but at least the worst fears of a wider 
regional conflagration have not been fulfilled. Is the Administration confident 
that its change of policy will preserve this relatively benign state of 
affairs? Already, Russian rumblings, which call on deeper resentments than can 
be assuaged by a soothing phone call to Boris Yeltsin, fill the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In time of war, the natural inclination of most Americans is to rally around 
the President. This in turn gives him the confidence of robust support when the 
going gets rough and victory seems elusive. But as Somalia showed, this support 
will evaporate overnight if people feel they have been tricked. The result then 
is not victory but defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration may well have all the answers to the questions above. But 
so far, its troubling decision not to lay out the full facts in public but 
instead to gloss over the implications of its change of policy may come back to 
haunt it and the country. The last thing that America needs is another 
foreign-policy debacle.

COULD THE WHALES' SONG BE SILENCED?; NOISE STUDY: CETACEAN LIVES ARE GUIDED BY 
HEARING; DON'T RISK CAUSING DAMAGE WITHOUT FIRST KNOWING ALL THE CONSEQUENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How can we be guardians of the natural world when it is we who threaten it? 
How can we protect other animals when we don't know what they are? I ask these 
questions not despairingly but practically, because every day we have to make 
decisions in ignorance. How can we assess the importance of what is not known? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm thinking about a project called ATOC (Acoustic Thermography of Ocean 
Climate) and the difficulty of measuring its impact on marine mammals. The 
project -- postponed for hearings -- proposes to measure global temperature 
changes by broadcasting intense sounds into the ocean for 20 minutes every four 
hours. The project would proceed for two years, with a likely extension to 10. 
The initial broadcasting sites are Monterey Bay and Hawaii, where several kinds 
of whales congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whales are acoustic animals. Their lives are informed not by what they see but 
by what they hear. When their acoustic environment deteriorates, so do all the 
basic mechanisms of their sociality -- their ability to meet one another; to 
establish, maintain and adjust the social relationships that support breeding; 
to locate food; to care for their young and to navigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean is a noisy place at best, but it is vastly noisier now than in all 
of the animals' previous evolutionary history. Windows of relative quiet in 
which communication can occur are becoming a scarce and perhaps a limiting 
resource. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the excellent team that has been assembled to document the impact 
of the project on local marine mammals has been given an impossible task. They 
can document short-term reactions to the broadcast sounds, but they cannot 
document long-term behavior changes because we don't know what is normal. We 
lack the knowledge that would enable us to distinguish between changes that are 
dangerous to marine mammal populations and changes that are sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of a 15-year study of the songs of humpback whales by me, Roger 
Payne, Peter Tyack and Linda Guinee suggest another dimension of whales' lives 
that could be disrupted. For reasons we do not understand, singing is a complex 
behavior in humpback whales. Their long, complex songs evolve rapidly over 
time. The songs are learned and the changes passed on by learning. Thus 
humpback whales, like human beings, are carriers of culture and the culture 
evolves differently in separate populations. Whale songs include structures and 
devices we find in human song and poetry -- for instance, rhyming. 
</P>
<P>
 Singing is always present when humpback whales are courting. Why they sing 
such elaborate songs, why the songs change and where the changes come from is 
not known. The lowest, farthest-traveling notes in the songs lie in the same 
frequency range as the ATOC sounds. These parts of the song may contain 
information of significance to distant whales. We don't know howimportant it 
might be if they lose their function. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't know how humpback whales choose their winter singing grounds, or to 
what extent they can move if the places they are in become intolerable. We know 
even less about most other marine mammals. We have no way to assess how much 
"play" there is in each aspect of their lives, from their basic demography and 
distribution to their cultural behavior. We only know that acoustic 
communication is involved at every level. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm opposed to a plan that would insert intense sound into the communication 
channels used by marine mammals. I do, however, support the investigation of 
global warming by less dangerous methods. There must be ways to study the 
effects of chemical pollution in the atmosphere without increasing acoustic 
pollution in the ocean. There must be ways that are more consistent with the 
lesson we are learning from global warming -- that polluting of all sorts is 
dangerous beyond our powers of prediction.

HAS SPIRITUALITY BEEN SAPPED OUT OF ORGANIZED RELIGION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Haederle's piece concerning the problems of spirituality facing Native 
Americans and non-Indians was provocative ("Spirited Away," March 31). He also 
brought to light the lack of spirituality found in organized religion and the 
fact that there is indeed a vast difference between religion and spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, organized religion, as it has come to be known, tends to 
be nothing more than an institution built upon the concepts of manipulation and 
control. It is based on black-and-white thinking: "Do this and you will go to 
heaven. Don't do this and you will go to hell." There is nothing in this neat 
little package that allows for a exploration into the spirituality of the 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, it avows that the human race is the end-all and be-all of the 
infinite Creator's power and grace, setting mankind above and apart from the 
rest of Creation. Nothing could be further from the truth and leads to the 
reasons why so many non-Indians are seeking out the spiritual teachings and 
practices of Native Americans.

<P>
 What a pity that after so many centuries of white arrogance and cultural 
oppression of Native American peoples and their religious practices that now, 
when there is genuine interest on the part of non-Native Americans into Native 
American nature-based spirituality, that the same arrogance and self-importance 
is reflected back. 
</P>
<P>
 One would have thought that Native Americans would welcome interest into their 
ways and beliefs, that such interest could serve as a healing bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, no one wants beliefs they hold sacred to be trivialized or trampled. 
But is it not better to play the role of a guide to those interested so that 
the process of education and teaching respect for the forms may be begun rather 
than defensively erecting physical and cultural barriers so that others cannot 
glean some insight into the special relationship Native Americans have with 
nature?

 Jane Garrison's article about Nellie Bly ("Nellie Bly, Girl Reporter," March 
28) took me back to my childhood in the '50s and '60s when I was a voracious 
reader of biographies.Women such as Nellie Bly, Amelia Earhart, Madame Curie, 
Clara Barton and (Unsinkable) Molly Brown became my heroes. They excited my 
imagination with their intelligence, daring and perseverance.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WAXING POETIC OVER WANING LIVES AND LOVE IN AN OLD-AGE

<P>
 A novelist must possess courage and artistry in generous measure to win 
readers in a story set in an old-age home, but that's exactly what Israeli 
novelist Yehoshua Kenaz has done in "The Way to the Cats," a grim, sometimes 
appalling but ultimately redeeming account of men and women whose only offense 
against humanity is that they have grown old and infirm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Way to the Cats" is the story of Yolanda Moscowitz, a retired French 
teacher in Israel, who finds herself in a "rehabilitation center" after an 
operation. The hospital is rather like Solzhenitsyn's "Cancer Ward," a place 
where the nurses are as callous as prison guards and the patients have 
forfeited not only their freedom of movement but their dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nazi!" Mrs. Moscowitz screams at a less-than-gentle attendant who washes her 
hair. "This isn't a Jewish hospital, it's worse than Treblinka here." 
</P>

 Kenaz, a journalist with the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz, brings a 
certain matter-of-factness to his novel, a brisk and mostly unsentimental 
description of the dreadful particulars of life in an old-age home. A cry for 
the bedpan, if answered too late, becomes a moment of humiliation; a massage is 
the occasion for a secret moment of intimacy; a trip to the bathroom becomes a 
life-and-death matter because consequences of a fall are so dire -- in fact, 
Mrs. Moscowitz awakens one morning to see a corpse in the doorway to the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already told you a thousand times: I don't mind dying," says Allegra, a 
dying woman who has befriended Mrs. Moscowitz. "And I don't mind if it hurts a 
bit then either. There's only one thing I'm terribly afraid of: that I'll die 
alone, in the dark, in an empty room, without a single soul next to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Into the rehabilitation center comes Lazar Kagan, younger and more vigorous 
than the other patients, a flamboyant painter who has been injured in a bus 
accident and lands among the suffering elderly. He's a vivid and beguiling 
figure -- Kagan quotes Baudelaire, smuggles liquor into the hospital, flirts 
gallantly with Mrs. Moscowitz and offers to sketch her portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly she felt as if his fingers were touching her face, stroking it as 
they had stroked the page," Kenaz writes, "and she didn't know which was 
stronger, her fear and revulsion at the touch or the wish to learn how to give 
herself up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Way to the Cats" begins to transform itself into a love story, but it's a 
peculiar and unsettling tale that strikes unexpected sparks of passion, as Mrs. 
Moscowitz struggles to understand the odd emotions that she feels toward 
Allegra, the doomed woman who washes her laundry, and Leon, an enterprising 
young hospital attendant who inexplicably plays at seduction, and -- above all 
-- the enchanting and exasperating Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenaz is remarkably adept and at ease with the unlikely setting of his story, 
and "The Way to the Cats" quickly draws us into the most intimate spaces of 
Mrs. Moscowitz's rich, if troubled, inner life. So vivid is the figure of Mrs. 
Moscowitz, and so lyrical is Kenaz's prose, that we are tempted to forget that 
she lives within a ravaged and failing body -- but Kenaz refuses to allow us to 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing in it to remind her of herself," Kenaz writes of Mrs. 
Moscowitz's encounter with her own reflection in a bathroom mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its expression repelled her, all the tiny wrinkles at the corners of her lips 
and around her eyes, and the bigger wrinkles on her cheeks and chin looked to 
her like cracks on a frail and precious vessel that had fallen and broken into 
bits, and which diligent hands had tried to piece together again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenaz must have known that he was setting himself a daunting task when he 
decided to tell the story of a sick old woman in a convalescent home. "The Way 
to the Cats" is not an easy book to open. But the reader who makes the effort 
will be quickly rewarded with an engaging and accomplished novel of surprising 
tenderness and even a kind of grace.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SERIAL MOM' GOOD AT BEING NAUGHTY; MOVIES: DIRECTOR JOHN WATERS 
TURNS TODAY'S VIOLENCE INTO COMEDY, AND KATHLEEN TURNER IS FURIOUSLY FUNNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's official: Mainstream John Waters is weirder than underground John Waters. 
"Serial Mom," his latest and one of his best, is like an early '60s TV sitcom 
that keeps lunging into profane naughtiness. Waters builds our disbelief of 
shows like "Leave It to Beaver" and "Ozzie and Harriet" right into the movie; 
he animates our fantasies of what these spic-and-span people might really be 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 He also builds into "Serial Mom" the no-brained affection we have for those 
shows. Waters, like David Lynch, can't truly be called a subversive filmmaker 
or a satirist because he shares most of the middle-class values he pokes. 
That's why he's a naughty black comic and not an enraged one. Deep down he 
wishes life were like "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime there's the real world of serial murders and mania to 
contend with. Waters' conceit in "Serial Mom" is to give us a June Cleaver type 
-- Kathleen Turner's Beverly Sutphin -- who is also a serial murderer on the 
sly. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not the usual predator, though. Even though she cherishes her shoe box 
filled with tapes from Ted Bundy and letters from Richard Speck, her rampages 
are almost always in defense of her family -- her meek dentist husband Eugene 
(Sam Waterston) and daughter Misty (Ricki Lake), who is having boyfriend 
trouble, and son Chip (Matthew Lillard), who works in a video store and has a 
yen for ultra-gore films. She's a valiant fantasy Mom -- the kind of Mother 
Courage who will impale her daughter's no-good boyfriend with a lance and leave 
his liver flapping; or run down the high school math teacher who foolishly 
suggests her son's gore fixation could do with a bit of therapy. Make no 
mistake: This is a pro-family values film. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the fun in "Serial Mom" is seeing what sets Beverly off. It's usually 
not what you expect. (After the law catches up with her, at her trial, a juror 
played by Patty Hearst is seen wearing white shoes after Labor Day -- a fashion 
no-no for Beverly of homicide-inducing proportions.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those '60s sitcom mothers were all-of-a-piece with the TV commercial 
housewives who were (and still are) forever fretting over household odors and 
spots. Beverly carries that fretting to its nut-brain conclusion: She's so 
hemmed in by her chirpy PTA-and-cornflakes life that even the slightest 
deviations drive her wild. (She's like a campier female version of Terry 
O'Quinn's serial murderer husband in "The Stepfather" who couldn't abide any 
cracks in his sitcom comfiness.) Waters gets at the freakiness inside all that 
peachy-keen rigor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serial Mom" is also a jab at the supposed uplift provided by "wholesome" TV 
shows and movies. With all the ruckus raised in the media about the harmful 
effects of on-screen violence and sex, "Serial Mom" weighs in for the other 
side: It implies that it's the antiseptic family entertainments that may have 
done us the real harm. The real nut cases in the movie aren't the hormonally 
inflamed teen-agers and avenging matriarchs. It's the suburban Baltimore 
do-gooders, the upright judges and deacons -- you know, the pillars of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Turner jump-started her stardom as a film noir femme fatale in "Body 
Heat" but her Garbo-esque smokiness and throaty come-hithers always camouflaged 
a wicked comic gift. As the hit woman in "Prizzi's Honor," her infatuated 
deadpan was hilariously apt; in her funniest role, in the neglected "The Man 
With Two Brains," she zigged to Steve Martin's every zag. (Quite a feat.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is one of those actresses who always seems partially zonked -- fogged 
in by her own self-absorption. But she's smart enough to play around with her 
zonkiness. In "Serial Mom," Beverly's avidity for wasting the opposition is so 
furiously funny that you can see why she can't stop herself -- she's having way 
too much fun. It's the joy that comes from clearing the air and clobbering 
complacencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters indulges in a few too many cute tricks, such as periodically flashing 
the date and time of the action on the screen, "Law & Order"-style, and 
sometimes his mimicking of straight-arrow TV shows is too close for comfort to 
the shows themselves. But this double-image effect is part of what makes 
"Serial Mom" distinctive. It's not just Waters' riff on old TV sitcoms. It's 
also his ode to those shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie also probably comes closer to how we actually relate to the current 
wave of serial carnage than a lot of the more "serious" fare. Waters plays it 
as giddy black comic vaudeville, and that connects up with our helplessness. 
The joke in this movie is that killers attract stardom and groupies and have TV 
movies made about them. (Beverly's life will be re-enacted by Suzanne Somers.) 
It is, of course, a real-life joke. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Waters set out to make a social statement here. It's just that 
the landscape and his mindscape turn out to be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
 God help us all.

MOVIE REVIEW; ERIC ROHMER TELLS A WISE, HUMOROUS 'TALE OF WINTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The French respect the quirky workings of the human heart more than any other 
people, and among the French filmmakers, the keenest observer may be Eric 
Rohmer, whose "A Tale of Winter" finds him at his scintillating best, never 
wiser or funnier. This time out he tackles that eternal question: What do women 
want from men?  
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, the second in his current cycle of "Tales of the Four 
Seasons," the question proves especially thorny. In a prologue, we meet, at a 
beach during the summer, a pretty young woman, Felicie (Charlotte Very), who is 
caught up in a vacation romance with Charles (Frederic Van Dren Driessche), a 
man so handsome he is later described as looking like an actor in an 
after-shave commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when it comes time for them to part, Felicie inadvertently gives him 
the wrong address and later realizes she can't even recall his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to the present, five years hence. Felicie works as a Paris hairdresser, 
has an adorable daughter Elise (Ava Loraschi) by Charles and two men in love 
with her, her boss Maxence (Michel Voletti), heavy-set but good-looking, and 
Loic (Herve Furic), an even better-looking librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesser director could not get away with a character like Felicie, who is 
blunt to the point of cruelty. (How very French it is of her to size up the men 
in her life as openly as if she were selecting produce at a market, determined 
to get the very best apple.) 
</P>
<P>
 Were Rohmer not so witty and compassionate in his admirably detached way, she 
would simply come across as a bitch, so hurtful is she in her directness to 
both men. The ability to get away with finding humor in cruelty as a proof of 
the absurdities of human behavior and life itself, however, is one of Rohmer's 
special gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Felicie at first chooses Maxence, who's about to open a salon in Nevers, only 
to discover she can't live with a man she doesn't love but at the same time 
realizes Loic is not for her either because she believes he can too easily 
dominate her intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple prayer at the Nevers cathedral followed by attending a Paris 
production of Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale," with its startling climactic 
scene of a statue of Queen Hermione coming to life, finally confronts the 
impetuous, restless Felicie with the truth: Her heart in fact still belongs to 
the long-missing Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohmer remains a master of conversation -- who else would even think of 
attempting a long discourse on Shakespeare and Plato on the immortality of the 
soul, let alone get away with it? Yet he's come a long way since "My Night at 
Maud's" and "Claire's Knee." With cinematographer Luc Pages, who brings to the 
film a clear, natural light, he moves from interiors to exteriors, from city to 
city, with a flowing gracefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Rohmer works magic with his generally unfamiliar casts, drawing from 
them more they perhaps realize they're yielding. He keeps Very so amusing in 
her quixotic ways that she never seems merely a pain in the neck, which is 
crucial for the film to work. Like all Rohmer films, "A Tale of Winter" 
paradoxically at once seems precise yet spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something touching about Rohmer, the most coolly contemporary of 
filmmakers, casting his lot with romanticism, suggesting that we need to be 
true to our hearts no matter what. The way in which Rohmer resolves Felicie's 
dilemma most likely will allow most viewers to reflect that "A Tale of Winter" 
is, after all, only a movie, a comedy at that. 
</P>
<P>
 But those of us who've actually had experiences parallel to that of Felicie 
with Charles, incredible as that sounds, and who've come to view them as she 
does, know that Rohmer is telling us some important truths.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; FLOWING, HYPNOTIC SET BY SLOWDIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the music of Slowdive could be bottled and sold, it would be marketed as an 
excellent de-stresser. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Roxy on Monday, the English quintet played flowing, hypnotic songs that 
often made your mind wander rather than demanding your attention.Slowdive isn't 
as original as, say, England's Curve and L.A.'s Medicine -- two other bands 
from the same school of atmospheric noise -- but it does the job of turning 
lots of feedback into delicate, smooth melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three guitarists created a flowing river of sound, using controlled distortion 
to smooth over the rough spots and make its mellow pop songs seamless. 
Guitarists Rachael Goswell and Neil Halstead took turns singing in airy, eerily 
similar tones that wafted in and out of the thick songs and became one with the 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The band stood motionless, and the packed-in crowd stood just as still, as if 
numb, while the band played at least 10 numbers that could have been one long 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowdive's escapist music is pretty, cold and detached -- perfect for an 
in-house chill-out, with no emotional strings attached. But live, it needs a 
few more grounding elements to take full effect. LORRAINE ALI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; STANLEY DELIVERS SANS STARS AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presence of more than a dozen country stars contributed much to Ralph 
Stanley's latest album, "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning." 
</P>
<P>
 But befitting the humble origins of his bluegrass music, the songs, not 
personalities, were at center stage on Monday when Stanley and the Clinch 
Mountain Boys played the Coach House, sans all-star support. 
</P>
<P>
 So although Ralph and Carter Stanley's "Wonderful World Outside" went without 
the achingly soulful reading George Jones gave it in the studio, 
singer-guitarist Kenneth Davis delivered a forlorn rendition of this 
prison-cell lament as successful in its own way as the album's. 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, Stanley is still in robust voice, sandpaper-raspy as ever. In fact, he 
sounded more secure throughout the two-hour show than he sometimes does on 
"Saturday Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, his banjo playing sounded as fleet as it did in his recordings from 
30 years or more ago. If anything has changed, it is his unusual (for the 
genre) vocal melisma, which he used to great effect, twisting syllables and 
subtly shifting vocal timbre two and three times in a single note. 
</P>
<P>
 When you can do that, who needs stars? RANDY LEWIS

California academia. We've heard from trumpeter Leo Smith, now at CalArts, and 
trombonist George Lewis, now at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday night's Green Umbrella concert at the Japan America Theatre, the 
guest of honor was flutist-composer and UC Irvine faculty member James Newton. 
The concert's second half was devoted to the L.A. premiere of Newton's 
ambitious 1992 piece "The Line of Immortality," scored for chamber ensemble and 
his own quartet, with bassist Darek Oleskiewicz, drummer Sonship Theuss, and 
pianist Jon Jang.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, Newton mixes Eurocentric, post-Bergian scoring for the classical 
contingent with rumbling improvisational passages for jazz quartet. Gradually, 
the forces on stage find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert also featured the world premiere of Charles Dodge's "The One and 
the Other." Like a black sheep in the minimalist lineage, the work is a 
definitive study of contrasts, generating considerable momentum and mystery 
from simple phrases laid at odds with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening was Steven Mackey's "Indigenous Instruments" (1989), which borrows 
from a dizzying array of sources. Microtonality, jaunty folkishness, Morton 
Feldman's metaphysics and clankety early jazz can be detected. But what makes 
this one of the finest compositions of the last five years is the freshness of 
outlook Mackey digs out from under the rubble of his -- and all of our -- 
culled influences. With this, Mackey may have painted his masterpiece. JOSEF 
WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; YOUNG VIRTUOSOS TAKE STAGE AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talent takes many guises; so does musical achievement. The three budding 
virtuosos who appeared on the Gold Medal series event at Ambassador Auditorium 
Monday night proved that, again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Sporcl, born in 1973 in the Czech Republic, showed himself to be a most 
gifted and accomplished violinist. His demeanor may be modest, but his 
technique and musicality comprise abundant resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist George S. Lopez is a native New Yorker raised in Central America and 
trained in Connecticut and Paris, among other locales. Swedish pianist Jan 
Biel, born 1975, like his colleagues at this performance, is a prizewinner of 
numerous competitions and a veteran of international tours. 
</P>
<P>
 These three, traveling under the unwieldy name of Laureates of Holland Music 
Sessions World Tour 1994 -- the title refers to a summer conservatory all have 
attended -- gave a demonstration of their present virtuosity in a generous 
program at the Pasadena showplace. The eclectic agenda contained music by Bach, 
Mozart, Beethoven, Copland, Saint-Saens and Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, probably the oldest of the showcased players, certainly showed the 
greatest maturity and musical perspective, especially in his playing of 
Copland's Piano Variations (1930), which emerged compelling in rhetoric and 
continuity, kaleidoscopic in color. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporcl's particular moment of glory was the Fourth Solo Sonata of Eugene 
Ysaye, the mechanical thickets of which he sailed through without hesitation, 
all the while producing a beautiful sound and genuine eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, Biel has the furthest to go in overall musical growth. Yet his 
technical capacity is huge, his speed and control -- especially in flying 
octaves -- startling. There may even be a poet underneath his cool 
stage-manner; at this moment, one would not place any bets on that, however.

TV REVIEW; 'MAO YEARS' SHEDS LIGHT ON SERIES OF RUTHLESS CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slogans and sayings ran through Mao Tse-tung years as supreme ruler of China 
like an unbroken performance. But a saying Maoism didn't invent seems to sum up 
his regime: Be careful what you wish for; it may come to pass. Sue Williams' 
two-hour depiction of "The Mao Years" on PBS shows a budding nation caught in 
the grip of one man's political imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities Mao envisioned were what propelled his Communist army to 
victory in 1949 -- that, and a ruthless military ability that he would later 
employ against his own people. The Mao ideal of a China with industrial and 
agricultural muscle pumped by a peasant working class always conflicted with 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 It produced one absurd and tragic episode after another, any one of which 
would have toppled a mere leader. Williams shows how Mao inoculated himself 
against this danger by developing a cult that turned him into a God in human 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were horrifying. Through the mid-'50s, when China boosted 
industrial production and fought the United States to a stand-off in Korea, 
things looked good. But the urge to fund industry through grain production, 
which led to "The Great Leap Forward," culminated in bitter resistance to 
collectives and, finally, mass starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 The casualty numbers during Mao's rule are truly awesome. Even before 30 
million died in the starvation of 1959-61, hundreds of thousands of landlords 
were killed by revolutionary zealots. (And '60s zealots killed hundreds of 
thousands more.) Each policy shift by Mao created new enemies of the state, new 
denunciations of "counter-revolutionaries," new prisoners, new deaths. Those, 
for example, who had supported his "Let 100 Flowers Bloom" campaign of 
criticism of party policies were trapped when Mao condemned the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mao's rule seemed to be a series of campaigns, each more disastrous 
than the next. At the same time, Williams reveals the human cost in the faces 
of those, like Li Maoxiu and Ding Xueliang, who witnessed public beatings and 
whole families and villages wiped out. Ding's case is especially interesting. 
He saw people try to eat dirt to stay alive in the farmlands. Later, in the 
city, he joined the youth-driven red guard of Mao's "Cultural Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 This campaign of the '60s urged youth to literally take over the party and all 
institutions. Behind it, though, was Mao's intent to curb nominal head of state 
Liu Siaoqui, a moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Revolution never made sense, and Williams doesn't provide any new 
insight into it -- despite many revealing recollections by Mao's personal 
doctor, Li Zhisui. A street civil war erupted, nearly tearing the country apart 
and forcing Mao to once again reverse himself and finally open a door to the 
United States and Richard Nixon. Mao couldn't keep the outside world and the 
capitalists out, despite his imaginings of a permanent revolution. "The Mao 
Years," with a bevy of remarkable and rare archival footage, starkly presents 
the costs when such imaginings have power.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BABYFEVER': HENRY JAGLOM ON THE MOTHERHOOD MANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been awhile now since jokesters regarded Alan Alda as the poster boy -- 
or whipping boy -- for extreme male sensitivity. Though director Henry Jaglom 
probably isn't mainstream enough to ever rate a "Tonight Show" gag, he seems to 
have taken up the Alda memorial mantle, releasing movies you could justifiably 
call "women's pictures," albeit not the kind Douglas Sirk used to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his apparent desire to surround himself with actresses and actresses 
alone, and spill their innermost hopes and fears, you figure Jaglom's either 
extraordinarily attuned to the estrogen cycle of the Zeitgeist or just 
afflicted with Venus envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Having eavesdropped already on one of the two great gender-specific fixations 
of our time, the thinness obsession, here he gets around to the other, the 
desire to be with child. "Babyfever" does for delayed procreation what his 
earlier art-house success, "Eating," did for food-related frustrations. This 
movie, too, is amazingly unwavering in single-minded devotion to its subject, 
and after almost two hours of baby chat served up with Jaglom's usual 
deliberate technical crudity, childless women won't be the only ones feeling 
their clocks ticking. But when it comes to being a compleatist, he does 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is principally a very long, very philosophic Malibu baby shower, 
which some inevitably feel ambivalent about attending, not having realized 
their own dreams of motherhood. Chief among the reluctant is Victoria Foyt, 
established in a brief setup as expectant of being expectant; she's supposed to 
get her results back by the end of the afternoon, which lends the laconic party 
a little suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgeous and driven, Foyt has no fewer than two guys who say they'd like to 
sire her children, but the one who may have impregnated her is an overly safe, 
responsible "suit" type (Matt Salinger), and the one she feels some real 
passion for is, of course, a fly-by-night rapscallion (Eric Roberts). Few of 
her contemporaries are blessed with even that considerable a choice of sperm 
donors. Among the other showerers who show up sans child, there's much 
bitterness over childlessness, and commitment-phobic men come in for a lot of 
lashing in this extended ladies' room. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, this is the date movie from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 But for viewers less immediately inclined toward conception anxiety, 
"Babyfever" begets a definite fascination, remarkable in its comprehensive 
documentary aspects, at least. (He's created a great time capsule, if not 
necessarily a great time.) Jaglom is, as always, big on ve rite and 
improvisation; with such a large cast milling about the airy, oceanside house, 
he's managed to cover just about every conceivable baby base, with sentiments 
ranging from banal self-interest to self-conscious belly laughs, and a lot of 
very real, undeniably affecting poignancy in-between. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaglom's success as an unofficial documentarian here undercuts his 
intentions as a dramatist. For much of the movie's mid-section, Foyt's concerns 
get set aside while Jaglom crams in as many dozens of different talking heads 
as possible; even Foyt's fairly involving character seems to come out of a 
Jaglom-esque void where women aren't given any outside social context that 
doesn't relate directly to the matter at hand -- i.e., this time, their 
uteruses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her character's short-shrift, Foyt (credited with co-writing the 
scripted part of the film with Jaglom, and making her starring debut here) is 
flat-out terrific. She's so radiant that you can't help thinking during the 
movie what a crime it'd be if those results didn't turn out positive. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be giving too much away to suggest that Jaglom finds a 
noncommittal way to have his cake and eat it too at the end, first with a 
slightly downbeat yet exultantly liberated climax, then an absurdly cheerful, 
non sequitur coda in which Foyt has found an unnamed, unseen great guy 
(presumably Jaglom, her real-life husband) and blown up like a balloon. It's 
diapers ex machina.

STEPFATHER KNOWS BEST; HAIM GINOTT'S BOOKS ARE BEING REISSUED -- AND THE ONLY 
CHILD HE HELPED RAISE HEARTILY ENDORSES THEM; OUR AID MUST BE SUBTLE AND 
SOPHISTICATED. -- HAIM G. GINOTT, "BETWEEN PARENT & TEENAGER" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mimi Ginott Kaough recalled that when she was 14, her stepfather hired her to 
type his nationally syndicated parenting columns. But as she typed, she edited 
the manuscripts to please herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was shocked. She'd say, 'How can you change Haim Ginott's work?' 
He'd look it over and say, 'You know, this is great. I really like it a lot 
better.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother didn't tell me until recently that he had explained to her, 'Alice, 
I've got an editor. Whatever they don't like, they'll change anyway.' 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I had no idea he was working on my ego and self-confidence," 
said Kaough, now a 38-year-old New York lawyer and mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
 What Ginott preached he practiced at home and felt in his heart, Kaough said. 
She should know. As the stepdaughter of the pioneering child-raising expert, 
she is the only child he ever helped raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Her admiration adds a topcoat of credibility to his work, which is resurfacing 
this spring, more than two decades after his death. Collier Books has reissued 
Ginott's "Teacher & Child" as a trade paperback; his others, "Between Parent & 
Child" and "Between Parent & Teenager" will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Ginott's book sales have been strong and steady, said Mark 
Chimsky, former editor in chief of Collier Books at MacMillan. Their basic 
message -- listen, praise, and validate feelings to encourage good behavior and 
high achievement -- set the theme for nearly every popular parenting book 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissuing the books made sense, Chimsky said: "If all the others recalled him, 
why not bring back the original?" Besides, Chimsky figured that he was a 
representative baby boomer who remembers as a child adoring Ginott, a frequent 
guest on "Today." "He was the grandfather all of us dream of having: the 
twinkle in his eye, the warm-hearted approach, the soft-spoken humor."  
</P>
<P>
 Building on the work of baby doctor Benjamin Spock, psychologist Ginott 
appealed to parents of the '60s, torn between Victorian authoritarianism and 
Spock's permissiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was able to straddle the fence between validating children and their 
feelings and yet helping them to become socialized human beings," said Gisela 
Booth, professor of clinical psychology at Northwestern University Medical 
School in Chicago. "This was an age when parents didn't quite know what to do. 
They felt very guilty. There were all these wild kids, and parents were really 
looking for some guidance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Ginott was childless -- until he married for the second time and 
moved in with his wife, Alice, a psychoanalyst, and her daughter Mimi, 13. An 
older daughter, Roz, was away at college.  
</P>
<P>
 It was 1970, long before stepfather issues reached public consciousness, but 
Ginott was extremely concerned about Mimi's privacy, her mother, Alice Cohn, 
recalled. "He wanted her to feel comfortable living with a strange man while 
her sexuality was budding."  
</P>
<P>
 But Mimi rejected him at first. "I was angry. . . . I felt they had both 
betrayed my father. He let me be angry for a year. Years later, I said, 'Haim, 
why were you nice to me? I was horrible.' He said, 'It showed me how much you 
loved your father and how loyal you were to him, and I admired that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, she came to adore Ginott. "The kind of support he gave I'd never 
had from anybody," she said. "He was always there when I needed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Once after arriving home after a 10-hour flight, he sat down for two hours to 
talk over a problem she had. He never took off his coat. "He was saying, 'Right 
now, you're more important than anything else. That's what he did, time and 
again," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Kaough said, she challenged his techniques. "I'd say, 'Oh don't 
pull that Ginott stuff on me: I feel blah, blah, blah. . . .' He'd burst out 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginott never sought "correct" feelings nor perfect behavior. One time, Kaough 
said, she opened the door for a blind date to discover "the ugliest guy I'd 
ever seen. . . . My mother's giving me a look that says, 'Just go on the date. 
You can't back out of it. . . .' Haim slipped me a $10 bill and said, 'Get a 
tummy ache in 45 minutes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once he lost his temper when she cursed in the midst of a kitchen accident. 
"He was shocked and exploded. Then he apologized. He said, 'See, I can't do it 
all the time either.'  
</P>
<P>
 "That was comforting to me. If you see someone else is perfect, you see 
yourself as less than perfect. When you see someone else as human, you feel 
better about yourself. Less judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
 Where his followers emphasize techniques, Ginott sprinkled his books with 
literary references from Tolstoy and often reminded parents that their primary 
goal was to raise children capable of caring, compassion and commitment.  
</P>
<P>
 "He always said if a parent can do 70% of what he was asking, that would be 
like perfect," Kaough said.  
</P>
<P>
 At 17, she knew he was battling cancer. As he became sicker, he asked her to 
stay away at college: "I think he probably knew at some level I couldn't cope 
with his dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, he was right. Ginott's death in 1973 at 51 was a shock. "He was at the 
height of his career. He had so much more to offer. There was so much more I 
felt I needed from him. He was just gone," Kaough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after 21 years, she said, "I'm still dealing with it. It was probably the 
major loss of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in addition to consulting his books about raising her own children, she 
said, "Sometimes when I go to bed, I look up and say, 'Help me, tell me what to 
do.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I always feel he's up there looking down, watching over us. And I wonder what 
he's thinking."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: BIRTHDAY CELEBRATES A NEW START FOR A DESERVING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She took the little white bear out of my hands, smiling like a little girl, 
thrilled and puzzled at the idea that we were there to celebrate her. When 
Peggie Reyna walked in and presented Alicia with a chocolate cake topped with 
blazing candles, she looked like a child on an especially bountiful Christmas 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alicia is no child. She is a tiny, fragile woman whose life had been a 
grim story of unpleasant chapters until she met Reyna a little more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna, a specialist on deaf, blind and physically disabled women for the Los 
Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, met Alicia after being called to 
King-Drew Medical Center by a social worker stumped by the young woman's 
inability to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia, who turned 24 on Monday, was born in Mexico and moved here with her 
family as a girl. Sometime during her childhood, she lost her hearing. She says 
she spent many years as a virtual slave in her home, abused by her family and 
kept out of school. She has told her story to social workers, police and 
prosecutors, who declined to charge the family with any crimes because of 
Alicia's inability to communicate clearly in a courtroom. When she finally 
decided to flee, the only way out was through her second-story window. She says 
she let herself down with a sheet and fell the rest of the way when she ran out 
of material. Bruised and dazed, she ended up at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She had never learned sign language and could not speak. She was too old to 
qualify for public aid to children, and because she is not a citizen, she could 
not qualify for help available to adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Her future looked bleak -- until she met Reyna. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna's compassion and dedication to helping disabled women who have been 
battered culminated in the virtual adoption of Alicia, whose name has been 
changed for this story. With Reyna's help, Alicia found a spot in a group home 
for deaf adults, is learning sign language and is undergoing counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 After I wrote about Alicia in February, many readers called or wrote with 
offers of help. Some offered television sets and VCRs with closed caption 
capabilities. Some sent checks, some sent cash. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a dozen producers or their representatives called as well, 
interested in turning the story of Alicia and her friendship with Reyna into a 
television movie. They saw the possibility of a heartwarming tale about a 
friendship that can change a life. 
</P>
<P>
 What they didn't know was that years ago, Reyna's teen-age daughter, Rhonda, 
died of a brain aneurysm. When Alicia saw Rhonda's photograph at Reyna's home, 
she turned to Sharon Hamilton, Reyna's roommate, and said, in signs: "Rhonda 
dead. Peggie cry. Alicia here for Rhonda." 
</P>
<P>
 "I got goose bumps," Hamilton said. "I don't know how she knew." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Alicia's birthday party was a prelude to more serious business, the 
third meeting of a new task force, "For Deaf Women Too." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the task force grew out of a conference on deaf and disabled 
women, sponsored by the Southern California Women's Law Center last fall. A 
group of women, including Reyna, decided that it wasn't enough to just talk 
about the problems faced by deaf women who have been battered. 
</P>
<P>
 With support from the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, which 
provides meeting space for the group at its Hollywood offices, task force 
members hope to expand support services for deaf women -- who, like women with 
other disabilities, are particularly vulnerable to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The members, most of whom are deaf, are working on projects as disparate as 
fund raising, creating support groups and developing training materials for 
staff at battered women's shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia is still experiencing for the first time the everyday events most of us 
take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna took Alicia to a beauty shop for her birthday. Her straight, jet black 
hair now falls in gentle curls around her face. She had her first manicure too, 
and on Monday, showed me frosted pink paint on stubby nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's vocabulary is still growing too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, when we went to dinner, I had trout," Reyna said. "She had never 
seen that kind of fish before. I told her it was fish and it was trout. She is 
learning that every fish is not just named 'fish,' and that every tree is not 
just named 'tree.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She is also learning words to express less tangible things. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in counseling, and it is hard," Reyna said. "She is working on signs 
and feelings and what the signs are to express those feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 If a deal for a TV movie is signed, Reyna hopes to use the money to send 
Alicia to Gallaudet College, the renowned university for the deaf in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the size and diversity of the population there," Reyna said, "they 
have programs for deaf immigrants. We are really excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's story may get a Hollywood ending after all.

FAMILY; FOR KIDS WHO GO 'AIEE!' IN THE NIGHT

 Children's terrifying dreams may be more than simple nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Children's Hospital of Orange County, a child deluged by 
frightening images from which he or she is not easily awakened may have an 
inherited disorder called night terrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Night terrors strike about 2% of children, usually starting between ages 1 and 
8 and disappearing by age 12. Episodes last 10 to 30 minutes, and may end with 
the child sitting up in bed, running around, screaming or talking wildly. And 
even if his or her eyes are open, the child may still be dreaming, says Dr. 
Robert Manniello, the hospital's medical director. 
</P>
<P>
 These tips may help: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not attempt to wake the dreamer. Instead, try to calm him or her back to 
sleep by turning on the lights and making soothing comments.  
</P>
<P>
 * Try to prevent episodes with "prompted awakenings." Note how long after 
bedtime the terrors usually occur, then awaken child 15 minutes earlier and 
keep him or her standing and talking for five minutes. Repeat nightly for a 
week -- longer if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch the child's schedule. Lack of sleep is the leading cause of night 
terrors. LESLIE KNOWLTON

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / NEW YORK; OH, YES -- THERE WERE CLOTHES, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GERSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the clamor about skirt lengths, colors and commercial appeal, do not 
for a minute believe that the fall fashion shows unfolding here are solely 
about clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 To varying degrees, they are about atmosphere and attitude, promotion and 
presentation, all exploited to create the impression something new and 
fascinating is transpiring. The thousand or so witnesses to this biannual rite 
are made to feel as if they're a privileged pack of seers who understand the 
significance of a shrunken mohair sweater far better than the bewildered 
masses. New, new, new is their mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Todd Oldham's collection of wacky, madly patterned, rainbow-colored 
clothes seem quite so appealing without Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and 
Mariah Carey clapping in the front row and Cindy Crawford and transvestite 
Billy Beyond cavorting down the runaway? 
</P>
<P>
 Would Oscar de la Renta's opulent, Far Eastern-inspired creations appear just 
as dazzling without an army of Beautiful People -- Nan Kempner, Carolyne Roehm, 
Lynn Wyatt -- in attendance and a procession of super-models arrayed in a blaze 
of costume jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one is suggesting that collections be displayed on hangers in 
showrooms, the centralized, circus tent venue has designers so carried away by 
hype and hullabaloo that the clothes get lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrived excitement preceding Oldham's evening show -- the crush of 
photographers surrounding Roberts, the preening hordes of groupies -- was a 
prelude to a chaotic grab bag of styles ranging from tie-dyed velvet jeans and 
shrunken chenille sweaters to skintight beaded gowns worn with jeweled hair 
clips and floor-grazing fake furs. The clothes practically screamed, "Hey, Look 
at Me!" which explains why Oldham is the label of choice among club crawlers 
and movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the zany styles were some salable items, such as classic pin-striped 
suits and flippy skirts topped by little jackets with fake fur collars and 
cuffs. But it was the campy creations -- riotously colored patchwork jackets, 
pearl-studded fishnet gowns, velvet slip dresses dangling with pompons -- that 
drove the audience wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Sui's fashion circus lacked Oldham's star power -- Vanessa Williams, 
Sofia Coppola and daddy Francis were pretty much ignored by the paparazzi -- 
but it overflowed with groupies arrayed in black leather, spiky platinum hair, 
silver backpacks and nose rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sui didn't send anything particularly witty or novel down the runway, unless 
you consider Day Glo-colored fake fur, pleated cheerleader skirts, rubberized 
T-shirts and -- what else -- shrunken mohair sweaters news, and most of the 
fashion crowd doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sui's giddy, riotously colorful creations had a sort of loopy charm 
that summoned up visions of little girls dressing up in mommy's finery. 
</P>
<P>
 Fake fur coats as fluffy as bath mats, bright Lycra jumpsuits and flippy Lurex 
slip dresses were gussied up with heaps of gangly plastic jewelry, spike-heeled 
boots and pompon ski caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for some popcorn-knit sweaters, suede vests and plaid mohair suits, 
most of the clothes were fun and nonsense, which suits Sui's fans just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere surrounding De La Renta's show was, as one would expect, calm 
and civilized. Attractive, navy-suited attendants escorted guests to their 
seats adorned with tiny packages of the designer's Volupte perfume. In this 
circle, rings were square-cut diamonds on fingers, not gold hoops in noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure to delight De La Renta's gilded gang was a big, luxurious collection 
featuring short, slender clothes in spice colors and burnished paisleys paired 
with spotted fake furs and whimsical little hats shaped like pagodas. The 
strong Far Eastern flavor -- Mandarin collars, tassels, embroidered velvets 
resembling Oriental carpets -- seemed more Orient Express than Bistro Garden.  
</P>
<P>
 De La Renta's evening extravaganzas, exemplified by chiffon paisley pants 
floating beneath a multicolored sequin-embroidered jacket rimmed with fake 
cheetah, were way over the top, even for the diamond-by-the-yard brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to De La Renta's too-rich feast, Bill Blass presented easy 
tailored clothes in lively color combinations -- mint green and pink was a 
favorite -- worn by models with long, shiny hair, subtle makeup and very little 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Blass caters to the same over-40 socialite as De La Renta, but rarely have the 
two designers been so far apart style-wise. Women unembarrassed by excess will 
go with De La Renta; those who prefer understated luxe, such as a fragile gray 
lace cocktail dress concealed beneath a camel polo coat, will choose Blass. 
</P>
<P>
 Swing coats, cuffed trousers, tailored jackets over vests and thick fabrics, 
including double-faced wool melton, dominated the daytime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 For evening, amber or bronze cut-velvet pants were teamed with tunics or tweed 
jackets. A layered chiffon halter dress with a jeweled bolero was the ticket 
for more formal wingdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the loveliest surprises of the week was the tiny, informal breakfast 
show held by Vera Wang at the Regency Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has been pigeonholed as a bridal designer (and creator of Nancy 
Kerrigan's skating outfits), her new line of evening ready-to-wear should make 
Wang a fashion force. Holly Hunter, Sharon Stone and Marisa Tomei are already 
members of her fan club, which is sure to grow by the time the Oscars roll 
around again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang's chic, minimalist styles, most of them in black or navy crepe and 
tissue-thin layers of chiffon, looked serene and sexy in a Grace Kelly sort of 
way. Her signature sheer illusion back and sleeves appeared on long, sinuous 
dresses and a few frothy taffeta ball gowns inspired by British designer John 
Galliano. 
</P>
<P>
 White satin cuffs, a ripple of tiny satin buttons down the back or a sliver of 
antique gold lame were other Wang details. The clothes were elegant but fresh 
and young, a combination rarely seen, unfortunately, on the runways.

FIREFIGHTER FACES A DEADLIER FOE; ACTIVISM: AFTER A MEDICAL PROBLEM TOOK TONY 
BORBON OFF THE FIRE LINE AT 36, HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO FIGHTING ANOTHER 
DESTRUCTIVE FORCE: VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLEN JUSTICE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 36, Tony Borbon faced a bitter reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Borbon, a fire captain in the California Department of Forestry, was diagnosed 
with an infected heart valve. He would need a mechanical valve to keep his 
heart pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally disturbing to Borbon was that he would be forced into early 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself 'I'm too young, I've got too much fight and too much 
spirit,' " he said. "I wanted to retire with the state, but I wanted to do it 
the normal way. Not like this." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1987. Today, Borbon's schedule is so full he is pressed to return his 
phone calls. And in his line of work, these calls are important. Sometimes 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Borbon, 43, is a consultant in violence prevention, helping activist groups 
set goals and manage their resources. As a fire captain, he was often called on 
to work with inmates who hoped to work as firefighters. Borbon's experience 
with these men fueled his new career. 
</P>
<P>
 He is on the often-ignored technical side of activism, helping organizations 
manage money and organize violence-prevention events. 
</P>
<P>
 Borbon's most recent undertaking is chairing an anti-violence protest march 
scheduled for Saturday in Downtown Los Angeles. Sponsored by the Violence 
Prevention Coalition of Greater Los Angeles, Drive-By Agony and Women Against 
Gun Violence, it will begin at 10 a.m. at Olvera Street Plaza and end at the 
county Hall of Administration. Anyone interested in violence prevention is 
welcome to march. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sick to death of the guns and the violence," said Ann Reiss Lane, 
coordinator of Women Against Gun Violence, adding that marchers will call for 
stricter gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Borbon: "We are hoping to bring people out. We have to start becoming 
involved. Youth. Parents. Grandparents. And agency people. There's a 
consciousness that 'it hasn't hit my block, so I don't have to become 
involved.' But we hope everyone will come to do their little piece to 
de-escalate violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Borbon said the march is not targeted solely at gang violence, but also at 
domestic violence and violence against gays, children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may get people to march together for a day," he said. "But the key is what 
goes on in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 Borbon's reputation is growing, locally and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has helped us get off the ground," said Billie Weiss, a spokeswoman for 
the Violence Prevention Coalition. "He's quite a dynamic person." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' began working with Borbon in 1991 when the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services launched the coalition as an umbrella 
organization for anti-violence groups. Borbon was the coalition's first 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he organized a conference that drew nearly 500 people from across the 
nation. "He's very directed and a very good organizer," Weiss said. "He can 
pull people together." 
</P>
<P>
 This is something Borbon said he has always done well, beginning with his work 
with the Latino group MECHA in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending UC Santa Barbara, he went to work as a probation officer in 
Santa Barbara County. He has worked with gang members and "high risk 
individuals" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't long lines to do this type of work. And that's what I know how 
to do."

A MAN OF HIS WORDS; IN HIS POEMS, 1994 PULITZER PRIZE WINNER WRITES OF THOSE 
USING STRENGTH AND SPIRITUAL TENACITY TO SURVIVE -- LIKE HIMSELF

 Thanks for the tree  
</P>
<P>
 between me & a sniper's bullet.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what made the grass  
</P>
<P>
 sway seconds before the Viet Cong  
</P>
<P>
 raised his soundless rifle.  
</P>
<P>
 Some voice always followed,  
</P>
<P>
 telling me which foot  
</P>
<P>
 to put down first.  
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Thanks," by Yusef Komunyakaa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yusef Komunyakaa, who won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for poetry on Tuesday for 
his collection "Neon Vernacular," has much to say about survival. 
</P>
<P>
 His autobiographical poems are rooted in his struggles with racial tensions 
and Vietnam horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see myself coming from a community of strong survivors who refuse to be 
victims," he says, "because victims are defeated before the fight begins." 
</P>
<P>
 That refusal to play the victim is where he believes he differs with many of 
the higher-profile "poets" of today: top-selling rap stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally wanted to embrace the imagery and forthrightness of rap music," 
he says. "There are some interesting, dynamic voices in rap. But I find most of 
it irresponsible in its overt violence and commercialization of anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "As artists, we believe we can will action through language. If that's the 
case, we have to take responsibility for what we say." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Komunyakaa was at Claremont Graduate School to receive the second 
annual Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, at $50,000 the largest prize bestowed for a 
single work, also for "Neon Vernacular." 
</P>
<P>
 "The work had great vitality. It was almost electrically compelling," says 
judging panelist Sandra Gilbert, a poet, critic and professor of English at UC 
Davis. "I was excited by the way he combines colloquial language with poetic 
language and uses images and themes from jazz music." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his tidy cinder-block office at Indiana University, where he is a 
professor of English and Afro-American studies, Komunyakaa shrugs. "I really 
should have a copy." 
</P>
<P>
 But no, the prize-winning collection of new poems and selections from his 
earlier works is not yet on either of the two orderly bookcases that are the 
room's only personalizing touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his surroundings, the poet is subdued -- black and white checked shirt, 
dark trousers, wire-rim glasses, short hair beginning to gray. He speaks in a 
deliberate, quiet voice that hints more of Australia, where he has traveled 
extensively, than of rural Louisiana where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Komunyakaa said he didn't even know he had been nominated for the 
Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised, but in a sense, it sort of tells me that I'm going in 
the right direction in my work. That's my gut-level reaction," he told the 
Associated Press, noting that his plans for the rest of the day included 
teaching his 4 p.m. workshop of "young, bright writers." 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I'm going to sit down and think about it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Komunyakaa's work flows from the struggle to define his status as a 
black male and a Vietnam veteran. His poetry, he says, attempts to emphasize 
the strength and spiritual tenacity of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the black male, most people see this as a negative time," he says. "In 
these troubling moments, more people are attempting to define themselves with 
violence as a background." 
</P>
<P>
 Komunyakaa's experiences in Vietnam help him put these visions into some 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam helped me to look at the horror and terror in the hearts of people 
and realize how we can't aim guns and set booby traps for people we have never 
spoken a word to. That kind of impersonal violence mystifies me." 
</P>
<P>
 Komunyakaa realizes that this same sort of haphazard anger is still powerful 
in American inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see many black males grasping for some thread of hope. There are so many 
destructive practices, glimpses into a psychic abyss. That must be very 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Komunyakaa lives in Bloomington with his wife, Mandy, and has a daughter from 
a previous relationship. Although he concedes that he adopted his name for 
cultural and religious reasons, he prefers to keep his private life private.  
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Bogalusa, La., a continuing source of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always believed if you worked hard, you could make it in America, 
which now seems an almost insidious idea. He worked 12 to 14 hours a day and 
saw others who were hard workers yet weren't paid that much. I questioned those 
contradictions from early on." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of his generation, Komunyakaa left the rural South for the 
military. He spent some time stateside before being sent to Vietnam. In time, 
he became a correspondent and editor of the Southern Cross, a military 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being from the South, I didn't fear the vegetation and climate of Vietnam 
nearly as much as if I had been from an urban environment. I could identify 
with the landscape and with the Vietnamese people as a whole. That made it very 
hard to hate them as the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned from Vietnam, Komunyakaa felt disengaged from U.S. society, 
feeling kinship both with his fellow vets and with those protesting the war. 
His experiences and emotions found their voice in poems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1973, I was in a creative writing workshop taught by Dr. Alex Blackburn 
(at the University of Colorado). He gave me some wonderful criticism and made 
me believe that I could write poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking back to his earliest poem, written in high school, Komunyakaa 
concedes that he had a lot to learn. "It was 100 lines in rhymed quatrains, 
very traditional and very verbose. It was influenced by the poetry I had read 
in school -- mostly British." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he drew inspiration from such black poets as Frances Harper, Langston 
Hughes, Robert Hayden, Melvin Tolson and Gwendolyn Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black poets were voices I could hear inside my own head." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning degrees from Colorado, Colorado State and UC Irvine, he 
published the collections "Copacetic," "I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head, 
"Dien Cai Dau" and "Magic City." 
</P>
<P>
 His honors include two National Endowment for the Arts creative writing 
fellowships, the 1991 Kenyon Review Award for Literary Excellence and the San 
Francisco Poetry Center Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neon Vernacular" was selected from 247 works to win the Tufts award, 
established in 1992 through an endowment grant of more than $1.25 million given 
to Claremont Graduate School by Kate Tufts to honor her late husband, poet and 
writer Kingsley Tufts, says Peter Harris, Claremont assistant director for 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Its $50,000 prize will help give Komunyakaa space to work on his three current 
projects -- and a bit of celebrity for a solitary artist. 
</P>
<P>
 When a university colleague shouts congratulations from the hallway, 
Komunyakaa humbly waves. But he admits that recognition makes it easier to 
approach his works in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It underlines the fact that maybe you're going in the right direction as a 
poet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you operate in an intense vacuum, it's nice to take a moment to step 
outside and look at your work."

SUMMER: INDEPENDENTS' DAY?; MOVIES: FOR '94, THE INDEPENDENTS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT 
A SEASON THAT THE MAJORS USED TO OWN. CONTENDERS INCLUDE NEW LINE'S 'THE MASK,' 
IRS MEDIA'S 'THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE,' SONY CLASSICS' 'MI VIDA LOCA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This summer, Hollywood's big commercial movies will have to share more of 
their multiplex turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it won't exactly be a case of "Move over, Arnold," or "Step aside, 
Harrison." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hollywood's independent movie distributors, which have tended to concede 
the summer playing time to the major studios, are no longer content to sit out 
the lucrative season. These companies are becoming increasingly aggressive 
about booking their product alongside the big guns. 
</P>
<P>
 So, come summer, playing at your neighborhood theater along with such films as 
Universal Pictures' "The Flintstones," Walt Disney's animated "The Lion King" 
or 20th Century Fox's "True Lies" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger will be such 
titles as New Line Cinema's "The Mask," IRS Media's "The Beans of Egypt, Maine" 
and Sony Pictures Classics' "Mi Vida Loca." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beans" and "Mi Vida" are very personalized dramas dealing with human themes. 
"The Mask" is a big, special-effects film headlined by "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective" star Jim Carrey. But all three are from the smaller, maverick film 
companies that usually shy away from the hotly competitive summer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, over the last few summers, these smaller distributors have 
increasingly tried to capture a share of the high-volume ticket buying action 
that accounts for roughly 40% of the entire year's box-office sales. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer the numbers tell the story. There are roughly 60 films scheduled 
for release between the week before the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May and 
Labor Day weekend in September. And about 15 of those are what can be 
considered major releases from the independent companies. "There is a movement 
going on," acknowledges Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, which 
found a summertime gold mine in such pictures as "Enchanted April" and the 
Spanish-language "Like Water for Chocolate."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Weinstein, the reason for the success of such films is simple: "How many 
times can people go to see 'Terminator 75,' 'The Fugitive 8' or 'Jaws 0'?" he 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
 And the lines of what distinguishes a major from a smaller company are 
continuing to blur -- especially when a studio like Paramount Pictures releases 
an intimate and off-beat film like "Forrest Gump," due out this June starring 
Tom Hanks, or a "small" company like New Line releases "The Mask," which boasts 
millions of dollars of special effects from George Lucas' outfit Industrial 
Light & Magic and stars the new popcorn hero Carrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The line becomes even fuzzier when one considers that some "independents" are 
now owned by the major studios. Miramax's parent is the Walt Disney Co.; New 
Line was recently acquired by media mogul Ted Turner; and Gramercy Pictures, 
which is releasing the currently popular "Four Weddings and a Funeral," is a 
co-venture of Universal Pictures and Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
 Savoy Pictures, which is revving up to release around 12 major titles a year 
but only has one film scheduled for this summer ("Exit to Eden"), declined to 
participate in this article because its founders, a group of veteran Hollywood 
executives, consider the 2-year-old company to be a major studio in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax was one of the first firms to crack the major studio monopoly of 
summer with its 1989 release "sex, lies, and videotape," a film the company 
picked up for distribution when it won the grand prize at the Cannes Film 
Festival in May and rushed into theaters by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've educated the theater exhibitors that they don't have to play the same 
old movies. There is room for counter-programming," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "Like Water for Chocolate," explained Weinstein, "Our big break 
came Memorial Day weekend (1993) when we opened in 180 theaters (opposite such 
studio releases as "Sliver," "Hot Shots! Part Deux," "Cliffhanger" and "Made in 
America") and we played all summer. We proved it could be done. Goldwyn (the 
Samuel Goldwyn Co.) used the same strategy last summer with 'Much Ado About 
Nothing' and had fantastic results." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the pioneering effort was in 1985, when Embassy Pictures managed to 
book Ingmar Bergman's critically acclaimed "Fanny and Alexander," subtitles and 
all, into theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the earliest proponents of counter-programming the summer season was 
L.A.-based, Goldwyn Co.-owned Landmark Theatre Corp., which has 121 screens in 
several states and primarily exhibits specialized films. Said Landmark 
co-founder Gary Meyer: "We've been harping on this for years. We're thrilled 
that the independents are learning that lesson. For us, it's a matter of 
survival. We operate 52 weeks a year. Besides, sophisticated people don't leave 
the planet during the summer. . . . They're looking for movies to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Meyer cautioned that the specialized movies that do better in summer are 
ones with lighter topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is as optimistic about the realistic opportunities for some of 
the specialized films. A variety of major theater chain operators see the 
logjam of major studio titles still putting a squeeze on the smaller movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be one heck of a summer at the box office," said Michael 
Patrick, chairman of the 2,100-screen, multi-state Carmike Cinemas, now the 
nation's second-biggest circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every summer, the indies try to get their pictures' opening dates set. But I 
don't think this year will be any different, because, come June 24 (the day 
Disney expands the run of "The Lion King"), the major pictures will begin 
colliding and there won't be enough theaters. It will be extremely hard for 
independent films to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 That point isn't lost on New Line's theatrical marketing president Chris Pula. 
"Whenever you're situated in the summer with the high-concept movies like 'The 
Flintstones,' 'Maverick' and 'True Lies,' you have to come in with something 
different. We think in the case of 'The Mask' we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Goldwyn Co. production President Tom Rothman notes, "This is a trend 
that has been creeping forward. Three and four years ago we would see these 
films squeezed into August," long considered the dog days of the movie 
business. In 1990, Goldwyn's "Longtime Companion," one of the first feature 
films about the human effects of AIDS, was one example. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, we're going to be right in the teeth of summer. We were there with 
'Much Ado,' right opposite 'Jurassic Park.' And, lo and behold, the specialized 
film audience isn't going away."

THE METROPOLITAN PLAYS ITS ASIA CARD; ART: THE NEW YORK MUSEUM OPENS 18 
GALLERIES RUNNING THE LENGTH OF TWO CITY BLOCKS THAT WILL SHOWCASE SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST ASIAN WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sometimes it seems that every time you think "culture," the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York has launched another wing. Today, the museum opens 
what experts are calling the finest and most extensive collection of South and 
Southeast Asian art in the West, with some 1,300 objects displayed in 18 new 
galleries that run the length of two city blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a wing," corrects Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director. 
"They're galleries." 
</P>
<P>
 Wing or not, by any standards the 15,000-square-foot display is impressive and 
will likely draw attention to arts that have long been ignored in this country. 
"By opening 18 galleries in one shot and by virtue of its location within the 
Metropolitan Museum," says Vishaka Desai, director of New York's Asia Society 
Galleries (which has no room to display its own notable permanent collection), 
"I believe that this will put South and Southeast Asia on the map in an 
unprecedented manner." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, to begin to tell its story, the display must span 5,000 
years, scores of cultures, and according to today's map, a dozen different 
nations, from Afghanistan to Vietnam, Tibet to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 No other section of the museum covers as much geography and time. The overall 
size of the Florence and Herbert Irving Galleries for the Arts of South and 
Southeast Asia is roughly half what the same museum devotes to a single country 
in a single century -- 19th-Century France. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since its founding in 1870, it has been the mandate of the Metropolitan 
Museum to collect art encyclopedically," says De Montebello. "When we began, 
the emphasis was on archeological material and Western art. These new galleries 
are the last letter of the encyclopedia. Now we've got the whole globe under 
one roof." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is amazing that it has taken the Metropolitan so long to acknowledge the 
impact of these cultures," says Pratapaditya Pal, senior curator of Indian and 
Southeast Asian art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which has 4,000 
square feet to display its own impressive collection. "This is difficult for me 
to admit, but there is no question that numerically and in terms of overall 
quality the Metropolitan's is the number one collection of its sort in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the art of India and Southeast Asia was chosen as the last 
letter says more about the tastes of collectors and the biases of art 
historians than it does about the cultures represented here. The cultural 
development of these artforms does not fit the neat delineations between West 
and East that art historians crave. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first gallery devoted to ancient sculpture from Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, for example, works show clear links to the art of the Persians, 
Greeks and Roman -- even a small statue that may remind some of the "Venus of 
Wilendorf," the mythic starting point of Western art history. 
</P>
<P>
 The further forward in time one goes, the less useful Western references 
become. In the various painting traditions of North India, Nepal and Tibet, a 
compositional complexity may suggest both early Renaissance painting and 
abstract Modern Art, without having anything to do with either lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of attempting to delineate artistic high points of these 
cultures, the display in effect traces the complex development of religious 
thought from nature worship through Hinduism and Buddhism, and their spread 
throughout the Eastern world, ending with the king-worship of the Khmers, who 
built the ancient city of Angkor Wat in present-day Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an entirely new museum," says Martin Lerner, the Metropolitan's 
curator of South and Southeast Asian art. When Lerner was hired in 1972, the 
collection contained fewer than 55 items. One of the high points, according to 
experts, is a room of bronze and cooper sculptures of the Chola Dynasty of 
South India (900-1300). 
</P>
<P>
 This material, according to Steven M. Kossak, assistant curator, displays a 
fusion of naturalism and metaphor unparalleled in Western art. Of a statue of 
the goddess Parvati, he says, "This sculpture is composed of a series of 
metaphors for nature. Parvati's arm, for example, is just like the trunk of an 
elephant, but the two references come together so as to create a totally 
convincing portrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Jeffrey L. Daly, the galleries are housed in rooms previously 
designated for temporary exhibitions. One half is composed of what had been a 
single 200-square-foot space referred to as "the bowling alley." The current 
configuration has been seven years in the making, and was financed with a 
$10-million donation from Florence and Herbert Irving, who have also donated or 
earmarked for donation some 50 works from their collection. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first Indian works to enter the museum's collection was a massive 
and highly ornate domed ceiling from a 16th-Century Jain meeting hall in 
Gujerat carved of teak wood with intricate friezes of kinnara musicians, 
dancers, weapon-bearers, peacocks and mongooses fighting snakes, and 
ashtadikpalas -- the eight regents of the directions. The ceiling had been on 
display in the museum from the teens until the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lerner came to the museum, however, nobody seemed to know what had become 
of it. Eventually he located it disassembled into more than a thousand pieces 
in a museum storage facility under Riverside Drive, beside the place where the 
city stores some of its sanitation trucks. "When I first saw it," he says, 
"there was an accumulation of pigeon residue -- it must have been 10 or 15 
years worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Curators across the country hope that such neglect is a thing of the past. 
Unlike Western painting, which from the Renaissance through the 19th Century is 
virtually impenetrable for a new collector, there is still room in the field of 
South and Southeast Asian art. Accompanying the acquisition of art from these 
countries are also ethical issues of provenance, laws restricting deportation 
or antiquities and recent reports of pillaging at important historical sites in 
Cambodia. (The Metropolitan has followed UNESCO guidelines, which forbid 
purchase in Eastern countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles there are a thousand collectors of boring contemporary art," 
Pal says, "all with the same sort of stuff by the same sort of artists and not 
a single collector of Indian art, even though the Los Angeles County Museum's 
greatest holdings are in Indian art." Of the New York opening, he said, "Maybe 
this will be the turnaround for them."

THIRD TIME'S A CHARM: 'TALL' TALE ANOTHER ALBEE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH KOENENN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Albee, who made an acclaimed return to the New York stage this season 
after a decade's absence, won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for Drama Tuesday, his 
third, for "Three Tall Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Although rumors circulated in New York theatrical offices for several days 
that Albee would win the prize, he said Tuesday afternoon that he wasn't ready 
to celebrate yet: "You hear those things, but it's something you should never 
count on, so you can't plan celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke from Texas, where he teaches playwrighting at the University of 
Houston, but he will return to New York today for the official reopening of 
"Three Tall Women" at the Promenade Theater after a successful run at a small 
Off-Off-Broadway venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pulitzer comes near the end of a season that has seen a resurgence of 
interest in, and appreciation for, the playwright who made a dramatic impact on 
American theater 32 years ago with "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony Award he earned for that play was followed by two Pulitzer Prizes, 
for "A Delicate Balance" in 1967 and "Seascape" in 1975. But Albee had not had 
a new play produced here since 1983, when "The Man With Three Arms" closed 
quickly on Broadway after devastating reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In the intervening decade, Albee has continued writing and has found 
hospitable stages in cities like Houston and Cincinnati, and in places as far 
afield as Vienna, where "Three Tall Women" had its world premiere in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first act, the winning play looks at three women of varying age 
preparing for the demise of the eldest. In the second act, the actresses become 
the eldest woman, at three stages in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 This season has been something of an Albee festival in New York, but it's been 
happening blocks away from the bright lights of Broadway. The Signature Theater 
Company, which devotes its entire season to one playwright, chose Albee for 
1993-94 and has staged seven of his works, most of them new to New York. The 
latest, "Fragments," opened at Signature's 77-seat theater Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the critical and box-office success of "Three Tall Women" has been 
obvious for weeks, Albee was not prepared Tuesday to moderate his recent harsh 
statements about standards and commercial concerns of contemporary theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a play done Off-Off-Broadway gets a Pulitzer doesn't mean 
anything's different. . . . I try not to predict anything. You go through your 
career and you think a play is going to communicate and people think you've 
committed a (expletive). You write something else and people like it and you're 
startled." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of ideas for new plays in Albee's mind. "I've got two I 
could write right away and a third one in a holding pattern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pulitzer Prize for music went to Gunther Schuller, 68, for his 
"Of Reminiscences and Reflections," which received its premiere by the 
Louisville Orchestra, the composer conducting, Dec. 2, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A composer, conductor and music educator, the New York-born Schuller began his 
career as an instrumentalist, playing principal horn in the Cincinnati Symphony 
and in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. *

MUSIC REVIEWS; EMANUEL AX AND FRIENDS THINK SMALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chamber Music Society of the Los Angeles Philharmonic serves a noble, 
idealistic, healthy purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 It affords visiting celebrities a rare opportunity to forswear the heroic 
flourish in favor of the intimate gesture. It allows members of the orchestra 
-- and not just the first-desk chieftains -- an exposed moment of potential 
glory. It gives the public a welcome chance to savor the delicacies of 
introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean, however, that all chamber-music ventures by the 
Philharmonic are models of ensemble virtue. It takes a long time for any group 
of musicians to think and breathe, not to mention phrase, as one. If the group 
is very small, moreover, there may be no place to hide any discrepancies of 
timbre, attack or nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, Philharmonic chamber-music concerts often turn out to 
be more notable for lofty intentions than for exquisite performances. The 
assembled spirits, no doubt, are always willing, no doubt. Unanimity of 
execution, however, has to be a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was on Monday in the rather dry acoustic of University Synagogue in 
Brentwood, which is providing a temporary haven for the series in the wake of 
earthquake damage to Gindi Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The stellar guest was Emanuel Ax, a popular virtuoso who was persuaded to 
linger in town an extra day after playing large-scale Haydn and Stravinsky with 
Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonic at the Music Center. The pianist was 
joined by stalwarts from the ranks in contrasting trios of Poulenc and 
Beethoven, with a string duo by Mozart serving as program centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The programming was sophisticated, to be sure. Much of the playing was 
elegant. All of it was competent. Still, revelations remained elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Poulenc's Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano, written in 1926, is a taut 
exercise in Gallic whimsy -- dashing, gently abrasive, deceptively nonchalant. 
It demands muted bravura from three players of equal expressive output. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, the players, though eager and able, seemed separate and 
unequal. Ax played loud, tough and fast, like someone in fear of missing a 
train. David Weiss' oboe dealt primarily in piercing assertion, in contrast to 
the mellow restraint of David Breidenthal's bassoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these three blazed through the sprightly finale with splendid, 
feverish impetuosity, getting there was not half the fun. Gentle charm tended 
to get lost in the scramble. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensitive protagonists in Mozart's B-flat Duo, K. 424, were Lyndon 
Johnston Taylor, violin, and Dale Silverman, viola. He played with remarkable 
poise and wispy yet subtly shaded tone. She played smoothly, generously and a 
bit stodgily. There was more give here than take. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Leonard, the formidable principal cellist of the Philharmonic, joined 
Taylor and Ax in Beethoven's Trio in D major, Opus 70, No. 1, a.k.a. "Ghost." 
One had to admire the generalized sweep of the collaboration, even if Ax's 
grandeur sometimes proved unyielding and intonation problems sometimes proved 
disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber music is hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society's remaining concerts

 GOOD BENCH WARMER: Ever heard of a politician willing to give up power? La 
Habra is sending Councilman Steve Anderson to sit on the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority. But by choice, he will not cast any votes. One La Habra council 
member explains that the future of the base is a "war of the North versus the 
South" in the county, and the city wants to stay out of it. . . . Anderson 
doesn't mind. "I did a real good job of sitting on the sidelines," he says, 
referring to his high school athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
 BROWN WHO? Now that the updated version of the Brown Act, the state's 
open-meetings law, has taken effect -- more public speaking time, more 
adherence to the agenda -- are meetings more accessible? Yes, but maybe a bit 
more confusing too. . . . In Seal Beach this week, council members constantly 
had to seek assurances from the city attorney that they were doing things 
right. "Who is this Brown guy anyway?" Mayor Gwen Forsythe quipped. "I note 
that the date this law took effect was April 1. "

 UCI'S DAY: Three people who won the Pulitzer Prize Tuesday have ties to UC 
Irvine. . . . One of them is Edward Albee, above, who won the prize for drama 
for his play "Three Tall Women" (F4). Albee, now a three-time winner, is most 
famous for writing "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" . . . . He spent a week as 
a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine in 1983, then returned the following year to 
spend more than a month on the campus, working with drama students and 
directing the premiere here of his short play "Walking." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI II: The university is also boasting about Yusef Komunyakaa, who won a 
Pulitzer for poetry. Komunyakaa (E3) received a Master of Fine Arts in poetry 
there in 1980. James McMichael, now co-director of its writing programs, taught 
one of his classes and remembers him as an outstanding student. Says McMichael: 
"The Pulitzer in poetry doesn't always go to the best poets, but in this case 
it did.". . . . The third: Michael P. Ramirez of the Memphis Commercial Appeal, 
for editorial cartooning. He graduated from UCI in 1984, with a bachelor's 
degree in fine arts and studio painting.

TAIWAN DECRIES U.S. ANIMAL EXPORTS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government said Tuesday that the U.S. ban on its wildlife product exports 
is selective and unjust, and it claimed that its efforts on wildlife 
conservation have been far greater than those of other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (U.S. ban) is a selective action.It is different from what we know as 
fairness and justice. The United States completely ignored all our efforts on 
environmental and wildlife conservation in the past," Prime Minister Lien Chan 
told Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Monday that the United States will ban imports of 
certain wildlife products from Taiwan because of the island's continued trade 
in endangered tigers and rhinoceroses. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese officials estimate the ban will cost the island up to $10 million a 
year. According to U.S. estimates, annual imports of Taiwanese wildlife 
products total $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Products affected could include coral and mollusk shell products and jewelry; 
snake, lizard and crocodile skin shoes, and other leather products.

 Jerome Lejeune, 67, the French geneticist who discovered the chromosome that 
causes Down's syndrome.After six years of research, Lejeune in 1959 published a 
paper showing that the cells of people with Down's syndrome contain 47 
chromosomes, one more than normal. The condition, a form of mental retardation, 
is named for Dr. J. Langdon Down, a British physician who first diagnosed it in 
the 1800s. Lejeune became a vociferous advocate of humane care for people with 
Down's syndrome. Also a fervent opponent of abortion, he was named last month

 A tax of 25 cents per game cartridge and $100 per arcade video game would be 
imposed to cover rating administrative costs. Any surplus funds would go to 
public libraries.

DANA PARSONS: WHERE ARE RIBBONS, RAGE FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST LATINOS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hello, Mr. Parsons, my name is Michelle. My grandfather told me that if 
anyone could have any possible answers to my questions, it could be you." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how her letter began, and the poignancy of her thoughts jumped off the 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you please explain to me why every time there is an article concerning 
crime and gang activity, the Steve Woods case is always singled out? What was 
so special about this incident? And why was there such an outcry of public 
anger and police response to catch the people responsible for his death? Don't 
get me wrong. I feel what happened was very tragic. Was it because of the 
circumstances that surrounded his death that made it this way? You know, him 
being white and the defendants being Hispanic gang members?" 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to write: "Let me explain why I am so angry. Only six months ago 
my friend's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered. His name was Eddie Sanchez. 
He was on his way home from shopping at the indoor marketplace here in Anaheim 
when the car he was riding in stopped at a little store not too far from home. 
A guy at the store came up to the car and exchanged words with the female 
driver of the car. When Eddie spoke up and asked that there be no trouble 
because they had a baby in the car, the guy took out a gun and shot Eddie 
point-blank between the eyes. Eddie never stood a chance. He left behind a 
family and friends who loved him very much. He also left behind his girlfriend 
and unborn son. . . . Where was the public outcry for him? Where were the 
demonstrations and ribbons? Was it because he was Hispanic? He wasn't a gang 
member but the person who took his life was." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle mentioned two other cases involving Latinos who were killed and who 
she thinks received only modest coverage compared to the Woods incident. She 
concluded by saying: "I don't know if you can help me, Mr. Parsons, but I 
needed to get my feelings down on paper and let someone know that there are 
some of us out there that are outraged not because of just one incident, but 
because of all the senseless violence out in the world today." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle is right in saying that the Steve Woods incident received much more 
attention than other violent deaths allegedly linked to gang activity. Woods 
was the 17-year-old San Clemente High senior who died in November after his 
head was pierced with a sharpened paint-roller rod while he and friends were 
leaving a South County beach. Several people who police say are 
self-acknowledged gang members are on trial for his murder, but their attorneys 
have suggested Woods' group of friends provoked the trouble and that the death 
was an unforeseen outcome of the resultant antagonism. 
</P>
<P>
 I met with Michelle, and she laid her cards on the table: She's of Anglo 
heritage but has a 3-year-old son by a Mexican man who still is an active gang 
member. She says she once ran with gang members but has severed those ties. She 
lives with her mother in a modest, well-kept Anaheim neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 From a journalistic standpoint, I told her, the nature of Steve Woods' death 
and the published X-ray photos of the rod stuck in his head undoubtedly 
accounted for much of the public interest. In addition, the beach where he was 
assaulted hadn't been known for violence and that, too, contributed to the 
magnitude of the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it sounds insensitive or not, news coverage is driven by circumstances 
and/or setting. If either or both are noticeably different from the norm, which 
they were in the Woods situation, an incident tends to get increased coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But I couldn't escape Michelle's central point. Did it get more attention 
because Woods was white and his alleged assailants Latino? Was his death more 
tragic or more worthy of note than those involving Latinos that occur with 
numbing regularity in larger cities like Anaheim and Santa Ana? Does it matter 
that a paint-roller was used to kill someone instead of a gun? Are bullets in 
the head no longer considered gruesome enough to warrant extended coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't give Michelle an emphatic answer. All my journalistic training 
tells me the Woods incident was a big story. Textbook, you might say. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean it squares with personal feelings that tell me the death 
of an innocent white teen-ager in San Clemente is no worse than the death of an 
innocent Latino teen-ager in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad to say, I told Michelle, but murders in known gang territory come with 
such frequency that they are less newsworthy. And it's a fact of life that the 
shooters and victims are disproportionately Latino. The victims usually aren't 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's why it stands out if it happens in San Clemente?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an explanation, not a defense," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
 I left, telling her she had raised some legitimate issues. Pretty lame 
response on my part, but I'm not sure I know what the truth is. Or whether 
there's a moral question here or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coming at it from a parent," she said. "If my son was ever injured in any 
way, I would not want my son's life forgotten. I guess it angered me that -- 
bottom line -- one case is getting all the hoopla, everybody's angry, that's 
all everybody talks about and that's what's getting all the attention."

DEFENSIVE LAPSE HURTS THE LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: THE WARRIORS SCORE ON 38 
LAYUPS IN A 128-117 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their playoff charge suddenly a distant memory, the Lakers are going slowly 
into the good night, even after hearing the news at halftime that Denver had 
lost, they . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them at halftime Denver lost," Coach Magic Johnson said. "Then we came 
out like we did. I just don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are, indeed, a confusing bunch. The same team that recently held 
four consecutive opponents to 95 points or less had its defense dismantled by 
the Golden State Warriors, not just by the 128-117 margin before 13,302 at the 
Forum, but the way it was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disappointing thing is the number of layups," Johnson said Tuesday night 
after the Lakers had their first three-game losing streak since February. "When 
you give up 38 layups, you expect to lose. Golden State is not a big team, but 
they just pushed us around, outmuscled us." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Lakers took another step toward the NBA's 98-pound weakling 
division -- the lottery. Even with the Nuggets losing to the Suns and still 
having to play at San Antonio tonight, Denver's magic number to eliminate the 
Lakers is down to four with seven games to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the team that has made short lineups famous, the Lakers unveiled their 
own: Elden Campbell going from power forward to center, George Lynch going from 
small forward to become a 6-foot-7 power forward and Doug Christie going from 
shooting guard to his old small forward spot. The backcourt stayed the same, 
with Tony Smith and Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was prompted by Vlade Divac showing up late to practice Monday, after 
being warned about his tardiness in the past. He accepted the penalty of 
opening on the bench and said he expects to be back in the starting lineup 
tonight at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm on time," he said before the Warrior game. "So far so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Divac missed just three minutes before checking in, by which time the Lakers 
trailed, 12-5, and had three of their shots blocked and another turnover in the 
first seven possessions. The Lakers caught up just before the end of the first 
quarter, but Divac lasted only 3:03 before leaving with two fouls. He played 30 
minutes in all, finishing with 12 points and a team-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors had a 64-59 lead at halftime, with four of their five starters 
already in double figures. It was up to 91-78 when James Worthy and Golden 
State's Chris Gatling scuffled and were ejected with 2:27 remaining in the 
third quarter, instigated when the two got tangled after Worthy's jumper in 
front of the Warriors' bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Both appeared to take swings and shoved each other in the face before being 
separated and heading to the locker room. The Lakers appeared to get the best 
of the ejections -- Gatling had 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting and seven 
rebounds as the starting center while Worthy was just three of 10 from the 
field for eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Nick Van Exel on a long-term contract have gained such 
momentum that the rookie point guard said chances are good he will reach an 
informal agreement before the end of the season, though he can't sign until 
after July 1. "It's a good possibility," he said. "A real strong possibility. 
I'm hoping it does so I don't have to worry about it this summer." Van Exel 
accepted a one-year deal at the league minimum $150,000 after slipping into the 
second round of the draft, convinced that he would be better off taking that 
and then becoming a restricted free agent so the Lakers could ignore the salary 
cap to re-sign him. The gamble has paid off as Van Exel has become the only 
Laker to start every game and is threatening the NBA rookie record for 
three-pointers. He says he is now hoping for a six-year contract, and his 
agent, Tony Dutt, talked again with General Manager Jerry West on Tuesday. "I 
know the organization and I know that everyone here is pretty good people and 
they take care of people," Van Exel said. "I haven't caused any problems. They 
stuck by me and gave me a chance to start. I look at it like they're going to 
take care of me." 
</P>

 Kurt Rambis sat out his third consecutive game because of a strained rib 
muscle.

MURRAY, MORRIS HELP INDIANS BEAT ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These guys aren't supposed to be doing this any more. They already have had 
their World Series moments and All-Star games, and enough memories to last 
their grandchildren's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray should be staying home in Los Angeles working on his Hall of Fame 
speech, while Jack Morris should be retired on his farm in Montana. Neither 
should be involved in helping the Cleveland Indians to beat the Angels, 5-4, 
before 22,118 at Anaheim Stadium on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two are only seven years shy of collecting their pension, they would 
like nothing more than to end their careers by putting a stop to Cleveland's 
40-year pennant drought. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still a long way to go in the season, but there are the Cleveland 
Indians, sitting atop the American League Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, 5-1, are off to their best start since 1966, and the entire city 
of Cleveland believes that this indeed could be something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most explosive ballclub I've ever been on," Murray said. "I knew 
nothing about this team when I got here, but these guys can play, and they know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, 38, an eight-time All-Star whom the New York Mets couldn't trade to a 
contender last season, provided the decisive blow in the ninth-inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Joe Grahe, brought in to start the ninth, yielded a two-out 
single to left field by Carlos Baerga. Albert Belle popped up to shallow 
center, the ball falling in front of center fielder Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought up Murray, who had already given Cleveland a 4-3 lead with his 
run-scoring single in the seventh. This time, he slapped a single up the 
middle, scoring Baerga, and it was all Cleveland needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Turner, who reliever Morris at the start of the seventh, got the victory 
and Jose Mesa struck out pinch-hitter Greg Myers for the save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels overcame a 3-0 deficit in the first inning with a run-scoring 
double by Eduardo Perez in the second inning, and back-to-back run-scoring 
singles by Gary DiSarcina and Curtis in the fourth inning, but couldn't get to 
Morris again. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 38, who needs surgery on the ligament in his right elbow, retired the 
side in order in the fifth and sixth innings. He left the game with a 
no-decision, yielding seven hits and three runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to battle, borrow, cheat and steal to win a ballgame," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said of Morris. "I don't agree with everything he's ever 
said, but I'll always respect him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just going to keep throwing until his arm drops off. He'll go until he 
needs an operation just so he can comb his hair the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove: "I don't like taking Jack out of a game 
anymore than he likes coming out. It just comes down to how much pain he can 
pitch with." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley barely warmed up before Cleveland had three runs 
and loaded the bases with Mark Lewis was at the plate. A hard grounder to 
shortstop DiSarcina averted a catastrophe and Finley was fine thereafter, 
yielding only four hits and one run over the next six innings until Murray 
disrupted his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's run-scoring single in the seventh gave the Indians a 4-3 lead that 
lasted until Angel designated hitter Chili Davis caught them trying to be a bit 
too fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians made a dramatic defensive shift to the right when he batted. But 
Davis, who is off to one of the finest starts of his big league career, made 
the Indians look foolish. He ripped a slicing drive into left field on Matt 
Turner's first pitch. Edmonds scored easily to tie the score, and Davis had a 
double. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who is batting .469 with seven runs batted in, already has six 
multiple-hit games this season, one more than he produced all of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's an omen," Davis said. "The last time I had a start like this was 
in '91, we won the World Series (with the Minnesota Twins)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, of course, are thinking fast start, too.

CANDIOTTI'S PITCHING IS ONLY PART OF STORY; BASEBALL: DODGERS POUND CARDINAL 
PITCHERS FOR 12 HITS IN 7-3 VICTORY. KNUCKLEBALLER HAS FOUR-HITTER. 
</P>

<P>
 The last time Tom Candiotti pitched a complete game at Busch Stadium before 
Tuesday, it made every highlight reel in the country. But what was seen for 
days to come was a throw by Mike Piazza that hit Candiotti in, well, the 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the catchers who have ever caught me, Mike probably catches me the 
best and is a big target for me back there," Candiotti said. "And yes, in this 
stadium, I guess I've been a good target for him." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Candiotti, who was the most consistent pitcher on the 
Dodger staff last season but is seemingly always overshadowed by something. 
Tuesday night against the St. Louis Cardinals, Candiotti (2-0) pitched a 
four-hitter in a 7-3 victory, becoming the first Dodger pitcher to throw 
consecutive complete games to start the season since Orel Hershiser in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But Candiotti's knuckleball, which moved well in the windy, cold air, wasn't 
the only story of this game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers finally started hitting. After scoring only 11 runs and collecting 
29 hits in their first six games, they had 12 hits Tuesday, including five 
doubles and a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 For Candiotti, who had the worst run support in the major leagues last season, 
pitching with a six-run lead, including a run he drove in, was a welcome 
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first game I pitched, we got three runs and tonight we came out of the 
chute really well," said Candiotti, who kept his earned-run average at 2.00. 
"We got most of our runs early in the game and when you do that, it puts 
pressure on the other team." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Cardinal starter Rene Arocha (0-1), the Dodgers scored two runs in the 
second inning and two in the fourth before breaking the game open in the sixth, 
when Tim Wallach hit a two-run homer to give the Dodgers a 6-1 lead. Wallach 
drove a 2-2 pitch into the seats in center field, about 440 feet from the 
plate, for his first home run of the season. It was enough to send Arocha out 
of the game, and Manager Joe Torre used four relievers to finish it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitless through the first four games of the season, Wallach started to break 
out of his slump Saturday against the Atlanta Braves. He is five for nine, with 
three runs batted in and three runs scored, in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident I can still hit and do the things I haven't been able to do the 
past couple of seasons," said Wallach, who was two for four with two RBIs and 
two runs scored. "I feel better about where I'm at both physically and mentally 
and am in better shape than I have been in some time. And I think that's due to 
being able to go to the stadium during the winter and work out six hours three 
times a week, in the batting cages with Reggie (Smith) and (in the weight 
room)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach got things started in the second inning with a line drive to right 
field, but was forced at second by Henry Rodriguez. Raul Mondesi and Jose 
Offerman followed with consecutive doubles to put the Dodgers ahead, 2-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Offerman's double off the left-center field wall was his first hit of the 
season in 15 at-bats. Mondesi ended the night three for four, with two doubles 
and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coach) Manny Mota talked to me before the game and told me not to worry," 
Mondesi said. "He said, 'Everybody knows you can hit, so just go out and play.' 
What he said gave me more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence is not a problem for Candiotti. 
</P>
<P>
 During a stretch of 15 starts last summer, he was 5-0 with a 1.61 ERA and 10 
no-decisions. With the Dodgers scoring a major league-low average of 2.53 runs 
in games Candiotti started, he ended the season with an 8-10 record but a 3.12 
ERA, seventh-best in the league. Still, a knuckleball pitcher, no matter how 
good, is often overshadowed by the other pitchers on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it is just the enigma of the pitch, really, if someone says a 
knuckleballer is the ace of the staff, they probably think that everybody else 
on the staff is pretty bad," Candiotti said. "Most people think a knuckleball 
is a pitch that someone goes to when they don't have good enough other stuff, 
but it's different in my case. I don't mind being a contributing partner to the 
rotation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In Cleveland, I was considered the ace and in Toronto they had me start (Game 
1 of the playoffs), so somebody there thought I was pretty good. But it doesn't 
bother me, I have confidence in my ability and normally go out and give them a 
chance to win every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, he did that Tuesday.

RED SOX ROUT ROYALS, 22-11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the ninth inning of a long night in Kansas City, and infielder David 
Howard was pitching for the Royals. That's how bad it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Cooper needed a single to finish hitting for the cycle. That's how good 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he was going for it," Howard said. "I threw him two lob pitches 
because the changeup was called for and that's the only changeup I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper hit it for his single in Boston's 22-11 victory that made a bad 
situation worse in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have done that if I would have known he was going for it because 
it's something you might have one chance in a lifetime for," Howard said of his 
pitch to Cooper. "I told him that when I got to third base after my 
(ninth-inning) hit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals fell to 1-5, the third consecutive season they have gotten off to a 
terrible start. Kansas City started out 2-9 last season and was 1-16 in 1992. 
But even the Royals had never seen anything this brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just lucky to get it over with," Royals Manager Hal McRae said. "What 
can I say? You might as well forget it. It was one of those games you would 
like to throw out and forget about. It's always embarrassing to give up 22 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper drove in five runs in the highest-scoring game ever against the Royals. 
He went five for six with two doubles, and became the first Boston player to 
hit for the cycle since Mike Greenwell in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reached on an error by Howard, then a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Missouri, from St. Louis," Cooper said. "I had my brother and uncle 
here. I'll remember this night for the rest of my life. Hitting for the cycle. 
I was excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Mo Vaughn homered, tripled and drove in four runs for Boston in its biggest 
burst since a 24-5 romp over Cleveland on Aug. 21, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox got 15 hits, 11 for extra bases. They also took advantage of 13 
walks and three errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston ripped Kansas city ace Kevin Appier (0-2) for six runs in the first 
inning, then added eight runs in the sixth off Stan Belinda on only two hits. 
Danny Darwin (2-0) pitched six innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little on the humiliating side. It's a little demoralizing," catcher 
Mike Macfarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 10, New York 5 -- Frank Thomas and rookie Joe Hall homered at Chicago, 
leading Wilson Alvarez and the White Sox to their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (2-0) won his 10th decision in a row, including a victory over Toronto 
in last year's playoffs. He pitched 6 1/3 innings in sending the Yankees to 
their third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall hit his first major league home run and had two singles. Thomas hit a 
426-foot homer and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 8, Toronto 4 -- Toronto pitchers issued 12 walks, four of them to 
Rickey Henderson, and the Athletics won at Oakland despite being outhit, 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's did not get a hit after the first inning, but took advantage of four 
errors in snapping Toronto's four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Six walks in two-plus innings by Paul Spoljaric (0-1) set the tone for 
Toronto's pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 With Oakland up, 3-2, in the third inning, Spoljaric walked the first three 
batters and was behind, 2-and-0, to Mark McGwire. Scott Brow came on and walked 
in a run, and Geronimo Berroa's shallow fly ball got another run home when 
second baseman Roberto Alomar fell making the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland scored three times in the bottom half of the fifth inning without a 
hit, thanks to two errors by Alex Gonzalez at shortstop and two runs forced 
home by walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 12, Minnesota 0 -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit a 462-foot home run into the 
Seattle Kingdome's center-field stands, helping send Dave Fleming and the 
Mariners past the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey's fourth homer of the season, a three-run shot, gave the Mariners a 
7-0 lead in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins lost their fifth consecutive game and are 1-7 for the first time in 
history.

NOTHING LIKE A DAY AT THE OLD. . .ER, THE NEW BALLPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simply moving into The Ballpark in Arlington is not going to be enough to give 
the Texas Rangers a home field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players say it'll take a half-season to figure out the place. Others say 
they'll need all 81 home games. Manager Kevin Kennedy joked it better not take 
much longer because "we may not all be here if it takes two years." 
</P>
<P>
 But it only took one game -- a 4-3 loss to Milwaukee on Monday -- to point out 
several areas where they need extra work. 
</P>
<P>
 On is fan safety, a must after a woman was seriously injured falling from a 
rail in the upper deck in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Minter, 26, was in serious condition in a Dallas hospital Tuesday 
recovering from broken ribs and a broken right arm. Witnesses said she was 
sitting on the rail posing for a picture when she slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 About 46 warning signs will be posted along that railing before Wednesday 
night's game and Rangers president Tom Schieffer is discussing further action 
with city officials, team spokesman John Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking to put signs wherever there might be a potential problem," 
Blake said. "We feel this is a safe ballpark, but certainly we're concerned 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the field, the Rangers are trying to get used to the $189 million 
stadium's tight foul lines, an outfield wall with eight angles, slick grass and 
a short right-field porch. 
</P>
<P>
 Those quirks might seem like a problem now, but they could eventually give The 
Ballpark its identity, sort of like The Green Monster does for Fenway Park in 
Boston, says architect David Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want The Ballpark to develop its own mythology, like when some 
regular-season game is lost because someone guesses the ball is going to hit on 
the wrong side of the carom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarz got his wish Monday on a sixth-inning sinking line drive that scooted 
past charging right fielder Rob Ducey, bounced off a side wall along the line 
and got stuck in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The RBI triple put Milwaukee ahead 2-0 and kept the Brewers in control the 
rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The team already has been working on defending right field by having coach 
Mickey Hatcher hit balls into the corner and along the walls so players can get 
a feel for how it comes off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really get used to it because it can come off in any direction," 
Ducey said. "The only way you can play the ball right is to wait for it to stop 
rolling then pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern for players is the outfield grass that some compared to a golf 
fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were no footing problems Monday as there had been in exhibition 
games against the New York Mets on April 1-2, there were complaints that the 
ball "snaked" in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game also at least temporarily put aside assumptions that there was 
a wind tunnel sucking balls into the right field seats and helping others carry 
toward center and right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's give it a full season before we label it a hitter's park," said Will 
Clark.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BONDS HAS A MEMORABLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All winter, the San Francisco Giants have been hearing about winning 103 games 
and losing a division title. Since October, it has gnawed at them and it 
provided extra incentive Tuesday at Atlanta in the first meeting of the season 
between the Giants and Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds was talking cool but playing as though his memory is at least six 
months long. He ran down Charlie O'Brien's drive in the seventh inning, saving 
a run and crashing into the left-field fence. Then he hit a two-run homer in 
the ninth inning of the Giants' 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' homer tied the score and pinch-hitter John Patterson doubled home the 
go-ahead run as San Francisco stopped Atlanta's season-opening winning streak 
at seven. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bonds' homer, Todd Benzinger singled against John Smoltz (1-1), bringing 
on Mark Wohlers. After a sacrifice and grounder, Patterson doubled off the 
left-field fence, then scored on a single by Darren Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds lay on the ground for about 10 seconds after hitting the wall in the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "My (left) shoulder just popped out and back in," he said. "I wasn't worried 
about it. I knew I could swing. It's not a big issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, said Bonds, is last season's finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early. It's not how you start, but how you finish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta finished last season by overcoming a 10-game San Francisco lead by 
winning 75% of its games after July 20. The Braves got two hits in the ninth 
inning Tuesday before Mike Jackson got the third out for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Montreal 1 -- Tony Fernandez hit a three-run homer and Reggie 
Sanders added a three-run triple at Montreal as the Reds won their sixth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Pugh (1-0) gave up five hits in eight innings in his first start, striking 
out five and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati loaded the bases in the third inning against Denis Boucher (0-1) on 
singles by Brian Dorsett and Barry Larkin and a walk to Fernandez. Sanders then 
tripled to deep right-center, and scored on Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's first homer for the Reds came with two outs in the fourth inning 
to make it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 4, San Diego 2 -- Dave Clark, Al Martin and Don Slaught had 
run-scoring singles in the eighth inning for the Pirates at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Ashby had limited the Pirates to a run on six hits for 7 2/3 innings -- 
the second-longest outing of his career -- before leaving with a 2-1 lead after 
Jeff King's two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Davis (0-1) then walked Orlando Merced. Reliever Gene Harris gave up the 
three RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dewey (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth inning in relief of Steve Cooke, 
and Rick White pitched the ninth for his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Florida 2 -- Andujar Cedeno homered for the third consecutive game 
and Luis Gonzalez hit a three-run homer as the Astros spoiled the Marlins' home 
opener at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedeno, batting eighth, also singled and doubled in four at-bats and leads the 
National League with a .538 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Servais and Cedeno hit consecutive homers in the second inning against 
Ryan Bowen (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Kile (1-1) gave up five hits and one earned run, striking out eight in 
six innings. Tom Edens pitched three scoreless innings for his first save.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; 'MR. HERSHISER' ASIDE, PARK ADJUSTS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While at lunch Monday with Orel Hershiser and Darren Dreifort in St. Louis, 
Chan Ho Park was approached by a group of Koreans who wanted his autograph. But 
Park, who still refers to Hershiser as "Mr. Hershiser," told the fans it would 
not be polite to give autographs in front of a veteran player. And then Park 
introduced Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am being recognized by many people now, not just Koreans," Park said 
through his interpreter, Don Yi. "It happens in Glendale (where Park lives) in 
L.A. and here." 
</P>
<P>
 Park says he is adjusting well to his new life. Monday night, after the Dodger 
game against the Cardinals had been postponed because of rain, Park went to see 
"Major League 2" with Yi, Hershiser and several other Dodgers. Yi interpreted 
for Park, but said there were many scenes that needed no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chan Ho kept comparing the players in the movie to his teammates," Yi said. 
"You know the guy with the leather jacket that gets traded to the White Sox? 
Well when he walks in the clubhouse with his sunglasses on, Chan Ho said. 
'There's Roger McDowell.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Park is learning English, but says because of time restraints, he relies more 
on his teammates and audiocassettes than the language school he attends in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I can't understand what people are saying is the most difficult 
adjustment," Park said. "But the other players are patient and understand. (On 
the mound) I understand when Mike Piazza talks to me. Baseball is a 
professional language and I don't have difficulty there. Plus, Piazza goes out 
of his way for me." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cory Snyder, who started the season on the disabled list, is scheduled to 
arrive in St. Louis today in playing shape. To make room for Snyder, the 
Dodgers are expected to send Billy Ashley back to triple-A Albuquerque. Snyder 
probably will platoon in left field with Henry Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Stan Musial played the national anthem on his harmonica before the game. . . . 
The Cardinals have had three rainouts already this season, one in San 
Francisco, one in Cincinnati and Monday's game here. . . . Mike Perez, who took 
Lee Smith's place as the Cardinal closer, is two for two in save opportunities. 
. . . Rick Sutcliffe, 37, has been pitching in relief but will start tonight 
for the Cardinals against Ramon Martinez. Sutcliffe's last National League 
start was in 1991 with the Chicago Cubs. He was 26-25 in two seasons with the 
Baltimore Orioles before becoming a free agent after last season. MARYANN

 Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell of the Chicago White Sox collects, of all 
things, smiley faces -- coffee cups, buttons, banks, a cookie jar with HAVE A 
HAPPY DAY on it. He even painted yellow smiley faces on his sneakers.  
</P>
<P>
 "They make me laugh because isn't yellow supposed to be an anger color?" 
McDowell said in Chicago magazine. "Like, if you paint your walls yellow, it's 
supposed to make you feel angry. So it's funny to me that the happy face is 
yellow. It's a dichotomy."

 The Angels remained optimistic after starter Mark Langston's arthroscopic 
elbow surgery that he will be able to rejoin the rotation within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Yocum removed three bone chips Tuesday, two of which were large, but 
did not find any other abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went well, just as expected," Yocum said of the 40-minute 
procedure. "There were no surprises. He should be back in about six weeks, give 
or take a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Buck Rodgers: "That's as good news as you can get out of bad 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, left-handed starter Joe Magrane, who underwent arthroscopic elbow 
surgery Feb. 15, will make his first rehabilitative start Friday at Class-A 
Lake Elsinore against Central Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Magrane is scheduled to make two starts for Lake Elsinore before joining 
triple-A Vancouver on April 25 for two more starts. If there are no setbacks, 
he will join the Angel rotation on May 5 or May 6.

 Angel rookie Brian Anderson was strolling the Main Place Mall Tuesday 
afternoon, saw two men shopping for sunglasses, and couldn't believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 They were Albert Belle and Wayne Kirby of the Cleveland Indians, who just so 
happen to be two of his favorite players on his favorite team, at least until 
he made the big leagues himself. In fact, Belle still remains one of his idols. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a Cleveland fan grew up in Geneva, Ohio, walked up, introduced 
himself and left in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked away with a big smile on my face, my knees jittery," Anderson, 21, 
said. "I told them that I was a big Indians fan growing up, but I didn't tell 
(Belle) that I have posters of him hanging up in my room." 
</P>
<P>
 If truth be told, the folks in the Cleveland front office are fans of Anderson 
too. They hoped that he would last until the 11th pick in the draft last 
season. Instead, the Angels drafted him with their third pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We loved him, we wanted him in the worst way," said Cleveland General Manager 
John Hart said. "Our reports were that he come to the big leagues faster than 
anyone in the draft. We thought he could help a team right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it turns out, he proved us right." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 How rich is the athletic tradition at USC? Left out of the first class of 
inductees into the school Hall of Fame were two Heisman Trophy winners, a 
three-time Cy Young Award winner, Wimbledon and U.S. Open champions, numerous 
Olympic gold medalists in track and swimming, and Masters, U.S. Open and PGA 
winners. . . .

 The voters -- including sportswriters, sportscasters and officials and 
supporters of the athletic department -- were asked to choose two football 
players each from the pre- and post-1960 eras. . . .

CLIPPERS STUMBLING TO THE WIRE; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY LOSE FOURTH IN A ROW, AND 
WEISS ADMITS THIS HAS BEEN HIS MOST TRYING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss, an accomplished amateur magician, probably wishes he 
could make his team's dreadful season disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weiss, who can make cigarettes vanish with a sleight of hand, can't pull 
off that trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said this has been the most trying season of his six-year NBA head 
coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult with all the peripheral problems and injuries," 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lost for the 11th time in their last 14 games, falling to the 
Seattle SuperSonics, 116-101, Tuesday night before 11,160 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've run out of answers," said Clipper forward Dominique Wilkins, who had a 
team-high 26 points. "I don't know what to tell you. We just don't come to play 
every night, that's the only thing I can say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't play good team defense, we just don't. That's how you stop 
teams. You can't stop them by individual defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers' most recent slide coincided with an announcement last month by 
Steve Kauffman, Wilkins' agent, that Wilkins would test the free-agent market 
because he had been unable to reach a contract agreement with the Clippers. 
Wilkins is reportedly seeking a $21 million, three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Wilkins regret the timing of the announcement? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't, actually," he said. "I wish it hadn't gotten to that point. They 
could have handled that before it even happened, but they chose not to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers (26-50), who've lost their last four games, remained in a 
last-place Pacific Division tie with the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who ended a 19-game losing streak in Seattle earlier this 
season, fell behind by 19 points in the first half and couldn't get any closer 
than four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Seattle has already clinched the Pacific Division title, the 
SuperSonics don't look like they're ready to take the rest of the regular 
season off. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Kendall Gill had 26 points, forward Detlef Schrempf got 20 points, 11 
rebounds and a season-high eight assists and All-Star forward Shawn Kemp had 19 
points and a game-high 14 rebounds as the SuperSonics (58-18) won for the 12th 
time in their last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by 61-50 at halftime, cut the SuperSonics' lead to 
five points (84-79) going into the final quarter on a layup by forward Loy 
Vaught, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds, with 5.8 seconds remaining in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins had 10 points and Ron Harper, who had 20 points, got six points in the 
third quarter as the Clippers outscored the SuperSonics 29-23 in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers shot only 31.6% in the fourth quarter, missing 13 of 19 shots 
as Seattle beat them for the third time in four games. Wilkins missed five of 
six shots in the final quarter and Harper missed all three shots he took in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a great game," Kemp said. "It's the end of the season and their 
season's almost over, so they might not have their heart in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper point guard Mark Jackson, who sat out the last three games because of 
a sprained right wrist, played for the first time since last Tuesday's 92-91 
victory at Denver. Jackson had four points and 11 assists . . . Clipper Coach 
Bob Weiss was called for a technical with 9:01 remaining in the second quarter. 
It was the first time Weiss had been called for a technical since he was kicked 
out of a game against the Boston Celtics on Dec. 30 after drawing two 
technicals.

WHALERS HAVE ALCOHOL TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hartford Whalers have been grappling with losing seasons for years. 
Lately, they've been haunted by a more serious problem with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in three weeks, the NHL franchise was hit with an 
alcohol-related arrest. First there was a late night drinking episode in 
Buffalo, quickly followed by two drunken-driving arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything else happen to tarnish the Whalers before they end their 
miserable season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess bad things happen in threes, so we're done for this year," said 
defenseman Adam Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, the Whalers were done three weeks ago, when they were eliminated 
from the playoffs for the second straight year and seventh time in 15 seasons. 
Their off-rink problems began about the same time, when six players and an 
assistant coach were arrested following an early morning barroom brawl in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got even worse a week later with the drunken-driving arrest of General 
Manager Paul Holmgren, his second in two years. He is being treated at the 
Betty Ford Center and will face the charge when he is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last Friday night, defenseman Bryan Marchment was arrested for drunken 
driving on his way home from a charity event to raise money for a cancer fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the final episode sent a message to the guys that it can be you. It's 
not just happening out there. It can happen to the players as well. It probably 
was a good wake up call. I think everyone's kind of learned a lesson from 
that," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that (Marchment) is a very responsible guy and it was just an 
unfortunate incident, and it goes on all the time. It's just that not everyone 
gets caught like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents with the Whalers recall the death of Philadelphia Flyers goalie 
Pelle Lindbergh, killed in what was deemed an alcohol-related accident in 1985, 
driving home from after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But athletes from other sports have also died in similar accidents, including 
two NFL players -- Stacey Toran and Fred Washington and NASCAR driver Robbie 
Moroso. In addition, Lenny Dykstra and Darren Daulton of the Philadelphia 
Phillies were badly injured in an alcohol-related accident, and Jeff Alm of the 
NFL's Houston Oilers shot himself after a close friend was killed when his car 
drove off a freeway overpass last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gordon, owner of the Whalers, makes it clear that his team doesn't 
seem to be learning from past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously his arrest raises a big question," Gordon said. "Why would he do 
it? Sports figures are role models, and they have a responsibility, whether 
they like it or not, to themselves, their team and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they all have children too. Don't you think they would want to set a good 
example for their children? How interested would they be in having someone 
drive through their neighborhood drunk and hit one of their kids? These are 
standards set for everybody, whether you're in professional sports, or 
business, or whatever you do. These are just acceptable standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon tried to make when he tried to suspend the players involved in the 
first incident in Buffalo. The action was overruled by the NHL, which later 
decided not to punish the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said he believes excessive drinking is a societal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's not a question of just the Hartford Whalers. There are drunks 
in society all over the place -- excessive drinking every day. The question is 
what can we do to correct it collectively, not just come down on people and say 
'Okay, you're bad."' 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL does not have an alcohol policy, but it has been part of negotiations 
with the Players Association.

 "Our concerns about this far pre-date any of these incidents with the Hartford 
Whalers," NHL spokesman Arthur Pincus said. "It's a general feeling that it's 
something the professional sports league needs to have in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, meanwhile, said he will be trying to find out as much as he can about 
the problems. The Reid Treatment Center in Avon, which has worked with the team 
in the past, has offered to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to learn a lot and talk to a lot of different people, and offer 
services to our players. But again, it's if they want it. "We're trying as a 
franchise to help the individuals who are concerned."

NHL ROUNDUP; PANTHERS SEEKING HELP FROM ACROSS THE STATE

<P>
 Taken into a seemingly certain playoff spot by their defense and goaltending 
two weeks ago, the Florida Panthers were taken back out again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By defense and goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny what pressure can do to you," Quebec Coach Pierre Page said after 
his Nordiques handed the Panthers a 5-2 loss Tuesday night. "Unfortunately for 
them, the two guys that got them here had bad nights. They've had a great 
season, but their two big guys didn't come through for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida goalie Mark Fitzpatrick said most of the Nordiques' goals could have 
been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the goaltending, Florida's all-star goaltender John 
Vanbiesbrouck, who was pulled for the first time this season, said: "It 
certainly wasn't the best." 
</P>
<P>
 He is 0-5-2 in his last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 In an irony of sorts, the loss puts Florida, an expansion team, at the mercy 
of instate rival Tampa Bay. The Panthers need the Lightning to beat the New 
York Islanders tonight to stay in the playoff race. New York holds a one-point 
advantage for the eighth and final Eastern playoff spot, largely because 
Florida is 0-4-4 in its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 9, St. Louis 5 -- Dave Gagner scored four goals as the Stars won at 
home and clinched home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagner's first two goals came during a three-goal Dallas blitz in the opening 
6:49 of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Shanahan had a hat trick for the Blues, giving him 50 goals for the 
season. The hat trick was the sixth of his career and gave him 10 goals in his 
last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 3, Buffalo 2 -- The Sabres lost a two-goal lead in the third 
period and a chance to solidify their playoff position at New York, where the 
Rangers won on goals by Adam Graves, Alexander Karpovtsev and Brian Noonan. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Steve Konowalchuk and Kelly Miller scored 26 
seconds apart in the Capitals' three-goal first period and they wrapped up 
seventh place in the Eastern Conference at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Beaupre had 27 saves for Washington, which will open the playoffs Sunday 
against the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Toronto 3 -- Dirk Graham's two goals and Ed Belfour's strong 
goaltending led the Blackhawks at Toronto and ended the Toronto Maple Leafs' 
hopes of winning the NHL's Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's loss clinched first place in the division for the idle Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, New Jersey 2 -- Jason Bowen's first goal of the season with 
8:32 to play at Philadelphia helped the Flyers snap a three-game winless 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen found a loose puck at the top of the left faceoff circle and beat Devil 
goalie Chris Terreri with a hard, high slapshot to the glove side to give the 
Flyers a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only the Flyers' fourth in their last 11 games.

NBA ROUNDUP; REST OF THE CAVALIERS MAKE PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough reasons for the Cleveland Cavaliers to miss the playoffs this year were 
sitting on the bench in street clothes, watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Former All-Stars Brad Daugherty and Larry Nance couldn't play, along with 
three lesser-light teammates. What was left beat the Milwaukee Bucks, 119-91, 
Tuesday night at Richfield, Ohio, to clinch a playoff berth despite it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make a statement: that even though we've been injured, we're 
going to the playoffs," Bobby Phills said after Cleveland clinched a playoff 
berth for the sixth time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks lost their fifth consecutive game overall and their 13th in a row on 
the road. Their 56 losses set a team record. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland remains uncertain whether Daugherty, out because of a herniated 
disk, or Nance (knee surgery) will be back for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the fifth-best team in the East as of now, and we feel we can go in 
there and make some noise," Gerald Wilkins said. "Right now, we'd play Orlando, 
a team we split with, so we think we have a chance of getting to the second 
round. We don't think we're going to get Brad back. We don't think we're going 
to get Larry back. But we do have enough guys on this team to make some noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Phills hit nine of 11 shots and he and Terrell Brandon each scored 22 points 
for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous 10 games, Phills had hit 17 of 75 shots, 23%, and averaged 4.4 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basket's been small for me from the perimeter for about 10 games," Phills 
said. "I just had to go inside, pound it inside and get some dunks." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 107, Denver 102 -- Frank Johnson and Mark West made key contributions 
in the second half and the Suns pulled away at Denver, but the Nuggets remained 
four games in front of the Lakers for the final Western Conference playoff 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 108, Portland 107 -- Jamal Mashburn hit a jump shot in the final minute 
to snap a tie at Portland and lift the Mavericks to their first victory all 
season over a team with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas won for only the second time in its last 21 games, but the victory was 
its 10th of the season, assuring the Mavericks will not tie Philadelphia's 
nine-victory NBA record for futility. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 98, Minnesota 89 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 13 of his 42 points in the 
final four minutes, helping the Rockets tie last season's franchise record for 
victories -- 55 -- by winning at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston won its fifth in a row and took a 2 1/2-game lead over San Antonio in 
the Midwest Division. Minnesota lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 111, New Jersey 105 -- The Bulls won their eighth in a row, getting 25 
points from Scottie Pippen in beating the Nets at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls moved within a half-game of New York and Atlanta in the race for the 
best record in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks and Hawks each have seven 
games left and Chicago has six, including three in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen also had nine rebounds and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 134, Detroit 107 -- Jeff Malone scored 25 points, Orlando 
Woolridge had 23 and Philadelphia's reserves outscored Detroit's by 57 points 
at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 126, Sacramento 91 -- The Jazz stayed within two games of Phoenix in the 
race for the fourth-best record in the Western Conference, getting 21 points 
from Karl Malone at Salt Lake City.

ROUNDUP; BROCCO WON'T WORK UNTIL KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brocco, the winner of the Santa Anita Derby and the early co-favorite with 
Holy Bull for next month's Kentucky Derby, was pronounced in excellent 
condition by his trainer Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's fine," said Randy Winick, Brocco's trainer. "We walked the horse 
for about 45 minutes today, he's fine, he's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco was placed on the state veterinarian's restricted list Sunday. B. 
William Bell, the state veterinarian at Santa Anita, said Brocco was favoring 
one of his front legs after Saturday's Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses on the restricted list are not allowed to work out for five days and 
after that can race only if they show they have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never planned on a workout here," Winick said. "I planned originally on 
three workouts in Kentucky before the (Derby on May 7). That plan still holds. 
If he worked here, it would have been four. Right now, there's absolutely 
nothing wrong with the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky veterinarian George Mundy will assess Brocco's condition after his 
first strenuous work. If Mundy rules that the horse is fit, that will satisfy 
California requirements, and Brocco will be removed from the restricted list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The field for Saturday's $500,000 Blue Grass Stakes added Mahogany Hall, but 
lost Game Coin. Game Coin, second in the Louisiana Derby, has been sidelined 
because of a wrenched ankle and slight hoof injury, trainer Gary Jones said. 
Mahogany Hall is coming off a sixth-place finish in the Jim Beam Stakes at 
Turfway Park on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Warn Me might join the Blue Grass field. Trained by Alfredo Callejas, Warn Me 
hasn't started this year. He raced eight times in 1993, including seven starts 
in France, and won five races. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, a winner of six of seven lifetime starts, is expected to go off as 
the Blue Grass favorite. The probable field also includes Valiant Nature, 
Kandaly, Chimes Band and Bonus Money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Lamarque, owner of Kandaly, said his horse also will be entered in the 
Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on Saturday. "We're entering him there as a 
precaution in case there's an off track at Keeneland," Lamarque said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been raining at Keeneland for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remington Derby winner Smilin Singin Sam will run in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old won Saturday's Remington Derby at Remington Park by 2 3/4 
lengths. Silver Goblin, the favorite, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Goblin will run in the Arkansas Derby on April 23. Blumin Affair, the 
runner-up Saturday, will run in either the Arkansas Derby 23 or the Lexington 
Stakes at Keeneland on April 24.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: MORE THAN 1,000 SET FOR HALIBUT TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're flat as plywood, mottled brown and ugly, and they spend most of their 
lives staring straight up. But there's no fish as popular as halibut come 
springtime. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, more than 1,000 fishermen will ply the ocean between Point Dume 
and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, participating in the annual Santa Monica Bay 
Halibut Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day tournament, in its eighth year, has become one of the most popular 
events of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaze out into the bay Saturday or Sunday and there will be a sea of private 
and commercial boats. Marina del Rey Sportfishing and Redondo Sportfishing are 
booked for the event, which always seems to produce results. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's winner, Glenn Smith of Pacific Palisades, caught a 32.90-pound 
California halibut, which earned him a chance for bigger game. Smith's catch 
won him a trip to Whaler's Cove, Alaska, where he caught a 231-pound Pacific 
halibut, pulling on it for half an hour before getting it to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never imagined I'd be the one to catch one over 100 pounds, let alone one 
that weighed more than 200," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Smith is no ordinary halibut fisherman. In the last four years, he 
has placed in the top six at the derby. And halibut fishing runs in his family. 
His sister, Sylvia E. Kelly, holds a 12-pound line-class world record, the 
32-pound 6-ounce fish she caught in the Santa Monica Bay in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fishing has not been great this spring, John Bourget, tournament 
chairman, believes a big fish will again show at the scales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be covering the ocean out there," he said of the anglers. "Somebody 
will catch one." 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective participants can still enter by calling (310) 450-5131, or signing 
in at 2117 Ashland St. in Santa Monica through Friday at 8 p.m. Cost is $65 for 
the derby and banquet, $35 for the derby only. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the derby will benefit not only several children's organizations 
but also the halibut hatchery project at the marine laboratory in Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The small facility, tucked into the northeast corner of King Harbor, is home 
to several large halibut. The females lay thousands of eggs and studies begin 
when they hatch two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Halibut are ambush predators," biologist Jim Rounds said. "They are very 
powerful swimmers. They'll explode off the bottom and they're very fast. We've 
had them in indoor tanks here and put schools of live anchovies in and they'll 
just explode off the bottom and snatch the fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an explosion led to the death of one of the "old-time" halibut on the 
morning of the Jan. 17 earthquake. The shaking startled the fish and it leaped 
from an 11,000-gallon tank and landed a dozen or so feet below on the asphalt.  
</P>
<P>
 The hatchery, funded primarily by Southern California Edison and run by the 
Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, is close to having the capacity to 
conduct regular releases of halibut into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bourget is looking for halibut taggers. For $10, he supplies a kit 
and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Bourget's volunteer program has resulted in the tagging of nearly 
10,000 halibut. Information from retrieved fish is being supplied to the 
Natural History Museum, which wants to eventually determine migration patterns 
and attain population estimates so that someday the resource can be managed 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 A fish tagged in the Santa Monica Bay showed up in Morro Bay. Another was 
caught in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this is not yet enough information to make any conclusions about the 
patterns of halibut movement, it does show that individuals will travel both 
north and south," a museum update said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Last weekend's cold front shut off the yellowtail bite at the 
Coronado Islands, but the water is back up to 61 degrees and the fish are 
biting again. H&M Landing's Producer had 35 fish aboard by late Tuesday 
morning. The yellowtail are mostly 10-pounders. 
</P>
<P>
 The water off the Golden Gate area near Cabo San Lucas was the site of renewed 
marlin activity last week, but the bite didn't last. Yellowfin tuna remain the 
prevalent catch, but even tuna fishing has slowed in recent days. Best catch of 
the week: a 332-pound blue marlin caught aboard the Solmar VII. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cerralvo Island area off La Paz, the tuna fishing is excellent. 
Multiple hookups with fish to 80 pounds are common. The bite has been steady 
for five days, according to panga fleet owner Bob Butler. 
</P>

 Pacific Telesis stock -- The Stock Market Leaders and Laggards chart Monday 
listed Pacific Telesis as the communications stock with the greatest loss in

WORK BEGINS ON 12-SCREEN MOVIE PALACE; CAMARILLO: NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART EDWARDS 
COMPLEX WILL SEAT 3,000. TWO OTHER LARGE CINEMAS ARE PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a groundbreaking scheduled today, Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. will 
apparently be the first in a race among three movie theater chains to open a 
multiplex cinema in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Three cinema chains have won city approval to build theater complexes that 
will bring more than 30 screens and nearly 9,000 theater seats to the city. 
While all three have received permission to build, city officials said they 
believe only two of those will be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's going to happen is that there will be a cineplex on the east 
side and one on the west side of the city," City Manager Bill Little said. "I 
think that two will work. Three theaters -- I'm not so sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards Theatres is one of Southern California's largest theater chains and 
has only one other theater in the county, a seven-screen operation in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The new theater will be a 3,000-seat, 12-screen, state-of-the-art complex on 
10 acres of a planned business park south of the Ventura Freeway between Las 
Posas Road and Carmen Drive, company officials said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 56,000-square-foot facility will be called Camarillo Movie Palace and will 
feature high-tech sound and projection equipment, curved, wall-to-wall screens 
and seats with cup holders in the armrests. Along the 80-foot-long concession 
stand, patrons will be able to order popcorn with real butter topping, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the Edwards theater moves the project ahead of a similar-sized 
United Artists cineplex to be located on the city's east side near the 
intersection of Camino Ruiz and Adolfo Road. While the United Artists facility 
received final approval from the city in February, nearby residents have said 
the facility would create noise, traffic and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Artists facility, approved by the city Feb. 13, will begin 
construction in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mann Theaters Corp. proposal to build a 12-screen, 2,700-seat cineplex 
gained city approval last fall for a location in a business park off Daily 
Drive, across the Ventura Freeway from the Edwards project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Pardee Construction Inc., the firm that is building the proposed 
United Artists cineplex, and representatives of Mann Theaters Corp. could not 
be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edwards cineplex sailed through most of the city's regulatory process 
except for a sharp debate by members of the Camarillo Airport Authority who 
voted to oppose the movie house because it is located close to the edge of the 
runway at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the authority's objection, the City Council was forced to consider 
the proposal and voted to approve the project after a consultant's report 
indicated the chances of a plane crashing into the complex were slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said he welcomed the new development but expressed concern, 
like Little, over whether the city could support three massive movie houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can support 30-plus screens in this city, but I'm sure 
that if their marketing studies didn't show enough support, they wouldn't be 
here," Gose said. "Still, you can bet your boot they'll be watching the Edwards 
project closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said if the United Artists complex is developed after the Edwards 
project, the city could gain a countywide reputation as a place to see movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These larger theaters are really regional attractions," Little said. "People 
don't seem to mind making a 70-mile round-trip if it means they have the 
selection and amenities they want. By contrast, that would never happen back 
East. There you have theaters that are truly dependent upon patrons from the 
local neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards officials were also unavailable for comment, but they have said they 
expect to open the Camarillo location by Thanksgiving.

HOMEOWNER DRAFTS INITIATIVE TO PROTECT VENTURA'S GREENBELT; OPEN SPACE: THE 
PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL OF ANY DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
CITY-DESIGNATED AREA. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura city voters would have the last say on any new developments intruding 
on the city's greenbelt, under a ballot initiative proposed by a Ventura 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Vincent, angered at the prospect of development in orchards next to his 
east Ventura house, has drawn up an initiative that would require a majority of 
city voters to approve any development in the city-designated greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, the City Council has designated specific agricultural areas 
to be off-limits to development until the year 2010. But council members also 
have the authority to change its greenbelt rules and are considering such an 
exception in a controversial land-swap deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just want this group up there, on their dais, deciding what is best 
for developers," Vincent said. "We don't want Ventura to turn into 
cookie-cutter developments and strip malls. What this city has to offer is 
things like virtually clean air, little or no traffic, and citrus groves." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent has hired former Ventura Mayor Richard Francis, an attorney, to help 
him draft the measure and qualify it for the November ballot. Vincent must 
gather the signatures of 8,700 registered voters by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis, who has mounted similar development initiatives in the past, said he 
thinks the issue will have strong support from Ventura voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's assumed the environment is dead," Francis said. "It's not dead. 
It's alive and well and to some extent frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said he is motivated by a land-swap deal that could lead to building 
436 houses on an 87-acre lemon orchard behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is weighing a proposal by developer Ron Hertel to trade 92 
acres he owns near the Kimball Road off-ramp on the Santa Paula Freeway for the 
87 acres at the northeast corner of Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue behind 
Vincent's home. To sweeten the deal, Hertel has offered to give the city $2 
million to put a public park on the Kimball Road property. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch is that both the city's property and Hertel's property are 
designated as part of the city's greenbelt. And the City Council would have to 
amend its Comprehensive Plan before Hertel could knock down a single lemon tree 
on the Telegraph Road property. 
</P>
<P>
 Many council members, however, seem amenable to that prospect. In a 4-1 vote 
two months ago, the council gave Hertel its blessing to go forward with his 
proposed land swap. City officials are negotiating with the developer and the 
project is set to come before the council for final approval this year.  
</P>
<P>
 All this infuriates Bruce and Sheri Vincent, who contend that Hertel's sales 
agents promised them when they bought their home four years ago that the 
orchard would not be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very desirable to back up to miles of orchards," Vincent said, standing 
on the tiles by his spa and gesturing out at the trees across the street from 
the back of his house. "We based our home purchase on what we were told -- that 
if anything happens to this land, it'll probably be a regional park, but most 
likely, it'll stay an orchard."  
</P>
<P>
 Hertel said his sales agents were never instructed to make such a pitch to 
prospective buyers, and if they did, they were obviously wrong in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel and some City Council members, not surprisingly, are less than thrilled 
about Vincent's initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an obvious move on his part to prevent the land swap," Hertel said. "I 
consider it a selfish act . . . since he seems only interested in himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford, who voted for the project, said he thinks the initiative, if 
passed, would rob city government of flexibility in dealing with future 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly is an indication of a loss of confidence in the process and 
perhaps in particular elected officials," he said. "I don't think people think 
this solution is desirable, but they lose confidence in their officials and 
say, 'We will have to take matters into our own hands.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent is not alone in his battle against Hertel and City Hall. Neighbors in 
his tract and others embattled by possible development say they are eager to 
help circulate petitions and drum up votes for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that the city needs to protect green space," said Les Walker, 
who lives down the street from Vincent. Walker says he intends to plant himself 
in front of local markets and strip mall shops, offering petitions to sign to 
any willing passerby. 
</P>
<P>
 Sy Einstoss, whose nearly 30-year-old house abuts yet another proposed 
greenbelt development, said he plans to go "all out" to get the initiative on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be another Orange County if we let these guys do what they wanted to 
do," said Einstoss, who lives next door to the 222 agricultural acres that 
developer Brad Jones would like to transform into 815 houses. The orchards are 
located just east of North Hill Road, between Foothill and Telegraph roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our home was built on ag land, but that was years ago," Einstoss said. "I'm 
really against any further development."

D.A. WEIGHS '3 STRIKES' FOR SLAYING IN OXNARD; LAWS: MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS 
WIFE COULD BE THE FIRST COUNTY RESIDENT PROSECUTED UNDER THE NEW STATE STATUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A twice-convicted armed robber now accused of killing his wife could be the 
first Ventura County resident prosecuted under the state's new "three strikes 
and you're out" law, the district attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Castaneda, 25, of Oxnard is charged with murder in the April 2 death of 
his wife, Mina Castaneda, also 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate to become Ventura County's first "three strikes" felon, 
prosecutors said, is Henry Diaz, 40, of Simi Valley. He faces 10 felony counts 
of child molestation after police said they raided his Sitka Avenue home last 
month and found him in bed with a 13-year-old girl. Diaz, who is on parole, has 
three prior felony robbery convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say that those two cases are under consideration. They appear to meet 
the criteria for three strikes," Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district attorney's office decided Tuesday not to use the new 
law against Preston A. Shelton -- an Oxnard man who was charged with 
cultivating marijuana plants, a felony, only hours after Gov. Pete Wilson 
signed the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the law, defendants face a mandatory sentence of 25 years 
to life. The statute prescribes such a sentence for anyone with two prior 
serious or violent felony convictions who commits a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, prosecutors had indicated that Shelton might be charged under three 
strikes. Shelton had served more than 10 years for a series of eight robberies 
in Los Angeles County before being released eight months ago, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After prosecutors announced that they would not charge him under the 
three-strikes law, Shelton pleaded guilty to one count of marijuana cultivation 
in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that he didn't fit under three strikes," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gary K. Barrett, adding that Shelton's latest crime had been initiated before 
Wilson signed the three-strikes legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was arrested a few hours after the law went into effect," Barrett said. 
"That's why we looked at it as a three-strikes case. Obviously, (Shelton) 
planted marijuana that had germinated and grown for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, however, did add an allegation to the cultivation charge that 
said Shelton committed the offense while on parole. It requires that he serve 
prison time for Tuesday's guilty plea, Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath indicated he would sentence Shelton to 
28 months for his guilty plea and violation of parole, which is the lowest term 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Bryant Villagran, Shelton's attorney, said his client 
is pleased that he is not facing a sentence of 25 years to life. He also said 
Shelton picked up marijuana-cultivation tips from a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are probably a thousand people in this county doing the same thing," 
Villagran said. "But when you are on parole, you just can't afford to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very tough to have spent the last 10 2/3 years of your life in a 
terrible and frightening environment," Villagran said. "You just can't expect a 
person to come out and adjust. If this is the worst that he does, he's doing 
better than most other people in his situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases of Diaz and Castaneda, prosecutors will announce whether they 
will charge the men with three strikes at their Superior Court arraignments, 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are being held at the Ventura County Jail. Because they are charged 
with crimes while on parole, they are not eligible for bail. Dates for their 
arraignments in Superior Court have not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley police SWAT team and narcotics detectives raided 
Diaz's home about 7 a.m. on March 22 after his parole officer reported possible 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the suspect in bed with the girl. After reviewing reports in the 
case, the district attorney's office filed the 10 counts of child molestation 
against Diaz, who also has been convicted of narcotics violations, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to murder, Castaneda faces a charge of unlawful possession of a 
firearm in connection with his wife's slaying. Mina Castaneda of Oxnard died 
after being shot in the head during an argument with the defendant, police 
said. She attended Oxnard College and had dreams of becoming a teacher.

NAVY SUED OVER UNDERWATER TEST BLAST PLANS; ENVIRONMENT: FIVE GROUPS CONTEND 
THAT EXPLOSIVES COULD HARM MARINE LIFE. DETONATIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO START THIS 
MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five environmental groups sued the Navy on Tuesday, saying a proposal to test 
ship-hull strength by detonating underwater explosives in waters southwest of 
the Channel Islands could harm marine life in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of fruitless negotiations with the Navy, the groups filed suit in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt 
the testing, which is scheduled to start later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials acknowledge that the testing may result in the deaths of a 
small number of marine mammals, but insist that it is environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests involve the detonation of underwater explosives as large as 10,000 
pounds each to determine the strength of the Navy's new Aegis-class destroyers, 
their electronics equipment and overall crew survivability under simulated 
battle conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names the National Marine Fisheries Service for granting the 
Navy a permit for the tests, which may involve as many as 270 detonations over 
a five-year period. Fisheries service officials could not be reached for 
comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the crux of the dispute is the proposed location for the tests, an area 
roughly 20 miles south of Navy-owned San Nicolas Island and about 85 miles 
southwest of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, where the tests will be 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy could scarcely have chosen a richer marine environment in which to 
test its ships," said Joel Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council, which is coordinating the legal challenge. "Detonating heavy 
explosives near the Channel Islands (National Marine Sanctuary) makes as much 
sense as testing dynamite in the Sistine Chapel." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the resources defense council in the suit are the Humane Society of 
the United States, Save the Whales, American Oceans Campaign and Santa 
Monica-based Heal the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say aerial surveys they have conducted in the test area during 
the past several months show there are relatively few marine mammals there. On 
Tuesday, they expressed disappointment over the groups' decision to file a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we have gone to extraordinary lengths to gather the scientific 
data showing this area is the best-suited for the tests," said Lt. Cmdr. Frank 
Thorp, a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego. "In fact, we believe that 
we have compiled the most extensive marine biological survey in recent 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that data, Thorp said Navy officials see no reason to stop or delay 
the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But the environmental groups opposing the plan disagree, saying the area is 
teeming with marine life, including some federally endangered species. Over the 
course of the proposed five-year testing period, 9,600 marine mammals could be 
harassed, injured or killed as a result of the tests, Navy documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy last month announced that it will seek, at first, to "ship shock" 
test only one vessel, the John Paul Jones. Under a revised environmental 
assessment compiled for the Jones last month, Navy officials said the ship 
would be exposed to only four detonations, using 10,000-pound explosives. On 
Monday, the Navy certified the environmental assessment, saying the four tests 
would have no significant impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Reynolds, the attempt by the Navy to switch to testing just 
one vessel is a smoke screen designed to lessen the public's concern over the 
testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our suit challenges the whole five-year program," Reynolds said. "Regardless 
of whether it's four detonations or 270 detonations, it's still the same 
program and we aim to stop it because of the danger that it presents to marine 
mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also contends that both the Navy and the fisheries service 
violated the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Environmental 
Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act by proceeding with the 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Godley, a local environmental activist and a spokesman for the Ventura 
County chapter of the Earth Island Institute, a nonprofit environmental group, 
said he was initially optimistic because the Navy agreed to meet with 
environmental groups over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought for once that the Navy was showing some real concern for the marine 
environment," Godley said. "But obviously, their concern was not legitimate. 
It's too bad that it will take a lawsuit to make them do what they should have 
done on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Brennan, a spokesman for the Ventura County chapter of the Surfrider 
Foundation, said he also was disappointed that the groups felt compelled to 
file a lawsuit over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on it seemed that they were actually taking our concerns seriously," 
Brennan said. "Now it seems that they were just attempting to placate us by 
meeting with us." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles will hear arguments from the U.S. 
Navy and attorneys representing the environmental groups in the lawsuit April 
20. Navy officials have agreed to postpone the first "ship shock" test until at 
least April 24.

VENTURA COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to sharp criticism from residents who accused them of being 
secretive, Ventura City Council members backed off on a vote on a 146-unit, 
low-income housing project in east Ventura, saying they should have called a 
public hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but sympathize with the residents who said they haven't heard 
about this" in time to gather enough information, said City Councilman Gregory 
L. Carson before the council voted 5 to 1 Monday night to delay a decision on 
the 23-acre project. Councilman Steve Bennett was absent, and Councilman Jim 
Monahan voted against the motion, saying he did not like the proposed site just 
north of the Santa Paula Freeway and east of Saticoy Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit developer, Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., 
had asked the council to give its non-binding "conceptual approval."  
</P>
<P>
 Such a vote would have let Cabrillo officials know if council members seemed 
amenable to the project's scope and site and if they would consider pledging 
city redevelopment funds to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us as a developer a chance to find out whether we are wasting our 
time and your time," Rodney Fernandez, Cabrillo's executive director, told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, council members asked Cabrillo officials to take the project back to 
the local community for further discussions and to hold a public hearing with 
the city's Redevelopment Agency if Cabrillo still wishes to apply for a 
$200,000 loan from redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's vote was not listed on the agenda as a public hearing, meaning 
no notices were sent out or posted alerting residents to the impending council 
action.  
</P>
<P>
 The residents who did learn about the agenda item and showed up at the meeting 
were not happy with the council. "The public doesn't have the information or 
the knowledge out there at this point to make a decision," said Susan Moffatt, 
who lives near the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 The development -- which would be just outside the city limits and would have 
to be annexed if it were approved -- includes construction of 80 apartments for 
very low-income residents and 66 single-family houses for low-income residents. 
 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1993 figures, low-income residents are families of four earning 
$39,700 or less per year, city officials say. Very low-income residents are 
families of four making $27,600 or less per year, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already pledged the $350,000 in federal, low-income housing funds 
it received for 1994 to Cabrillo for use in a low-income project.  
</P>
<P>
 If eventually awarded full approval, it would be the first low-income housing 
development authorized by the city in more than six years, said Everett 
Millais, the city's director of community services. Cabrillo is the largest 
private builder of low-income housing in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from their frustration at the City Council's hearing process, local 
residents attacked the project itself for its self-stated mission to house poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that Ventura has higher-priority projects than this particular 
one," said Dick Harp, a nearby resident, adding that he thinks the city already 
has plenty of low-income housing complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cabrillo officials countered that the city is officially deficient, by 
federal standards, in its supply of low-cost rental and for-sale housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not now, when? If not Cabrillo, who?" Fernandez asked council members. 
"Cabrillo's the only one doing this. If we don't do it now, who will do it 
when?"

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; GARAMENDI VISITS PORT FOR A DAY OF 
WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Garamendi moved 2,200 pounds of bananas on a forklift at the Port of 
Hueneme without a hitch Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as a phalanx of reporters and photographers recorded his every move, the 
would-be California governor also pitched in as longshoremen measured bananas 
and loaded them onto pallets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all in a day's work for Garamendi, who is laboring very hard these days 
to persuade voters that he should be the Democratic contender for the 
governor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his "Make California Work" campaign, Garamendi, 48, has sacked 
groceries, pumped gas, taught seventh-grade government class and flipped 
burgers at a small cafe. And that's just in the past three months when his 
campaign for the June Democratic primary kicked into full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he came to Port Hueneme because international trade will be a 
key point in the economic rebound he envisions for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that California's future lies in trade," he said, stopping for a 
brief chat with reporters after working alongside dock workers for about three 
hours on a 400-foot-long cargo vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching in on real-life jobs gives the former rancher and state legislator a 
good idea of the issues that concern people most, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're working side-by-side with people, you hear things you'll never 
hear from a lobbyist," he said. "You learn right from the people who are doing 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he supports the tiny port's goal to eventually reclaim Navy land from 
the adjacent Seabee base to expand its operations, and will lobby for state 
funds to see that happen if elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting to the state's Capitol might be an uphill battle. Polls show 
Garamendi running behind Democratic front-runner Kathleen Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even realize he was running for governor until today," said 
longshoreman Mark Pro. Even after working alongside Garamendi, Pro, a Democrat, 
remained uncommitted about whose name he will punch in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to study the issues some more," he said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FRESNO MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO BANK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura resident who swindled $7 million from the now defunct Santa 
Paula Savings & Loan has admitted in court that he lied to banks about his 
finances and then failed to pay back the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging an elaborate scheme to defraud Southern California banks, 
William F. Williams, 49, of Fresno pleaded guilty Monday to six counts of false 
statements, bank fraud and conspiracy. He will be sentenced July 20 and could 
face up to 135 years in jail and $4.5 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Williams' 
wife, Mary, will not be prosecuted. But prosecutors are still pursuing the 
Ventura County mortgage broker they say helped make some of the bad deals. 
Broker Patrick M. Downey faces trial May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint FBI and IRS investigation found that Williams and his wife inflated 
the income shown on their federal tax returns so banks would grant them loans, 
said Gary Auer, regional supervisor in charge of the FBI's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple would buy buildings with the loans, then fail to make payments, 
Auer said. Before the bank could foreclose on the property, the Williamses 
would transfer the titles to bogus corporations, he said. These corporations 
would then declare bankruptcy, thus protecting the building from foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges that Williams pleaded guilty to stemmed from two cases: a 
$1.5-million loan from the Antelope Valley Bank in Lancaster that was used for 
construction of a medical building; and a $950,000 loan from American Savings & 
Loan Assn. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement, Williams also acknowledged obtaining and 
defaulting on five loans from Santa Paula Savings & Loan in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamses bought apartment buildings in Fresno and condominiums in 
Bakersfield with the money from the small Santa Paula institution, but stopped 
all payment on the loans by September, 1989, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan, suffering under the weight of these and other bad loans, 
was taken over by Bank of A. Levy in 1991. Agent Auer said there was no 
connection found between bank employees and the couple. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SAN NICOLAS ISLAND; COASTAL PANEL OKS NAVY GUN 
TESTING

 The California Coastal Commission on Tuesday approved a request by the U.S. 
Navy to test-fire a sophisticated Gatling gun on San Nicolas Island in an area 
teeming with seals, sea lions and marine birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after the commission debated the proposal for more than two 
hours at its meeting in Los Angeles, said Alan Alpers, a spokesman for Point 
Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the Navy wants to test-fire an updated version of its 
Vulcan Phalanx Gatling gun off Navy-owned San Nicolas, which is located south 
of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and about 70 miles west of 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The test involves firing rounds -- measuring about 8 inches in length and 
about 3 inches in diameter -- at a variety of self-propelled and towed aerial 
targets, at a speed of about 4,500 rounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials acknowledge the zone from which the gun will be fired sits 
between two areas on the island where an abundance of marine mammals and birds 
are located, including the endangered southern sea otter and the California 
brown pelican. Officials say these animals may be affected by noise from the 
tests and there is a remote possibility they could be hit by the projectiles.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNTY MOVES ON CLEANUP AT AIRPORT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County will spend $264,712 to clean up hundreds of gallons of fuel 
that leaked from underground tanks used by a now-defunct helicopter firm at the 
Oxnard Airport, the Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel seeped into ground water not used for drinking around the helipad 
owned by Condor Helicopters and Aviation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials believe that the leaks occurred between 1966 and 1986, when the 
company leased land from Ventura County at the airport on Patterson Road near 
West 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the county filed suit against Condor Helicopters ordering it to pay 
damages. The suit is expected to go to trial soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, board members agreed to move forward with cleanup efforts to 
prevent the fuel from leaking into the nearby Oxnard Aquifer, used for drinking 
water. TINA DAUNT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAYOR FILES APPEAL AS AUDITOR CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton on Tuesday appealed a judge's decision to 
disqualify him from running for county auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the judge raised more questions than he gave answers," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge William L. Peck ruled Monday that Stratton's master's 
degree in business administration from Cal Lutheran University does not qualify 
him for the auditor because it was not earned at a school of accountancy. The 
hearing was the result of a lawsuit filed by William Baker, a certified public 
accountant and one of five other candidates for the auditor's job. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for county auditor, state law dictates that a candidate must either 
be a certified public accountant, have served as county auditor controller or 
deputy auditor controller for at least three years, or possess a certificate or 
diploma from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no more schools of accountancy in California, Stratton 
argued that his master's degree in business administration -- including 14 
units in accounting -- qualified him for the position. But Peck did not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton's lawyer, Tom Wise, asked the appeals court to render a decision as 
soon as possible so that county officials can continue to prepare for the 
election. Stratton said he did not know when the 2nd District Court of Appeal 
would hear his case but that it would probably be before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 County election officials are worried that a delay may cause problems in 
printing sample ballots on Monday in order to meet a state-mandated deadline 
for mailing samples to voters. The election will be June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," Stratton said. "I've got a fund-raiser on Friday, and 
I don't know if I'm in the race or not." CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY OKS 2ND CORRIGANVILLE PARK 
ENTRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents near the proposed Corriganville Park have persuaded the 
city to require a second entrance to the park to ease traffic congestion on 
their street. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concerns of residents who live on Smith Road, the main entrance 
to the planned 204-acre park, the City Council has agreed to require developers 
to open a second entrance at Sandalwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandalwood Drive will be extended to the park's western edge when a 
development of 200 homes known as Hope Town is built next to Corriganville 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 During a public hearing before the council vote, Smith Road resident Julie 
Willingham urged the council to require the second entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live out there because we want the seclusion," Willingham said. "We'd like 
a little consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the site of a movie ranch and Wild West amusement park, the Corriganville 
property was purchased jointly in 1988 by the city, the Rancho Simi Recreation 
and Park District and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to mandate the second entrance, overturning a 
vote by the city's Planning Commission last fall to require only the Smith Road 
entrance at the park, located at the southeast corner of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do everything we can to give these people a break from a constant 
traffic flow past their homes," Councilman Bill Davis said. "When the park is 
open, the Sandalwood gate ought to be open." SARA CATANIA

D.A. HIRES ATTORNEY TO INVESTIGATE OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private-practice attorney who specializes in environmental law has been 
hired by the Ventura County district attorney's office to investigate a spill 
of 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil last year into McGrath Lake just north of 
Oxnard.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard attorney Glen M. Reiser said he was awaiting a final report on the 
spill from the California Department of Fish and Game before recommending 
whether criminal charges should be filed against Bush Oil Co. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Brose said the county retained Reiser because of 
his expertise in the field.  
</P>
<P>
 Reiser also worked on the recent Oxnard Shores case, in which residents 
claimed oil contamination beneath their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush report, prepared after months of investigation by Fish and Game Lt. 
Mark Caywood, is completed and awaiting approval from Fish and Game officials 
in Sacramento, Reiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because there are at least four state agencies involved in the case -- the 
State Lands Commission, Fish and Game, the California Department of Parks and 
Recreation and the Regional Water Quality Control Board -- Reiser estimated it 
would be at least next month before he is prepared to make a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 birds and other animals were killed in the spill, which dribbled 
at least 2,000 barrels of heavy crude oil from a leaking Bush Oil pipeline 
before it was discovered by federal officials Christmas morning. JEFF McDONALD

CITY TO PROMOTE USE OF METROLINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard is beginning a full-scale, public relations effort to 
entice commuters to use the new Metrolink service to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved plans to sell commuter train tickets at 
City Hall and authorized the mayor to send letters to various community leaders 
to urge their support in increasing ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter train service, which began April 4 as a response to the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, must attract 100 riders per day to remain economically 
feasible, said Samia Maximous, Oxnard traffic and transportation manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have the 100, it could be closed even before the end of the 
(six-month) emergency period," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Metrolink spokeswoman Tuesday said the Oxnard ridership has averaged just 54 
people a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel M. Lopez said the train service is a valuable addition to transit 
alternatives in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you can enhance your public transit, you're helping the smog and a 
lot of other things," Lopez said. Installing the ticket vending machines at 
City Hall "is designed to make it easier for people to utilize Metrolink," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink may buy back the $70,000 vending machines if the service is 
canceled, Maximous said. 
</P>
<P>
 Round-trip tickets to Los Angeles cost $14, but monthly passes are available 
for $208, Metrolink officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two trains leave for Los Angeles each morning and return each afternoon. JEFF 
McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE SETS HEARING ON NURSES' PAY PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Tuesday refused to stop Ventura County from imposing a 
new compensation plan on nurses, but called on county officials to defend their 
actions at a hearing next month. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the County Board of Supervisors voted to approve the new pay and 
benefits package, Judge Ken W. Riley ordered officials to prepare their legal 
case for a May 4 hearing.He will decide then whether to issue an injunction 
against the county's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Riley left the pay package in place, saying it would cause no 
"irreparable harm" to the Ventura County Medical Center nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses, concerned that the new package gives administrators unprecedented 
latitude for layoffs, said they will return to court immediately if the 
hospital attempts to lay off health care workers before May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Counsel Leroy Smith said the hospital had no plans for 
layoffs before May 4. If cutbacks became necessary, the hospital would notify 
the nurses union in enough time to take their concerns back to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really what we wanted out of this," said Don Nielsen, attorney for the 
California Nurses Assn. "I think we've gained leverage. The judge didn't send 
us packing." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge did reject the nurses' request for a temporary restraining 
order that would have blocked the county from implementing the plan. The 
supervisors approved the measure after declaring that contract negotiations 
with the nurses union had broken down. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the judge preserved the nurses' right to strike, but required three 
days notice of any work action. Union leaders have voted to authorize a strike, 
but say they would rather return to negotiations. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FEE HIKE PROPOSED FOR CITY LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners in Simi Valley could pay up to 28% more for landscaping services 
under a proposal submitted to the City Council to increase fees the city 
charges to prune hedges, plant flowers and water hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to schedule a June 6 public hearing on the proposed 
increases in fees for landscape maintenance in median strips, along roads and 
other common areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the assessments, based on home values, would increase at the low 
end from $26 to $32, with top-end fees for large commercial properties 
increasing from $776 to $899. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the state law last year requiring 45 days advance notice for rate 
hikes prevented the city from raising its fees so residents would be hit with 
two years worth of increases, said John Watring, assistant public works 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he was astounded at the proposed increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems ridiculous to have this kind of increase," Davis said. "It seems 
like everything is increasing at a time when people are in the worst shape 
financially." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester defended the proposed increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is expensive," Koester said. "But it does take that amount to keep the 
landscape up to the level it's been." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels pointed out that of 4,000 notices sent out to 
homeowners alerting them of the proposed increase, the city received only four 
letters of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider that a tremendous public outcry," Mikels said. SARA CATANIA

<P>
 A wholesale compact disc and music video distributor that recently bought a 
$1.3-million Simi Valley warehouse has been granted a $5,600 tax break by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to grant Pacific Coast One-Stop the assistance, 
usually reserved for new construction projects, because the company is making 
$500,000 in improvements to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester urged the council to approve the tax reduction, 
pointing out that the warehouse Pacific Coast bought at 45 W. Easy St. has been 
a constant headache for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is the former home of Travelin' West Textiles, a dyeing facility that 
had a long history of waste-water violations, illegally disgorging up to 
500,000 gallons of polluted water each day for more than a decade before 
closing in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That site has been a problem site and we're actually very thankful that 
Pacific Coast is going ahead with this," Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed, unanimously approving the tax break. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BUDGET CUTS KEEP PUBLIC POOL CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley's only public pool remained closed this spring break for the first 
time in 20 years, another victim of state budget cuts and dwindling local 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Park district officials said they were forced to keep the pool at Rancho Simi 
Community Park closed this week because the park district budget was cut $1.1 
million this year and last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think it's an awful shame," said park district board member 
Debi Schultze. "But it is one of the more costly things the district does." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pool doesn't officially open for the summer season until June 17, 
park officials have opened it for the week of spring break every year since the 
pool was built 20 years ago. This year, they decided to save the $2,500 it 
takes to staff and prepare the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of available lifeguards helped contribute to the decision, said Diana 
Riley, district recreation supervisor. College students usually make extra 
money on their spring breaks by watching the pool. But this year's Simi Valley 
Unified School District spring break fell during a different week from most 
area colleges, making lifeguards hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just decided that the one-week opening was too financially draining," 
Riley said. "But then of course it's beautiful weather all this week." MARY F.

 An autopsy failed to determine the cause of death of a 32-year-old homeless 
man who was found dead in his car at a Thousand Oaks park-and-ride lot, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials are now waiting for the results of toxicology tests to 
show what drugs might have been ingested by Harrison David Droege before he was 
found inside his locked car early Monday. Those results could take up to two 
months, said James Baroni, autopsy assistant.

 Droege's body was wrapped inside a sleeping bag, as if he had fallen asleep 
there. His car was stuffed with clothing and other personal possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators said they found no sign of foul play and nothing to 
indicate that Droege had been killed by another person. His body may have been 
in the car for up to five days before it was discovered by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty much convinced at the scene that I didn't have a crime," said 
Sgt. Mike Barnes of the major crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators will wait for the coroner's office to determine a 
cause of death before doing anything further on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said Droege apparently had been homeless for 
about a year and was living out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Linda Droege, said she was stunned by the news of her brother's 
death. She last spoke with him about two weeks ago when he told her he'd gotten 
a job with a temporary agency doing clerical work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't making sense," she said. "I keep thinking I'm going to get on an 
airplane and go out there and find out what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end he was so ambitious. He said he wanted to get his car fixed in two 
weeks. He was too pumped up to be lying about everything," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Droege, 30, who lives just outside Indianapolis, said she used to allow 
her brother to call her collect until she could no longer afford it. She said 
she occasionally sent him small packages of clothing or envelopes of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Droege said she knew of no health problems that might have led to her 
brother's death. She said he had been living out of his car for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Droege's last known job was with the U.S. Defense Department's Contract Audit 
Agency in Oxnard, where he worked for four years as an auditor. He resigned 
last May for personal reasons, said Phil Rogers, a spokesman for the office.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOT WEATHER SWEEPS THROUGH THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unseasonably warm temperatures in Thousand Oaks and the rest of Ventura County 
on Tuesday sent some residents searching for something cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been packed for the past two days," said Jennifer Alvarez, a clerk at 
Baskin-Robbins 31 ice cream store in Thousand Oaks."Whenever the temperature 
goes up, people just start thinking 'ice cream.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The sunny, hot weather is expected to linger today, with highs in the 80s for 
most parts of the county, said Nick Leivers, a meteorologist with the National 
Weather Service in Oxnard. But a cooling trend will start tonight, when a thick 
marine layer descends over coastal areas during the night and morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Leivers said it reached 86 degrees in Thousand Oaks on Tuesday. Even normally 
cool Point Mugu reached 80 degrees by 1 p.m., Leivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little surprised by how hot it got ourselves," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of a normal sea breeze keeping things cool, the winds have been 
limited to the immediate beach areas," he said. "The rest of us are getting 
what the valleys usually get." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures were expected to cool by seven or eight degrees inland to the 
upper 70s to low 80s and drop by about four degrees to the mid-60s along the 
coast. KAY SAILLANT

CITY EXPECTS REFINANCING WILL SAVE $4.2 MILLION; THOUSAND OAKS: THE DEAL 
INVOLVES CERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION, SIMILAR TO BONDS, ISSUED IN 1988. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Much like homeowners refinancing a mortgage, Thousand Oaks officials will take 
advantage of lower interest rates to save about $4.2 million in city funds over 
the next quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
 The refinancing will not yield a sudden windfall for Thousand Oaks. Rather, 
the city will save roughly $180,000 a year -- about the cost of the DARE drug 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings will come from a complicated refinancing transaction that the City 
Council approved in a unanimous vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction hinges on certificates of participation issued in 1988 to pay 
for construction of the teen and senior centers, the Newbury Park branch 
library and Conejo Creek Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Certificates of participation function almost exactly as bonds do: investors 
put up cash to buy them and thereby inject money into city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with cash, the city can then carry out major projects. Investors reap 
interest for years or decades, and then receive their principle in a lump-sum 
payment when the certificates mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 1988 certificates carry an interest rate of nearly 7.9%, Thousand 
Oaks Finance Director Robert Biery said the city could save money by issuing 
new, lower-interest certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program approved by the council, the city will redeem the old 
certificates now, paying back investors' principle years before the due dates. 
To finance that move, the city will sell new certificates, with an interest 
rate of about 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole transaction, including attorney fees and insurance requirements, 
will cost about $102,000, said Paul Farr, the city's redevelopment associate. 
But officials figure the expenditure will pay off later, as interest rates are 
expected to rise in decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I read it is, we get a better deal and we save some money," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new certificates will be sold in $5,000 blocks during a competitive 
auction April 26. The city will then swiftly repay investors holding 1988 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where they get the takers for these certificates, but our 
advisers should know what the market is," Mayor Elois Zeanah said. "I have to 
simply take this on the wisdom of our staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Confident that the city will receive a solid bond rating, Farr said he 
anticipates no problem selling the certificates. By law, investors do not pay 
state or federal income taxes on the interest, so certificates can be 
attractive long-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who buy these want tax-free money and an A-rated city to back it 
up," Councilman Frank Schillo said before Tuesday night's meeting. "We continue 
to be a good, fiscally sound city -- we've never defaulted on anything, and 
we're in the black." 
</P>
<P>
 The new certificates of participation, like those issued in 1988, will total 
nearly $16 million. That's enough money to pay for the senior and youth 
centers, the branch library and the park -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance director Biery told the council that the leftover funds amount to 
about $1.5 million. That sum would have been available if the city maintained 
the 1988 certificates, and will still be free under this year's refinancing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may use the $1.5-million reserve pot to help pay for repairs at 
the earthquake-battered Thousand Oaks Library, officials said. A collapsed 
ceiling and burst water pipe caused about $2 million worth of damage during the 
January Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is scheduled to reopen next week, but officials have still not 
determined how much money the city will put up and how much will be covered by 
insurance or federal relief payments.

DEVELOPER SEEKS LOAN FROM SIMI; HOUSING: GRIFFIN INDUSTRIES WILL REQUEST 
$750,000 TO HELP PAY FOR 70 LOW-INCOME CONDOS IN 500-HOME PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Simi Valley developer planning a 500-home complex on the city's west end 
will ask city leaders today for a $750,000 loan to help pay for low-income 
condominiums at the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal by Griffin Industries is a scaled-down version of the developer's 
request for a $1-million, interest-free loan that was rejected by the city's 
Affordable Housing Subcommittee in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Judy Mikels and Bill Davis, who make up the subcommittee, 
balked at the no-interest part of the initial request and said they did not 
want to tie up so much housing money in one project. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of fiscal year 1994-95, the city will have only $710,000 in 
low-income housing funds not already committed to other projects, Deputy City 
Manager Brian Gabler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of that money comes from a state-mandated program requiring city 
redevelopment agencies to set aside 20% of their revenue for affordable 
housing, Gabler said. 
</P>
<P>
 To fully grant Griffin's request, the city would have to tap into other 
revenue sources, such as the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said she would like to see the low-income housing built, but is 
hesitant to grant Griffin the amount of city funding requested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still iffy, but it looks a lot better," Mikels said. "My main concern 
right now is finding the funds, because it's still a lot of money that's going 
to be tied up for a long time, and I don't want other projects to lose out 
because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Griffin's new request, the developer is offering to pay 6% interest and 
build 70 low-income homes, rather than the 96 proposed under the original plan, 
Vice President Richard Niec said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidized units, which would be offered at about $30,000 below market 
value to low-income buyers for 30 years, would be spread throughout the 
development, Niec said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city does not approve the new proposal, Griffin will probably withdraw 
the offer and build the development without any low-income housing, Niec said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone back and looked at the level of assistance and have decided that 
this would pretty much be our minimum offer," Niec said. "Without the city's 
assistance, we would probably look at doing the project without an affordable 
component." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-acre Simi Village development, south of Los Angeles Avenue between 
Sinaloa Road and 1st Street, is slated for completion in 1998, if approved by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the city has contributed more than $1.6 million to two 
housing developments for low-income residents, said Dulce Conde-Sierra, Simi 
Valley's deputy director of housing and special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the city-subsidized projects, the recently opened Heywood Gardens 
apartment complex for senior citizens, is reserved entirely for low-income 
residents. Monthly rent on its 75 units ranges from $0 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The other project, a 22-townhouse development being built by Cabrillo Economic 
Development Corp., will cater to residents who earn 75% or less of the county 
median income. The median income is about $39,700 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Affordable Housing Subcommittee approves Griffin's loan proposal, the 
matter will be sent to the full City Council for consideration. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Affordable Housing Subcommittee meets at 5:30 p.m. today at Simi 
Valley City Hall, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road.

THOUSAND OAKS PLANNERS OK HILLSIDE TOWNHOUSE PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: SOME 
COMMISSIONERS QUESTION IF THE FIVE-ACRE SITE IS BIG ENOUGH FOR THE 45 UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 5 1/2 hours of fierce debate, Thousand Oaks planners approved a hillside 
housing project early Tuesday morning despite concerns that the 45-townhouse 
development was too large for its five-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 If zoning for the project is approved by the City Council, builders will begin 
constructing the two-, three- and four-unit townhomes on the rolling green 
acreage by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of Monday night's session, however, the outlook for the project 
looked bleak. The Planning Commission appeared to be stacked against the 
proposal as the public hearing closed, and it was not until the 3-2 vote was 
read that the developers knew they had prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers left the roller-coaster session jubilant with their success, 
but disconcerted with the process that had them pleading for their project at 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 During their presentations, representatives from Los Angeles-based developer 
Patriot Homes, Inc. chided the commission for "picking apart" a project that 
had lived up to all city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are with nobody opposing us, with the city staff supporting us, and 
still you are saying it's not good enough," said Francisco Behr, the project's 
architect. "I'm concerned, for the sake of the city, that no one will ever be 
able to satisfy you." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the commissioners agreed that the project fit the city's standards, 
but remained concerned that it was too dense for the five-acre parcel on East 
Hillcrest Drive near Skyline Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've done a lot of good things," said Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter, who 
voted with Commissioner Linda Parks against the project. "I just think you've 
tried to do a little too much with the space on the site. It has been pushed to 
the extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Forrest Frields also expressed concern that the development had 
too many buildings and too much pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just look at this, and I see that it's geared toward families, and I 
wonder, where are the children going to play?" Frields said. "There just is a 
total lack of open space." 
</P>
<P>
 But at 12:15 a.m., it was Frields who broke the deadlock, casting the final 
vote in favor of the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he said he still questioned his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was torn and I'm still torn," Frields said as he left City Hall. "I'm 
afraid I'll be tossing and turning over this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they were particularly concerned about the project because 
the area along East Hillcrest Drive is in transition. 
</P>
<P>
 The lot where the development would be built is overgrown, rolling land, paved 
over in parts, and occupied by two small structures -- a house and a two-story 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 While an office complex has been built nearby, and another residential 
development is a few lots away, most of Hillcrest Drive is lined with 
single-family houses that have been built before the widening of the street 
from two lanes to four. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of lots on the north side of Hillcrest Drive is expected to be 
developed with medium-density projects such as condominiums and townhouses, 
city staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This development really will set the tone for the area," Carpenter said. "And 
I think this project is just a little too much for what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Parks said she feared a crowded development would forever change 
the feel of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we allow high-density development on (the north) side of the street, we 
can't expect that the other side of the street won't follow," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers, along with Commissioners Irving Wasserman and Mervyn Kopp, 
urged Frields to see the benefits of such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this project is a showpiece," said David Schwartzman, the president 
of Patriot Homes. "If this project is turned down, I don't see how the property 
will ever be developed, and you will be left with a blighted space of land." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to avoiding construction on the rear slope of the land and 
donating 1.3 acres of the property to the Conejo Open Space Conservation 
Agency, Patriot Homes agreed to pay for the restoration of land that had been 
damaged by earlier grading. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the development, Schwartzman said, is not to provide mansions 
for people but to provide homes for first-time buyers and young professionals. 
He said the townhomes would be priced in the $200,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Wasserman said that type of development is missing in Thousand 
Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think despite the concerns raised by Commissioner Frields, this is an 
important project," Wasserman said. "It's a project which is exactly at the 
level needed in the community today."

OXNARD BOY, 12, STRUCK BY AMTRAK TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old Oxnard boy, wearing headphones as he crossed a railroad trestle 
Tuesday, failed to hear the frantic warning of a train's horn and was struck by 
an Amtrak engine, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Moraga remained in Ventura County Medical Center on Tuesday night after 
the accident, which occurred about 2:30 p.m. At the family's request, the 
hospital declined to release his condition, but police said he appeared to be 
in "reasonably good condition" when taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron was walking on a bridge that crosses the Ventura River near Seaside 
Wilderness Park when the eastbound train approached from behind, traveling 
about 45 m.p.h. After seeing the boy, the engineer began slowing the train and 
blowing the horn, said Sgt. Gary Atkinson of the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely not the train's fault," Atkinson said. "He was on his air 
horn the whole time trying to get the kid's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron's father and another child were also walking on the trestle, but managed 
to step to the side and let the train pass. Aaron, apparently listening to 
music on his headphones, did not hear the train at first, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy's father apparently was not close enough to warn him. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aaron finally realized the engine was bearing down on him, he began to 
run. But the train, which had slowed down considerably, still struck him and 
tossed him to the side of the trestle, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not plan to press charges against Amtrak or against the boy, who was 
breaking the law by crossing the trestle, Atkinson said. It is a law that's 
hard to enforce, Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, right after this (happened), a whole family with bicycles came 
over the trestle," he said.

SOME UNINSURED QUAKE LOSSES ARE DEDUCTIBLE; TAXES: THE TEMBLOR WAS DECLARED A 
FEDERAL DISASTER, SO VICTIMS CAN DECLARE DAMAGES ON THEIR 1993 OR '94 RETURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Friday the deadline for filing income taxes, the disaster-weary can at 
least look forward to some tax relief: Uninsured casualty losses from the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake -- as well as from last fall's fires and mudslides -- 
are deductible on individuals' federal and state returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because the Northridge quake was declared a federal disaster, 
victims of the disaster can choose to take those losses on either their 1993 or 
1994 returns. That is a major advantage for people who expect their 1994 
incomes to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But doing all this additional figuring can take time -- which is why many 
people are expected to ask the Internal Revenue Service and California 
Franchise Tax Board for filing extensions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley and Fillmore, the two Ventura County cities hardest hit by the 
quake, tax preparers said the disaster has left many victims scrambling to file 
extensions or take advantage of damage-related tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have had other things on their minds, so the information is sort of 
dribbling in," said Beverly Gage, a bookkeeper who has run her Fillmore tax 
business for 41 years. "And a lot of my clients are still assessing damage, so 
they're going to hold off until 1994 to file for deductions." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley tax preparer Bud Ganowsky said about 20% of his clients have no 
earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of factors to weigh when you're deciding whether to take the 
deductions in '93 or '94, things like income and inflation," Ganowsky said. 
"But sometimes it just comes down to time -- do you have all the information 
now, do you want to file an extension, or are you willing to wait another 
year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ganowsky said his clients are about evenly split between those who are taking 
the deductions now and those who are waiting for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Many taxpayers have lost important documents that they need to file their 
1040s because the quake damaged their houses or local post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Others will have to file extension requests with the IRS (Form 4868), because 
"they are still waiting for the simplest of records," one tax preparer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those records may include W-2s from their employers or 1099s showing 
investment income. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, tax experts said, the government expects taxpayers to 
reconstruct 1993 income and deductions -- which can be done using copies of 
checks written throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even figuring out your deductible casualty loss can be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you have to get a real estate appraiser to tell you what the value of 
your property was before the disaster and after," said Alan Kennan, a tax 
partner in the Los Angeles office of accounting firm Grant Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance payments must be subtracted from that tentative loss, producing a 
net loss figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch: To be deductible, casualty losses must exceed 10% of 
your adjusted gross income -- basically income before itemized deductions -- 
plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has introduced federal legislation to 
make uninsured losses 100% deductible for victims of declared national 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) has authored a 
bill that would provide identical relief for disaster victims on their state 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither bill is expected to pass by Friday, spokesmen for Berman and Rosenthal 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the proposed legislation is enacted later, taxpayers entitled to 
the bigger write-offs could file amended returns. The tax breaks would apply to 
losses on declared disasters that occurred on or after Jan. 17, the day of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding whether to take the limited loss that is available now this year or 
next year may be easy for people faced with extensive rebuilding -- but still 
waiting for disaster aid.

 "The question is how badly do you need cash now?" said Kennan. "Fixing your 
house may be more important than waiting a year to get a bigger deduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Requesting an extension to sort all this out before filing taxes can provide 
nearly six months' reprieve -- to Oct. 14 this year, since Oct. 15 falls on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with a filing extension, the IRS and the California Franchise Tax 
Board still expect checks for about 90% of the amount owed to be in the mail by 
midnight this Friday, April 15. And although it is possible to get an extension 
for paying federal taxes, it is certainly not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it's absolutely impossible to even borrow to pay your federal taxes, 
you can file an "Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax" (form 
1127) by midnight Friday. Accountants say the IRS usually will agree to 
negotiate some kind of payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The state does not grant extensions per se, said Franchise Tax Board spokesman 
Jim Shepherd. But he said people with quake damage should make the state aware 
of their situation.

PARQUE PITCHES CRESCENTA VALLEY INTO FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle for first place in the Pacific League turned out to be a contest 
between two of the league's best pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High's Jim Parque went up against Arcadia's Dam Tyman and it 
was Parque who kept his composure down the stretch, leading the Falcons to a 
2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander pitched a complete game and improved his record to 6-1. 
He gave up five hits, struck out 11 and walked four. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left the Falcons (9-3 overall) atop the league standings at 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim really battled and battled today," Crescenta Valley Coach Tony Zarrillo 
said. "I don't know that he was feeling all that good, but even when he's not 
at his best he's such a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyman (6-1) suffered his first loss. The senior right-hander gave up eight 
hits and struck out six. He walked only two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fine high school game," Arcadia Coach John Meiers said. "The bottom 
line is that they got a couple of clutch hits and we didn't. That was the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 1-0, in the top of the sixth, Crescenta Valley scored two runs on 
third baseman Brian Peterson's two-out triple. Jason Griffiths, who had 
doubled, and Natt Putra, who had walked, scored on the decisive hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to make contact," Peterson said. "I just wanted to hit the 
ball hard. It was a high fastball and I really got a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia (13-2, 5-1) scored in the bottom of the second when George Mendia 
drove in Jason Cly from second base with a double to right field. Cly had 
doubled to center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this would be a low-scoring game and I told the kids that before we 
left," Zarrillo said. "Both teams really battled. It turned out exactly like we 
thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior shortstop Kirk Hagge went three for three with one walk for the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagge switched to catcher in the third inning when starter John French was 
ejected after a play at the plate. French blocked the plate to stop Arcadia's 
Tim Urquidi from scoring but he smacked Urquidi with his glove after the out 
was recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Urquidi was ejected because he made no attempt to slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether that play at the plate was a turning point for us," 
Zarrillo said. "It might have done something for us."

PITCHING-POOR CS NORTHRIDGE GETS CRUSHED; COLLEGE BASEBALL: PEPPERDINE HAMMERS 
MATADORS, 18-4, WITH NINE RUNS IN NINTH AGAINST DEPLETED CSUN STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman Jason Shanahan didn't need a compass, road map or canteen to 
find his way to the pitcher's mound. He didn't need smelling salts afterward, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The same couldn't be said for some of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan made only his second start in two years on the mound and pitched 
respectably, but Pepperdine hammered two relievers and rolled over Cal State 
Northridge, 18-4, Tuesday in a nonconference game at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, who had pitched one inning of relief all season, was thrust into a 
starting role because of injuries. A little 3-in-1 oil in the ol' arm socket 
and he was ready to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he remembered where the mound was located. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found my way out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan gave up a three-run homer in the first to David Newhan, but not much 
thereafter. By the time Shanahan's three-inning stint was complete, Pepperdine 
held a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With starting pitchers John Najar and Keven Kempton out for the season with 
injuries and relievers Evan Howland and James Hines sidelined with sore arms, 
Shanahan (0-1) got the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to get him a little experience," Coach Bill Kernen said. "Because 
we're going to be using him here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 The next there likely will be this weekend in Hawaii, where Northridge (18-19) 
begins a three-game Western Athletic Conference series on Friday night. If the 
results are comparable to Tuesday, Kernen might make the team swim home. 
</P>
<P>
 Relievers Rick Orr and Jason Vargas, part of a shrinking contingent of six 
healthy Matador pitchers, each pitched three innings against the Waves. The 
results were disappointing and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Solo homers by Joey Arnold in the third and Keyaan Cook in the fourth helped 
Northridge close to within 3-2, but matters got out of hand in a hurry. 
Leading, 4-2, Pepperdine scored four times in the sixth against Orr to pull 
away and then bombed the Matadors with a nine-run ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Waves leading, 9-4, with two out in the ninth, Vargas seemingly had 
retired the side when third baseman Tyler Nelson committed his third error of 
the game. Two runs scored on the play, and the next seven batters banged out 
hits to make it a laugher. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the inning was over, Pepperdine (23-14) sent 15 batters to the plate 
and racked up 10 hits. All were season-highs against the Matador staff. All 
nine runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated to do that to (Vargas)," Kernen said, "but I literally had nobody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was it? Tony Treul and Keith McDonald entered the game as 
pinch-hitters in the sixth for Pepperdine and combined for seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors surrendered season highs in runs and hits (23) and fell below 
.500 for the first time since they were 9-10 on March 9.

BOROWSKI LEAVES ANAHEIM FOR WALNUT

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim football Coach Todd Borowski has resigned to coach at Walnut High, 
Borowski said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Borowski led the Colonists to the Southern Section Division VI quarterfinals 
in the last two seasons. Anaheim was 15-9 under Borowski. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season in 1992, Borowski led the Colonists to a 9-3 record and a 
share of the Orange League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Colonists reached the playoffs again in 1993, new facilities at 
Walnut and an opportunity to coach with former Cal State Fullerton classmate 
Ron Sparicino helped persuade him to move. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; TRABUCO HILLS BOUNCES CENTURY IN 11TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Brian Costello, Trabuco Hills' No. 8 batter, singled in a run in the bottom of 
the 11th inning to give the Mustangs a 3-2 victory over Century in a Pacific 
Coast League baseball game Tuesday in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the 11th, Dan Delfium singled and stole second.Costello worked 
the count to three and one before singling down the right-field line for the 
winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello played a part in each of the Mustangs runs. In the third inning, he 
tripled home Delfium and scored on a sacrifice fly by Gerry Beckham to give 
Trabuco Hills (11-5, 6-0 in league) a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Century (11-4, 4-2), which had gotten the lead-off hitter on base in five of 
the first six innings, tied the score in the sixth. The Centurions loaded the 
bases on an infield single by Art Tapia, a double by Jerry Ochoa and a walk to 
Christian Duran. Mustang reliever Ryan Kelley entered and got Ramiro Torres to 
hit into a double play, scoring Tapia. A single by Richard Cevallos tied the 
score before Kelley got the last out. Kelley (6-1) allowed three hits in six 
innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills had a chance to win the game in the seventh when it loaded the 
bases, but a fly out by Matt Rechner ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams meet for a third time this season on Friday at Century. MIKE

SUNSET LEAGUE BASEBALL; ODD-BALL RALLY CAPS EDISON'S VICTORY OVER FOUNTAIN 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More twists and turns certainly await Edison's baseball team in that amusement 
park called the Sunset League. But the Chargers have enjoyed the ride so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers rallied for an 8-4 victory over Fountain Valley, Orange County's 
No. 1-ranked team, Tuesday at Edison. It was just another day in a league where 
nearly everyone is a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could lose four games in this league and still win it," Charger second 
baseman Matt Barcellona said. "This league is weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Barcellona added a few oddities of his own, a wind-blown triple and ricochet 
double to bring the Chargers back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (15-2, 3-2) were breezing along, leading, 2-0, through five 
innings. Pitcher Jason Liuzzi had nibbled and teased, hitting corners here and 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi allowed only two hits heading into the sixth, then tired. He was 
relieved by Brian Ponchak with two outs and two on. Barcellona then lofted his 
wind-aided triple to center to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Haugen singled to give the Chargers (11-4, 3-2) the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Barcellona's second big hit in as many league games. He won the Marina 
game a week ago Friday with a three-run double in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was Barcellona again," Coach Paul Harrell said. "He seems to be the 
only guy hitting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Barcellona did again in the seventh, hitting a two-run double off the head of 
Fountain Valley right fielder Geoff Wilson. Wilson appeared to lose the ball in 
the sun and was knocked to the ground. He left the game but was not seriously 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit keyed a five-run inning that gave the Chargers some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen anything like that," Harrell said. "That was strange." 
</P>
<P>
 But strange has been the normal for the Chargers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 6, Ocean View 4 -- Jeremy Vidales hit the game-winning double 
down the right-field line to score James Roberts in the bottom of the sixth for 
No. 4 Huntington Beach (12-4, 3-1). Teammate Craig Daedelow had three hits, 
including a double, an RBI and a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 7, Santa Ana 2 -- Tim Humble had pinch-hit two-run triple in the sixth 
inning to lead Marina (13-5, 3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 5, Westminster 4 -- Brian Greene picked off the potential tying run 
from second base in the sixth. Kirk Rossi went two for two with an RBI for 
Servite (8-6-1, 2-3).

<P>
 Jennifer Slaney provided the angst and the RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney, a junior transfer from Downey High who is batting .121, sliced a 
single down the right-field line in the fourth inning to score the run that 
gave second-ranked Los Alamitos a 1-0 victory over No. 1 Cypress on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of Slaney's two hits off freshman Stacy Silva (8-2), who pitched a 
four-hitter but had little offensive support. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions (9-3) had their chances, though, beginning with Slaney's 
two-base error in right field to open the game. That caused some anxiety for 
her teammates, including winning pitcher Debbie Wilson (9-1), whose double 
preceded Slaney's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kim Lumsdaine was called out for stepping on the plate while trying to 
sacrifice Christa Saindon to third and pitching around Julie Adams, Cypress 
looked as if it was in business. But Wilson, who gave up only two hits, struck 
out the fourth and fifth batters. MARTIN HENDERSON

COLLEGE SIGNING ROUNDUP; WOODBRIDGE'S OENNING TO SIGN WITH UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodbridge High's Jamie Oenning will become the first girls' Division I 
college basketball player from the school when she signs today with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning, a first team Times' All-County selection who averaged 13.5 points, 
4.7 assists and shot 47% from the field, led Woodbridge to a 32-1 record and 
the State Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
 With Oenning as the team's only senior starter, Woodbridge won the Southern 
Section Division II-AA girls' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the first day of the late period for signing letters of intent. The 
late period lasts through Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which will play Division I next season, will get two 
Magnolia boys' basketball players. Frank Henderson, a 6-3 off guard who 
averaged 17.1 points, and Brandon Hearvey, a 6-6 forward who averaged 15.1 
points, will sign letters of intent today, Sentinel Coach Al Walin said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donnie Bladow and Juan Garcia, who have led Rancho Santiago in rushing yards 
the last two seasons, said they will play football at four-year colleges next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bladow, a 5-11, 215-pound fullback who ran for 920 yards and eight touchdowns 
last season at Villa Park, plans to play at Redlands. Garcia, a 5-11, 185-pound 
tailback from Century High, is among the first recruits at Chapman, which will 
field its first football team since 1932 in the fall.

 Loewe, an All-Southern Section selection at Woodbridge High in 1992, chose 
Mesa State over Colorado Christian, Seattle Pacific, Alaska Anchorage, Alaska 
Fairbanks, Southern California College, Westmont, Redlands and Whittier.

 Less was more for Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn as the Sailors, ranked sixth 
in Orange County, defeated ninth-ranked Corona del Mar, 15-13, 12-15, 15-9, 
15-10, in a Sea View League boys' volleyball match Tuesday at Corona del Mar 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I did too much coaching in the first two games," Glenn said, "instead 
of keeping my mouth shut and letting the kids play." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Vallely, who split time between setter and outside hitter, had 12 kills 
and 39 assists to lead Newport Harbor (8-2, 7-0 in league), which broke open a 
match that was close early. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserves Ramy Shoukry and Paul Root also gave the Sailors a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoukry and Root had four blocks each to help slow Corona del Mar's attack. 
Shoukry also finished with nine kills and Root had six. 
</P>
<P>
 "That must have been the match of the season for Ramy," Corona del Mar Coach 
Joey Fuschetti said. "We played well but Newport Harbor played better." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Hoppe had 21 kills and four blocks, Brian Coleman had 15 kills, and 
Brad Callahan had 10 for the Sea Kings (7-2, 5-2). But Newport Harbor won with 
better balance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Vallely, Shoukry and Root, Wes Badorek (13 kills), Mitch McCoy 
(11), and Greg Slick (10) also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the teams split the first two games, Slick had four kills to help the 
Sailors grab a 9-1 lead in Game 3. Corona del Mar never got closer than 14-9, 
and McCoy blocked Hoppe on game point. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 4, Corona del Mar trailed, 10-9, but Newport Harbor scored five of the 
last six points to win the match. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: HART ROCKS PEBBLE BEACH FRONT NINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hart plays its home golf matches at Vista Valencia Golf Course, a short layout 
that will never be confused with Pebble Beach Golf Links. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians fired a scintillating five-man total of 198 over the front 
nine at Pebble Beach on Monday to defeat Carmel Valley by a whopping 44 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Pebble Beach, site of several U.S. Opens as well as a regular stop on the PGA 
Tour, has brought more than a few top professionals to their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart had three players -- Steve Farris, Jason Semelsberger and Dave Trovato -- 
shoot 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Semelsberger is a sophomore and Trovato and Farris are juniors. Senior Spencer 
Hill recorded four birdies and shot 40. Trovato was even par before he 
double-bogeyed the ninth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive stuff. Coach Dennis Ford gave the team with some nuggets of wisdom 
on how to handle the course. 
</P>
<P>
 He instructed with his golfers to concentrate on their game, not the 
million-dollar amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of time saying, 'Look at the golf ball until you've hit it, 
then admire the scenery,' " Ford said.

 In a week when the Saugus baseball team went 5-0-1 in five days, shortstop 
Danny Cato put up monstrous numbers. He had 11 hits in 20 at-bats, raising his 
batting average from .323 to .412. He drove in 11 runs, scored 11, hit two 
doubles and belted three home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cato, a senior, is 5-foot-6, 155 pounds. Asked about the sudden surge in 
power, he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from God," he said. "I couldn't hit the ball on my own this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cato now has four home runs.

 Saugus Coach Doug Worley just got his 300th career victory. So how did he 
celebrate? Did he go to Disneyland? No, better. He's taking a Jamaican cruise 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, who got No. 300 against Cajon in the Coachella Valley tournament last 
week, said he didn't plan it this way. His wife insisted on a Spring Break 
vacation this year; the timing was coincidental. This is the first vacation for 
Worley in 23 seasons of coaching. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Mistaken Identity 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham high jumper James Lincoln and the Braves' distance medley relay 
team of Ismael Castellanos, Marcos Aguilar, Jose Torres and Richard Rubio 
didn't perform as well as hoped for in Saturday's Arcadia Invitational, but 
Coach Scott King wasn't too concerned about their performances, not after what 
they went through before the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 King, the five Birmingham athletes and assistant Kertic Carruth were a few 
blocks from Arcadia High at approximately 5:15 p.m. Saturday when King noticed 
several police cars in his rear-view mirrors with their lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring that the police must be headed somewhere else, he pulled over. When 
the cars stopped 30 to 40 meters in back of the van he was driving, King got 
out to see what was happening and heard the distinct sound of rifles cocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the guys said, 'You make another move like that and we're going to 
blow your brains out,' " King said. "They told me to get back in the van, turn 
off the engine and throw the keys out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 After following those instructions, King was told to get out of the van, clasp 
his hands above his head and walk backward slowly toward the police cars where 
he was handcuffed. One by one, Carruth and the five athletes went through the 
same routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The van was searched for weapons, and after none were found, they were 
released and given a police escort to Arcadia High, where the meet was in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that the police never explained to him what was going on, although 
he gathered from listening to the radio in the police car that a report had 
been made about the driver of a van brandishing a gun at a nearby gas station, 
where King had filled up on the way to the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be a police officer in this society," King said. "But I 
think they might have over-reacted." EAST VALLEY LEAGUE

 Driving a Hugo 
</P>
<P>
 Poly baseball Coach Chuck Schwal knew junior pitcher Hugo De La Torre was 
special, but he never expected this. Schwal listed De La Torre as his third 
pitcher before the season, but claimed the right-hander would be a "darkhorse," 
an unexpected winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, De La Torre (7-0) just happens to be the winningest pitcher 
in the region. He had his 23-inning scoreless streak snapped in a Las Vegas 
tournament game two weeks ago, but has given up only one earned run in 38 1/3 
innings for a 0.18 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't overpower anybody, but he hits his spots," Schwal said. "He throws 
a knuckle that drops and his curve for a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Torre, who has struck out 26, has allowed 21 hits and six runs. ALPHA 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Streak Snapped 
</P>
<P>
 An incredible winning streak came to a halt last week, but senior right-hander 
Matt Hernandez showed little emotion about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's 15-game winning streak, which dated to his sophomore season, ended 
last week when Warren of Downey defeated L.A. Baptist, 8-6, in the fifth-place 
game of the Gladstone tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (4-1), who has a 1.60 ERA, allowed 11 hits in the complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even know if he knew about (the streak)," Coach Mark Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who is attracting interest from Cal Lutheran, went 10-0 last year 
and won the final outing of his sophomore season. MARMONTE LEAGUE

 Youth Catching Up 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo softball Coach Darwin Tolzin knew it was a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 When a team starts seven freshmen and sophomores, the inexperience is sure to 
show sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo (10-3), the only team to beat Simi Valley this year, played solid 
softball -- until last week. The Scorpions committed five errors -- not to 
mention several mental mistakes -- and lost to Thousand Oaks, 5-0. The Lancers 
ran all over Camarillo, stealing seven bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying all along we're young and it all finally jumped out at us at 
one time," Tolzin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the embarrassing loss, Tolzin asked his players if they wanted to have a 
Saturday practice to brush up on fundamentals. He wasn't surprised by the 
answer. "They all said, 'Yes, we don't want to get beat, 5-0, again.' "

 Shortstop Johnny Oliveras drove in nine runs for Channel Islands in a 22-8 
victory against Royal. Oliveras' RBI total was one short of the Ventura County 
record of 10, set by Westlake's Mike Lieberthal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just hit every pitch hard," Coach Al Tarazon said of Oliveras. "He had a 
line-drive stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliveras, who raised his average 100 points in the game, had two singles, two 
doubles and a 400-foot grand slam to center field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Coach Dan Maye, mulling the fact that his team walked eight, hit two and 
made seven errors in the 22-8 loss to Channel Islands said: "We feel lucky we 
only gave up 22."

 Agoura Coach Bryan Maloney got a Gatorade and shaving cream shower after the 
Chargers' beat Lompoc, 1-0, to snap a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 What, might you ask, was shaving cream doing in the dugout? 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Bruce Beck brought it to use in a pregame prank intended to loosen 
up the players. First baseman Cory Fish was a victim. He wound up with shaving 
cream in his glove. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley freshman David Krewson, who hit a home run in his varsity debut 
Friday against Agoura, was not only Pioneer player to reward Coach Mike 
Scyphers for giving him an opportunity. Outfielder Brian Wall, a reserve, 
started and had two hits, and Nathan Celusta, a pitcher who doesn't usually 
hit, drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said Simi Valley players have a tradition of debuting well against 
Agoura. Standout third baseman Ryan Hankins went four for five as a freshman in 
his debut against Agoura. Last season, Jeff Michael made his first varsity 
appearance with five RBIs against the Chargers.

 Throw Softly 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme came back to win three games at the San Luis Obispo tournament after 
losing its opener last weekend, and the primary reason was Sergio Casarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Casarez pitched a four-hit shutout against El Segundo on Friday. He came back 
to throw three more innings Saturday, picking up the victory against St. 
Ignatius of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Casarez, a sophomore right-hander, has pitched well most of the season, 
compiling a record of 3-3 with a 3.16 ERA. He beat Hart in the Westside 
tournament and pitched a six-hitter in a 2-1 loss to Rio Mesa. And he does it 
with nothing but control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is 120 pounds and has arms like pencils," Coach Reg Welker said. 
"He's got the gravity changeup. It drops from lack of speed." GOLDEN LEAGUE

 A Smash Hit 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill Coach Mike Neilson liked what he saw of junior Kyle Goss' hitting 
last summer, though as a sophomore, Goss only pitched sporadically and did not 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him hitting in American Legion, so when he came out in September, I 
said, 'I'll give you a shot to swing the bat,' " Neilson said. "He's certainly 
proved worthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Goss, who plays third base when not pitching, is hitting .551.

 Littlerock's top starting pitcher, senior right-hander Jesse Silva, was 
recently dismissed from the team for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bernie Kyman would not specify why Silva was dismissed, but acknowledged 
that Silva's departure would leave a hole in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, Kyman can call on senior Robert Reed, who has appeared in 12 of the 
team's 14 games. Reed is 4-2 with a 2.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been great," Kyman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed did pitch poorly in two appearances in the Rowland tournament in late 
March and Littlerock lost its four tournament games by a combined score of 
45-18, but Reed and his teammates have since rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed gave up only one run in 10 innings last week, as Littlerock beat Highland 
and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the tournament, we were just a pathetic team," Kyman said. "If people read 
it in the paper, they figured the old Littlerock is back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (last week's victories) certainly woke some people up."

 The leader in earned-run average among Southern Section pitchers after the

 Tough Call 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's volleyball team thought for an instant it had won a key five-game match 
against Chatsworth on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreadors were ahead, 14-10, in the fifth game and serving for the 
victory. As they were about to set the ball for the possible winning spike, a 
referee ruled that a Chatsworth player went under the net, a violation that 
would have given Taft the point, and the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Play was stopped and the Toreadors thought the match was over. 
</P>
<P>
 But the head referee was unsure of the call, and ruled the point be replayed. 
Chatsworth won the point and and came back to win the decisive game, 16-14, 
knocking Taft (7-3, 5-2 in conference play) out of a sole possession of second 
place. Now both Chatsworth and Taft are two full games behind front-runner 
Granada Hills, (6-0 in conference play), with only four matches to play, 
virtually assuring Granada Hills of the conference title.

 Chatsworth junior pitcher Oscar Bocanegra entered Friday's game against 
Cleveland with a 5.48 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 The number dropped to a respectable 2.93 after Bocanegra took a no-hitter into 
the seventh inning, allowing only an infield hit in that inning before being 
relieved. PACIFIC LEAGUE

 Back in Action 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover baseball Coach Bob Cooper is anxious to get back on the field. Cooper 
hurt his back two weeks ago lifting a handicapped student at school and hasn't 
coached since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat on the bench in a couple of games over the weekend, but I really miss 
being out there," Cooper said. "I really miss practicing with the team and 
hitting ground balls." 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a while before Cooper can do that, however. He's only about 50% 
recovered and still experiences pain. In the meantime assistant Jim Delzell is 
running the team.

 Making a Move 
</P>
<P>
 The Chaminade baseball team is on a roll after winning five of six games. 
Catcher Brandon Gray leads the Eagles with a .442 batting average. He has not 
struck out in 43 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching has also played a huge role in the Eagles' success. The team ERA is 
2.21 and sophomore Gabe Crecion has a 1.70 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pitching has been out of this world," Coach Dave Desmond said. "Teams are 
hitting .209 against us. It's been incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade's (9-6) hitting will improve when Adam Crecion, Gabe's older 
brother, returns to the lineup this week. The senior catcher broke his nose in 
a collision March 18 and was initially expected to be out for the remainder of 
the season. He leads the team with a .455 batting average.

</P>
<P>
 First-year Buckley baseball Coach Dan Gilmartin expected a get acquainted year 
without the burden of big expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the loss of graduated star Taryll Jackson and only four returning 
players from last year's league championship team, the approach seemed 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an 8-4 victory in their league opener over favorite Oakwood last 
week, Gilmartin and the Griffins (6-4 overall) are thinking about repeating. 
"We've had solid pitching," Martin said. "Our goal now is to win the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Brim (2-2, 2.28 ERA) a transfer from Montclair Prep, Keith Armstrong 
(1-2, 2.33) and T.J. Jackson (2-0, 2.21), Taryll's sophomore brother, have kept

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: TENNIS HURT BY DISREGARD FOR RULE 
GOVERNING EXPENSE MONEY IN PRO EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 College tennis is in quite a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in November's issue of Tennis magazine claimed that whenever 
Miami's Bertrand Madsen needed money, he simply went to France and played in a 
couple of tournaments, raking in as much as $7,000 in "expense money" in three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an apparent violation of an NCAA rule governing amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was brought to the attention of Miami's compliance officer, Craig 
Angelos, who reported the violation to the NCAA, adding that he believed the 
problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the NCAA asked schools across the nation to investigate their 
players and determine the manner in which they have received money while 
playing in professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cases are not as severe as Madsen's. He received $29,000 in 
expense money in professional tournaments the past three years and lost his 
college eligibility because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, countless players across the country -- including players at USC and 
UCLA -- have been declared temporarily ineligible by their schools in the last 
week. Most have sat out two matches. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the controversy are conflicting rules, one by the NCAA, the 
other by the United States Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA rule says, in essence, players cannot receive more expense money than 
they would receive as prize money for a first-round loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The USTA says amateur players can receive expense money for as many rounds as 
they stay alive in a professional tournament, as long as the money is 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many players, using the USTA rule, took expense money as they advanced through 
professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 So why didn't the schools' compliance officers, whose job it is to know the 
NCAA rules, ever realize what was going on? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a question of people not knowing about the NCAA rule," 
said Judith Holland, UCLA associate athletic director. "(Administrators) didn't 
know that tennis tournaments were being run in that fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 But coaches knew, and they ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody did," said Bill Zaima, UCLA women's tennis coach. "It has always 
been an issue that I think a lot of people were wondering when it was going to 
come up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dick Leach, USC men's coach: "Since no one said anything, they just 
didn't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But sweeping it under the rug didn't make it go away, and now college tennis 
is dealing with a monster. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked USC men's team, which declared four players ineligible last 
week, had to default against UCLA last Friday. It also defaulted against UC San 
Diego on Monday. The players -- Wayne Black, Jon Leach, Lukas Hovorka and Brett 
Hansen -- are expected to have their eligibility restored in time for Friday's 
match against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players on the 15th-ranked USC women's team also are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, two members of the 12th-ranked men's team, Robert Janecek and 
Sebastien LeBlanc, were declared ineligible last week for two matches. All six 
starters on the eighth-ranked UCLA women's team are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zapolski, Pepperdine's sports information director, said Pepperdine 
has not received any letters of inquiry from the NCAA concerning any of the 
school's tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who are affected, the problem could not have come at a worse 
time -- heading into the NCAA tournaments next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA men's team, for instance, was a marginal candidate to receive one of 
eight automatic berths to the NCAA men's tournament at Notre Dame in late May. 
A legitimate victory over USC would have helped the Bruins' chances. The NCAA 
might not look kindly on UCLA's default victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, UCLA would have to play in the West Regional qualifying 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how the problem is ultimately resolved -- many coaches are 
calling for the NCAA rule to be changed -- any records set this season probably 
will have asterisks next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation leaves many questions. Among the most disturbing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Considering the implications of declaring so many players ineligible, why 
didn't the NCAA form a plan of action before beginning its inquiry? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is the NCAA leaving it to the individual schools to investigate this 
problem when the schools have covered it up for so long? 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the NCAA West Regional at Boise State on Saturday, the UCLA 
women's gymnastics team heads into the NCAA meet April 21-23 at Utah. . . . The 
UCLA men's gymnastics team placed fourth in the NCAA West Regional at Colorado 
Springs, Colo., on Saturday, failing to advance to the NCAA team championships 
at Nebraska April 22-23. Six men did qualify to compete as individuals. . . . 
UCLA will play host to the Pacific 10 Conference women's golf tournament April 
25-27 at the Brentwood Country Club.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; RALPH STANLEY PULLS BLUEGRASS DOWN TO ITS ROOTS; BANJO 
PLAYER AND HIS BAND KEEP SONGS IN THEIR PLACE -- AND TIME -- DURING A 
SATISFYING CONCERT AT THE COACH HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sky was clear but the stars were nowhere in sight Monday night when 
seminal bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley played the Coach House. But even those 
in the house who only discovered Stanley last year via his star-studded 
"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning" album didn't appear to register any 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely that's because Stanley and his band played their old-time mountain 
music the way it's been played for most of his 41-year career: unadulterated. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of George Jones, Emmylou Harris, Bill Monroe, Dwight Yoakam, 
Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill and other high-profile guests certainly contributed 
much to the scope and popularity of, and undoubtedly the three Grammy 
nominations for, "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning." But befitting the humble 
origins of this music -- much of it born centuries ago and passed from 
generation to generation -- the songs, not personalities, remain center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the case on Monday. Ralph and Carter Stanley's "Wonderful World 
Outside" didn't get the achingly soulful reading that George Jones gave 
opposite Ralph in the studio, but the newest Clinch Mountain Boy, 
singer-guitarist Kenneth Davis, delivered a forlorn rendition of the 
prison-cell lament as successful in its own way as the album's. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Stanley not told the audience that Davis has been with the group just 
seven weeks, one might have thought that he had been an integral part of this 
almost casually precise ensemble for a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the longevity spectrum, bassist Jack Cooke has been 
with Stanley for three-plus decades now. The youngest group member, Ralph 
Stanley II, actually has been touring with his father on and off since he was a 
toddler. Now a teen-ager, he is appearing with the group more frequently, but 
he put his age in perspective by announcing he had "taken three weeks off 
school to come on this tour." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph II's flat, slightly nasal, vibrato-less lead vocals on three songs were 
far from the most elegant in bluegrass, but they well may be the closest thing 
to a substitute for Stanley's brother and longtime partner Carter, who died in 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, Stanley pere's voice is still robust and sandpaper-raspy as ever. 
Indeed, he sounded more secure throughout the two-hour, 28-song show than he 
occasionally does on "Saturday Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his banjo-playing sounded as fleet as it does on his recordings 
from 30 years or more ago. If anything has changed, it is his unusual (for the 
genre) vocal melisma, which he used to great effect, twisting syllables and 
subtly shifting vocal timbre two and three times in a single note. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With so many songs as old as the hills, it seemed entirely fitting that 
Stanley & Son took time to dust off "How Far to Little Rock," a 
vaudeville-via-Appalachia string of corny jokes the Stanley Brothers used to 
tell. If the Stanleys didn't get royalties from the folks who subsequently 
invented "Hee Haw," maybe there's still time to file a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately (especially since most of the jokes didn't have a prayer), the 
number led directly into one of a small handful of gospel medleys. The 
"Saturday Night" album is evenly split between secular and spiritual tunes, but 
Monday's set emphasized the former. Judging by the reaction, the crowd would 
have welcomed more gospel numbers like "He Died Upon the Cross." 
</P>
<P>
 With its constantly undulating three-part harmonies from Stanley, Davis and 
bassist Cooke, it musically underscored the message that nothing in this life 
remains static for very long. If there is a running theme to Stanley's brand of 
bluegrass, it's the true struggle that these "Mountain Folks," as one song 
title describes them, experience every day, and that for all too many, the only 
prospect for a better life is in the next one.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; COWBOY CHRIS LEDOUX RUSTLES UP A ROUSING SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roll over Roy Rogers and tell Gene Autry the news. In his energetic 50-minute 
early show at the Crazy Horse Monday night, real-life cowboy Chris LeDoux took 
the crowd on a wild eight-second ride of a set. 
</P>
<P>
 With the volume cranked up to ear-scorching levels, he rocked, rolled and even 
duck-walked his way through 50 minutes of Western-themed songs. "Git Along 
Little Dogies" was never like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris LeDoux's cowboy hat is no mere fashion statement: He is a world-champion 
bareback bronc rider. LeDoux started performing cowboy songs at rodeos as a 
sideline. With the help of his parents, he recorded more than 20 cassettes that 
he sold on the rodeo circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garth Brooks wrote a song about a down-and-out rodeo rider ("Much Too 
Young to Feel This Damn Old"), he referred to his "worn-out tape of Chris 
LeDoux" as an integral part of that lifestyle. It helped LeDoux skyrocket from 
cowboy cult hero to mainstream country star. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night LeDoux showed that he had more in common with Brooks than just an 
interest in Western music. As Brooks does, LeDoux served up country music with 
a whopping dose of techniques borrowed from stadium rock. 
</P>
<P>
 With a larger-than-life charisma and a visual presence guaranteed to transmit 
even to the upper reaches of a stadium, LeDoux absolutely galvanized the 
275-seat Crazy Horse. 
</P>
<P>
 In constant motion on stage, he punctuated his songs with well-timed gestures 
and, during the instrumental breaks, ran from one band member to the next 
urging them to greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it seemed as though the small stage could barely contain him, 
although he occasionally slowed the pace with a ballad like "Look at You Girl." 
 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux drew his selections almost entirely from his three recent hit albums on 
Liberty Records and bypassed almost all of his early more cowboy-oriented 
songs. Acceding to a request from someone in the audience, LeDoux did perform 
the old favorite "Copenhagen," about chewing tobacco. He also introduced one 
new number, "Dallas Days and Fort Worth Nights." 
</P>
<P>
 From his explosive opening version of his hit "Cadillac Ranch" to his 
hard-driving final number, "Little Long-Haired Outlaw," LeDoux segued rapidly 
from song to song, not even stopping to introduce the members of his band, 
Western Underground. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-piece group gave him the energetic support he needed but never 
grabbed the spotlight. Although fiddle and steel guitar added a country flavor 
to the music, the screeching lead guitar and heavy rhythm section owed more to 
Aerosmith than to the Sons of the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 LeDoux seemed to have reached a peak mid-set with a thunderous version of the 
rodeo anthem "Hooked on an Eight-Second Ride." But after slowing briefly to 
deliver the contemplative "Riding for a Fall," he built to new levels of 
excitement to climax his set with "Cowboys Like a Little Rock and Roll" and Joe 
Ely's "For Your Love." 
</P>
<P>
 When LeDoux returned for an encore, he ended "Little Long-Haired Outlaw" by 
grabbing the electric guitar from his lead guitarist and stabbing himself in 
the belly with its neck.  
</P>
<P>
 Although his set lasted less than an hour, by the time the lights went on, he 
left folks feeling as drained and satisfied as though they had ridden a bronc, 
roped a steer and wrestled a bull.

THEATER REVIEW; 'BAREFOOT' A TIRED ROMP THROUGH A BORING PARK; THE DIRECTOR 
TRIES TO PEP EVERYTHING UP IN THIS NEWPORT HARBOR THEATRE ARTS CENTER REVIVAL 
AND THE ACTORS DO FALL INTO STEP, THOUGH NOT ALWAYS AS LIGHTLY AS THEY COULD.

 Was being a newlywed ever this tough? Corie and Paul Bratter, the sighing 
lovebirds-turned-quarreling magpies perched at the center of "Barefoot in the 
Park," just can't get along now that their honeymoon is history. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the carefree, dopey type. He's the starchy, corporate type. Watch out: 
Big personality conflicts scheduled for high noon! In this early Neil Simon 
comedy, currently in a barely so-so revival at the Newport Harbor Theatre Arts 
Center, one-liners about mismatch-misery are thrown around like rice at a 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sticky rice, though -- all lumpy and overcooked. "Barefoot" may have been 
fresh when it first was produced, back in 1963 (Hollywood certainly thought so; 
it did a screen version with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda), but these days 
it's boringly quaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it never was supposed to be more than a pennyweight romp. But when 
you realize that one of the Bratters' biggest problems is the exhausting six 
flights of stairs leading to their apartment, you know you're dealing with 
triviality on a grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, always wrapped tight in his business duds, hates the climb; ever-spunky 
Corie thinks it's invigorating. They grouse about that. Then there's the 
mother-in-law, who is not a mean sort, just a bit odd. They grouse about her. 
Then there's the Lothario neighbor that Corie lines up for mom. They grouse 
about him, and they grouse about the matchmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes of this, you're nearly thrilled when they start blathering 
about divorce. Need a ride to the lawyer? Here, let me hail a cab! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Director Gregory Cohen does pretty much the usual with this sort of affair, 
trying to pep everything up. His actors fall into step, though not always as 
lightly as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 On the up side, Jay Fraley is pleasantly cranky as Paul. He's conservative, 
all right, but he has a decent heart, and Fraley lets us see that. Sherry 
Mattson is too shallow as Corie, though. Even with the nonstop animation, all 
perk and no quirk makes Corie a dull girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting performance is by Art Arnold Peltz as the playful 
neighbor, Victor. He delivers his lines in a casual, offhanded way and is 
relatively amusing to watch as he tells unbelievable stories and pretty much 
worms his way into the dueling couple's life. 
</P>

 THAT TIME AGAIN: We only have two more days to settle our score with Uncle 
Sam, and you can bet many of us will wait again till the last second to file 
our taxes. And who can blame us? After all, these days, you have to work till 
early May (above) before you've earned enough just to pay your taxes. . . . 
And, because of the quake, many will seek extensions (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 BIRTHDAY: Last week, Jews commemorated a somber occasion -- the Holocaust. 
This week, the mood is quite different. The state of Israel turns 46, and 
despite the violence of recent weeks, all is not gloomy in the Holy Land. . . . 
"There have been a lot of tense times," said Neal Schnall, principal of the 
Hebrew School at Temple Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, "but the mood is still 
one of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 RESEDA QUAKE: We'll always call it the Northridge quake, but the epicenter was 
actually in Reseda. Fair is fair. So, on Tuesday, Councilman Hal Bernson gave a 
mock quitclaim deed to Councilwoman Laura Chick, saying it "shall be known as 
the Reseda earthquake, the Reseda temblor, the shaker of Reseda, or any such 
other name the community of Reseda may desire.". . . Funny, though, Northridge 
didn't give up its right to relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 WATER RATES: Summer is just around the corner, and that means we'll use more 
water. And we'll certainly pay for it. Or maybe we won't. A City Council 
committee has recommended extending winter water rates, which are much lower 
than summer figures. . . . But some still favor a system in which heavy users 
pay a higher rate (B3). 
</P>
<P>
 RICH RIDE: Long after their glory years, cowboys can still draw a crowd. And 
they're pretty good for business too. Based on a survey, last month's Cowboy 
Poetry, Music and Film Festival poured almost $250,000 into the local economy. 
. . . "The point is, we're bringing people into Santa Clarita and they're 
spending their money," said a city official. (B7). Michael Arkush

 GOOD RIDDANCE: Remember Richard Barrett, the white supremacist who wouldn't 
leave Simi Valley alone? It appears the Mississippi mischief-maker has found 
another target. He's raising a ruckus in Boston by trying to hold a one-man 
parade that usually draws hundreds of police, counterdemonstrators and TV 
cameras. . . . Barrett twice stirred up trouble in Simi Valley after the first 
Rodney G. King beating trial. "We're very pleased that he's not back," said 
Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell. "We are still trying to live down the image 
he was trying to give us."

 MULTIPLEX MANIA: James Edwards Sr., the 87-year-old founder of the Edwards 
Theatre chain, today helps break ground on Ventura County's largest movie 
theater complex, near the Camarillo Airport (B1). . . . Edwards, who opened his 
first theater in Monterey Park in 1930, has adopted some of the movie 
industry's razzmatazz. It'll be "one of the most beautiful theatre complexes in 
the world," Edwards' announcement says, with a dozen curved screens, waterfall 
curtains and "state-of-the-art everything." Its name: The Camarillo Movie 
Palace.

 SPEED RACER: Most high schools have a few dare-devils who like to drag-race 
late at night on abandoned streets. But Ventura High senior Kris Krabill is a 
speed demon of a different dimension (C6). . . . On weekends, he travels to 
raceways throughout the West with his manager (his mom), his crew chief (his 
dad) and his pit crew (his uncle) and a 1,350-pound dragster that hits 60 
m.p.h. within a second and 150 m.p.h. in two seconds. "It's such a rush," he 
said.

 BATTLE AT SEA: The Navy is under attack for its plan to detonate explosives in 
coastal waters thick with dolphins, whales and sea lions. (B1) . . . . Save the 
Whales and other groups have filed suit, claiming the explosives will harass 
and injure 9,600 marine mammals or, worse yet, send them to Davy Jones' Locker. 
The area is too rich with sea life for such blasting, says environmental lawyer 
Joel R. Reynolds. "It's absolutely the wrong place to do this testing."

JACKSON FAN'S DEVOTION LEAVES HER PINING IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CARLA HALL and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 She spends her life waiting and watching for Michael Jackson. She says she has 
gone to scores of his concerts all over the world. She was in Las Vegas for the 
Jackson Family Honors concert. Then she went to the Grammys and the Soul Train 
Awards, hoping in vain to catch a glimpse of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month she was Downtown in the criminal courts building to support 
Jackson's mother as she testified before a grand jury hearing evidence in the 
molestation allegations against the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Denise Michelle Pfeiffer was back in court, and the underlying 
question was whether the driving force of her young life had driven her over 
the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old fan from Leicester, England, was arraigned in Beverly Hills 
Municipal Court on three misdemeanor counts, all stemming from her alleged 
hostility toward the father of the 14-year-old boy who accused Jackson of 
sexually molesting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer was charged with spray-painting accusatory graffiti on the sidewalk 
outside the father's Beverly Hills dental office, stealing keys to the office 
restroom and making annoying and threatening phone calls to the father's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested Thursday when she went to the father's house. There, 
prosecutors said, she talked to a male relative, described by prosecutors only 
as someone other than the boy who lodged the molestation charges. He invited 
her in, took her passport and called the police. She has been in custody ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a sweet, sweet girl," said a 24-year-old British friend, Jackie Scott, 
who first met Pfeiffer at a Jackson concert at Wembley Stadium in England. 
Scott, who says she has seen Jackson in concert about 30 times, has been 
staying in a hostel here with Pfeiffer and came to court to show support. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not weird. She'd never harm a child," said Scott, attired in jeans and 
a black cap as she waited in the hallway outside Judge Elden S. Fox's 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's obsessed -- not crazy," added a Swiss friend who has been staying at 
the hostel with the women and came along to court. "There's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 At the courthouse, reporters and photographers sprawled across pew-like wooden 
benches. Last month, Pfeiffer had waited among the reporters for Jackson's 
mother to emerge from a courtroom. She had proudly showed off two snapshots of 
herself with Jackson -- one encased on a key chain, the other attached to her 
backpack. When she spotted Jackson's mother, she had called out, "We love you, 
Mother Jackson. We love you." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, reporters -- and just her two friends -- awaited Pfeiffer's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been reporting every twist and turn in this Michael Jackson story," 
said Fiona Phillips, Los Angeles correspondent for the "Good Morning, Britain" 
television program. Pfeiffer had become the latest twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer was escorted into the courtroom by a sheriff's deputy, her hands 
handcuffed behind her. With her dark-blond hair and pale skin, she looked 
younger than her age, slight in the voluminous orange jail garb. She was seated 
on the side of the courtroom, looking calm but a little sad, staring straight 
ahead at the judge, then down to the side. She never made eye contact with her 
friends, who sat in the front row. According to the district attorney's office, 
she is listed as a transient. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Pfeiffer defended Jackson against the molestation allegations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Children are his life. He loves little children," Pfeiffer, a fan since she 
was 12, had said passionately. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she was defending herself. She entered a plea of not guilty.  
</P>
<P>
 She once estimated that it cost her $10,000 to travel from concert to concert 
during Jackson's Dangerous Tour, money she amassed by working odd jobs and 
hoarding every penny. Now, it is unclear if she will be able to make her 
$15,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty high bail," said her court-appointed attorney, Brenda Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Miller was besieged by press and cameras, much to her 
dismay. "I don't want to discuss the case. She's fine. She's just scared." 
</P>
<P>
 "But she's coping?" said TV reporter Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's coping," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the situation like in American jails?" asked Neal Harrison, producer 
for "Good Morning, Britain." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know -- fortunately I've never had the experience of being in a jail, 
but I'm sure she'll be well cared for," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographers followed Miller to the elevator as Pfeiffer's friends 
trailed after. Miller went down in the elevator, the friends talking to her in 
hushed tones. Pfeiffer was returned to jail.

GARCETTI GRANTED BUDGET INCREASE; GOVERNMENT: COMPROMISE IS STRUCK AS 
SUPERVISORS VOTE $3.8-MILLION RAISE TO SAVE THREATENED PROGRAMS. IN EXCHANGE, 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY AGREES TO RESTORE OTHER UNITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Moving to dampen the fractious budget standoff with Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, 
the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to increase Garcetti's budget 
by $3.8 million so that he can maintain several specialized crime units 
threatened with closure. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board lifted a hiring freeze that had prevented Garcetti from 
using outside grant money to set up special units to prosecute real estate and 
food stamp fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Garcetti agreed to restore and maintain divisions that prosecute 
major fraud, environmental crimes, auto insurance fraud, consumer protection 
and worker safety violations at least through the 1994-95 fiscal year. Garcetti 
also promised to live within whatever budget the board adopts for the next 
fiscal year, as long as it is not below his current allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise agreement was hailed by environmental activists, labor groups 
and others who had criticized Garcetti's threat to end prosecution of 
white-collar and nonviolent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very positive move," said Tim Frank, vice chairman of the Southern 
California-Nevada chapter of the Sierra Club. "The closure of these units could 
have been really devastating. L.A. County is one of the top three hazardous 
chemical-producing counties in the country. The air here is more polluted than 
anywhere. This is a dangerous place for us to allow violators to go 
unprosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, in an interview Tuesday, said that even with the increased budget, 
the department will have to evaluate all of the specialized units and may have 
to reallocate resources from one to another to keep them running. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows us to continue the prosecution of most of the cases," he said. 
"We can hire some lawyers and investigators, but we still have a large number 
of vacancies that need to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcetti praised the board for its action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board, to their credit, recognized that we really are understaffed," he 
said. "They came quite a distance in recognizing the real need of our 
department. I think there is a real spirit of cooperation here -- on their part 
and on my part too." 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly words were in stark contrast to the increasingly hostile debate 
that had been engendered by the board's demand that Garcetti live within his 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney had acknowledged overspending his $119-million budget by 
about $3.8 million. Supervisors had been adamant that Garcetti must stay within 
his budget limitations, imposing the strict hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti then announced that he would shift prosecutors from specialized units 
that prosecute nonviolent crimes to those that handle street crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Garcetti stopped accepting new cases involving environmental 
crimes, workers' compensation violations and major fraud because of staffing 
shortages in those units. He threatened to close them entirely by July 1 if he 
could not get more money and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision prompted Supervisor Gloria Molina to propose authorizing an 
independent negotiator to explore ways of securing outside funds to save the 
specialized units -- a proposal Garcetti had strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a surprise motion Tuesday, Supervisor Ed Edelman won agreement on a 
compromise, which was apparently brokered late Monday. Molina, who has butted 
heads frequently with Garcetti about his overspending, called the deal a 
"cave-in" on the county's part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he created a lot of stress and pressure for a lot of board members, 
but I have seen no confirmation that he is willing to live within his budget," 
Molina said. "But what can you do to a guy who's holding a gun to your head?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was no dispute that the specialized units deserved saving. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental crimes and occupational safety and health unit had handled 
more than 400 cases since 1987 and produced more than $13 million in fines, 
penalties and restitution, according to Garcetti's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The major fraud unit prosecutes white-collar crimes that involve amounts over 
$100,000. The unit has 214 active cases involving 11,000 victims and fraud 
believed to total $675 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials had expressed concerns about the possible dismantling of the 
specialized units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite pleased with the agreement and that it appears the prosecutions 
won't be disrupted," said CAL/OSHA spokesman Rick Rice. "One of the benefits of 
keeping these within the district attorney's office is that they will still be 
handled as felonies."

BOY, 15, ARRESTED IN POISONING OF TEACHER; SCHOOL: LITTLEROCK HIGH STUDENT 
CONFESSES, TELLING INVESTIGATORS THAT HE PUT CLEANING FLUID IN HIS INSTRUCTOR'S 
BEVERAGE CAN AS A JOKE. 
</P>

<P>
 A 15-year-old Littlerock High School student was arrested Tuesday after he 
confessed to putting four to five drops of toxic cleaning fluid into his 
teacher's can of Diet Pepsi, causing her to become violently ill, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was doing it as a joke," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry 
Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was arrested about 3 
p.m. on suspicion of a single felony count of poisoning or adulterating a 
drink, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives identified the youth after other students said they had heard him 
boasting that he had placed the cleaning fluid into the soda can as a joke, 
Wolf said. The boy subsequently confessed to detectives during an interview, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ennis, 32, an English teacher at the Antelope Valley school, was rushed 
to the hospital Thursday after she took a gulp from a can of soda laced with 
dry-eraser fluid. She was discharged from Palmdale Hospital Medical Center on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf declined to say whether the boy, who has no criminal record, showed 
remorse for his act. Wolf also declined to say whether any other students 
witnessed the incident, but he said detectives believe that the boy, who was a 
student in Ennis' English class, acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any doubt that we would find out who did this with as many 
people who must have been around," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the arrest came as a relief to school officials who helped sheriff's 
detectives interview dozens of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that finally we can bring some closure to this problem," said 
Michael Clark, a vice principal at Littlerock. "I think most students were 
appalled at what had occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the boy, now in custody at a local juvenile detention center, will 
face an immediate five-day suspension and possible expulsion from the school 
pending an outcome of his case. The boy's parents will meet with school 
officials during the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said interviews with students helped school officials and detectives 
identify the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a surprise to us when we began to investigate because a lot of 
students believed a particular student or group of students had something to do 
with it," Clark said. "I think the case broke when students realized it was no 
longer a prank and that Mrs. Ennis had suffered physically."

OPENING DAY; TRANSPORTATION: DRIVERS BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF AT BEING ABLE TO 
DRIVE THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY. BUT FOR CAR-POOLERS, THE COMMUTE WAS LONGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 That loud whooshing sound you heard coming from the Santa Monica Freeway on 
Tuesday wasn't just the noise of cars speeding past. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it was a collective sigh of relief coming from hundreds of thousands 
of motorists glad that the world's busiest freeway was open to traffic for the 
first time since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy day. It suddenly opens the other side of the city to us," said 
film producer David Miller of Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last few months have been awful. I actually quit the job I was working at 
in Glendale because it was impossible to get there with the freeway out," said 
Naida Albright, a car saleswoman who lives in Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters can be a cynical bunch. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 They have learned the hard way that radio traffic reporters always seem to be 
late in pinpointing traffic jams -- and that Caltrans sweepers always seem to 
be early in closing the rush-hour fast lane when it comes time to clean the 
median divider. 
</P>
<P>
 But most motorists seemed genuinely grateful as they whisked past Fairfax 
Avenue, past the two concrete bridges rebuilt at a cost of nearly $30 million, 
and past the platform filled with politicians taking deep bows for the swift 
repair job. 
</P>
<P>
 Half that cost was bonus money paid to the contractor for speeding up the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was money well spent," said Ken Kukene, a traveling salesman who described 
as hellish the zigzagging route he took from his Santa Monica home to the 
Downtown garment district after the freeway collapse. "I will not be upset if I 
never see National Boulevard again." 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Johnson, a security guard who lives a few blocks from the Westside 
freeway collapse site, said: "Whoever that contractor is, he's rolling in 
dough. But he should be commended." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabra Robinson-Niles, a children's therapist from Santa Monica, feared that 
the freeway would be shut for a year when she saw the quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about making a call to somebody because I'm really impressed 
with how quickly they got it fixed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a whistle-like whew sound of disbelief coming from some 
commuters who wondered whether the contractor was overpaid -- and whether 
problems caused by the freeway collapse were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever negotiated that $15-million bonus needs to look at their motives," 
said Ty Cueva, a telecommunications employee who lives in Santa Monica and 
works in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it's been quicker driving the detour. It's been about five or 10 
minutes quicker, to be honest with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Cohen and Lynn Dumenil, husband-and-wife professors who live in Venice 
and teach at Occidental College in Eagle Rock, plan to continue arising at 6 
a.m. as they learned to do while commuting around the collapsed bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of amazing it was done so rapidly," said Cohen, who teaches 
music. "Like all good citizens, we're happy about that. But we're very upset 
about the payment to speed up the production." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Carol G. Miller, who car-pooled to work in Downtown Los Angeles during 
the project and enjoyed the use of a temporary diamond lane, said her commute 
was taking 25 minutes. Until the freeway reopened, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like flying. But today it was the old sit and wait -- was just 
like old times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's trip to work took 40 minutes instead of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday was a grand day for most on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth whatever it took to get the freeway reopened," producer Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost went down there last night to watch the first cars go through," 
auto saleswoman Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has made people feel like we're healing a little better."

12 MORE ARRESTED IN PROBE OF PHONY QUAKE CLAIMS; ASSISTANCE: U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
DEFENDANTS SOUGHT AID TOTALING $64,000. FOUR OTHERS PLEADED GUILTY LAST WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 Pressing their probe of bogus disaster assistance claims, a task force of 
federal agents in recent days has arrested 12 people for seeking thousands of 
dollars with phony claims of earthquake damage, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegedly fraudulent claims, totaling more than $64,000, involved a range 
of misrepresentations to obtain Federal Emergency Management Agency housing 
grants and funds to cover lost personal property, according to complaints filed 
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. About $20,000, most of it in $2,300 
temporary housing checks, was distributed to the defendants, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman, who is prosecuting the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests come on the heels of guilty pleas last week by four people charged 
with falsifying claims that they lived at the collapsed Northridge Meadows 
apartments, where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those charged Tuesday also sought federal aid by falsely claiming to 
live at quake-damaged addresses. After the earthquake, two defendants sought 
state Department of Motor Vehicles identification cards with inaccurate 
addresses to bolster their claims, according to court documents. One defendant 
improperly received checks for two addresses, prosecutors said, and another 
filed a damage claim for a residence he had moved out of months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our second strike and our second warning to those who would defraud 
the U.S. government and interfere with (the) delivery of funds to the eligible 
and the needy," said Paul J. Lillis, FEMA's assistant inspector general. Lillis 
said numerous investigations of fraud are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, FEMA officials said about 2,000 relief checks totaling $6 
million have been returned by recipients for various reasons. And next week the 
agency will send out nearly 3,000 letters seeking to recover several million 
dollars more from applicants it has deemed ineligible for aid, or who received 
checks in error. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has received more than 500,000 applications and sent out 265,000 aid 
checks totaling $687 million, officials said. Overall, $1.5 billion in 
earthquake aid has been disbursed to individuals and businesses by various 
government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no way to estimate how much fraud may have occurred in the 
massive outflow of aid, officials insist that the vast majority of money has 
gone to those legitimately in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect that it's a major, major problem," said Morrie Goodman, 
FEMA's director of emergency information and public affairs. "But the point 
here is that the federal government will not tolerate any attempt to take 
advantage of (this disaster). We consider one (fraud) to be a lot and 
intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's arrests came from leads developed from a variety of sources, 
including 1,500 tips received by a FEMA hot line. Others were caught by FEMA 
officials reviewing and cross-checking claim information, as well as an alert 
mail carrier who noticed FEMA material going to people she did not recognize on 
her route. 
</P>
<P>
 Those charged Tuesday were: Rhonda Deshawn Andres, 21, of Los Angeles; John W. 
Barrett, 59, of Westchester; Michael J. Bermant, 26, of North Hills; Anthony S. 
Cooper, of Van Nuys; Tannis Eneeka Curry, 32, of Sun Valley; Marcus D. Holt, 
23, of North Hills; Varouj Ratavoussian, 33, and Adrineh Aghadjian, 27, both of 
Glendale; Victoria Russell, 36, of Sherman Oaks; Melvin Artie Staples, 45, of 
Sherman Oaks; Shirley Thompson, 48, of Los Angeles, and Carl F. McConachie, 51, 
of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Carlin, an assistant federal public defender representing Cooper, Holt, 
Andres, Thompson and Ratavoussian, said he had not had time to review the cases 
but expected his clients to enter not guilty pleas. The attorney for Aghadjian 
declined to comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; CONDO OWNERS 
WIN JURY AWARD OF $6.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Pasadena condominium owners who paid a premium price for luxury 
residences won a $6.3-million jury award Tuesday from the developer for shoddy 
workmanship and short space. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 homeowners who make up the 515 S. Orange Grove Owners Assn. had 
complained of water leaks and excessive noise soon after moving into the 
complex built by Orange Grove Partners and Pasadena developer Victor Illig.The 
5-year-old condos were sold for $500,000 to $1 million per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit against Illig's Orange Grove Partners was filed in September, 
1992, after an expert hired by the homeowner's association turned up evidence 
that the property was structurally unsound and that nine owners had paid for 
larger square footage than they got. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury awarded more than $5.7 million to compensate the association for 
defective construction and nearly $600,000 to be divided among the owners whose 
units were found to be smaller than advertised. The verdict comes after the 
jury reviewed thousands of exhibits during seven weeks of trial, including a 
tour of the property that the homeowners lawyer, Lee Barker, believed sealed 
the verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they could see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears the 
problems," Barker said, "that was one of the deciding factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Illig nor his attorney could be reached for comment Tuesday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GROUP 
SEEKS TO STIR INTEREST IN SOUTH AFRICA ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As South Africa girds for its first all-race elections, a fledgling group of 
black South Africans and Angelenos is working to stir interest here in the 
historic event. 
</P>
<P>
 Countdown to Freedom Coalition, created to focus attention on South Africa's 
vote two weeks from now and the second anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, 
Tuesday announced a series of activities beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled "The Power of the Vote . . . from Soweto to South-Central," the 
program combines lectures, art exhibits and a candlelight vigil to raise 
awareness of the South African elections and the 1992 riots.  
</P>
<P>
 "This occasion marks a critical juncture in both the United States and South 
Africa," said Cynthia Robbins, an attorney for Public Counsel and a member of 
the coalition. "While we fought long and hard for the right to vote in this 
country, we must use the event in South Africa to refortify us to be vigilant 
in holding on to the right to vote."  
</P>
<P>
 Robbins was joined at the First African Methodist Church by more than 30 South 
Africans, coalition members and supporters of the long and bloody struggle to 
overturn South Africa's apartheid system. Elections for South Africans living 
in Los Angeles will be held April 26. Ballots will be cast in South Africa on 
April 27 and 28.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
QUAKE-DAMAGED PIPELINE TO BE SHUT INDEFINITELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An aging oil pipeline that suffered extensive damage in the Northridge 
earthquake -- including a crack that sent walls of flame through a Mission 
Hills neighborhood -- will remain out of commission indefinitely, its owners 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line, which connects Kern County oil fields to 
South Bay refineries, had been scheduled to reopen by May 1.But executives of 
Atlantic Richfield Co., which owns the line, decided to put repairs on hold to 
further study costs and safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCO spokesman Scott Loll said the company is considering a number of options 
regarding the 70-year-old pipeline -- including shutting down for good the 
54-mile stretch that runs under densely populated communities between Newhall 
and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 During January's 6.8 temblor, the 10-inch diameter pipe ruptured in several 
places. A spill into the Santa Clara River near Valencia killed hundreds of 
fish and birds and a leak in San Fernando fueled fires along Wolfskill Street 
that destroyed cars and homes and seriously injured a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and elected officials in Los Angeles and San Fernando had 
feared similar leaks if the line was allowed to reopen without thorough testing 
and repairs. They applauded Tuesday's announcement.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OK 
EXPECTED FOR NAMING CIVILIAN TO POLICE PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission is expected to approve a motion today 
clearing the way for a civilian member to join police disciplinary panels, a 
significant step toward implementing a reform approved by voters two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police officers have expressed reservations about the idea, but 
representatives of the Los Angeles Police Protective League tentatively backed 
it under conditions laid out in an agreement to be considered today by the 
commission.That agreement spells out employment and selection criteria for the 
civilian board members. 
</P>
<P>
 In its study of the LAPD, the Christopher Commission recommended that a 
civilian be included on police boards of rights -- which now are made up of 
three senior officers. The commission's recommendation was approved by city 
voters in 1992 as part of Charter Amendment F.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ANIMAL 
CONTROL OFFICIAL QUITS, CITING COYOTE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commissioner from the San Fernando Valley 
resigned Tuesday, saying animal rights advocates have unduly influenced the 
panel, particularly its policy to continue a ban on coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Exe submitted her resignation to Mayor Richard Riordan, seven months 
after she was confirmed to the five-member panel by a split vote of the City 
Council amid sharp criticism from animal rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken control," Exe said, referring to animal rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Exe said the commission's decision to ban coyote trapping 10 months ago was at 
the behest of animal rights organizations. She said the commission has refused 
to consider lifting the ban, despite concerns of residents who complain about 
coyote attacks on pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Robins, president of the commission, declined to comment on Exe's 
accusations. "I don't have any comment and I wish her well," she said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RULING 
ALLOWS FOX TO AIR MOVIE ABOUT MENENDEZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Tuesday to bar the Fox network from airing locally a TV movie 
about Erik and Lyle Menendez, who face a second trial on charges of murdering 
their wealthy Beverly Hills parents. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Manuel Real rejected claims by the Menendezes' attorneys 
that "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Brothers" 
would make it impossible to seat impartial jurors for the retrial.Real also 
refused to order Fox to provide a disclaimer or take out the word "true" and 
"murders" in the title of the movie, which is scheduled to air Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Terri Towery, who represents Lyle Menendez, said the 
brothers want the movie barred from local television because "it purports to be 
a true story, but that's not true." Towery said the movie contains fictional 
dialogue and the writers changed elements in the trial transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is based on trial transcripts, public records and the book "Blood 
Brothers," by John Johnson and Ronald Soble. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Vanderet, an attorney for Fox, said the network believes it is a fair 
depiction of the Menendez case. And he said the law on such injunction requests 
is clear.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: THE GOOD TAX NEWS: 
UNINSURED DISASTER LOSSES ARE DEDUCTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Friday the deadline for filing income taxes, the disaster-weary can at 
least look forward to some tax relief: Uninsured casualty losses from the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake -- as well as from last fall's fires and mudslides -- 
are deductible on individuals' federal and state returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because the Northridge quake was declared a federal disaster, 
victims of the temblor can choose to take those losses on either their 1993 or 
1994 returns. That is a major advantage for people who expect their 1994 
incomes to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But doing all this additional figuring can take time -- which is why many 
people are expected to ask the Internal Revenue Service and California 
Franchise Tax Board for filing extensions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt there will be a lot more extensions than usual," said Paul White, a 
partner in the Sherman Oaks accounting firm of White, Zuckerman, Warsavsky & 
Luna. Among his clients, "more people who usually file early are at least 
waiting until the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 White's firm is temporarily renting offices in Burbank because the quake 
demolished the accountants' headquarters. The firm was relieved when it was 
able to find or recover all the records needed to prepare its clients' 1993 
returns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many taxpayers have not been as lucky, losing important documents that 
they need to file their 1040s because the quake damaged their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every client I've worked with has lost at least some records," 
said Alan Kennan, a tax partner in the Los Angeles office of the accounting 
firm Grant Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 Others will have to file extension requests with the IRS (Form 4868) because 
"they are still waiting for the simplest of records," said Elaine Blackman of 
White, Zuckerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those records may include W-2s from their employers or 1099s showing 
investment income, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, "the government basically expects you to reconstruct your 
income and deductions for 1993," Kennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 If people still end up having to guess at, say, how much they gave to charity 
in 1993, label it an estimate, he advised. But they should be conservative 
because the government will check it carefully, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even figuring out your deductible casualty loss can be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you have to get a real estate appraiser to tell you what the value of 
your property was before the disaster and after," Kennan said. The difference 
is your tentative loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance payments must be subtracted from that tentative loss, producing a 
net loss figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch: To be deductible, casualty losses must exceed 10% of 
your adjusted gross income -- basically income before itemized deductions -- 
plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has introduced federal legislation to 
make uninsured losses 100% deductible for victims of declared national 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) has authored a 
bill that would provide identical relief for disaster victims on their state 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither bill is expected to pass by Friday, spokesmen for Berman and Rosenthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the proposed legislation is enacted later, taxpayers entitled to 
the bigger write-offs could file amended returns. The tax breaks would apply to 
losses on declared disasters that occurred on or after Jan. 17, the day of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding whether to take the limited loss that is available now this year or 
next year may be easy for people faced with extensive rebuilding -- but still 
waiting for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, how badly do you need cash now?" Kennan asked. "Fixing your 
house may be more important than waiting a year to get a bigger deduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Requesting an extension to sort all this out can provide nearly six months' 
reprieve -- to Oct. 14 this year because Oct. 15 is a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a filing extension, the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board 
expect checks for about 90% of the amount owed to be in the mail by midnight 
Friday. Although it is possible to get an extension for paying federal taxes, 
it is not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The state does not grant extensions per se, tax board spokesman Jim Shepherd 
said. But, he said, people with quake damage should make the state aware of 
their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is assessed a penalty for filing late or paying late and it was 
because of the earthquake, we will be lenient if they protest the penalty," 
Shepherd said. "We're the same way when there is any type of catastrophe." JILL

BILL BOYARSKY: THE FREE RIDE WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL BOYARSKY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I walked around the empty Santa Monica Freeway at La Cienega Boulevard Monday 
afternoon, taking a quiet look at the reconstruction job before the 
superhighway returned to its usual jammed, polluted state. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that my relationship with this ugly concrete road has every been a 
sentimental one. The last time I'd approached that spot on foot was early in 
the morning, the day after the earthquake, just as the workers were arriving to 
begin the repair. I've never liked this freeway, which has been my route to 
work the last 24 years. But I wanted to pay my respects on the occasion of its 
remarkably speedy recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning, of course, the truth came out. Times reporter Virginia Ellis 
disclosed that state engineers, racing for a record, permitted the bridges to 
be rebuilt with seismic weaknesses that will have to be corrected later. 
Reading that, I thought of what my father used to tell me when I started a new 
and difficult job -- go slow and be careful. Failure to follow his advice 
resulted in my having to take high school chemistry two times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ellis' story made me nervous, I took the freeway to work anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I was alone in my car, just like hundreds of thousands of other commuters. I 
could see that most of us unreconstructed, car-loving Santa Monica Freeway 
users hadn't learned much from our almost four months of fighting gridlocked 
city street intersections and stoplights. As Dan Garcia, former head of the Los 
Angeles Planning Commission, put it: "Beset by drought, fires, recessions, 
riots and now earthquakes, Southern California's 15 million people labor under 
the unnecessary additional burden of a grossly inefficient and, even in normal 
times, an unbearably congested transportation network." 
</P>
<P>
 This cannot continue, Garcia said. "Health-based air quality standards are 
here to stay, and since 65% of the area's pollutants are from . . . cars and 
trucks, policies that will reduce the number of vehicles on the road are 
essential." 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, at the exact moment the rebuilt freeway was being dedicated, 
the future of our overburdened transportation system was being discussed at a 
seminar at the Biltmore. Garcia's comments, in fact, were part of a report 
presented at the meeting, which was sponsored by the Reason Foundation, a 
Libertarian-oriented think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting didn't get the notice given to the dedication, but in the end it 
will be much more important to the history of transportation in Los Angeles 
than the ceremony on I-10's newly laid concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the L.A.-based Reason Foundation is scorned by liberals as a bastion 
of conservatism, it had assembled a group of transportation experts 
representing a range of political views. One of the most important reports came 
from a tall, young, curly-haired economic analyst named Michael Cameron, who 
since 1989 has researched Southern California transportation for the 
Environmental Defense Fund. The defense fund is disliked by the right as much 
as the Reason Foundation is by the left. The fact that the two organizations 
were cooperating at this meeting was evidence of how widespread the concern 
over Southland traffic has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron has figured out that one reason Angelenos stick to their cars is that 
the auto is the cheapest mode of transportation. I don't exactly understand 
why. He uses mathematical formulas, and as I mentioned previously, I had to 
repeat high school chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
 He concluded that even considering car payments, gas, insurance and the rest, 
it's comparatively cheap to drive your car, cheaper than using public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron's answer is to make driving more expensive by levying a 5-cent-a-mile 
fee. It would be fair: The multi-vehicle, long-driving rich would pay more than 
the short-trip poor. Other speakers at the meeting had variations on the theme, 
proposing tolls for use of free-flowing diamond lanes during rush hour. Pay 
more and get there faster. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to subsidize more attractive forms of public 
transportation. One day you'll summon a Super Shuttle-type van on your home 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 You may think this is all academic dreaming. But it's not. Toll roads are 
becoming a reality in Orange County. In the San Francisco Bay Area, they're 
talking about higher Bay Bridge tolls during the rush hours, a concept known as 
"congestion pricing." In fact, Congress, as far back as 1990, ratified the idea 
of such pricing in the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the future. We freeloading commuters on the Santa Monica Freeway are 
history.

LAST WITNESSES TESTIFY IN KING'S CIVIL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testimony in the first phase of Rodney G. King's civil lawsuit came to a close 
Tuesday as King's attorney called a sound expert who told jurors he could hear 
a racial slur on the videotape of the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for King and the city are to square off with closing arguments today 
before the 10-member jury begins deliberations to determine the amount of money 
King will be compensated for the injuries he suffered when he was beaten by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 George Papcun, an acoustic phonetics expert for the Los Alamos national 
laboratory in New Mexico, said he heard the epithet after filtering out the 
helicopter noise on the audio portion of videotape of the March 3, 1991, 
beating in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phrase, 'nigger, hands behind your back' appears on that tape recording," 
Papcun testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Papcun was called to the stand to rebut earlier statements by Angelika Braun, 
a German sound expert who said that she could not make out any racial slur. 
Papcun played a filtered tape for the jurors and many in the courtroom said 
they heard the epithet. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ended its case Tuesday, calling George Brinton, an economist, to 
testify that King would have earned no more than $500,000 for the rest of his 
life. The testimony countered estimates from one of King's witnesses that the 
former construction worker could have made $1.2 million if he worked to age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Timmy Fowler, King's parole officer, testified that he visited King 
shortly after the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was beaten like a dog and that he never tried to strike the 
officers," said Fowler, who described King as confused. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lead attorney, Milton Grimes, asked Fowler if he recalled whether King 
mentioned racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers said, 'Run, nigger, we're going to kill you,' " the parole 
officer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fowler, who testified about the incident for the first time Tuesday, said he 
never relayed the comment to his superiors because he wanted to remain neutral 
on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys say that the use of racial slurs during the beating 
contributed to the emotional pain and anguish suffered by their client. 
</P>
<P>
 King is seeking $9.5 million in compensation for his physical and emotional 
injuries. The city has accepted responsibility for King's injuries, but its 
offer to settle the case for $1.25 million was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 After a compensation verdict is reached, the second phase of the trial will 
determine the individual liability of police officers and other defendants for 
punitive damages.

GEARBOXES FAIL AT HIGH RATE ON BLUE LINE CARS; TRANSPORTATION: THE 
CASH-STRAPPED MTA IS FORCED TO PAY FOR REPAIRS. AGENCY OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE 
TALKING TO THE CONTRACTOR, SUMITOMO CORP., IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHARE THE BURDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than one-fifth of the way into their expected life spans, more than 15% 
of the gearboxes on Metro Blue Line cars have failed, forcing the cash-strapped 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to buy new parts and overhaul equipment, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 230 gearboxes, 38 have broken down much sooner than expected -- some of 
them after only 48,000 miles of service. That is less than 5% of the 
1-million-mile standard specified in MTA's contract with the car manufacturer, 
Sumitomo Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 For all but three of the failed gearboxes, the two-year warranty period had 
expired, forcing the MTA to dip into its coffers to fund repairs and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Art Leahy, the agency's executive director of operations, said 
discussions are under way with Sumitomo to mitigate the costs of fixing and 
maintaining the equipment, estimated at $750,000 initially and $350,000 a year 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be exploring all the options," said Leahy, who added that service has 
not been affected along the 22-mile Blue Line route between Long Beach and Los 
Angeles. "We are working with Sumitomo and discussing with them the engineering 
required to figure out what the ultimate solutions of this will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Detection of the failures, made while the cars were out of service for routine 
inspections, is a blow to the transit agency, which is struggling to close a 
projected $126-million operating shortfall for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The faulty equipment also raises questions about the 15 cars Sumitomo has been 
selected to provide for the Green Line, scheduled to open next year. That 
contract was awarded in 1992 by the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission (now part of the MTA) before any widespread problem with the 
gearboxes had come to light -- only seven had failed by that point, MTA chief 
spokesman Jim Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 cars are in production. Sumitomo and the MTA are discussing whether a 
different gearbox system can be installed and an extended warranty granted, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reviewing all factors involved in this matter," said Sumitomo product 
manager Chuck White from Tokyo, where he said company executives and MTA 
officials were meeting to examine the problem and devise a solution. "I don't 
want to speculate any more than that at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment on what the company's legal and contractual obligations 
are, saying only: "We're responsive and responsible vendors." 
</P>
<P>
 The 54 Blue Line cars were purchased in 1987 at $1.3 million apiece -- along 
with some spare parts -- and put into use in 1990. Inspectors discovered the 
first gearbox failure in June, 1991, and the problem has worsened over time. 
Stress has fractured the teeth in the gears that drive the wheel axles, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each car has four gearboxes, which were manufactured by the Flender Corp. in 
Illinois. It was unclear Tuesday how many cars are affected, but "enough of a 
problem has in fact occurred that it's a serious issue," Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials added that future rail car purchases call for a different 
gearbox design that is expected to be more durable. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, the LACTC commissioned Sumitomo to manufacture the entire 
41-car Green Line fleet, but a political uproar over awarding the contract to a 
Japanese-owned company forced officials to cancel the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven months later, officials said time constraints left them no choice but 
to request 15 cars at $2.9 million each. Though the cars are virtually 
identical to their Blue Line counterparts, they cost twice as much because of 
the limited size of the order and the short time within which it had to be 
filled.

2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN STUDENTS' KILLINGS; COURTS: RAYMOND BUTLER, 18, ALLEGEDLY 
SHOT THE 19-YEAR-OLDS DURING A ROBBERY. ALBERTO RAYGOZA, 20, IS ACCUSED OF 
RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY.

 A reputed San Pedro gang member charged with the execution-style murders of 
two Marymount College students from Japan pleaded not guilty Tuesday, as did 
his alleged accomplice in the high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar (Mugsy) Butler, 18, appeared in shackles and street clothes for 
his arraignment before Long Beach Municipal Judge James B. Pierce, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who faces the death penalty if convicted, is charged with the March 25 
slayings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, in the parking lot of a Ralphs 
supermarket on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The killings ignited bitter 
criticism in Japan and prompted calls of condolence from President Clinton, 
Gov. Pete Wilson and U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler could face the death penalty because the killings were multiple murders 
and committed during a robbery. He also is charged with two counts of 
second-degree robbery and two counts of carjacking Ito's white 1994 Honda 
Civic. Those accusations also carry special allegations that Butler used a 
handgun to commit a crime and that he inflicted great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Not guilty pleas also were entered by Butler's alleged accomplice, Alberto V. 
(Chato) Raygoza, 20, of San Pedro. Raygoza is not accused of having been at the 
scene when the two students were shot in the back of the head, but he is 
accused receiving the victims' stolen camera, car stereo system, clothing and 
miscellaneous personal items, according to the prosecutor's criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 He was charged with one count of being an accessory to murder after the fact, 
and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing was set for May 25.

FIRE DEPT. MINORITY HIRING PRACTICES TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday ordered a study of the Fire Department's hiring 
and promotion practices involving minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority representation in the department has risen from less than 6% in 1974 
to 37% today, but is still short of reflecting the city's 63% ethnic 
population, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The statistics speak for themselves with respect to entry-level positions," 
said Ridley-Thomas, who proposed the study. "With respect to promotional 
opportunities in terms of managerial or supervisorial positions, the problem is 
more stark." 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities make up 22% of captains and 12% of battalion chiefs and the higher 
ranks, Ridley-Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Donald Manning said his department does not discriminates against 
minorities.

COMPTON SCHOOL AIDE GETS 6-YEAR MOLESTATION SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Compton school district has launched an internal investigation to 
determine if school employees did all they could to protect students from a 
teacher's aide who was sentenced to a six-year prison term Tuesday for having 
sex with a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide, Twone Torri Flowers, 24, pleaded no contest in Compton Superior 
Court to committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose name is not being released because of her age, said that she 
and Flowers had sex at Enterprise Middle School during school hours a number of 
times and that Flowers fathered her child. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl made her allegations more than a year after three other students 
accused Flowers of molesting them. School officials came under fire this week 
when prosecutors disclosed that school officials allegedly discounted the 
earlier allegations and failed to notify law enforcement authorities as the law 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
 State-appointed administrator J. Jerome Harris said employees could face 
disciplinary action if he finds they acted improperly. "All of this happened 
before I got here," said Harris, who assumed the district's top job in 
February. "What I am trying to do is reconstruct after two years what 
transpired. Sometimes that's not easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he would require school administrators to review procedures for 
handling molestation allegations. The district came under state control last 
July as a condition for receiving an emergency state loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier case, school officials accused the girls who complained about 
Flowers of lying, according to police reports based on interviews with the 
girls and their families, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sindee Kain-Kerker said. In 
addition, the teacher's aide denounced the girls publicly and other students 
kicked, taunted and threatened two of the girls for complaining about Flowers, 
Kain-Kerker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they learned of the earlier allegations from the alleged victims' 
parents, who were dissatisfied with the school's response. Prosecutors 
eventually concluded they did not have enough corroborating evidence to file 
charges against Flowers. The later case was different because the girl was 
pregnant and Flowers admitted having sex with her, Kain-Kerker said. Flowers 
worked for the district as recently as last November, district sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Flowers said she and her client would have no comment. 
Flowers appeared briefly in court Tuesday to enter his plea. He sat quietly, in 
blue prison clothes and with his head in hands, until ordered to stand during 
the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant received six years and will probably be released after three 
years," prosecutor Kain-Kerker said after the hearing. "The girl has a longer 
sentence. She'll have to raise his child and deal with this trauma for the rest 
of her life."

ANTI-GANG PROGRAM PAYING OFF; CRIME: WESTMINSTER REPORTS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN 
RELATED VIOLENCE SINCE TARGET EFFORTS BEGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a recent series of cafe shootings in the city, police Tuesday reported 
a stunning 62% decline in gang-related crime during the past two years and a 
near-perfect record of prosecution for gang members charged.  
</P>
<P>
 A report released by Police Chief James Cook said the reduction in gang 
violence has been directly related to a program -- recently expanded countywide 
-- devoted to weeding out neighborhood gang leaders for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most significant findings contained in the 55-page study of gang 
crime in the city, officials said that all but one of the 67 cases referred for 
prosecution last year resulted in either a finding or plea of guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 And since 1991, police report, the number of gang-related crimes has plunged 
from 286 to 110 incidents last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that crimes have now been reduced to such a low level that it will 
be difficult to demonstrate further decreases," the report stated. "In the last 
quarter of 1993, few such crimes occurred in any given month." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the apparent success, one county official cautioned that more work 
was needed to see improvement in the especially gang-plagued areas of Santa Ana 
and other central and North County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a long way from declaring victory here," said county Supervisor Roger 
R. Stanton, whose district includes Westminster. "Gangs still remain a threat 
to Southern California. The (Westminster) results are encouraging, but I'm just 
being realistic. I don't think we should be getting too excited yet." 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the gang enforcement program called TARGET in 1992, Chief Cook 
reported almost immediate success. The strategy involves teaming local police 
officers with prosecutors and probation officers in an effort to build criminal 
cases against hardened gang leaders based in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, including Stanton, recently approved a $2-million program to 
extend the strategy to six other cities in the county, including Santa Ana, 
where gang crime has been a growing problem. Those programs have just begun 
operations and are not expected to show major changes in gang crime activity 
for up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, in fact, these figures can be verified," Stanton said of Cook's report, 
"it shows what really paying attention to a problem can do. Adding more people 
and keeping track of our progress mean a change in trends here. I think we're 
just starting to come to grips with the situation here." 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes as police have been investigating possible gang involvement 
in a string of cafe shootings in Westminster and Garden Grove that have left 
two dead and five wounded.

PASTORS SING PRAISES OF INDUSTRIAL PARK CHURCHES; RELIGION: FLEDGLING 
CONGREGATIONS FIND THE SITES IDEAL FOR SERVICES, EASY ON THE BUDGET.

<P>
 Like many new churches, Canyon Family Worship Center is long on good 
intentions but short on cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Gary Martin started the church five years ago, holding services in a 
hotel conference room every Sunday. When the congregation outgrew that 
arrangement, Martin began looking for a building to buy or lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have looked at every building in a five-mile radius," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the financial backing of a major religious organization, the 
independent church found traditional settings unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's solution was to lease space in an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this was the route to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Low rents, facilities with room to grow, and virtually no competition for 
parking on Sunday mornings make industrial and business parks attractive to 
fledgling congregations. In cities across Orange County, churches are leasing 
or buying warehouses and buildings designed for manufacturing and other light 
industry at rates far below what churches in residential areas pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial parks are particularly appealing in South County and other growing 
areas. Developers have abandoned the earlier practice of setting aside land for 
churches to attract home buyers, forcing new congregations to be creative in 
their search for a place to worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's vacant land (in industrial parks), it's cheap and there's a lot of 
space," said Phillip Schwartze, a San Juan Capistrano real estate consultant 
who has helped several churches lease or buy industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartze said churches and light industry have proved to be compatible, in 
large part because they operate on different schedules and have different peak 
use times. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartze, a former planner for the city of Anaheim, said allowing churches in 
industrial and business parks can be beneficial to all parties. When a church 
leases space in an industrial park, there is one less business using up parking 
spots and clogging streets in and around the facility during regular business 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, several city planners say when looked at as a land-use issue, 
churches actually fit better in industrial and business zones than residential 
and retail areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A church, in terms of operating characteristics, is more like a business," 
said Mike Bouvier, planning and building director for the city of Westminster. 
"You have large groups of people coming at the same time and leaving at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Most churches in Westminster are in or near residential areas, Bouvier said, 
and invariably there are complaints from residents about parking and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have a few in industrial zones, and we haven't had any complaints 
regarding those," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine during the past 18 months, all 12 applications to operate a new 
church in that city were for industrial zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many cities prefer that churches stay out of industrial parks, fearing 
they will deter other tax-generating tenants. They also fear that churches, 
which are exempt from property taxes, will erode the property tax base. Garden 
Grove, for instance, has banned churches from industrial zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard enough to find ways to keep our tax base healthy," said Millie 
Summerlin, Garden Grove's planning services manager. "If large amounts of 
commercial space are converted to church use, it harms our ability to support 
community services." 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda recently grappled with that issue when New Hope Church sought 
permission to lease a building in Savi Ranch, a city-planned industrial and 
research and development center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission rejected New Hope's application after considering the 
financial impact the church would have. One commissioner questioned whether the 
city should include churches "within the premiere industrially planned 
community in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council eventually overturned the commission's decision, but only 
after New Hope agreed only to lease and not purchase a building in Savi Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Canyon Family Worship Center, which is on La Palma Avenue east of Yorba 
Linda Boulevard, the flat-roofed, concrete and glass building that houses the 
congregation has nothing in common with the more traditional houses of worship, 
with their bell towers and stained-glass windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, Martin said, can be difficult to accept for those with strong 
traditional church backgrounds, but it is actually an advantage in attracting 
what Martin calls "the unchurched." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people find it easier to walk in here than to go to 
traditional-looking churches," Martin said. "I guess it is less intimidating 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Swearingen, who has attended Canyon Family for a year, said once she is 
inside, she forgets the church is located in an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it has what it needs to be a church -- the spirit and the people -- it 
does not matter where it is located," Swearingen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street from Canyon Family, in a similar building, is Canyon Friends 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pastor Larry Mendenhall began holding services in the building three 
years ago, the church was one of the first in Yorba Linda to locate in the 
light-industrial zone east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that area has become an unofficial church row, with three other 
congregations leasing space in a two-mile stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 New churches "really don't have much of a choice" but to consider industrial 
parks, Mendenhall said. "Developers didn't leave land open for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendenhall figures his congregation saves about $6,000 a month by leasing a 
10,000-square-foot facility in an industrial area rather than in a residential 
or retail zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Martin and Mendenhall said they have been so pleased with their current 
facilities that when their leases expire in the next two to three years, each 
has the same plan: to purchase their own industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in this kind of building might be difficult for those who envision 
church as a place," Martin said. "But we see the church as people."

AUDIT BOLSTERS CITY'S CLAIMS OF PAY ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 An independent audit released Tuesday bolsters allegations by city officials 
that firefighters manipulated loopholes in the overtime pay system at a 
potential cost to the city of hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the audit, prepared by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick after a six-month 
review, suggests that the blame rests as much with the system of management at 
the Fire Department as with the employees who abused it. The report concludes 
that Fire Department managers were "ineffective" in preventing the excessive 
use of overtime through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew there was something wrong, but we are appalled at the depth of the 
abuse," said Mayor Charles V. Smith. "The different schemes that were used to 
turn straight time into overtime is shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman said she thought the report served as "a 
tremendous vindication" for the council's decision to investigate the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this raises some serious moral and ethical issues," Bohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, who are seeking a recall election of Smith and three other 
council members, expressed outrage with the auditor's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's total smoke and screens, and lies and innuendoes," said Paul Gilbrook, a 
firefighter who was recently fired. Gilbrook is appealing that decision. "It's 
an election year and they're trying to keep themselves in office." 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters' attorney, Alan C. Davis, called the report inaccurate and 
unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got their facts totally wrong and are slandering the firefighters," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report submitted to the council Tuesday indicated that some Fire 
Department employees who received $20,000 to $40,000 a year in total overtime 
abused the system, and that some of the pay appears to have been improper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven years that the auditors reviewed, the Fire Department spent $4.8 
million on overtime, with yearly totals starting at $341,000 in 1986 and 
peaking at more than $900,000 in 1990. Last year's total was $661,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Complete records for 1988 were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors did not say how much of those overtime totals may have been 
wrongfully charged, but they concluded that faulty record-keeping appears to 
have routinely resulted in overpayments and double billings at the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of overtime charges does not appear to be the result of large fires 
or other emergencies, but rather (was) caused by payroll and staffing 
practices," the auditors said in their report. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit will be discussed at a public council study session at 11:30 a.m. 
Friday at City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 The report appears likely to strain relations even further between city 
officials and members of the Westminster Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has fired the union's president and suspended a fire captain in 
recent months as problems between the two groups intensified, and the union has 
countered by suing the city and leading a recall effort against Smith and four 
members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert Huntley said a copy of the audit was sent Tuesday 
to the Orange County district attorney's office, which is investigating the 
allegations of overtime fraud to determine whether criminal charges should be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fire Department employees routinely collected overtime for working shifts 
left vacant by staffing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employees took unauthorized "administrative time off," and their shifts were 
then covered through overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * The practice of trading shifts allowed employees to be paid overtime for 
shifts that they did not actually work.

A MATTER OF FLASH -- AND SUBSTANCE; TRIAL: ANTHONY MAGLICA DENIES 'ANY 
COMMITMENTS' TO HIS COMPANION, CLAIRE MAGLICA, AND ASSERTS THAT THE 
$300-MILLION BUSINESS IS ALL HIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 His voice hoarse and straining, flashlight mogul Anthony Maglica said Tuesday 
that he loved Claire Maglica and was always generous in their 23 years together 
as an unmarried couple, but that he never "made any commitments" to her. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked jurors to "listen to his heart" as they judge him in the couple's 
palimony trial, where more than $150 million is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been loving, not only to Claire but to her family, to her children," 
the Anaheim Hills businessman testified in Orange County Superior Court. "Today 
is devastating to me to see that they put me on trial like I am some kind of 
criminal. I have done nothing! I have done nothing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica's testimony came during the second week of a trial over who is 
entitled to the fortune from the Southern California flashlight empire that 
grew from a hole-in-the-wall machine shop since the couple met in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, the 60-year-old executive vice president of Mag Instrument 
Inc., has valued the company at $300 million. She says she deserves half, 
because Anthony promised her they would share everything as they built the 
business together. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony Maglica, 64, counters that he always told her the company and the 
homes they shared belonged to him, and that they signed a property agreement in 
1977 vowing never to merge their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica's attorney called Anthony Maglica to the witness stand Tuesday, 
and repeatedly sought to portray him as a greedy man who will "say anything" to 
keep total control of his money. Drawing on depositions that Anthony Maglica 
gave in lawsuits against the company, attorney John W. Keker showed jurors that 
Anthony had called Claire's daughter his "stepdaughter," and had deferred 
numerous questions about marketing, advertising and packaging to Claire, who, 
he said, handled those departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Keker showed the jury a videotaped deposition that Anthony Maglica gave in a 
palimony case, prodding him to explain why his answers often didn't match up to 
comments he made before the lawsuit was filed in July. Maglica said he did not 
recall many previous comments. 
</P>
<P>
 While he may have deferred to Claire on certain matters, Anthony Maglica said 
Tuesday that she never made any final decisions without his approval, referring 
to her as a "conduit," his "eyes and ears" at Mag and even as his secretary. He 
denied that she was a part-owner or a decision maker.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked on his videotaped deposition why Claire Maglica was the executive, 
Anthony Maglica replied: "Because she's my girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 He elaborated for the jury on Tuesday. "She was someone I can trust -- a 
friend. Someone who would tell me everything that was going on in the company," 
said Anthony Maglica, a Croatian immigrant who apologized several times to 
jurors for his broken English and lack of formal education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maglicas were known by presidents and socialites from Orange County to 
Europe as a married couple, although they never married. Years ago, Claire took 
on Anthony Maglica's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony said that despite the lawsuit, he has not kept Claire from the 
couple's Anaheim Hills home and continues to support Claire's grandchildren in 
private school and her wheelchair-bound brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica testified that she believed that Anthony considered her a 
part-owner and would share all assets with her, until she learned in 1992 that 
he was trying to secretly transfer stock into his children's names. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Anthony Maglica said he could not recall the specific 
confrontation with Claire that she said stemmed from that discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he talked about his feelings for his children from his first 
marriage, and the guilt he feels for being an absentee father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent my life in that shop that they now try to steal away from me," he 
testified as two of his sons and his daughter sat in the courtroom. "I didn't 
play with my kids baseball. I didn't take my daughter to the prom. All my life 
I was in the shop. I gave more help to Claire and her children than I did to 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Keker asserted that the evidence showed the couple acted as "a team" from the 
beginning. He pointed to homeowner's insurance policies that name Anthony and 
Claire as beneficiaries, and insurance policies for Mag that covered Anthony 
and Claire "only with respect to their ownership interests in the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica denied that Claire had any interest in the company or the 
houses that they shared. "The business is all mine. The houses are mine," he 
said.

SUPPORTER OF COYOTE TRAPPING QUITS PANEL; WILDLIFE: LYNNE EXE SAYS THE ANIMAL 
REGULATION COMMISSION IS 'CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL INTERESTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles animal regulation commissioner from the San Fernando Valley 
resigned Tuesday, saying animal rights advocates have unduly influenced the 
panel, particularly its policy to ban coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Exe submitted her resignation to Mayor Richard Riordan seven months 
after she was confirmed to the panel by a split vote of the City Council amid 
sharp criticism from animal rights advocates. Her resignation from the 
five-member commission is effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken control," Exe said, referring to animal rights groups. "The 
commission is controlled by special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Exe has been the lone voice of support for coyote trapping on the commission, 
which voted 10 months ago to end the practice at the behest of animal rights 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that despite complaints from Valley residents about coyote attacks on 
pets, the commission has refused to consider lifting the trapping ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Robins, president of the commission, declined to comment on Exe's 
accusations. "I don't have any comment and I wish her well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's spokesperson, said Tuesday that the mayor had not 
read Exe's resignation letter and could not comment on her accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Nate Holden, who nominated Exe to the panel, called her 
allegations "disturbing" and said he plans to call the Animal Regulation 
Department's general manager, Gary Olsen, to answer her charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bell, vice president of the Wildlife Protection League and vocal 
supporter of the trapping ban, called Exe's allegations "laughable, not even 
worth addressing." 
</P>
<P>
 He fired off his own allegations, accusing Exe of being inflexible on the 
issue of coyote trapping. "I am thrilled that she is no longer going to be on 
the commission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Exe was confirmed to the commission by the council in an 8-3 
vote despite harsh criticism by animal rights groups who said she was out of 
step with efforts to reform the Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Exe has been at odds with the other four members of the 
commission who have expressed support for the trapping ban. A final decision, 
however, is pending a 60-day study of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, from the very first day of my tenure, other members of this 
commission, with agenda formed by vested special interest groups, have thwarted 
any attempts at rational humane animal care and control and conscientious 
public policy," Exe said in her resignation letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Exe also said she resigned because she believes that fellow 
Commissioner Gini Barrett should not be on the panel because she is a vice 
president with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the Animal Regulation Department cannot investigate charges of 
animal abuse in the movie and television industry as long as Barrett is on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the city's Ethics Commission -- prompted by Exe's charges 
-- cleared Barrett of any conflict of interest. Barrett could not be reached 
for comment.

GLENDALE OKS PLAN TO TRAP AND KILL PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to stem a burgeoning pigeon population in Glendale's downtown 
business district, the City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to trap and kill 
hundreds of the pesky fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is the first in Los Angeles County to adopt such a sweeping measure, 
which sparked concern among animal rights activists but won support among some 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Park pigeons are the roaches of the sky," said Dr. David Wallace, who spoke 
in favor of the measure at a council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote authorizes the city to contract with Los Angeles County to catch and 
kill the birds. Under the terms of the contract, traps containing food and 
water will be placed on downtown business and restaurant rooftops by the end of 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 These traps, which hold up to 40 live fowl, will be emptied twice a week. The 
pigeons will be taken to the Los Angeles County Medical and Veterinary Services 
center, where they will be tested for disease and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pigeons have overtaken downtown office buildings and eateries, messing 
awnings, ledges and benches and ruining the Civic Center's appearance, said 
George Miller, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he is concerned that residents will contract contagious diseases 
-- notably tuberculosis and salmonella -- from bird droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is not the only Southern California city to adopt a pigeon control 
program, but most other municipalities do not kill the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles contracts with the county to place a sticky bird repellent on 
ledges and rooftops to deter pigeons from landing on the Los Angeles mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Diego reduced its pigeon population in Balboa Park from 8,000 
to 1,000 by spiking pigeon corn feed with a birth control substance. San 
Clemente used a similar method to slow population increases in a flock 
inhabiting the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Management by death, a practice utilized over a thousand years, does not work 
and is not supported by scientific data," said Michael Bell, vice president of 
the Wildlife Protection League, which has an office in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Press, a biologist with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in 
Washington, D. C., said pigeons are tenacious and will return to areas where 
there are traps, but not to places where they cannot sit and roost, Press said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said alternative measures to killing the birds include playing tapes of 
bird calls to lure them away or frighten them, or placing nets above ledges and 
balconies to keep the birds from landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is avoiding such measures because they simply relocate the determined 
birds from one area of the city to another, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to cope with urban pigeon populations because residents feed 
the birds -- directly contributing to the current population increase, said 
Richard Wightman, deputy agricultural commissioner for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Wightman said that while no other municipalities have asked the county to trap 
and kill pigeons, several businesses and condominium associations have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, officials expect to be able to remove 90% of the downtown flock, 
according to a report presented to the council. The city will pay the county 
$23,000 for the first year of eradication services, and about $3,000 thereafter 
to maintain the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at Tuesday's council meeting offered other eradication alternatives 
to the council, including plastic owls and falcons meant to frighten pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed with the council vote and asked that officials also discuss 
removing crows that frequent hillside areas and scare away songbirds.

QUAKE THROWS OFF TAX TIMING; DEADLINE: UNINSURED LOSSES CAN BE CLAIMED ON 
EITHER 1993 OR 1994 RETURNS. IRS AND STATE EXPECT MANY REQUESTS FOR FILING 
EXTENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With Friday the deadline for filing income taxes, the disaster-weary can at 
least look forward to some tax relief: Uninsured casualty losses from the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake -- as well as from last fall's fires and mudslides -- 
are deductible on individuals' federal and state returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because the Northridge quake was declared a federal disaster, 
victims of the temblor can choose to take those losses on either their 1993 or 
1994 returns. That is a major advantage for people who expect their 1994 
incomes to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But doing all this additional figuring can take time -- which is why many 
people are expected to ask the Internal Revenue Service and California 
Franchise Tax Board for filing extensions this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt there will be a lot more extensions than usual," predicted Paul 
White, a partner in the Sherman Oaks accounting firm White, Zuckerman, 
Warsavsky and Luna. Among his own clients, "more people who usually file early 
are at least waiting until the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 White's firm is temporarily renting offices in Burbank because the quake 
demolished the accountants' headquarters. The firm was relieved, he said, when 
it was able to find or recover all the records needed to prepare its clients' 
1993 returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But many taxpayers haven't been so lucky, losing important documents that they 
need to file their 1040s because the quake damaged their houses or local post 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every client I've worked with has lost at least some records," 
said Alan Kennan, a tax partner in the Los Angeles office of accounting firm 
Grant Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 Others will have to file extension requests with the IRS (Form 4868), because 
"they are still waiting for the simplest of records," said Elaine Blackman, tax 
manager at White, Zuckerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those records may include W-2s from their employers or 1099s showing 
investment income, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, "the government basically expects you to reconstruct your 
income and deductions for 1993," Kennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could probably do most of it by getting copies of all the checks you 
wrote during the year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If people still end up having to guess at, say, how much they gave to charity 
in 1993, label it an estimate, he advised. But they should be conservative, he 
said, because the government will check it carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a person making $100,000 a year and you said you made $5,000 of 
charitable donations last year, an auditor would say that's reasonable," said 
Kennan. "But if you said you (made) $50,000, you better have proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Even figuring out your deductible casualty loss can be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "First you have to get a real estate appraiser to tell you what the value of 
your property was before the disaster and after," Kennan said. The difference 
is your tentative loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance payments must be subtracted from that tentative loss, producing a 
net loss figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch: To be deductible, casualty losses must exceed 10% of 
your adjusted gross income -- basically income before itemized deductions -- 
plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennan offers this example: 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose the quake caused extensive damage to a house that was worth $300,000 
before the shaker, leaving it worth only $200,000 when the shaking stopped. The 
homeowner's tentative casualty loss would be $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtracting $30,000 of insurance payments produces a net loss of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we look at this homeowner's adjusted gross income and find it was 
$200,000," said Kennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtracting $20,000, or 10% of $200,000, from $70,000 results in a net loss of 
$50,000. Finally, "we subtract $100, which gives us a deductible casualty loss 
of $49,100." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has introduced federal legislation to 
make uninsured losses 100% deductible for victims of declared national 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) has authored a 
bill that would provide identical relief for disaster victims on their state 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither bill is expected to pass by Friday, spokesmen for Berman and Rosenthal 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the proposed legislation is enacted later, taxpayers entitled to 
the bigger write-offs could file amended returns. The tax breaks would apply to 
losses on declared disasters that occurred on or after Jan. 17, the day of the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding whether to take the limited loss that is available now this year or 
next year may be easy for people faced with extensive rebuilding -- but still 
waiting for disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how badly do you need cash now?" said Kennan. "Fixing your 
house may be more important than waiting a year to get a bigger deduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Requesting an extension to sort all this out before filing taxes can provide 
nearly six months' reprieve -- to Oct. 14 this year, since Oct. 15 falls on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with a filing extension, the IRS and the California Franchise Tax 
Board still expect checks for about 90% of the amount owed to be in the mail by 
midnight this Friday, April 15. And although it is possible to get an extension 
for paying federal taxes, it is certainly not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely difficult," said Harvey Bookstein, managing partner of Los 
Angeles accountants Roth Bookstein & Zaslow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstein, who lives in Tarzana, suffered about $400,000 of quake damage 
himself. He has already decided to take his casualty loss in 1994, when he 
expects his income to be lower than it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's absolutely impossible to even borrow to pay your federal taxes, you 
can file an "Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax" (form 1127) 
by midnight Friday. Accountants say the IRS usually will agree to negotiate 
some kind of payment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The state does not grant extensions per se, said Franchise Tax Board spokesman 
Jim Shepherd. But he said that people with quake damage should make the state 
aware of their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is assessed a penalty for filing late or paying late and it was 
because of the earthquake, we will be lenient if they protest the penalty," 
Shepherd said. "We're the same way when there is any type of catastrophe." Help

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CAPTAIN DIES IN FALL WHILE WATER SKIING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Scott (Woody) Pollak, a well-known captain with a local marine 
assistance company, was killed Tuesday in a water-skiing accident two miles off 
Crystal Cove, the Sheriff's Harbor Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the effort to save the 34-year-old captain's life was similar to 
efforts Pollak himself had participated in with his firm, Costa Mesa-based 
Vessel Assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak of Newport Beach was free-boarding (water skiing on a board) behind the 
Vessel Assist 1 when he fell at 11:45 a.m., according to Lt. Dick Olson. When 
the 30-foot boat circled back for him, he was floating face-down in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Two friends aboard, Bob Upson Jr. of Costa Mesa and Robert Elston of Irvine, 
sent a Mayday call on the boat's marine radio while administering CPR, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Harbor Patrol and the Newport Beach Fire Department's fireboat 
arrived and medical personnel administered aid to Pollak, Olson said. Pollak 
was taken to Hoag Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just after 1 p.m. The 
cause of death was not immediately known, but an autopsy will be performed 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 "Woody was very well-known throughout the harbor area for his assistance to 
boats contracting for his help," Olson said. "He was also very well-known to 
the Sheriff's Harbor Patrol deputies along the Orange County coast and well 
respected for his professional expertise and friendly manner. He will be 
greatly missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, when two Marine Corps helicopter collided off Santa Catalina 
Island, Pollak helped in the rescue of the four surviving crew members, leaving 
his vessel to take over another rescue boat where medical aid was being 
administered to survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak's "willingness to assume the responsibility of boat operator of the 
Baywatch Avalon rescue boat made it possible for an additional paramedic on 
board the fishing vessel 'De Brum' and help in the rescue effort and 
stabilization of those who were injured," wrote Stan Wisniewski and Don Rohrer, 
of the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good to know that in an emergency, there are people like Captain Pollak 
who are willing to render aid and volunteer their services," the lifeguards 
wrote.MARK I. PINSKY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; PANEL GIVES OK TO PROJECT'S ZONE CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hills housing development for senior citizens and low-income families 
moved one step closer to reality Tuesday when a Los Angeles City Council 
committee approved a needed zone change. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the council's Planning and Land Use Management committee marks 
the second time in less than a week that city officials have voiced support for 
the $4.25-million project, which would be built in a vacant lot on Parthenia 
Street by the nonprofit Los Angeles Community Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an outstanding project," said City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents 
the area. "Children need older people to act as surrogate grandparents and 
seniors need young people to interact with." 
</P>
<P>
 The full City Council will consider the change within the next few weeks, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the City Council approved $1.6 million in loans for the 25-unit 
affordable housing apartment complex, which also includes a child-care center. 
The loans include a $700,000 two-year loan and a $900,000 40-year loan, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other funding includes long-term loans of $1.88 million from the state's 
Family Housing Demonstration Project and $1.4 million from the California 
Equity Fund, an investment group. The state loan, when received, will be used 
to pay off the $700,000 city loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex is the first such venture by the nonprofit group into the San 
Fernando Valley, said Ann Sewill, the agency's executive director. The group 
runs 24 other such low-cost housing projects in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income seniors will live in eight of the apartments, with the remaining 
units occupied by families who qualify for affordable housing. Seniors will 
also be encouraged to volunteer in the child-care center, which will be 
licensed for 36 children and be open to tenants and non-tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed so seniors could have privacy but not be isolated," Sewill 
said. "They can go participate with the families if they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Sewill said about 40 people have already expressed interest in the project, 
with construction expected to begin this summer. But not everyone in the 
community is supportive.  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Swan, president of the North Hills Community Coordinating Council, a 
non-governmental advisory group of business and community leaders, criticized 
the City Council for pouring money into new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many vacant apartments in North Hills," Swan said. "They should 
take the money to revitalize existing apartment buildings and provide more 
police officers." JEFF SCHNAUFER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; FREE SURGERY GIVES BLIND RETIREE SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A retired engineer, blinded by cataracts, got a free operation that has 
restored the vision in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Kempkens, 65, lost sight in his right eye three years ago, but worried 
that surgery was too experimental to risk. Then in March, he also lost sight in 
his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stumbling around for a month," Kempkens said. "I could mostly help 
myself because I knew where everything was, but when I went outside the house 
it was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he used the red-painted curbs to guide himself to the market, he 
said, but after two weeks he could no longer see a hand in front of his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Eye doctor Roger Ohanesian heard about Kempkens' case from an outreach worker 
at the Laguna Beach Senior Center. "It's very rare to see cataracts as advanced 
as his in this country," Ohanesian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cataracts form when the protein strands that make up the eye's lens break into 
pieces, Ohanesian said. Instead of being clear, the lens becomes cloudy and 
opaque like a piece of wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In 25 years of practice as an eye doctor, Ohanesian said he has never seen a 
patient who was blind in both eyes from a reversible condition. Kempkens, a 
Laguna Beach resident, said he had resigned himself to the blindness until a 
neighbor saw him stumbling down the street and persuaded him to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 The cataract was so advanced that Ohanesian needed three hours, instead of the 
routine 20 minutes, to surgically remove Kempkens' faulty eye lens and replace 
it with a plastic lens. Kempkens said he was able to read a newspaper the same 
day, April 1, that he got the surgery. He is scheduled to have his left eye 
lens replaced next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohanesian pronounced the right eye healthy when he saw Kempkens last week at 
his San Juan Capistrano office. Kempkens has almost perfect vision in one eye 
now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a total surprise to me, because I see more colors than I even could 
three years," Kempkens said. "Things are so bright that I have to wear special 
sunshades." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohanesian, who also performs free eye surgeries in Armenia, where his 
grandparents came from, said he was happy to do the work without charge. 
"Here's a person in our country who can obviously use the help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempkens said he wants to pay Ohanesian back by designing a mobile eye surgery 
center, perhaps built into a trailer, for use in rural areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Kempkens had led an active life until he lost vision in his left eye. He was 
even a volunteer firefighter, and helped lay hose for firefighters during the 
Laguna Beach wildfires, he said. "I could still see everything, but I couldn't 
see small objects," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, Kempkens has worked as a gardener, a painter, a 
picture framer and a repairman. Since he has no insurance and little savings, 
he would have had great difficulty in paying for the eye surgery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempkens said there were some aspects of his monthlong blindness that he 
appreciated. "My other senses started picking up," he said. "I almost developed 
a kind of radar. You don't have any distractions. And of course you don't watch 
TV."WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; RAMS, CITY CLOSER TO PRACTICE FIELD ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for the city and the Rams are close to resolving a protracted 
lease dispute over the team's practice facility, officials confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the renewed negotiations are aimed at heading off a court 
eviction process that was started last week by Magnolia School District, which 
owns the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have made significant progress, but nothing is over until it is 
over," City Manager James D. Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly agreed that "the door remains open" and "progress has been 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth, Daly and other city officials declined to discuss how the two sides are 
planning to resolve the dispute, but sources close to the negotiations say the 
Rams have apparently reconsidered their position and are prepared to accept the 
city's last offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that offer, the city would subsidize about $3 million of the team's rent 
over the course of a 15-year lease. The Rams would be able to break the lease 
at any time provided they give at least six months' notice, pay $220,000 and 
restore the practice site to its original condition. The city agreed to pay 
about half of the estimated $1.2 million to $1.5 million in restoration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. But 
city officials said the district had indicated it would consider dropping the 
eviction lawsuit if the city and Rams reached an agreement soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, senior vice president for the Rams, said the team's attorneys 
have contacted the city about settling the lease dispute. He said the attorneys 
will meet with the city today for further negotiations. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district owns the site, the city leases the property from 
the district and then sublets it to the Rams. That lease, however, expired Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
 City and district officials have tried for months to accommodate the Rams' 
concerns about the lease extension. Three separate deadlines had been set and 
extended in an effort to resolve the matter amicably. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, district officials filed suit to evict the team from the 
premises because they said it was clear that the team did not want to practice 
on their property.  
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over extending the team's lease for the practice facility has 
come to represent the rift that has grown between the city and Rams. Team 
officials have said they will exercise an escape clause in their Anaheim 
Stadium lease May 3 and look to move the team to a city that offers greater 
financial opportunities. MATT LAIT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; PROGRAM HELPS STUDENTS BEAT TEMBLOR BLUES 
</P>

 It's a prescription nearly every child can swallow: To reduce earthquake 
stress, mix one part drumming and one part singing with one part pretending to 
be a turtle. Add clapping and stomping to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of elementary school children across the San Fernando Valley are 
taking a dose of rock 'n' roll to ease anxieties induced by the earth's rocking 
and rolling on Jan. 17, thanks to the music therapy department at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to use music and rhythm to calm fears raised by the 6.8 magnitude 
Northridge earthquake. On Tuesday, three CSUN music therapy students visited El 
Dorado Avenue Elementary School in Sylmar, armed with drums and the will to 
endure as much noise as a room full of third- and fourth-graders could make. 
</P>
<P>
 The students pounded mallets against paddle drums with all the fervor their 
bodies could muster. The classroom vibrated with a growling rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drumming sounds like the earthquake," said 10-year-old Christine 
Valencia, who was staying with her grandmother when the pre-dawn quake struck 
-- in a house that was later condemned. "This helps people be a little calmer 
so they won't be scared anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Borczon, director of the music therapy department at CSUN, said the 
drumming helps children channel their anxieties about the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music is an energy release as well as being fun," he said. "It helps them 
put emotional concepts into something they can see and feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old music therapy department teaches students how to treat 
patients with a variety of physical, intellectual and emotional disabilities 
through music. The earthquake presentation marks the first time students in the 
department have worked with public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake program, which involves six CSUN students, will last until 
mid-May and involve 20 San Fernando Valley schools.  
</P>
<P>
 It is funded with a portion of a grant for elementary school music programs 
that was awarded to the Valley Cultural Center by the Los Angeles-based 
Weingart Foundation. The about 70 drums were bought at a substantial discount 
from a North Hollywood drum manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Dorado, in addition to pounding the drums, the students imagined 
themselves as turtles crawling on the ground, feeling safe within their shells. 
</P>
<P>
 They sang a rap song encouraging themselves to accept that the earth moves 
sometimes:  
</P>
<P>
 "When the earth shifts/  
</P>
<P>
 just move your feet/  
</P>
<P>
 and clap to the rhythm of Mother Earth's beat."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CRITICS FAULT AIRPORT NOISE IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Airport is expanding its system for monitoring aircraft noise 
levels, but residents say it does not go far enough to reduce the annoying buzz 
of airplanes and helicopters over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Beard, noise-management manager for the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports, said the mostly complete, $1.3-million expansion of the airport's 
noise monitoring system is allowing the facility to track large airplanes' 
flight paths and identify their type and ownership, in addition to measuring 
their noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, Beard and other airport officials explained the new system's 
capabilities to an advisory group -- made up of homeowners, pilots and members 
of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council -- that is concerned with 
noise issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The system's four new computers will enable the airport to identify which 
aircraft are violating the rule stating that they cannot exceed 74 decibels of 
noise. Beard said that another department is devising ways to enforce the rule, 
and that "a letter could be written" to the owner of a transgressing plane or 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is part of a $2.3-million, comprehensive revamping of the noise 
monitoring systems at three airports -- Van Nuys, Los Angeles International 
Airport and Ontario International Airport.  
</P>
<P>
 Beard said the system, which he described as 75% operational, has limits. 
According to the official, it will only be able to identify large airplanes, 
not small airplanes and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mack, president of the West Van Nuys Homeowners Assn., said he was glad 
that residents calling the airport's noise hot line will no longer have to 
provide the offending aircraft's identification number and flight path when 
lodging a complaint, but voiced concern about what he called a lack of 
enforcement provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no penalties for aircraft that deviate from the aircraft flight 
regulations," he said. KAY HWANGBO

 State investigators closed the inn on April 1 because its liquor license 
expired on Dec. 31 and was never renewed, said Marianne Eckhoff, the 
supervising investigator for the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control. The annual cost of renewing a license is $495 if done on time, Eckhoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckhoff said the department sent several letters to the license holder, Angelo 
Tomeo, at the inn at 34094 Pacific Coast Highway, offering him several 
extensions, but received no response. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department had no alternative but to revoke the license for non-renewal, 
just like someone who doesn't renew a driver's license," Eckhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckhoff added that "I don't foresee this license being resurrected" because 
the period has passed when a license can be renewed. A new license will now 
have to be purchased at a minimal cost of $12,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's expensive, we make many attempts to try and find the licensees," 
Eckhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomeo could not be reached for comment. His only known address was at the inn 
itself, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was part of the problem, we never could find him," Sheriff's Deputy Joe 
Homs said of Tomeo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Inn was the source of numerous complaints from nearby residents for 
noise and occasional fighting in the parking lot, Homs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homs said the Harbor Inn was the first place in the city ever to have its 
license revoked, although the nearby Caribbean nightclub lost its license a 
year ago when its owner died. 
</P>
<P>
 The building that housed the Harbor Inn has been in business since the early 
1950s and originally was a restaurant and bar called Doc and Joe's, according 
to local historians. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; ELEMENTARY STUDENTS MAY FACE TRANSFERS

<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District is considering forcing about 100 
students who attend the overcrowded Mariposa and Arovista elementary schools to 
go to schools with smaller student populations next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The students who would be transferred do not live in the attendance areas for 
Mariposa and Arovista elementary schools, school officials said.Some live 
outside Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved, the students who do not live in the city would be 
transferred to either Laurel, Fanning, Brea Country Hills or Olinda elementary 
schools, whose classes are not overcrowded. Students who are residents of the 
city and are going to Arovista or Mariposa will be sent to their neighborhood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 690 students attend Arovista and 615 attend Mariposa. The maximum 
recommended enrollment is 650 at Arovista and 600 at Mariposa. School officials 
said they expect the two schools' student populations to grow within the next 
few years because housing projects in their attendance areas are being 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no room right now at these two schools for local growth," Assistant 
Supt. Gary D. Goff said. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving the students who attend Arovista and Mariposa on inter- and 
intra-district transfers, room would be created for new students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members may allow students who live on Elm Street, Date Street 
and Cedar Avenue to remain at Arovista. Pepper Tree Drive residents currently 
enrolled in Mariposa may be allowed to stay there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Any resident who moves to Elm, Date or Cedar would be required to attend 
Laurel, and new Pepper Tree residents would be required to attend Fanning. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the boundary changes is planned for Monday and board 
members are expected to make a decision May 2.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE GIVE PRECIOUS GIFT TO OFFICER: TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach police have donated more than 1,500 hours of their own vacation 
time and overtime to a fellow officer whose wife was stricken with brain 
cancer. The donations will allow Officer Bob Rivers, 37, to spend more time 
with his wife, Sheri, and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do something for the family so they could share time together," 
said Sgt. Andy Gonis. "We hope this helps them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Rivers developed breast cancer in 1986 and has been battling the disease 
ever since. In 1992, she developed lung cancer but was treated successfully 
with a bone marrow transplant. Last year the cancer recurred, this time in her 
brain and liver. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be told that her life is slipping away is not as hard for Sheri to 
tolerate as to face the realization that she cannot continue the wonderful job 
that she has done in raising our children," Bob Rivers said in an open letter 
to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When colleagues learned of the couple's situation, they worked Bob Rivers' 
overnight patrol shift for several months. Eventually, they developed a 
personal leave "time bank" that allows officers to donate their vacation time 
and overtime to Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers worked for the department for nearly a decade in the 1980s before 
leaving to earn a law degree. He returned to the department about two years 
ago. Because of his brief tenure, he has accumulated little paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the donations, Rivers would receive no pay for the time off he is 
spending with his family, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Rivers said his family was moved by the generosity of the 
officers, whom he described as an "extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can never express our gratitude enough for the selfless and caring 
contributions that the Newport Beach Police Department has given us," Rivers 
wrote. "Our family was deeply moved by this compassionate display by the men 
and women I work with every day."SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MAYOR TO LOBBY FOR CRIME BILL IN D.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson will travel to Washington today to lobby for a 
federal anti-crime bill that could give the city much-needed money to hire 
police officers and develop crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more police -- there's no doubt about it," Moulton-Patterson said 
Tuesday after a morning news conference at City Hall. "I'm fighting for 
anything I can do in the area of public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson announced her plans to attend a White House meeting Thursday 
with President Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, and she will meet later with 
House leaders, including members of Orange County's congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, who said she is paying for her trip, added that she wants to call 
for swift passage of an anti-crime bill that would provide $23 billion 
nationwide to local governments. Congress is expected to vote on the bill this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials said the measure would provide funds not only for 
new police officers, but also for crime prevention measures, youth recreation 
and training programs, drug rehabilitation, and new prisons and "boot camps" 
for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bill is extremely important -- that's why I'm making the trip," 
Moulton-Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said that Orange County cities would benefit from the bill's passage 
because local law enforcement agencies need more money for anti-crime efforts, 
including putting more police officers on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Police Chief Ronald Lowenberg said that if the bill were passed, such 
criteria as a city's crime rate, level of poverty and unemployment rate would 
be factors in how cities receive money. Because Huntington Beach's crime rate 
is not high enough, he said, the city would not meet the criteria under the 
pending bill to receive money for new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not going to give up on that," he said, adding that the city plans 
to lobby for federal money to hire officers anyway. The city is hoping that 
provisions of the bill affecting funding criteria will be changed before it is 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson said it is not known how much Huntington Beach would receive 
if the bill were passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, she said, would provide assistance to cities nationwide over a 
five-year period. The money would come from cutbacks in the federal payroll -- 
not from increasing taxes, the mayor added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it results in adding one DARE (drug abuse education) officer, the 
trip will be worth it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said that at a time when the city faces budget woes and rising rates 
of violent offenses and gang problems, "every dollar helps" in fighting crime.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 'BIRD LADY' MOTHERS NEWBORN BARN OWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week has brought newborn crying and late-night feedings at Susan 
Doggett's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Doggett is caring for four baby barn owls, two of which hatched early Monday 
morning amid a chorus of "squats" and "quacks." The two other owls remained 
inside their golf ball-sized shells. 
</P>
<P>
 The babies eat a steady diet of mashed mouse meat and live inside a makeshift 
incubator that sits on the breakfast bar of Doggett's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like baby food," said Doggett, 40, known to friends as the "Bird 
Lady of Orange" because she nurses sick fowl. "To get up at 3 a.m. to serve 
them cut-up mice is really something. It's as close to motherhood as I've 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 The hatched owls are about the size of a quarter but will eventually grow to 
be a foot tall with a wing span of three feet, Doggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their appetites will increase with age too -- an adult owl eats up to a dozen 
rodents in one night. 
</P>
<P>
 The owl eggs were discovered in a nest Sunday by an electrician repairing a 
sign at Riverside Municipal Airport. The mother owl was apparently frightened 
by the worker and became separated from the nest, Doggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barn owls are fairly common to urban areas, attracted by rodents who roam 
through the garbage. The owls are protected by federal and state laws. Keeping 
one of the birds in captivity can bring a $1,000 fine, Doggett said. Doggett 
holds a license from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that allows her to care 
for sick birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon discovering the nest, the electrician called the Pacific Wildlife Project 
for help. The project referred him to Doggett, who is known throughout Southern 
California for her work with sick birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The first owl was hatched inside an incubator at the electrician's home Sunday 
night, prompting him and his wife to drive the entire five-egg nest to 
Doggett's home in Orange. A second owl hatched Monday morning and a third was 
stillborn. Two others remain in their shells and are expected to hatch within 
the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery began a long morning punctuated by the cries of the baby owls, 
who have pink flesh, white fuzz and hooked beaks. The owls have two distinct 
types of cries: a loud cackle that signifies hunger and a soft twitter they 
sound whenever the heat in the incubator is increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The twitter means they are trying to call their mother," Doggett said. "It's 
like an acknowledgment of Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 The owls join a house filled with more than a dozen various birds cared for by 
Doggett.  
</P>
<P>
 "They will learn to be barn owls, not people," she said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY OKS 2 LOANS FOR PUBLIC HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two low-income-housing projects in Irvine and Fullerton won nearly $3 million 
in construction loans Tuesday from the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Without discussion, supervisors gave unanimous endorsements for both housing 
plans, which would provide a total of 328 units designed primarily for the 
county's single, working-poor population. 
</P>
<P>
 Dhongchai (Bob) Pusavat, the county's housing and redevelopment director, said 
the projects have the potential of aiding thousands of low-income residents in 
need of shelter over the next several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 6,000 people are on the county's list for housing assistance, and 
candidates must wait an average of four years for vacancies within the county 
public housing system. The Irvine and Fullerton plans are key to the county's 
overall public housing strategy, which has seen the development of 1,400 units 
in the past three years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the projects, county funding was seen as especially critical 
because it sealed sensitive financing packages involving the private developers 
and participating cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a deal breaker, had (the loans) not passed the board," 
Pusavat said. "I'm confident that these (projects) will be there for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The new complexes in Irvine and Fullerton will be operated like hotel-style 
efficiencies to house predominantly single people or married couples who earn 
less than half the county's median income -- less than $18,450 for individuals. 
Units are expected to rent for less than $400 a month in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, more than 300 people have expressed interest in the 136 units to 
be built at 224 E. Commonwealth Ave., city redevelopment administrator Ken 
O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very strong demand," O'Leary said. "The developer is planning on 
doing everything it takes to open up within a year. This is really going faster 
than most projects." 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.2-million Fullerton facility will be developed by Urban Communities/San 
Gabriel Partners of Costa Mesa. Under terms of the agreement, the county will 
lend $900,000 to the developer for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine project calls for the construction of 192 units on a 2.4-acre site 
at Warner and Jamboree roads, next to the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. 
Location of the facility in the city's industrial district had been cause for 
some controversy, but city officials gave final approval to it in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will lend Irvine Inn developer Shawntana Management Corp. $2 
million toward the total $9.7-million project cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In both Irvine and Fullerton, as in previous housing developments, the county 
has joined with cities and private firms to help pay for the facilities, some 
specifically designed for families, the elderly, physically disabled or single 
and married residents who cannot afford market-rate housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In those cases, the county has provided low-interest loans with terms of 
repayment deferred up to four years to help spur construction of low-income 
housing. KEVIN JOHNSON

QUAKE-DAMAGED OIL PIPELINE WILL REMAIN CLOSED INDEFINITELY; ENVIRONMENT: 
RESIDENTS AND OFFICIALS APPLAUD ATLANTIC RICHFIELD'S DECISION. THE LINE RUNS 
THROUGH THE VALLEY TO SOUTH BAY REFINERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An aging oil pipeline that sustained extensive damage in the Northridge 
earthquake -- including a crack that sent walls of flame through a Mission 
Hills neighborhood -- will remain out of commission indefinitely, its owners 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line, which connects Kern County oil fields to 
South Bay refineries, originally was scheduled to reopen by May 1. But 
executives of Atlantic Richfield Co., which owns the line, decided to put 
repairs on hold so they could further study costs and safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spokesman Scott Loll said the company is considering a number of options 
regarding the 70-year-old pipeline -- including shutting down for good the 
54-mile stretch that runs under densely populated communities between Newhall 
and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a possibility we are not ruling out," Loll said, acknowledging that 
Arco eventually wants to reopen the remainder of the pipeline north of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Jan. 17 6.8-magnitude temblor, the 10-inch diameter pipe ruptured 
in several places. Most notably, a spill into the Santa Clara River near 
Valencia killed hundreds of fish and birds and a leak near O'Melveny Elementary 
School in San Fernando fueled fires along Wolfskill Street that destroyed cars 
and homes and seriously injured a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents and elected officials in Los Angeles and San Fernando feared 
similar leaks if the line was allowed to reopen without thorough testing and 
repairs. They applauded Tuesday's announcement, hoping it would allow more time 
to discuss alternatives with Arco executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, president of the Los Angeles Unified School District board, 
said Arco's decision "brings a lot of relief. I think it is an incredible 
announcement on the part of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando City Councilman Doude Wysbeek said: "I think the company 
recognizes that they were wrong about the quality of the pipeline and that if 
they are going to be good neighbors they are going to have to go beyond state 
mandates and go the extra mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek added that Arco's action reflected an encouraging change in the way 
the company deals with concerns raised by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us can do business the way we used to," he said. "In the old days, 
the golden rule was, 'Those who have the gold make the rules.' That has 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Loll acknowledged, however, that part of the decision to postpone repairs was 
based on the amount of oil the line was pumping before the January earthquake. 
In other words, it may not be profitable to reopen the line south of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Corners pipe is a "common carrier," which means other oil companies 
pay a fee to ship their product through it. The line had already been shut down 
when the quake hit, and the oil that leaked was residue in the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The state fire marshal, who has jurisdiction over oil pipelines, identified 20 
miles of the Four Corners pipe between Newhall and Carson that needed upgrading 
after the quake. Loll estimated replacement costs at about $1 million per mile 
and said Arco has already spent $20 million to clean up spills caused by 
cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact that it was not operating at full capacity 24 hours a day, we 
are evaluating it," Loll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, oil has been shipped along another Four Corners pipeline that 
also runs through the San Fernando Valley. Loll said the company would continue 
to reroute oil through that line until it determines how best to proceed.

WATER RATES MAY REMAIN LOW THIS SUMMER; UTILITIES: COUNCIL PANEL MAKES 
RECOMMENDATION IN RESPONSE TO COMPLAINTS FROM VALLEY RESIDENTS OVER HIGH BILLS 
LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to a flood of complaints from San Fernando Valley residents over 
high water bills last summer, a Los Angeles City Council committee recommended 
Tuesday that the city extend lower winter water rates through this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter rates, which are about 28% lower for heavy water users than summer 
rates, are a stopgap until a special water rates panel appointed by the mayor 
devises a permanent rate system that addresses Valley residents' criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee unanimously supported the 
recommendation to extend the lower winter rates, but the proposal is expected 
to spark harsh debate when it comes before the entire City Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The water rate structure imposed last year had two tiers, a high rate for 
customers who use more than twice the median amount of water, and a lower rate 
for smaller users. It was designed to promote water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Valley, where lots tend to be larger and summers tend to be hotter, 
residents raised a furor when they began to receive summer water bills ranging 
from $500 to $900. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism over the rate structure, Sandy Brown, co-chairwoman of the 
Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee on Water Rates, said her group will probably 
recommend a permanent rate system that retains the two-tier approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still looking favorably at a two-tier system," she told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the northeast Valley, blasted the 
two-tier structure, saying it forces Valley residents to pay more than their 
share for water. He promised to lobby the council to impose a permanent rate 
structure that charges the same amount for each billing unit, regardless of how 
much water is used. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is only one fair and equitable solution," he said. "Pay for what you 
use, and have everyone pay the same rate. I will not stand for one part of the 
city subsidizing the other any longer."  
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, including Mike Hernandez, who represents central Los 
Angeles, have backed the two-tier structure because they say it forces high 
water users to conserve water.

<P>
 At least 11 high-ranking officials on the city staff, including police and 
public works administrators, soon will be jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members this week unanimously voted to eliminate their positions 
in an effort to help balance the city's budget. The layoffs will save the city 
about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials last month discovered that the city is facing an additional 
$238,000 shortfall in this fiscal year's budget of $15.4 million and a 
$1-million deficit in the 1994-95 budget, which is estimated at $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to lay off a police captain and a communications supervisor and 
eliminate a lieutenant's position and a sergeant's post, which are both vacant, 
made residents angry. "When someone comes into your house with rape on their 
mind, who are you going to call?" resident Ted Hill asked the City Council at 
its meeting Monday night. "You keep cutting down our police force and we will 
have more crime." 
</P>
<P>
 But the council said it will hire four patrol officers and is seeking funding 
for four more. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, police said the city will suffer without administrators on the force. 
They recommended that the council instead keep the captain and sergeant's 
posts, eliminate the other two, and hire two patrol officers rather than four. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain to be laid off has worked for the city for 28 years. Police 
pleaded with the council to reconsider eliminating his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that public safety is a No. 1 issue," Councilwoman Cecilia 
L. Age said. But "it's important that we hire more police officers. It's the 
cop on the street that is going to deter crime, not the one sitting behind the 
desk." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the council agreed with Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees to be laid off on June 30 include one administrative analyst 
each from the Public Work and Parks and Recreation departments and two 
associate planners from the Planning Department. The position of assistant city 
manager, which is vacant, will be eliminated as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city plans to either eliminate or lay off one or more 
high-ranking officials from the Finance Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the job cuts are necessary because the city is in a 
budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the police captain who will be laid off, Mayor Richard Partin said: 
"We have no choice in the matter. . . . We are trying to do our very best." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, police officers who have been at odds with the city over contract and 
salary disputes for two years, said they plan to picket City Hall. They said 
they have not ruled out waging a campaign against the council members at 
election time as well. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PENALTIES TOUGHENED ON ILLEGAL GRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors, taking a tough stance against illegal 
grading, gave unanimous final approval Tuesday to an ordinance that stiffens 
penalties for people who clear hillsides without the proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who initiated the reforms, said illegal grading 
has been a particular problem in the South County foothills where even the 
slightest landscaping changes can dramatically change water drainage routes and 
cause erosion damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In worst cases, county officials have said, illegal clearings can leave 
properties vulnerable to landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance includes a schedule of fines and civil penalties to go with 
existing criminal misdemeanor punishments for violators. The new penalties 
allow the county to collect up to $250 in fines for each day the property owner 
violates grading regulations or is clearing sensitive hillside property without 
a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also allows county officials to obtain restraining orders to 
halt ongoing projects that are not in compliance with county regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since illegal clearings usually are away from public view and only brought to 
the attention of authorities by upset neighbors, sheriff's deputies are being 
trained to detect grading violations, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said this is probably the first law of its kind that includes civil 
penalties for such violations.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're pushing the edge of the envelope with this as a means of addressing 
this problem," County Counsel Terry C. Andrus said. "I don't believe there is 
any other county with an ordinance like this." ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; POLICE INTERRUPT ROBBERY, ARREST 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A home-invasion robbery was interrupted by police early Tuesday when one of 
the victims was able to phone for help before being bound and gagged. 
</P>
<P>
 After a chase, officers arrested two of four suspects. None of the several 
victims were injured, and the other two suspects remain at large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred about 4:45 a.m. at a home near Harbor Boulevard and 
Edinger Avenue, Detective Jim Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released few details but said one of the victims was able to get to a 
phone before being tied up. The emergency call was cut off but dispatchers had 
secured enough information -- including the address -- to send officers, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, they were confronted by one of the suspects outside the 
house, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry gave this account: Officers took cover while the robber retreated into 
the house. Moments later, two suspects emerged from the back of the house and 
fled in a vehicle. Following at high speed, police pursued the suspects through 
Fountain Valley. Along the way, the suspects allegedly threw out a loaded 
handgun as well as some of the belongings taken from the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police cut off the fleeing vehicle in the area of Edinger Avenue and Magnolia 
Street and detained Tong Le of Carlsbad and a 17-year-old youth whose identity 
was not revealed. Le is in custody at the Huntington Beach City Jail and the 
teen-ager was sent to Orange County Juvenile Hall, both on suspicion of 
residential robbery, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's bail was set at $50,000, according to jail officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Detective Perry said police could not reveal the names or number of the 
victims or how the intruders got into the house. The victims and suspects are 
all of Asian descent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has seen a rash of so-called home invasions since 1991. Santa 
Ana, Westminster and Garden Grove have recorded a majority of the robberies, 
during which the victims are usually bound and gagged. FERNANDO ROMERO

PROPOSED CUT OF UCI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PROTESTED; ACADEMIA: ABOUT 275 
EDUCATORS COMPLAIN IN LETTERS TO CHANCELLOR. SHE WILL STUDY THE COMMENTS AND 
SAYS SHE WON'T MAKE A DECISION UNTIL THE END OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 275 county educators have complained to Chancellor Laurel L. 
Wilkening's office over the proposed elimination of UCI's Department of 
Education, said campus spokeswoman Karen Young. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The letters protesting the proposed dismantling of the department are being 
forwarded to a 20-member academic planning committee made up of faculty 
members, administrators, staff and students who will summarize them for a 
report being prepared for Wilkening, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening had said she would accept comments from the public on the issue 
until Friday, and Young said she will not comment on or make a decision about 
the department until the end of the academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for ways to deal with an expected budget shortfall totaling millions 
of dollars a year in the near future, an academic planning task force in 
February recommended "disestablishing" several departments, and streamlining 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments about the proposed closure came from superintendents, administrators 
and teachers in various school districts throughout Orange County, saying the 
department provides a vital link to its neighboring communities and a supply of 
high-quality teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Magsaysay, principal of Pio Pico Elementary in Santa Ana, said she told 
Wilkening in a letter that the UCI student teachers who have been working with 
her school for three years provided "great role models for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're getting (from UCI's Education Department) is teachers better 
prepared for real classroom experience," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the academic task force's recommendations to cut several 
departments and streamline others have caused "tremendous" discussion and 
debate on campus. "Much of the debate has been about the Department of 
Education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Cicerone, chair of the task force, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the department were eliminated, "the impact would be devastating," said 
Carol Booth Olson, head of the writing project for teachers. "We would be 
shutting down the primary training site for teachers in Orange County. . . . It 
severs an important link between UCI and the community that can't be 
reconstructed." 
</P>
<P>
 The department gets about half of its $1.4-million budget from grants, and the 
other half comes from UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report responding to the committee's recommendation, the department, 
which consists of 17 full-time professors and 12 visiting or part-time faculty, 
said its credential program has trained more than 2,000 teachers in 10 years, 
most of whom ended up in Orange County schools. About 140 students are 
currently in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended moving the credential program to the California 
State University system, or to UCI's extension program. 
</P>
<P>
 Transferring the credential program to the Cal State system is not possible 
because it has no room, according to a letter from Carol Barnes, chair of 
elementary and bilingual education at Cal State Fullerton, and the report 
stated that the UCI Extension program does not have the capacity for a 
credential program. 
</P>
<P>
 The department would be willing to consider becoming part of one of the other 
departments such as Physical Sciences or Social Sciences, according to the 
report.

PROSECUTOR URGES JURY TO CONVICT RAPE CASE DEFENDANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor urged a jury Tuesday to convict a man on trial for repeatedly 
raping two North Hollywood women in neighboring apartments on consecutive 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury will begin deliberations today in the trial of 
Scott Daniel Artamenko, 24, who faces 19 felony counts stemming from the two 
attacks in an apartment building on Colfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Often looking directly at the defendant, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen 
accused Artamenko of repeated sexual assaults where he was "raping not just her 
body, but also her emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman, now 44, testified that she was repeatedly raped during the 
early morning hours of June 30 of last year. From the witness stand, she 
tentatively identified Artamenko as the rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first victim heard screaming from a nearby apartment the next 
morning, July 1, she summoned police, according to testimony. Officers knocked 
on the door, and the second woman, who is 30, was able to flee. Artamenko was 
taken into custody after a brief struggle with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ipsen said that when the first woman and her boyfriend viewed the suspect 
after he was arrested, Artamenko looked at the man and said, "Go ahead, charge 
me so the police will kill me and I won't have to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the similarity of the two attacks, Ipsen said the incidents were "a 
repeated nightmare" similar to the movie "Groundhog Day," where the lead 
character has to live the same day over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Patricia A. Andreoni-Alcazar stressed that there is 
reasonable doubt that Artamenko committed the first attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even on the stand, (the first woman) couldn't be 100% sure my client was the 
attacker," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreoni-Alcazar acknowledged that Artamenko had sex with the second woman, 
but said he was under the influence of alcohol and could not form the intent 
necessary for a criminal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all 19 counts, Artamenko would face more than 100 years in 
prison.

HOMELESS MAN ACCUSED OF MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man was charged Tuesday with the murder of a man with whom he 
shared an apartment in an abandoned building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Anthony Simeone, 30, was charged with one count of murder by the Los 
Angeles district attorney's office, said Detective Charles Uribe of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly used a cinder block to crush the skull of Joseph Robert Loya, 29, 
late Sunday or early Monday morning, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified friend of Loya's found him Monday morning on the floor of the 
apartment in the 5100 block of Bakman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Simeone, whose shirt was stained with blood, was arrested at the scene by 
patrol officers in the driveway of the apartment building, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simeone led officers to the apartment where Loya's body was found and told 
police that he had lived there with the victim for about two weeks, Uribe said.

CLOSING ARGUMENTS BEGIN IN MARATHON TOXIC EXPOSURE CASE; TRIAL: MORE THAN 600 
LOCKHEED WORKERS CONTEND THEY WERE INJURED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE HEALTH 
INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer for more than 600 Lockheed workers Tuesday accused the firm's 
chemical suppliers of "despicable" conduct for concealing the risks of their 
products, as closing arguments began in the first phase of a marathon toxic 
exposure trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they stink (for) what they did," attorney Thomas V. Girardi told a 
Los Angeles Superior Court jury hearing the case against 20 chemical 
manufacturers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had the ability all along to do the right thing, to give the right 
warnings, to make sure nobody got hurt by this stuff," Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants -- including petrochemical giants Exxon, DuPont, 
Shell and Arco -- are expected to start their summations today. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers are seeking unspecified damages, contending that they suffered 
injuries because the chemical firms failed to provide adequate health risk 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a retrial of the suit that ended in a deadlock last spring after 
12 weeks of jury deliberations, the longest deliberations in a civil case in U. 
S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute involves dozens of chemical products -- including solvents, 
primers and epoxies -- allegedly sold to Lockheed in the 1970s and '80s and 
used to build the Stealth fighter and other military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the workers say warning labels shipped with chemicals, known as 
material safety data sheets, did not provide enough information about health 
risks and necessary safety precautions. As a result, they say, workers suffered 
maladies ranging from skin irritation to nervous system damage and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemical firms say they provided adequate warnings, and updated material 
safety data sheets as new information became available. Moreover, they contend, 
Lockheed is one of the world's most sophisticated users of chemicals and was 
responsible for furnishing its workers adequate ventilation and protective 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly a defendant in the case, Lockheed was dismissed nearly two years ago 
after agreeing to pay a $33-million settlement. The settlement has not been 
disclosed to jurors to avoid influencing verdicts on the liability of the 
chemical firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a projector to display blowups of data sheets for specific chemicals, 
Girardi said the chemical firms soft-pedaled risks by stressing transitory 
effects of overexposure -- such as skin and eye irritation -- instead of 
permanent or life-threatening effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases, he said, manufacturers neglected to state that epoxies 
containing asbestos or silica posed an inhalation risk, or failed to warn users 
not to create a breathing hazard by sanding the material. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, Girardi said, manufacturers eventually beefed up data sheets 
to include cancer warnings, but did so long after the risks became known. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Girardi, the policy was: "Until the last nail is driven in the 
toxicological coffin, we're not going to warn about this stuff. . . . As a 
worker, you'd feel pretty tricked, pretty mad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in their eighth week, the proceedings are but the first phase of a 
bifurcated trial. In the current phase, jurors merely will decide which 
chemical firms, if any, gave inadequate safety warnings and did so with 
knowledge that product users could be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 If jurors find one or more firms liable, a second trial will determine if 
workers were actually exposed to their products and if injuries resulted from 
insufficient warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In round two, jurors would consider the specific claims of 14 "pilot" 
plaintiffs, whose alleged injuries range from minor to severe. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome could guide settlements with hundreds of the claimants, although 
more trials are possible.

FORMER WATER DISTRICT MANAGERS ENTER NOT GUILTY PLEAS; COURTS: TWO LONGTIME 
SANTA MARGARITA AGENCY OFFICIALS DENY ILLEGALLY STEERING MORE THAN $17 MILLION 
IN CONTRACTS TO COMPANIES THAT LAVISHLY ENTERTAINED THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two former managers of the Santa Margarita Water District entered pleas of not 
guilty Tuesday to charges they illegally steered lucrative contracts to 
companies that gave them thousands of dollars worth of gifts, meals and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter W. (Bill) Knitz and Michael P. Lord, who ran the water district in 
Mission Viejo from the 1970s until they took early retirement last year, were 
arraigned Tuesday in Orange County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. Neither 
man attended the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary M. Pohlson, Lord's attorney, telephoned the court Tuesday morning to 
enter his client's not guilty plea. Marshall M. Schulman, Knitz's attorney, 
could not be present in court, but sent another lawyer from his firm, Lynne 
Patterson, who entered a plea on Knitz's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Arthur G. Koelle set the pretrial hearing for May 6, 
with a trial date of May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident in the charges we filed, and have the evidence to convict 
Mr. Knitz and Mr. Lord," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Kelly. "We have had no 
contact with their attorneys, but we assume that will be forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Pohlson was expected to visit prosecutors today to discuss a possible plea 
bargain for his client. He did not return a call for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, 50, is charged with 15 misdemeanor counts of failing to disclose gifts 
from two engineering firms and then illegally recommending that those firms be 
awarded district contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies, Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates of Irvine, and 
MacDonald-Stephens Engineers of Mission Viejo, have been awarded some $17 
million in contracts that were not competitively bid since 1989. Together, they 
have provided Knitz and Lord with tens of thousands of dollars in trips, meals, 
gifts and other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz, 62, is charged with 23 similar misdemeanor counts, mainly for his votes 
to recommend contracts to the two companies. Knitz is accused of failing to 
disclose gifts from the two companies on his annual statements of economic 
interest from 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz was hired as general manager of the district in 1975 and Lord was hired 
as his assistant two years later. The two men guided the district through a 
period of rapid growth and each was rewarded with a salary, a district-leased 
automobile and other benefits that totaled more than $140,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the managers also spent freely, receiving more than $160,000 in expense 
reimbursements between 1984 and 1992, not including the cost of some airline 
tickets and car rentals that were billed directly to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Their expenses were frequently excessive. Knitz, for instance, once charged 
the district $245 for a five-hour ride in a stretch limo to kill time in New 
York City while waiting for his flight home. While in New York City on 
business, he ran up a $4,021 bill for his three-day stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord charged the district $1,026 for an October, 1989, trip to New York for 
himself and his wife, including $200 for Broadway theater tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the managers were spending public money freely, Knitz and Lord 
were also accepting lavish entertainment from district contractors, including 
fishing and pheasant hunting trips, golf games and expensive meals at fancy 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 According to their statements of economic interest, Knitz and Lord accepted 
more than $40,000 worth of gifts from contractors, developers, bankers and 
consultants. After The Times published articles about the gifts they had 
accepted, the men amended their disclosure forms, eventually reporting more 
than $60,000 in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of instances, the managers accepted gifts in excess of 
state-mandated limits on gifts from contractors to which they continued to 
steer business. Under the state Political Reform Act of 1974, administrators 
are prohibited from using their "official positions to influence a governmental 
decision" that has a financial impact on a company that has given $250 or more 
in gifts during the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are still weighing whether or not to file criminal or civil 
charges against the district's former board chairman, Don B. Schone, and its 
current top engineer, William B. Dye, over their acceptance of gifts.

 A vote on a development agreement that would bind the city to a controversial 
$500-million hotel and residential plan was postponed Tuesday by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major sticking points was the order in which the features of the 
development would be built. The proposed agreement leaves that entirely up to 
the developer. But council members insisted that the commercial and hotel 
portions of the development be built early, because they produce revenue for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives the owner of the property the right to build a 400-room 
hotel, two commercial centers and 370 homes on the 121-acre peninsula above 
Dana Point Harbor known as the Headlands. Last week, the council approved the 
plan in concept.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make sure the project is economically viable and fair for both the 
landowner and the city," Councilman Mike Eggers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city gets its revenue from sales taxes and bed taxes. The landowner gets 
its slice of the pie from home sales.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the Headlands has been the focus of debate for more than three 
years between environmentalists who want to save the property as a natural 
resource and the project's proponents who insist it will be a financial boon 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the city staff to renegotiate some key elements of the 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Although now subject to change, the rights the agreement gives the landowner 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The discretion over what and when the various parts of the plan are 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlimited city assistance in obtaining federal and state approvals for the 
plan, including the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Included for the city are: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 59 acres of the parcel dedicated for parks and open space and $2.8 
million in improvements for the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The right to purchase a 2.7-acre parcel at the intersection of Coast Highway 
and Green Lantern for 80% of fair market value for a civic and cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times.

JDL PROTESTS STATUE HONORING SLAIN PALESTINIAN ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial national chairman of the Jewish Defense League said Tuesday 
he will complain to the City Council about a commemorative statue in Santa Ana 
of slain Palestinian-American activist Alex Odeh that portrays him as a man of 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Rubin said he will bring a contingent of JDL supporters to next Monday's 
council meeting to protest the nine-foot bronze statue, unveiled Sunday as a 
crowd of more than 500 supporters eulogized Odeh. 
</P>
<P>
 Odeh was killed in the 1985 booby-trap bombing of the Santa Ana offices of the 
American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, where he was head of the group's 
western region. He had participated in dialogues with the Jewish community as 
an advocate for peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, however, disputes characterizing Odeh as peace-loving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make quite a dramatic protest because we feel in our hearts 
that to paint Alex Odeh as a man of peace is not the truth," Rubin said. "This 
man was pro-(Palestinian Liberation Organization) 100%, and bottom line, he was 
a PLO propagandist. The PLO has their hands covered in Jewish blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Odeh's brother, Sami Odeh, of Orange said he respects Rubin's right to free 
speech. But he said that Alex Odeh never endorsed violence and his reputation 
will stand up against Rubin's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my brother. The world knows my brother, and his record speaks for 
itself," Sami Odeh said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What Mr. Rubin thinks of my brother is not important to me. We had over 500 
people at the ceremony who came from all across the United Sates, including 
congressmen, a mayor, a rabbi, priests and other figures who knew Alex well, 
not just heard about him. All had testified in public to his being a man of 
peace and to the good effort that Alex left behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin said Tuesday that in a TV appearance the night before his death, Odeh 
expressed support for the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985, 
when passenger Leon Klinghoffer was killed by PLO-linked terrorists. He said he 
will ask Santa Ana officials to balance the Odeh statue by mounting one in 
Klinghoffer's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sami Odeh said Alex Odeh never supported the hijacking, and in fact 
condemned it in the television appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He expressed horror at the death of Mr. Klinghoffer and expressed hope that 
the perpetrators be brought to justice," Odeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Odeh was killed in 1985, Rubin said: 'I have no tears for Mr. Odeh. He 
got exactly what he deserved." He later said he regretted the statement.

CHALLENGERS ROUT 2 TUSTIN COUNCIL INCUMBENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an upset election, two challengers soundly defeated Council members Leslie 
Anne Pontious and Charles E. Puckett in Tuesday's municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Worley and Michael J. Doyle each received well over 600 votes more than 
the incumbents, according to unofficial results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously I'm very happy," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 An electronic counting machine broke down during the count, delaying results 
and forcing the city to bring in a machine from Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 In the campaign, the incumbents said that planning for the future reuse of the 
Tustin Marine Corps Air Station is the most critical decision City Council 
members will face in the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontious and Puckett contended that the city was in good hands under the 
current council, whose other members are Mayor Jim Potts and Councilmen Thomas 
R. Saltarelli and Jeffrey Thomas. Crime is down, sales tax income is up, new 
businesses are coming in, and while nearby cities struggle to maintain 
services, Tustin is financially healthy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Doyle and Worley said that the more important issues were the city 
attorney's fees, a gift ban for council members, term limits and limits on 
campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have more accountability," Doyle said. He said that Pontious and 
Puckett failed to order a thorough review of city credit expenses last year 
even after allegations surfaced that high-ranking officials of the Police 
Department were using city credit cards to charge meals and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers had criticized Puckett for using city credit cards for 
business lunches with City Manager William A. Huston in 1991 and 1992 at a 
Fullerton restaurant that featured female models in scanty clothing. Puckett 
said the meetings were strictly business.

 An audit later indicated that there was no widespread abuse. EDITION TIME

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN CONVICTED OF FRAUD OVER BANK LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura man was convicted this week of bank fraud for using false 
information to obtain millions of dollars in loans from California banks, 
including a $1.5-million loan from the Antelope Valley Bank on which he later 
defaulted, an FBI agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 William F. Williams, 49, pleaded guilty Monday in U. S. District Court in Los 
Angeles to six counts of bank fraud, conspiracy and making false statements on 
a loan application, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams of Fresno was charged with submitting fraudulent federal income tax 
returns that inflated his earnings when he applied to lenders for construction 
and refinancing loans, according to the FBI. Williams failed to make payments 
on the loans, and to avoid having the banks foreclose on the property he would 
transfer the titles to other people who would then file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest loan he was charged with fraudulently obtaining was a $1.5-million 
loan from the Antelope Valley Bank in 1987 for a medical building in Lancaster, 
the FBI said. Williams used false income tax returns to obtain the loan, which 
he subsequently stopped making payments on in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who will be sentenced July 20, faces up to 135 years in prison, a 
$4.5-million fine and the cost of his imprisonment, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' wife Mary, 47, who was charged in the original indictment in August, 
was dismissed from the case as part of a plea agreement that her husband struck 
with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick M. Downey, a Ventura mortgage broker and businessman, who was indicted 
along with the Williams, is scheduled to stand trial May 31.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COWBOYS' POETRY KIND WORDS FOR SANTA CLARITA 
ECONOMY; RECREATION: SURVEY SHOWS ABOUT 3,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE MARCH 
FESTIVAL AND SPENT ABOUT $244,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's city-sponsored cowboy poetry festival spurred the local economy 
by more than $244,000, Santa Clarita's top economic development official has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a survey of 200 festival-goers -- one-tenth the number believed to 
have bought tickets -- nearly $250,000 was spent on Santa Clarita Valley 
hotels, restaurants and entertainment sites by festival patrons during the 
three-day event, according to Mike Haviland, economic development coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, that's a conservative number," Haviland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average festival-goer attended with two other people and spent more than 
$81 in the Santa Clarita Valley during the three-day event, according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiplied by the estimated 2,000 ticket-holders and the 1,000 others who 
attended festival activities not requiring a ticket, the results were a 
significant economic boost for local businesses, Haviland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people who spent well over $1,000, we had others who spent like zero 
because they're locals," Haviland said. "The point is, we're bringing people 
into Santa Clarita and they're spending their money." 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of money also had a "ripple effect," as when a restaurant buys 
more supplies from local grocery stores to accommodate new customers, Haviland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact attendance and amount of merchandise bought at the festival is 
unavailable. The estimate of 3,000 attendees is based upon an informal count at 
the entrance gate, said Gail Foy, city public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film Festival wanted to create a 
large-scale tourist event that will bring visitors to Santa Clarita and 
strengthen the identity of the 6-year-old city. 
</P>
<P>
 About 89.4% of the survey respondents rated the event "excellent" or "very 
good" and 95% said they would return to a future festival. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members will decide whether to make the festival an annual affair 
during the budget process in the next couple of months, Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita spent $15,000 to host the event at the Melody Ranch Motion 
Picture Studio in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was originally to be held in auditorium of the Newhall high 
school named for Western silent film star William S. Hart, but the site was 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the city's earthquake-related requests to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency is one for reimbursement of the $13,000 in additional 
expenses it took to relocate the event to the studio.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 'BUCKWHEAT' REMARK SPURS SUIT OVER YEARBOOK; 
RACE: PALMDALE HIGH SECURITY DIRECTOR OBJECTS TO A PASSAGE THAT COMPARES HIM TO 
A CHARACTER IN THE 'OUR GANG' COMEDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A black school employee who was compared in a yearbook to Buckwheat -- the 
character from the "Our Gang" comedies of the 1930s -- filed suit over the 
reference, contending that it has caused him "mental, physical, and nervous 
pain and suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court in Lancaster on behalf of George Jenkins, 
seeks unspecified damages from the Antelope Valley Union High School District 
and James Gardner, faculty adviser for the Palmdale High School "Falcon" 
yearbook. The suit accuses the district and Gardner of publishing and 
distributing "racially offensive material" in the 1993 yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, a campus security director at Palmdale High, was "subjected to racial 
slurs, demeaning comments, ridicule, great humiliation, anxiety and depression" 
after the yearbook was distributed, the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also contends that the comparison was a violation of Jenkins' civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparison of Jenkins to the big-eyed, grinning Buckwheat was made in a 
section of the yearbook in which students identified the personality they 
thought of when "someone says your favorite teacher's name." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said Tuesday that he was unaware of Jenkins' action but added: "There 
is no basis for the suit." He earlier said the comment was made in jest and was 
not racist. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Rex Parris, the Lancaster attorney representing Jenkins, said, "Anyone with 
any reasonable sensibilities would recognize you don't call a black person 
'Buckwheat.' " Students at Palmdale High School have been suspended for using 
the term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the initial comments was that this was a joke, that calling him this 
was a joke. . . . Making a reference like this is not a joke. It causes real 
pain and real damage," Parris said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, Gardner's failure to edit out the comparison before 
publication, or correct it before distribution of the yearbooks, was "done for 
the purpose of causing (Jenkins) to suffer humiliation, mental anguish, and 
emotional and physical distress because of his Afro-American heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner earlier said he asked the yearbook publisher to remove the Buckwheat 
reference, but it was not done. Parris said yearbook students have declared 
that there was no effort to remove the item. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school promised to cover over the reference before handing 
out the yearbooks but failed to do so, Parris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school district is responsible, Parris said, because it failed to do 
anything -- such as remove the page -- to correct the yearbook after 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Girolamo, superintendent of the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District, said Tuesday that he was unaware that the suit had been filed and 
could not comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Parris said that although it is too early to know for certain, he expects 
Jenkins to be awarded significant monetary damages.

LANDLORD PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 8 ARSON-RELATED CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU and GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A landlord accused of setting fire to two of his apartment buildings and 
attempting to burn another one twice to collect insurance payments pleaded not 
guilty Tuesday to eight arson-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bail for Gheorghe Alexandroai, a 63-year-old Romanian immigrant, was set at $1 
million by North Orange County Municipal Judge Stephen J. Sundvold. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai was arrested shortly after a blaze Thursday caused $50,000 damage 
to one of his eight-unit apartment complexes on Ball Road in Anaheim. 
Prosecutors contend that Alexandroai set that fire and another that caused 
$12,000 damage to another in 8600 block of Cerritos Avenue in Stanton in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, tenants, some of whom were sleeping, were quickly evacuated 
from the buildings by other residents and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandroai is also charged with attempted arson on Nov. 18 and March 2 on a 
second property he owns in the 1500 block of Ball Road in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Alexandroai has been charged with two counts of arson, four counts 
of possession of a flammable material and two counts of attempted arson. 
Authorities say he may later face additional charges stemming from other fires 
at other properties he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 After the brief bail hearing, Alexandroai's attorney, Mitchell Hannah, said 
the charges against his client are "based solely on circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "These fires are either coincidence or retaliation," Hannah said outside of 
court. "My client denies all the charges adamantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy District Attorney Carl Biggs said during the hearing that Alexandroai 
showed little regard for life and property. "He set those fires without any 
concern for the safety of the occupants, including children," Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs said prosecutors are still considering whether to file attempted murder 
charges against Alexandroai and are continuing their investigation. "We decided 
for now not to pursue attempted murder charges because it would require 
specific intent. His actions just showed an indifference," Biggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah argued that his client should be released to take care of his 
properties. But Biggs told Sundvold that Alexandroai is a flight risk who poses 
a threat to society. He asked that Alexandroai be held either without bail or 
on $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Floarea Alexandroai, the suspect's 50-year-old wife, was in court Tuesday. She 
was initially a suspect in the case, but was released from jail without being 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Floarea Alexandroai said she was unsure if her husband 
had started the fires. But outside of court on Tuesday, she said she was 
convinced of her husband's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely don't believe he did it," she said in Romanian through an 
interpreter. "I cannot believe he would do this. The people who have known him 
for years don't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County authorities have also reopened their investigation of a 
September, 1992, fire in a single-family home in Mira Loma owned by 
Alexandroai. Capt. Wes Alston said the fire was originally attributed to 
electrical problems and caused $25,000 worth of damage, mainly to the attic of 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking another look at that fire," Alston said. "There are a lot of 
similarities to the other fires in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all charges, Alexandroai faces up to 20 years in prison. 
Sundvold set a preliminary hearing for May 3.

VALLEY BRIEFING: UNHAPPY RETURNS; HOW GOVERNMENT DISSECTS FEDERAL AND STATE 
TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where does it all go? It's a common question this time of year, with Friday 
looming as the deadline for filing income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years some tax-payer groups and politicians have suggested modifying 
our tax structure. In 1992, for example, presidential candidate Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown proposed replacing the current tax brackets with a 13% flat tax 
and a 13% value-added tax, which would effectively be a national sales tax. All 
tax deductions would be eliminated except for home mortgage interest, rent and 
charitable donations. The idea was so simple, he said, that anyone's taxes 
could be figured on a postcard. The idea got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Washington-based Tax Foundation each year continues to 
designate "Tax Freedom Day," the day when the average American would have 
earned enough that year just to pay his federal, state and local taxes. In 
1950, the group estimated, the average person had to work until April 3 to pay 
his taxes. Last year, the day came on May 3 for workers nationwide and May 7 
for those California because of the state's relatively high state and local 
taxes. The foundation is keeping Tax Freedom Day 1994 a secret until Thursday. 
Until then, we can only keep working. Still haven't filed? 
</P>
<P>

DOW SLIPS AS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks closed slightly lower Tuesday, weathering a selloff in 
technology stocks that sent the Nasdaq market into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on Treasury bonds fell and prices rose for the fifth time in the past 
six trading days after the Federal Reserve Bank bought government securities to 
boost banking system reserves, in turn persuading others to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 A government report of low wholesale inflation in March also provided a degree 
of support to the bond market, easing investor concerns about today's 
much-anticipated report on consumer prices. The dollar and gold rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.14 points to end at 3,681.69, 
while the Standard & Poor's list of 500 stocks fell 2.30 to 447.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,242 to 876 on New York 
Stock Exchange volume of more than 256 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index, heavily weighted by technology stocks, was off 8.89 points 
at 739.22. 
</P>
<P>
 Semiconductor stocks were hurt by a report of its industry association that 
said its so-called book-to-bill ratio was unchanged at 1.13 in March. That 
means that for every $100 of products shipped, manufacturers received $113 in 
new orders. Many analysts had expected a stronger performance -- from 1.16 to 
1.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The book-to-bill ratio is often taken by investors as an indication of demand 
in the entire technology sector, analysts said. If demand for chips is weak, 
the thinking goes, it must be elsewhere in the industry as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department report that producer prices rose 0.2% in March 
underscored the fact that any real inflationary pressures have not yet emerged 
in the economy, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial markets are watching the Labor Department reports closely 
because the Federal Reserve has nudged interest rates higher twice this year to 
try to stop inflation from accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 11/32 point, or $3.44 cents 
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, 
fell to 7.20% from 7.23% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology shares were battered on all markets. Motorola reported 
first-quarter earnings of $1.03 a share, up from 72 cents a year ago. Analysts 
had expected higher earnings, and the stock tumbled 4 1/2 to 95 1/2 on the 
NYSE.  
</P>
<P>
 On Nasdaq, Intel lost 3 7/16 to 65 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft lost 2 1/4 at 84 3/4, Micron Technology dropped 4 7/8 to 86 1/2 and 
Texas Instruments shed 5 5/8 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonnell Douglas' stock rose sharply in what analysts said was a reaction 
to a potential $400-million contract award to launch satellites for the Iridium 
space-based communications project. McDonnell's stock rose $3.375 to close at 
$111.75 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets:  
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rose against most major currencies as traders shrugged off news 
that White House economic adviser Robert Rubin said the Administration is not 
trying to drive the yen higher against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his comments, many market players still believe the Administration 
will back a stronger yen to help shrink the U.S. deficit if the market-opening 
effort fails. So they bid the yen higher. In London, the dollar rose to 103.55 
yen. In New York, it closed at 103.65 yen, up from 103.45. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $378.50 an ounce, up 60 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil prices finished lower after briefly flirting with $16 per barrel. 
May delivery of light, sweet crude oil settled at $15.75 per barrel, down 12 
cents.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE; AN EASIER WAY TO OPEN YOUR 
E-MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people watch more than one TV network, lots of folks read more than one 
newspaper or magazine, and an increasing number subscribe to more than one 
on-line information or electronic mail service. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, for each service you join, you get an additional electronic mail 
address and, often, the pleasure of installing and learning a new piece of 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a hassle. Each day, to be certain that I get all my e-mail, I have 
to log on to America Online, MCI Mail, CompuServe, Prodigy, Netcom (an Internet 
provider) and a couple of private e-mail services. Sometimes I log on several 
times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a partial solution. E-Mail Connection, a $49.95 Windows program from 
ConnectSoft ((800) 234-9497), automatically sends and receives mail from MCI 
Mail, CompuServe and Prodigy, as well as several local network-based mail 
systems, including Microsoft Mail, cc:Mail, Lotus Notes and Novell Netware MHS. 
</P>
<P>
 The software sequentially dials into each service, letting you check and send 
all your mail with a single click of the mouse. You can log on manually or have 
the software automatically log on at specified intervals, and it runs in the 
background so you can use your PC for other tasks while it's working. When it's 
done, all your e-mail is presented in a single in-box. The return address of 
everyone who writes to you is automatically entered into the program's address 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending mail is also easy. You write the message in a word-processor-like text 
editor. Or you can use your regular Windows word processing program, which, in 
many cases, can be linked directly to E-Mail Connection so you can send the 
message directly from your word processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you can send a message, you have to be sure the person is in your 
address book. Because all major e-mail services are connected via the Internet, 
your respondents don't have to subscribe to the same service as you. The 
software figures out the best route and writes in the routing codes for you. 
LAN-based mail is automatically sent over the network. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to text messages, E-Mail Connection lets you send and receive any 
type of file, including spreadsheets, documents, graphics and even programs. Be 
warned: Some files are quite large and can be costly to send. Sending 
commercial software via e-mail, in most cases, may be construed as pirating. 
Sending non-text files over the Internet requires special software -- Uuencode 
and Uudecode -- which you can download, for free, over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 E-Mail Connection also makes it possible to receive messages via one service 
and respond via another. MCI Mail, for example, doesn't charge for incoming 
messages but, in its basic plan, charges a minimum of 50 cents for an outgoing 
message. CompuServe, which lets you exchange mail with MCI Mail users, charges 
only 15 cents for an outgoing message, so when I get incoming mail via MCI 
Mail, I use E-Mail Connection's routing feature to have the response sent via 
CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 E-Mail Connection has some other neat features, even if you use only one 
on-line service. The software stores all incoming and outgoing messages on your 
hard disk and allows you to sort the messages into various folders, much like 
the neat Pine program for e-mail on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 You can even establish rules to have it automatically route messages from your 
in-box to special folders. 
</P>
<P>
 I've created a list of high-priority respondents that go into a special 
folder. I have other folders for special projects or groups of people I 
correspond with. Press releases relevant to articles I'm working on go into yet 
other folders. It takes only a second to move my junk e-mail into the trash 
folder. 
</P>
<P>
 The software also has a search feature that lets you quickly find mail that 
contains a specific text string or the name or e-mail address of any person. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy subscribers will need the service's Windows software to use E-Mail 
connection. CompuServe and MCI Mail users don't need any other software, but 
E-Mail Connection can be used only for mail. It won't provide news, forums or 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, E-Mail Connection doesn't let you connect with any of the 
low-cost Internet e-mail providers, which, like Netcom, offer unlimited e-mail 
for as little as $17.50 a month. That, however, is likely to change by the end 
of the year.

FIXATIONS: ENTERTAINING GUESTS; THE COACH HOUSE'S 'BACKSTAGE MANAGER' CALVIN 
HARDY SATES THE WHIMS OF THE VISITING MUSICIANS, MAKING SURE THEY'RE 
COMFORTABLE . . . AND HAVE ENOUGH SOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to wonder if there's some mad-scientist matter-transforming device 
that resides upstairs at the Coach House: Night after night at the South County 
concert club, Calvin Hardy disappears up one flight of stairs with armloads of 
nachos, and soon after comes down another flight with a rock band in tow. He 
goes up with nachos -- and down with a band; up with more nachos, down with a 
band. I figure that one of these nights a band member will get too close to the 
stage lights and melt back into plastic cheese goop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime the 6-foot-3 Hardy is sticking to the story that he's bringing 
the nachos to musicians. Hardy, after all, is known around these parts as Mr. 
Hospitality.  
</P>
<P>
 In his seven-year stint as what he calls "backstage manager" at the Coach 
House, it has been Hardy's job to see to the comfort of the performers, to 
procure whatever items it takes to sate the depraved whims of the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Like socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised how many groups want socks," Hardy said, shaking his head. 
"Chris Isaak wants socks, Devo, the Tubes, Adam Ant. Chris Isaak wears a new 
pair of socks for every show. I can understand it. It's almost like a 
dependency, a ritual. You put them on, go out there, and it's like Whaaammm 
you're onstage doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you think, like, what, they must have a thousand socks. They collect them 
at every club, and they can't wear them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, such needs are spelled out in a group's rider. To musicians, a rider 
is to a contract what the Bill of Rights was to the Constitution. Riders 
delineate a band's inalienable right to have bowls of M&Ms with the brown ones 
removed; to have light bulbs of a certain wattage; to have so many magnums of 
chilled Dom Perignon; to have organic carrot juice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the concert industry Chuck Berry is nearly as legendary for his rider as 
for his performances. It stipulates even what temperature his dressing room 
will be -- with a hefty fine for the club if it isn't -- and goes on for 
fine-print pages of such detail. At the other end of the spectrum, singer 
Jonathan Richman's riders have simply called for a towel and a rented amp, and 
he's recently dropped the towel from the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some acts are humble, down-to-earth people, and their riders project that 
attitude," Hardy says. But even when an act's attitude is pure attitude , Hardy 
doesn't speak ill of them. This is a man who used to play bass for Ike and Tina 
Turner at the time when the duo came to a violent parting, and even of the 
much-vilified Ike, Hardy has nothing but kind words. 
</P>
<P>
 He's seen how performers act when they're away from public scrutiny, when they 
let their hair down, or don't. We could tell you about the perpetually 
be-hatted country performer who's pate is as bald as his knees, except we're 
not that kind of newspaper, at least not when Hardy insists it's off the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no great revelation when he mentions that comedienne Sandra Bernhard 
strutted around backstage butt-naked, since she had done a portion of her 
performance topless.  
</P>
<P>
 A few more dressing room facts: David Crosby reads books; Ray Charles plays 
chess, running his hands over the pieces; most country bands eat steak; David 
Lindley bolts down so much Jolt Cola he should be its poster boy; George Carlin 
brings his dog. "And Timothy Leary was the only one to bump his head into a 
wall on the way to the stage. I don't know if you should read anything into 
that," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the acts that play the club, such as Etta James, are ones Hardy used 
to perform with. "It might seem strange, serving people I used to be with. But 
I go on about my job and do it with integrity, and that takes away the 
embarrassment I might otherwise have. I don't go around moaning 'Oh, I wish I 
wasn't working here,' because I like working here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And just how important a job is it delivering nachos to the famous? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really important how these bands are treated in the dressing room," says 
Coach House talent buyer Ken Phebus. "It makes my job a lot easier having 
Calvin there. Most of these acts come in here with serious road-burn, and 
Calvin takes care of them. When I'm talking to an act's agent, one of the first 
things I'm asked is, 'Is Calvin still there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Warren, who travels 200 days a year as tour manager for 
Chris Isaak, Bonnie Raitt and others, "Without a doubt one of the bright spots 
in my life on the road is coming to the Coach House with Calvin there. He makes 
it a very homey atmosphere and everything's right. The guy's got radar. You can 
think about a hamburger and it's there. Some other clubs, the people are shady, 
there's no food at all, and it's so scurvy you don't want to sit down anywhere 
for fear of sticking to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy has seen his share of those dressing rooms. Now 45, he was born in 
Virginia, getting his distinctive features from his African American and 
Blackfoot Indian heritage. In the late '60s he wound up in Woodstock, N.Y., and 
since everyone else there seemed to play an instrument, he took up the bass. 
Turning pro, he worked with Tim Hardin, John Hall of Orleans, James, the 
Turners, Elvin Bishop and others.  
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Orange County in the mid-'80s to work on a friend's music project. 
When the money ran out he went to Coach House owner Gary Folgner -- whom he'd 
met when playing the club with Bishop -- and asked for a temporary job washing 
dishes. Instead Folgner hired him to be in charge of backstage hospitality.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the other side, and I think that helps. I know what their life 
is like. When artists ask for something, they're usually polite, saying, 'When 
you have a moment.' I do it immediately, because there's not much else in their 
day that happens that way." It is with perhaps just a touch of informed irony 
that he says, "I had thousands of dollars in my pocket, played the big halls. 
Now I'm Mr. Hospitality." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He knows artists don't have much respect for the hired help fawning over them, 
nor for those who hang out inordinately to be "one of the guys." He gauges each 
act, and strikes a balance, because he also maintains, "The best thing you can 
do is treat them like regular people, not with awe, with respect, but with the 
same respect you should give anyone, famous or not." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets embarrassed when old band mates ask him to play his bass with them, 
because he's let his chops go stale in the uninspiring local "stuck in Lodi" 
music scene. One vestige of his performing past he hasn't given up is his 
attire. Hardy may come to work sporting a flashy tux one night and the next 
looking like he'd robbed Jimi Hendrix's grave. The late Miles Davis, no slouch 
himself when it came to sartorial statements, once tried to get Hardy to give 
him the Indonesian outfit he was wearing one evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hundreds of acts he has attended to have treated him with respect, 
and when some instead strike prima donna attitudes or litter the carpet of his 
proudly maintained domain with cigarette butts, he takes it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while a person will treat me with no respect. Not usually the star, 
but a band member or someone in the entourage trying to feel important, where I 
get the feeling they're really trying to annoy me. But I always come back like 
they're not. If you treat a jerk like a regular person, sometimes they stop 
being a jerk. And if they don't, at least I did my part and didn't fall into 
their personality, what they're stuck with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy has an almost monkish forbearance, with a California New-Age spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty much a spiritualist, where I consider people for their inner self 
and there we're all the same, so I relate to that . I relate not to their 
personality but to the person I perceive to be in them that is in me. It breaks 
down walls and it really helps," he said.

RACING TO RAISE MONEY FOR ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Athletes and theater buffs, two groups with decidedly different interests, 
have found a common cause: the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Both will join forces June 5 when Mazda and the Guilds of the Performing Arts 
Center of Orange County stage a triathlon at Lake Mission Viejo to benefit the 
center. The triathlon is expected to attract more than 1,600 professional and 
amateur athletes, draw 10,000 spectators and raise about $50,000 for the 
center. The Great Race 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 organizers and supporters of the triathlon came together last week 
at the center's Founders Hall for a kickoff luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Braunstein, race coordinator, offered a preview of the race. Amateurs 
will compete in a 1K swim, 30K bike ride and 8K run, he said, while 
professionals will go the full Olympic distance -- a 1 1/2-kilometer swim, 40K 
bike ride and 10K run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as overwhelming as it might sound," Braunstein said. "Most athletes 
have already done one discipline. (Amateurs can train for) this in three to 
four hours a week minimum, but more likely they'll do 10 hours a week. The pros 
are training 30 to 40 hours a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Named by Triathlon magazine as one of the top 10 triathlons in the world, the 
race is the qualifier for the Goodwill Games International Competition in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. The top three professional men and women finishers will 
represent the United States July 28 in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Jennings, center staff member who met her fiance at last year's 
triathlon, is training for the amateur competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard fitting in all three athletic pursuits into your week. Usually I do 
two things a day -- running and swimming -- and I take long bike rides on the 
weekends," she said. "My biggest concern is that I'll forget my shoes" when 
switching events during the race. Soprano Sounds Off 
</P>
<P>
 After dining on pasta, salmon and tiramisu provided by Tutto Mare of Fashion 
Island Newport Beach, guests were treated to a performance by soprano Alison 
England. England is one of the featured artists who goes out into the community 
to give free performances as part of the center's Informally Yours program. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounding out in a jogging suit, England began the program by singing "Who Will 
Run This Wonderful Relay?" to the tune of "Who Will Buy?" from the musical 
"Oliver." She then peeled off her warm-up outfit to reveal a turquoise 
pantsuit: "I hate running," she joked. "I have soprano fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the slender England at one point slipped a pillow under her blouse 
and, looking five months' pregnant, stepped out from behind the piano singing: 
"I should have danced all night," a takeoff from "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few serious moments, too, such as when England gave a soulful 
rendition of "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" from "The Phantom of the 
Opera" and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" from "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no man in the room was safe when England launched into "You Made Me 
Love You." She walked among the tables teasing the men, hugging them, running 
her fingers through their hair and even removing one's glasses. Among her 
victims: a red-faced Tom Tomlinson, executive director and chief operating 
officer of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd included: Marlene Short, chairwoman of the guilds; 
Jeanette Kleist and E.L. Smith, triathlon chairwomen; Carmine and Marilyn 
Anania, Sue Feldman, Kyle Kring, Jack Pitney, E. Gary Smith, Melly Sutherland 
and Bonne Wheeler. KATHRYN BOLD

ARTS CENTER OPENS UP TO RAY CHARLES; VENUES: THE BOOKING OF THE LEGENDARY R&B 
SINGER/PIANIST MARKS ANOTHER STEP IN A PLAN TO EXPAND ITS PROGRAMMING. 
</P>

<P>
 In a step beyond the hall's traditional boundaries, Orange County Performing 
Arts Center officials Tuesday announced that Ray Charles will perform there on 
June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The renowned singer and pianist will be joined by the Ray Charles Orchestra 
and by his backup singers, the Raelettes. Jazz-blues singer Ernestine Anderson 
will open the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles has performed at the center once before, in a pops concert with the 
Pacific Symphony, but this is the first time he will play with his own band in 
a concert presented by the center itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a concert last year by Art Garfunkel, the center had shied away from pop 
acts of the post-World War II era. The Charles booking "reflects my desire to 
continue to expand programming somewhat," said center president Tom Tomlinson. 
He maintained, however, that the concert is not really a departure, in that the 
center does offer an annual jazz series. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Tomlinson said he wanted to offer Charles as part of the jazz series, 
but timing made that impossible, so the concert is being offered as a 
"stand-alone" event. 
</P>
<P>
 In a career spanning more than 40 years, Charles has served a variety of 
American musical forms including jazz but also blues, R&B, gospel, pop, even 
country. He scored his 12th Grammy award last month for his recording of "A 
Song for You." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the center also announced a return engagement for magician 
David Copperfield, who will perform eight shows May 26 through 29.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the center is expected to announce a weeklong run of a Broadway musical 
to be offered outside the regular Broadway series. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Charles concert, which will start at 8 p.m., range from $26 to 
$44; Copperfield tickets will be $19.50 to $35 with $7 discounts at matinees 
for children 12 and under. Both shows go on sale April 24. Information: (714) 
556-2787.

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; YOUTHFUL TALENT STRUNG OUT ON STRING QUARTETS; ABOUT A 
THIRD OF THE COMPOSITIONS SELECTED FOR THE FIRST 'VOCES NOVAE' FESTIVAL AT CAL 
STATE FULLERTON ARE OF THAT GENRE. THE EVENT BEGINS THURSDAY. 
</P>

 Young composers have become less interested in shaking up the establishment. 
That's what Lloyd Rodgers discovered after asking California composers to 
submit work for the first "Voces Novae" festival at Cal State Fullerton. It 
begins Thursday and runs through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, I was surprised how conservative the young composers are 
today," said Rodgers, a music professor at CSUF, in a recent interview on 
campus. "We got work that was much more conservative than one would have gotten 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few theater pieces, very little involving multimedia, very 
little politically oriented work. We didn't get very much vocal music. We 
didn't get anything very experimental in technique. We got, strange as it 
seems, very little solo piano music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a few pieces that involved extended instrumental techniques, but not 
very many. We didn't get as many (small-ensemble) pieces, like one would 
expect, even in terms of the modernist kinds of stuff -- that flute, 
vibraphone, marimba, piccolo, trumpet, harmonium kind of thing. And we got very 
little music that involved winds, which is quite amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so what did they get? 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a tremendous number of string quartets," Rodgers said. "So that's why 
we're playing six or seven of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a major renaissance in the string quartet in the last 15 years 
or so, and this is shown by the work submitted. . . . It's fascinating, isn't 
it? I guess it's possibly the popularity of the Arditti String Quartet and the 
Kronos Quartet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 51, and fellow faculty member Michael Bayer chose 18 pieces from the 
73 submitted by 43 composers. (Each composer was allowed to submit two works, 
though some entered just one.) 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting those 18 "wasn't as simple as saying, 'OK, we're going to rank the 
best pieces and perform them,' " Rodgers said. "No. 1, it wasn't a contest. So 
there aren't winners and losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, they also were concerned with programming for the public and including 
"a cross-section of what was out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The string quartets alone cover a number of stylistic bases, Rodgers said. 
"We've got some minimalist string quartets and some modernist string quartets 
and some sort of grand-tradition string quartets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If they have one thing in common, it is that all the works to be performed 
show "a certain sureness of purpose, direction, technical competence, how the 
music speaks through the media that it's written for, its sense of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like (Thomas) Aquinas says, 'For a thing to be beautiful, you need 
clarity, integrity and consonance.' And I think that's what you look for." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the 18 composers are CSUF students. The others, a combination of 
professionals and students, hail from San Francisco and San Diego and points 
between. Their works will be played by professional musicians, Cal State 
Fullerton faculty and upper-division students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intention was always to perform the works," said Rodgers, who has taught 
at the university since 1972. "We're also going to be recording all the 
performances, not only for archival purposes, but so that the composers can 
have copies of the performances, since not all of them are coming." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the composers," he added, "sent work that was very utopian from a 
performance point of view . . . extremely virtuosic music that is not 
unplayable but is not practical from a budgetary point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the age limit for entrants was set at 32, but Rodgers soon found 
that to be impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started getting calls from older students," he said. "It didn't dawn on me 
that there were so many students in graduate programs around the state who were 
in their mid-30s. So we informally changed it. In two years, the next time we 
do it, we'll probably bump the age up because there is an enormous quantity of 
people in school in their 30s now." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers definitely wants the festival to be a public event, not a program for 
"new-music aficionados." 
</P>
<P>
 "New music has such a bad rep, and I think that the general music public is 
sort of spiritually and psychologically drained, which is unfortunate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really public stuff. I want the public to come. The programming is 
done in such a way that I think is empathetic to the audience and also will 
place the pieces in good relief. I would encourage the public not to be put off 
by the fact that it's called New Music. " 
</P>
<P>
 He would also encourage the composers to keep writing, "just the same way I 
would encourage any artist," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been difficult functioning as a composer. . . . Composers 
oftentimes do other things -- teach Latin at the Thomasschule and run church 
services like Bach, or free-lance around like Mozart or (exploit) publishers 
like Beethoven, or accompany women's choirs and play in barrooms like Brahms 
and accompany violinists like he did. I don't think it's any worse now than 
it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Voces Novae" festival will present three different programs of recent 
or new work by 18 California composers, Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. in 
the Recital Hall at the Performing Arts Center, Cal State Fullerton, 800 N. 
State College Blvd., Fullerton. $8 each program. (714) 773-3371.

THE BENEFITS OF THE PART-TIMER; THEY ARE FEW, WHICH UNIONS SAY THREATENS 
FULL-TIME JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 17 1/2 years, Morley Cohen thrived in his full-time job as a liquor 
salesman, enjoying his San Fernando Valley route and living comfortably on an 
annual income of about $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last year, it all fell part. Cohen's employer shut down, and he was 
forced to scramble to come up with part-time sales work. His income shriveled, 
and he lost his company-paid health care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shocker after that many years to leave with nothing," said Cohen, 63. 
"Any way I can make a dollar, I'll make a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of heightened job insecurity, the image of such a fall from a 
well-paying, full-time position to a marginal part-time job haunts many 
workers. And the fact that adding part-time jobs often threatens the wages, 
benefits and economic security of full-time workers has spurred many unions to 
fight companies moving in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the key triggers that sparked the nationwide strike launched 
by the Teamsters Union last week against 22 trucking companies was the 
employers' proposal to start using lower-paid, part-time dock workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In some industries, labor leaders regard part-timers as union busters. In a 
strike, part-timers can sometimes step into the jobs of those on the picket 
line. Full-timers "fear that they're training their own replacements," said 
Dale Belman, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Even apart from strikes, Belman added, the lower wages and benefits often paid 
to part-timers provide "a very strong dynamic for firms to reduce the number of 
full-time workers and replace them with part-timers." 
</P>
<P>
 Part-timers are hard to organize, and, especially if they hope to move up to 
full-time positions, they are likely to be far more reluctant to challenge 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the vision of legions of employers demoting workers from full time to part 
time, or laying off full-time workers to make room for lower-paid part-timers, 
masks a more complicated pattern in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, part-timers generally receive substantially fewer benefits and 
often lower hourly pay than their full-time counterparts. In addition, the 
number of "involuntary" part-timers -- people who hold part-time jobs because 
they can't find full-time work -- has climbed over the years, although they 
still account for less than a third of all part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there has been a boom in a related type of worker -- temporary 
employees -- who also have less than a full-time stake in the companies 
employing them. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last two decades, Labor Department figures show there has been no 
surge of part-timers pushing full-time workers out of their jobs. The number of 
part-timers shot up over that period, but the ranks of people working 35 hours 
or more a week rose almost as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1973 to 1993, the percentage of working people holding part-time jobs 
rose only slightly, from 16.6% to 18.8%, with involuntary part-timers 
accounting for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue, according to Georgetown University labor economist Stanley D. 
Nollen, is not that part-timers are replacing full-time workers but that 
"part-time people aren't being treated equitably." 
</P>
<P>
 While government statistics show that part-timers earn much less than 
full-timers, part of the reason is that part-time jobs are more prevalent in 
low-paying industries such as restaurants and retailing. Still, even when 
efforts are made to compare part-time and full-time workers in similar jobs, a 
big gap remains. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, according to the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, 
women working part-time in administrative support and clerical jobs earn 16.5% 
less per hour than their full-time counterparts. And 25.6% of women who work 
part time and head households receive health care benefits, compared to 74% of 
similar women working full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, of course, sees working part time as a hardship. Part-time jobs 
can be a boon to students putting themselves through college, parents trying to 
balance the demands of work and family, and moonlighters looking for extra 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically over the years, employers and unions have clashed over proposals 
to add part-time workers. Supermarket and transportation businesses have led 
the way, largely because they have distinct busy and slack work periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any industry you pick where there isn't a level work flow, you're going to 
get those pressures from management," said Daniel J.B. Mitchell, a UCLA labor 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell noted that one factor that could reverse the trend is health care 
reform. He explained that if employers are required to provide health insurance 
for all workers, full and part time, that could provide more of an economic 
incentive to rely more on full-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, part-time jobs can be a boon to companies and their 
employees, enabling firms to stay in business by holding down labor costs and 
using their work force more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the trucking industry was deregulated in the 1980s, non-union truckers 
have enjoyed that kind of flexibility, taking business from union carriers, 
said Charles P. O'Connor, general counsel for Trucking Management Inc., the 
organization representing the companies struck by the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to reduce costs," O'Connor said. He later added: "We're trying to 
protect Teamster jobs too. . . . We're their last, best hope to maintain a 
presence in the trucking industry." 
</P>
<P>
 But for union leaders, bringing in part-time workers carries symbolic as well 
as economic importance. Teamsters President Ron Carey, championing his union's 
cause, has argued that "Americans are sick and tired of seeing corporations 
slashing good jobs and replacing them with low-paying, part-time jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Geoghegan, an author and labor lawyer who has represented the 
Teamsters, said that when part-timers make inroads in traditionally high-paying 
and highly unionized industries such as trucking and airlines, it is 
particularly significant. "It's a warning sign of a deteriorating standard of 
living," he said. Working Part Time 
</P>
<P>
 Although most people who work part time do so out of personal preference, for 
many people it can be a bad deal. Hourly pay and benefits are substantially 
lower for part time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 INVOLUNTARILY PART TIME 
</P>
<P>
 People working part time not because they could not find full-time jobs 
(non-agricultural employment, in millions): 1973: 2.34 1974: 2.75 1975: 3.54 
1976: 3.33 1977: 3.37 1978: 3.30 1979: 3.37 1980: 4.06 1981: 4.50 1982: 5.85

THE CUTTING EDGE / CASE STUDY: HOW TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A BUSINESS; WORLD CUP 
GOES HIGH-TECH; TECHNOLOGY: COMPUTER FIRMS POOL TALENT TO BRING LATEST 
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS TO SPORTS CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
 Former Venezuelan soccer star Cheche Vidal hung up his cleats years ago, but 
when the World Cup soccer championship -- the most-watched sporting event on 
the planet -- kicks off this summer, he'll have a lot more on his mind than 
winning a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidal is vice president of technology for World Cup USA 1994 Inc. He is in 
charge of what is perhaps the most advanced computer and telecommunications 
system yet designed for a sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup USA 1994, the Los Angeles-based organizer of this year's soccer 
championship, is responsible for bringing the playoff to the United States for 
the first time. The 52-match series begins June 17 at stadiums in nine cities 
across the country. Seven of the games, including the final one, will be played 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the four-week championship will be a computer system that uses the 
latest technology, including computer networking, multimedia and high-speed 
fiber-optic communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Designing the system was a considerable challenge to World Cup officials. "No 
one was prepared for the staggering dimension of the job of generating a 
working environment for an event the size of the World Cup championships," 
Vidal said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vidal, the system will be used by about 50,000 people as an aid 
to daily administration and operations -- for tasks such as the instant 
dispensing of photo identification passes to players, coaches, referees and 
World Cup employees. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most far-reaching applications of the computer system will be the 
World Cup News Service. Designed for the use of the 3.6 million ticket holders, 
as well as the 7,500 to 10,000 journalists who will cover the matches, it is 
intended to be an easy-to-use source of timely information about the games, 
statistics, rules and players' biographies. 
</P>
<P>
 The system's database will also contain historical data on the 64-year-old 
World Cup and the 3,000 games and 20,000 players that have participated in the 
quadrennial competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers will also be linked to closed-circuit TV that will feed 
statistics to broadcasters during the games. You don't have to go to the game 
to get to the information, though. The general public will have access to it 
via the CompuServe network. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup's computer system blends technology from some of the most 
prominent suppliers: The computers are on loan from Sun Microsystems Inc., and 
telecommunications giant Sprint International will provide the fiber-optic 
communications to link up the international network. Two Sun SparcCenter 2000 
servers -- computers that serve as the main repository of data and software for 
the system -- in Dallas will anchor the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Systems integrator EDS -- Ross Perot's former firm -- designed the system and 
wrote some of its most critical software. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the firms are marketing partners of the World Cup, as are several 
other companies. In exchange for donations of $5 million each, they'll receive 
special advertising and promotional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "With their partnership, we've been able to capitalize on the most advanced of 
established technology," said Bill Alaoglu, assistant vice president of 
technology for World Cup USA. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup's system will have about 1,000 computer workstations distributed 
among approximately 50 smaller networks in the nine host cities. But because of 
the "distributed computing" technology used, every computer user will have 
access to any item of data or software program in the system, whether the 
information is in a computer across the room or across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A system of this sort is nothing unusual in the halls of big business, but the 
logistic demands of the World Cup nevertheless made this project unusually 
tricky. One problem was time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to put up a nationwide and international information system, but 
instead of having three years to describe the system and two years to develop 
it, we've had to get the whole thing up and running in a year and a half," 
Alaoglu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Space was another challenge. The World Cup's host cities -- Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, New York, Washington and Orlando 
-- are in four time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The system also had to be linked with soccer's international parent 
organization, the Zurich-based Federation Internationale de Football. Already, 
about half of the system -- or about 500 workstations -- is in place. But the 
rest can't go up until the stadiums and other hotel and office spaces are free, 
and that won't happen until the last minute.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have as little as 10 days to set up the office buildings, 
physically lay cabling for the computer networks and deploy 500 more 
workstations," said Bud Bencic, the EDS account executive on the World Cup 
project.  
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials expect that 1.6 billion people -- nearly a third of the 
world population -- will watch the final game on July 17 in Pasadena.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE '94 TAX TREND: A THROWBACK TO THE '70S

 The trend in taxes this year is to avoid trouble -- with voters that is -- as 
states and the federal government scramble to find ways of raising revenue that 
will be the least displeasing to middle-class taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan set the tone last month by voting to use sales taxes and a hefty levy 
on cigarettes, rather than property taxes, to finance public schools. Wisconsin 
followed two weeks ago by scheduling a $1-billion cut in property taxes by 1996 
and promising to come up with alternative sources of revenue before then. In 
all, some 20 states are making changes in their tax systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is strong at the federal level too. President Clinton proposed a 
75-cent-a-pack cigarette tax to help finance health care reform, and Congress 
hiked the suggestion to $1.25 a pack. Clinton also nodded at the idea of a tax 
on gambling to raise $3 billion toward the cost of welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, it's easy to target smokers and gamblers, but politicians and 
voters should understand that economically, such "sin" taxes might bring in 
less revenue than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 A more important trend is a widespread shift to consumption taxes, such as 
sales taxes, rather than property or income and business taxes. "It's not a bad 
idea," says Lawrence Stone, tax expert at Irell & Manella, a Los Angeles law 
firm. "Consumption taxes are less disruptive to the economy than taxes on labor 
or capital." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are pitfalls as well as advantages in sales taxes. And the more we 
understand them, the more we can make intelligent choices about public finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's trend is a throwback to the anti-tax sentiments of the late 1970s that 
produced Proposition 13 in California, which curbed property taxes and reined 
in government, and Proposition 2 1/2 in Massachusetts. In the present revolt, 
Colorado voters, seeking to harness government, have passed an amendment 
requiring ballot approval for any tax change. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no easy fixes. A study released Tuesday says California is 
suffering a worrisome erosion in education and public services -- a fall to 14% 
below the national average in school funding -- because of structural 
distortions in its sales and property taxes. Other states are likely to run 
into similar unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The currently popular idea of heavily taxing cigarettes, for example, could 
prove disappointing in two ways. In the past, tax hikes of pennies to a nickel 
a pack reduced cigarette sales by about 5%, several studies show. The new steep 
taxes -- the city of Detroit is already moving toward 75 cents a pack -- will 
cause more smokers to quit, which will be a boon for their health but not for 
school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, higher taxes spark illegal activity. Canada last year levied $2.69 a 
pack in taxes and watched in horror as smuggling and black markets erupted. It 
has since rescinded the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 As for gambling, "no reason why it shouldn't be taxed," says economist Henry 
Aaron of the Brookings Institution. But economically, gambling revenues are too 
unpredictable to be a satisfactory source for public finance -- as lotteries 
have proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Volatility is a drawback of sales taxes also; tax revenues jump around with 
consumer spending. "Surpluses pile up in good times, leading to calls for tax 
cuts, then fall in bad times, producing deficits," says Ron Snell of the 
National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 And many sales tax systems are out of date. The American people are spending 
more on services -- medical, legal, dental, all sorts of consulting. Yet sales 
taxes in most states focus on goods. Thus, the buyer of a lawn mower pays a tax 
but the probably wealthier person who hires a gardener does not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Budget Priorities, a Washington think tank, estimates that 
California forgoes $1.7 billion a year in tax revenue by not taxing services. 
But doing so may not be easy. "There are fierce arguments in many states about 
extending sales taxes to services," says Carol Douglas, state editor of "Tax 
Notes," an Arlington, Va., research publication. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, property taxes also have their drawbacks: In areas of sharply 
rising land and house values, such as Montana today and California in the '70s, 
they threaten family homes and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 And politically, notes one tax expert, "property taxes tend to fall on 
articulate people who vote," which probably explains why they have been 
declining as a source of states' revenue for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the solution? "There should be a balance among sales and property 
and income or other taxes," says Steven Gold, director of the Center for the 
Study of the States in Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Michigan is creating such a balance. The state's sales tax was 
only 4% -- below the national average -- before voters last month hiked it to 
6%. But in property taxes per resident, Michigan ranked high -- 8th in the 
country. So voters rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Michigan had to balance school funding between rich and poor districts, 
a major need for most states. And sales taxes offer the flexibility that allow 
this to be done more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 California's system since Proposition 13 qualifies as balanced, with property 
and sales taxes contributing roughly equal percentages of state and local 
funding, and income taxes accounting for 45% of state revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The political arguments as the state tries to move ahead revolve around two 
poles. One is the recommendation of the liberal Center for Budget Priorities to 
increase revenues by enlarging the scope of sales taxes and loosening the 
strictures of Prop. 13. The other is the forthcoming recommendations of a 
governor's commission headed by former Treasury Secretary George Schultz to 
spur the economy by cutting taxes on business. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a worthy argument, and as the state pursues it, we should remind 
ourselves -- particularly in the week of April 15 -- that tax changes come and 
go but that the average percentage of income most Americans end up paying in 
taxes, about 25%, has not varied in 16 years, according to the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 And we should also keep in mind a quotation from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes 
Jr.: "Taxes are what we pay for civilized society."

PARAMOUNT JOINS THE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE RUSH; TECHNOLOGY: VENTURE WITH 
TORRANCE-BASED DAVIDSON FOLLOWS WAVE OF MERGERS SEEKING PIECE OF BURGEONING 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eyeing what it believes will be a $1-billion market for educational multimedia 
software, Paramount Publishing said Tuesday that it has formed a joint venture 
with Torrance-based Davidson & Associates, the largest remaining independent, 
publicly owned publisher of educational software. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of the deal -- which includes an initial $50-million investment from 
Paramount -- is one of the broadest multimedia alliances in the fast-growing 
education arena thus far. The joint venture, which aims to produce electronic 
books for consumers, schools and businesses, follows a wave of multimedia 
mergers in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 For Paramount, the world's largest publisher of educational books, the 
five-year venture with Davidson offers the prospect of leveraging the vast 
library it already owns into a new medium. For Davidson, best known for its 
ubiquitous Math Blaster program, it means fast expansion and the opportunity to 
develop expertise in the lucrative school curriculum market. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which went public last year, plans to build an addition to its 
Torrance facility, complete with a one-way mirrored area to observe parents and 
children using the software. Bob Davidson, who runs the company with his wife, 
Jan, a former teacher who founded Davidson, said they plan to hire about 200 
people over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance illustrates how old-line publishers such as Paramount -- which 
has been hurriedly converting its books into computerized format but does not 
expect to finish the job until 1996 -- are turning to younger, smaller 
companies such as Davidson to help them make the transition to the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic books are published on CD-ROMs, which hold 400 times the data of a 
typical computer floppy disk and can store pictures, sound and video as well as 
text. As the price of computer equipment needed to play CD-ROMs plummeted, the 
number of titles exploded to more than 8,100 worldwide in 1993, according to 
InfoTech, a Woodstock, Vt., market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount said schools are increasingly demanding multimedia accessories to 
traditional textbooks. And educational software aimed at children and 
teen-agers, who often are more at home interacting with a computer than their 
parents, has proven to be a particularly hot segment of the CD-ROM market. 
High-growth forecasts estimate sales of home software alone will reach $300 
million this year, doubling to $600 million in 1996 -- all of which has spawned 
a rash of mergers and alliances in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramount is recognizing that there are very few horses to ride in the 
educational software area," said Charles Finnie, an analyst with investment 
banker Volpe Welty & Co. in San Francisco. "It wants to get its hooks into this 
very attractive market." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Pearson, parent company of publisher Addison-Wesley, 
bought Software Toolworks, a Novato, Calif.-based educational multimedia 
publisher. In February, Electronic Arts agreed to purchase Broderbund, the 
leading publisher of children's software, which has a separate deal to publish 
electronic children's books with Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount itself bought software developer Computer Curriculum Corp. in 1990, 
and its parent company, Paramount Communications Inc., has a minority stake in 
La Crescenta-based multimedia start-up Knowledge Adventure. Paramount was 
recently purchased by Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount and Davidson will share the investment and revenue in a set of about 
25 titles to be developed for the home and business markets, drawn from 
Paramount's library of more than 300,000 titles. Plans include interactive 
versions of the children's book "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" and the bestseller 
"Beating the Street" by investment guru Peter Lynch. They will be sold under a 
new joint Simon & Schuster-Davidson name in computer and bookstores. Simon & 
Schuster is a unit of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a separate deal, Davidson will develop curriculum-based software for 
Paramount for schools. These CD-ROM titles will be sold with textbooks 
published by Paramount's Prentice Hall, Silver Burdett Ginn, Computer 
Curriculum, Supplemental and ESL (English as a second language) units. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount stock ended off 87.5 cents at $38.375 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Davidson rose $1 to $23.50 on Nasdaq. Viacom was off $1.125 at 
$26.625 on the American Stock Exchange.

 Abbey Healthcare Group Sued by Former Exec: Victor Chaltiel, 52, is seeking 
more than $6 million in damages from the Costa Mesa-based health care provider, 
alleging that he was wrongfully terminated in February.In a lawsuit filed in 
Los Angeles County Superior Court, he charges that Abbey used "heavy-handed, 
bad-faith tactics" to eliminate his contract and push him out as president and 
chief executive. Chaltiel, of Manhattan Beach, joined Abbey in 1993, shortly 
after it paid $195 million to acquire Torrance-based Total Pharmaceuticals 
where he had served as chairman, president and chief executive since 1989. 
Abbey would not comment on the suit.

 USAir Plans Hirings: The carrier said it will hire about 800 part-time 
reservation agents -- some from previous layoffs -- and about 200 flight 
attendants.A 49% increase in calls to USAir reservation centers since March, 
1993, sparked the move, a spokeswoman said. The airline said it expects to lose 
more than $200 million in the first quarter of 1994 but that lower fares appear 
to be leading to an increase in passengers. USAir lost millions of dollars in 
the past year and cut hundreds of jobs. It recently asked its unions to start 
discussions on wage, benefit and work-rule concessions.

 Viacom President Says Blockbuster Deal Near: Frank Biondi, seeking to counter 
growing skepticism that Viacom Inc.'s acquisition of video rental giant 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. is in trouble, predicted that the deal will 
close within a few weeks.But analysts remain skeptical because many Blockbuster 
shareholders are unhappy with the terms of the deal, which call for Blockbuster 
stockholders to receive Viacom securities, which have plunged in value. The 
merger stems from the battle over Paramount Communications Inc., of which 
Viacom took control in part by using $1.85 billion that Blockbuster paid for 
the Viacom securities. Biondi made his comments before money managers at a 
Wertheim Schroeder/Variety media investor conference in New York.

 NFL Contract Boosts Fox TV Affiliations: Fox Broadcasting Co., which won a 
$1.56-billion contract to broadcast National Football League games earlier this 
year, said it has added seven new full-time affiliates and 24 secondary 
affiliates to its roster of Fox stations. The additional affiliates should 
boost the network's coverage from 94% to 98% of U.S. TV homes, Fox said. Both 
CBS and ABC have threatened reprisals against their affiliates that agree to 
part-time Fox affiliation for the NFL games.

P&G REPORTS $102-MILLION DERIVATIVES LOSS; EARNINGS: THE SWAPS CHARGE MAY BE 
THE LARGEST EVER REPORTED BY A U.S. INDUSTRIAL COMPANY. BANK THAT ARRANGED 
CONTRACTS SAYS IT ADVISED SELLING. 
</P>

<P>
 Procter & Gamble Co., the consumer products giant, said Tuesday that it was 
badly burned by investing in two exotic financial contracts that created a 
$102-million after-tax charge in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss is believed to be the largest ever reported by a U.S. industrial 
company on swaps, a financial derivative in which two parties exchange interest 
payments on loans to hedge against interest rate risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble said it often used these contracts to hedge against risk but 
that the swaps in question fell outside its normal investments. 
</P>
<P>
 P&G said the two contracts, arranged by Bankers Trust New York Corp., were so 
complex that when interest rates leaped higher last month, its losses 
multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derivatives like these are dangerous, and we were badly burned," said 
Chairman and Chief Executive Edwin Artzt. "We won't let this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We are seriously considering our legal options relative to Bankers 
Trust, the financial institution that designed these swaps and brought them to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust said it fully discussed the contracts with Procter & Gamble 
officials and said its advice to sell them when interest rates rose was 
unheeded by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankers Trust entered into a number of leveraged derivative transactions with 
Procter & Gamble, several of which were profitable to that company," the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the contracts were based on a bullish view of U.S. and German interest 
rates, which instead of falling rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust said it strongly and formally recommended that P&G limit its 
risks by unwinding all or part of these transactions. "Senior officials 
rejected these recommendations," Bankers Trust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives such as swaps have become popular in recent years, but, like all 
investments, they have a downside if the market turns in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The news may rattle investors today, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that derivatives are like floating mines in a busy sea lane," 
said Alan Ackerman, strategist at Reich & Co. "When they get too close, they 
can do a lot of damage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that earnings disappointments can be devastating and that derivatives 
may surface in earnings reports among other companies as well," Ackerman added, 
calling the P&G news "a shot across the bow." 
</P>
<P>
 P&G said that excluding the onetime charge for the third fiscal quarter, which 
will be announced this month, earnings will be up about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate that this onetime charge detracts from the outstanding 
progress expected in the company's operating earnings for the third quarter," 
Artzt said.

 General Magic Signs Up France Telecom: The software consortium that hopes to 
set the standard for piloting users through multimedia entertainment and 
information networks got a boost when France Telecom said it would take an 
undisclosed equity stake in the venture. The French state-owned telephone 
monopoly is the latest telecommunications giant to back General Magic, based in 
Mountain View. General Magic is developing software to make it easier to send 
information over new communications networks and to search for specific 
information -- such as news reports, stock quotes or flight schedules -- 
through mountains of data becoming available on global computer networks.

CBS ENTERTAINMENT CHIEF GOT $7.8 MILLION, MOST OF IT AS BONUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS Entertainment President Jeffrey Sagansky, who has helped guide CBS to the 
top of the ratings charts over the past three years, earned a total of $7.8 
million last year most of it in the form of a onetime bonus for keeping the 
network in its No. 1 position. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive year that Sagansky earned what is widely 
believed to be one of largest executive paychecks in Hollywood. The chief CBS 
programmer was paid a total of $6.1 million last year for leading the network 
into first place during 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky's pay package was disclosed Tuesday in the CBS Inc. proxy report, 
which showed that he earned a base salary of $500,000 and a bonus of $7.3 
million tied to the network achieving a "first standing" in last year's 
prime-time ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay package does not include any bonus Sagansky might receive for the 
current broadcast season, which ends this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky is nearing the end of his 4 1/2-year CBS contract and is expected to 
decide soon whether he will stay at the network. 
</P>
<P>
 If he stays, Sagansky is expected to assume a new title at CBS with broader 
responsibilities, but he would cede overall running of the entertainment 
division to his chief lieutenant, Peter Tortorici. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky earned more than all four of the other top CBS executives combined, 
including his bosses, Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch, who earned a total of 
$1.9 million last year, and CBS/Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer, who 
earned $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say Sagansky has talked with both MCA Inc. and Sony Pictures 
about joining those studios after his contract expires, as well as with 
independent movie producer Savoy Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has yet to reach a deal with any of them, and the longer he waits, 
sources suggest, the more likely he is to continue some kind of association 
with CBS.

GROWTH OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES' PAY LEVELS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growth in chief executives' compensation flattened out last year because of 
more activist corporate boards, but it continues to rise much faster than most 
peoples' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonuses and salaries rose 9.4% for top executives last year, according to Gary 
Lyons, who studies compensation issues at Washington-based Institutional 
Shareholder Services Inc., while long-term compensation, which includes stock 
options, rose 13.2%. Both rates are about even with last year's when adjusted 
for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons has already looked at proxies for 157 companies in the Standard & Poor's 
500 index and expects to have data on about 7,000 companies at the end of proxy 
season in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle managers aren't getting the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at that level are just worried about keeping their jobs, not about 
salaries going up a lot," said Bob Ochsner, director of compensation for 
Philadelphia-based Hay Management Consultants. While Ochsner had no hard data 
on middle-management pay raises, he said companies' overall payroll expenses 
have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Graef Crystal, editor of a newsletter on executive compensation in Lake Tahoe, 
Nev., said that in 1975, CEOs at America's 200 largest companies made 40 times 
the pay of the average worker. In 1992, top executives' pay had jumped to 157 
times the average worker's. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief executive mega-salaries are still in evidence this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Greenhill, chairman and chief executive of Travelers Inc.'s Smith 
Barney Shearson Inc. brokerage unit got $36.3 million for the six months he 
worked at the firm last year. Sanford Weill, chairman and CEO of Travelers, 
earned $26.4 million. Bear Stearns Companies Inc. chief Alan Greenberg raked in 
$15.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons said that based on calculations that include a company's stock 
performance, the overall stock market performance and competitors' performance, 
about 24% of companies overpaid their CEOs, about 3% more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers worry some shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about compensation in 1993," said Sarah Teslik, head of the 
Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington-based trade group of public, 
private and union pension funds. "I'm afraid that companies have understood 
that institutional investors don't care how much executives are paid as long as 
it is theoretically tied to performance."

TIME WARNER CHIEF SAYS NEW RULES PENALIZE CABLE; COMMUNICATIONS: GERALD LEVIN 
WARNS THAT SECOND FCC-ORDERED RATE CUT WILL SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SYSTEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government's new rules for cable TV penalize the industry too harshly and 
will harm development of better communications systems, the head of the 
nation's largest media company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner Inc., sharply 
criticized the Federal Communications Commission, which last month invoked the 
second rate cut in less than a year on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC issues eloquent calls for achieving American leadership in building 
the communications systems of the next century, then turns around and does its 
best to postpone or prevent that achievement," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the speech, made at a conference of investment bankers and entertainment 
industry executives, Levin joined the chorus of cable and technology executives 
to protest the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other executives say the loss of revenue will weaken their capital 
investment plans and slow improvements to phone, cable and wireless networks. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who followed Levin with a luncheon address at the 
conference, did not respond to the criticism in his speech. However, in 
response to a question from an audience member, he repeated his often-stated 
view that one government decision cannot drastically slow the development of 
systems that allow voice, video and data to be sent and received anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going along at a tremendous pace," Hundt said.

STABLE WHOLESALE PRICES EASE INFLATION WORRIES; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS ARE 
ENCOURAGED AS MARCH INDEX RISES ONLY 0.2%. MARKETS ARE UNAFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steady energy costs helped offset a rise in food prices as wholesale price 
inflation was in check in March, the government said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The report eased inflation worries just one day before a much-anticipated 
report on consumer prices, and financial markets -- which have been shaken 
recently by expectations of rising inflation and interest rates -- were stable. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale prices rose 0.2% last month, and for the first quarter of 1994 they 
were up at an annual rate of 3.9%, the Labor Department said. For all of last 
year, they were up only 0.2%. The index measures inflation pressures before 
they reach the consumer. The Labor Department is due to announce today the 
consumer price index for March; most analysts predict a modest increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said that even though some commodity prices rose -- with storms and 
icy weather driving fruit and vegetable prices higher -- the overall picture is 
tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to worry. But I can't find much to worry about," said Ron 
Schreibman of the National Assn. of Wholesaler Distributors. "Inflation is the 
rhinoceros in the room that everyone fears but no one can locate." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Co. said inflation will continue to be tame 
as long as labor costs remain low. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration hailed the report as further evidence that 
inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't see a scenario under which inflation rises meaningfully from 
present levels," Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's producer price index had jumped 0.5% in February, the largest 
increase in 10 months, because of surging heating costs. March's increase 
matched January's 0.2% advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy prices, which soared 2.8% in February as Americans turned up their 
thermostats to ward off winter's chill, were level in March as spring arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline prices declined 1.8% and heating oil was down 0.7%. But gas for home 
heating increased 1.9%, breaking the previous record of 1.5% set in June, 1993, 
and October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Food prices, down 0.4% in February, shot up 0.5% last month. Producer Price

LAST-MINUTE TAX TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's two days before April 15 and you still haven't filed your tax return? 
There's still time and help available. But be careful. People who wait until 
the deadline to file are the most error-prone of all taxpayers, the Internal 
Revenue Service says. And some of these errors can subject you to penalty. Here 
is a brief guide on completing your tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign and date your return: In the last-minute rush to file, many people 
don't. And, technically, if it's not signed, it's not filed. You could be 
subject to late-filing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the prepared address label: The label the IRS sent on your 1040 booklet 
is coded. Using it, rather than filling in your name, address and Social 
Security number by hand, tends to speed up the processing of your return.  
</P>
<P>
 * Check the postage: Without enough stamps on the envelope, your return may be 
kicked back, which could subject you to late-filing penalties of 5% of the tax 
owed for every month it's late. 
</P>
<P>
 * File for an extension: If you can't make the deadline, file a Form 4868, 
which gives you another four months to procrastinate. You are supposed to pay 
your estimated tax when you send in the extension request, but if you can't, 
don't. Interest on the amount you owe will accrue at a 7% annual rate, and 
there's a half-percent-a-month penalty, says Rob Giannangeli, an IRS spokesman. 
But starting this year, there is no longer a "late-filing" penalty -- that's 
the onerous 5% per month charge -- for failing to send in your check. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last-minute mailing: IRS employees will be at the following Los Angeles-area 
post offices from about 6:30 p.m. to midnight Friday to provide last-minute 
filers with tax forms and other aid. These locations will also be open late to 
accommodate you if you need that important April 15 postmark.

STRIPPER FINDS SUPPORT IN BUST RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stripper allowed by a tax judge to depreciate surgical implants that greatly 
enlarged her breasts said Tuesday that the ruling corrects rules that were 
unfair to entertainers in her field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply a stage prop we are carrying around to make money," Cynthia Hess 
said of the implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy for me and a lot of other girls in show business," she said before 
performing at the Bamboo Room in Green Bay as Friday's deadline for filing tax 
returns approached. "The tax laws seem to be against us everywhere we turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Hess, known professionally as Chesty Love, and her husband, Reginald R. Hess, 
claimed a $2,088 deduction in 1988 for depreciation on the surgical implants to 
enlarge her bust size to 56FF. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS rejected the deduction, citing many court rulings that said spending 
money to improve a taxpayer's health or appearance, though useful for business, 
are too inherently personal to be deducted as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hess, of Ft. Wayne, Ind., won agreement from Special Trial Judge Joan 
Seitz Pate, who last month ruled that the implants increased Hess' income and 
that the breasts, at 10 pounds each, were so big and bulky that she couldn't 
derive personal benefit from them.

'FRESH' CHICKEN LABEL LAW RULED INVALID; POULTRY: U.S. JUDGE SAYS FEDERAL 
AGRICULTURAL REGULATIONS OVERRULE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION. USDA REVIEWS ITS 
POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has struck down a California law that would have prevented the 
sale of fresh, Southern-grown chicken in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge David Levi in Sacramento said a state law limiting use of 
the word "fresh" on poultry labels is preempted by federal agricultural 
regulations. The ruling was a victory for Southern chicken processors who stood 
to lose millions in fresh chicken sales under the California law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision means consumers will continue to have a choice . . . brought to 
them through fair competition by all those in the industry," according to 
George Watts, president of the National Broiler Council, the plaintiff in the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the ruling may not end the fresh chicken scrap, pitting giant 
Southern companies such as Tyson and Conagra against California processors 
Foster Farms and Zacky Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture is reviewing its freshness regulations to 
determine whether changes are needed. The author of the California law, Sen. 
Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto) said he would push for revised legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Randy Christison, representing the California Department of 
Food and Agriculture, the defendant in the lawsuit, said the state would 
probably appeal Levi's decision, which was handed down Friday. The law has not 
been enforced, pending outcome of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't appeal cases lightly, but it looks to me like we'll be taking this 
one" to a higher court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California law prohibited poultry from being sold as fresh if it had ever 
been frozen to an internal temperature of 25 degrees, or held at 25 degrees for 
over 24 hours. The law had been sponsored by the California Poultry Federation, 
which described it as a truth-in-labeling measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation, an industry association dominated by Foster Farms and Zacky 
Farms, said chicken was being shipped into the state in "rock hard" condition 
at temperatures under 25 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 But Southern chicken processors said the law was an attempt to freeze them out 
of the market, since chicken shipped long distances must be held close to 25 
degrees to prevent spoilage. In the poultry industry, the word "fresh" is an 
important marketing tool, as most consumers demand fresh, not frozen, chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was enacted amid a decline in sales of California-grown chicken. With 
the state's economy on the ropes, consumers had been snapping up inexpensive 
chicken from Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, abandoning old loyalties to 
premium-priced, California-grown chicken. Today, home-grown chicken accounts 
for slightly more than a third of the $2.5-billion California market, down from 
nearly half nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 19-page decision, Levi noted that a provision of the federal Poultry 
Products Inspection Act prohibits states from imposing poultry labeling 
requirements differing from federal standards. He said a 1989 USDA policy memo 
permits processors to label poultry fresh when it is stored below 40 degrees 
and has never been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also invalidated other parts of the law restricting the use of the 
word "fresh" in poultry advertising and marketing.

3 MORE TRUCK FIRMS SEEK TEAMSTERS PACT; LABOR: INTERIM AGREEMENTS WOULD PUT 
4,350 BACK TO WORK. MANAGEMENT ACCUSES UNION OF SEEKING PUBLICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three more trucking companies Tuesday asked the Teamsters Union for interim 
agreements that would permit them to return to the highways pending an overall 
settlement of the week-old strike. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the agreements would permit the companies' 4,350 drivers and dock 
workers to join Teamsters members of two other carriers who had been exempted 
from the strike in earlier, separate agreements with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking Management Inc., which represents the struck firms, accused the union 
Tuesday of stringing out the interim agreements for the sake of headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest companies that requested interim agreements are TNT Holland Motor 
Express Inc. of Holland, Mich., the sixth-largest carrier, with 2,500 Teamster 
members; TNT Red Star of Newark, N.J., the eighth-largest, with 1,500, and 
Sea-Land Service of Elizabeth, N.J., with 350 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day it becomes clearer that TMI represents only the interest of the 
four companies that dominate the industry," Teamsters President Ron Carey said. 
"They don't represent the interest of the smaller companies or the communities 
we serve." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70,000 Teamsters drivers and dockworkers struck the 22 companies April 6 
over the increased use of trains and part-time workers. Since then, two 
carriers -- Preston Trucking and Carolina Freight Carriers -- have reached 
interim agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 A third company, Churchill Truck Lines Inc. of Chillicothe, Mo., went out of 
business Monday, saying strikers' demands would make it impossible to turn a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI had released the regional carriers last week to negotiate interim 
agreements that would be replaced when a national settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized that many of the companies could not survive a strike, and so 
the only decent thing to do was allow the companies to keep operating and their 
workers to keep earning their living," TMI President Arthur H. Bunte Jr. said 
in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of doing the honorable thing and immediately granting those interim 
agreements so their own members could get back to work, the Teamsters have 
adopted the deplorable strategy of stringing out these agreements. . . .

 Title: Chairman and CEO of Airtouch Communications 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 57 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Bachelor's degree in industrial management, Auburn University, 
Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Interests: Reading, golf, tennis, watching the Golden State Warriors. An avid 
health and fitness buff, he works out almost daily at 5:30 a.m. at the company 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone habit: Severe enough to require three phones in his company 
Cadillac, including one that's always charging in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: He and his wife, Ann, have two sons and a daughter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sam Ginn recently celebrated his 57th birthday in dramatic style. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up his post as chief executive of Pacific Telesis Group, the parent of 
Pacific Bell, and moved a few blocks away to head the company's newly spun-off 
wireless unit, AirTouch Communications. For the privilege, he took a sizable 
cut in pay -- more than $300,000 off the nearly $2.2 million in salary and 
bonuses he got in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch is starting off on the right foot, with no debt and $1.4 billion in 
the bank. It also has 4,400 employees and cellular telephone licenses for areas 
covering more than 81 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Its aim, says analyst Frederick W. Moran of Salomon Bros., "is to be the 
premier provider of wireless telecommunications services in the world's most 
attractive markets." As a partner with other companies, AirTouch already has 
licenses for Germany, Japan, France and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993, the company reported sales of nearly $990 million and net income of 
$34.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginn is an Alabama native whose forebears migrated to Colonial America with 
James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia. He talked recently about the 
opportunities for the newly independent company.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are your plans for AirTouch? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have the opportunity to develop a very large, very profitable 
international company over the next decade. The utilization of wireless 
services around the world is a phenomenon that's real. We would expect 
(cellular companies) in the United States to go from 6% (market penetration) to 
20% to 25%, and in the rest of the world from under 1% to about 10% to 15%. The 
primary objective of AirTouch is to get more than its share. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will you do that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We've developed a history. Of all the major competitions that have taken 
place around the world in the more developed markets, we have not lost one 
where we have elected to stay and compete. Now, we have gotten out of a few 
when we thought the up-front fees made them non-economic. We've developed a 
world reputation for our technical capability and our ability to deliver on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some have remarked that the new name is perhaps a little too touchy-feely. 
Any second thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The more we have focus groups, the more reinforcement we get that this is 
going to work extremely well in the marketplace. It's really the only 
consumer-type name; everything else is sort of mobile-digital-telecom. This is 
going to be a lot more consumer-friendly than some of those techie names. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you plan to compete with companies such as Nextel, which seeks to 
jump from radio dispatch into a system rivaling cellular? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We've always understood that we're going to have competitors. Through our 
surveys, we know that if customers think we're doing a good or outstanding job, 
they don't leave us. So we've instituted programs to basically test customers' 
feelings about our service, and we try to put in programs that allow them to 
say we're doing good or outstanding. A simple example for "gold" customers: 
We'll go to the garage, test the phone in the garage, make sure it's working -- 
give a very high level of customer service. That's the way you respond to 
competition. Plus, of course, you continue to get your costs down and you 
continue to look for opportunities to keep your rates down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you keep costs down when you're growing fast and you need more 
people and equipment and technology? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You get your costs down on a per-customer basis. We have this commitment 
among the employees of this company that we're going to double the initial 
public offering price in four years. We let the (staff) see if they can 
essentially fine-tune their operations and deliver either the additional 
revenue or the reductions in costs that are required. The other thing you do is 
try to make sure that the new technology gives you built-in savings. For 
instance, we are looking at systems now where a customer calls and orders the 
service, and by the time the customer hangs up, the person is on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When the government auctions frequencies next year for the next generation 
of wireless services -- personal communications services, or PCS -- you'll be 
limited to bidding for just 10 megahertz of spectrum, in areas where you offer 
cellular service, out of the 120-megahertz total. Will that be worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's an open question. If you could develop some specialized service, it 
may be. Examples: If you could put all your data customers on 10 megs, or maybe 
you could design a truly high-fidelity service for customers where rates don't 
matter, where the quality of the connections is more important than anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: To whom would that appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You know, Hollywood directors. There is a luxury segment in this business. 
I'm not sure that that's a financially viable segment. No. 1, we have to 
finally conclude that there are some market segments that make sense. No. 2, we 
have to be convinced that what we have to pay for them is within the range of 
our own economic assumptions. If we can't meet either of those, we're not 
interested in the 10 megs. But assuming we get excited about some market 
segment and the economics are right, I suspect we'll be bidding on some. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the markets where you don't offer cellular, do you intend to go after 
some of the 30-megahertz licenses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we will. I also think what you may see is players coming together 
and pooling resources, because this is going to be a very, very expensive 
proposition. Nobody's got the resources to fill out a ubiquitous, seamless, 
nationwide system. What you want in the end, if you can manage it, is as much 
seamless coverage as you can get nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have some of these coalitions in the works yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'd say everybody's talking to everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about the PCS auction as it is now configured? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the government in the end is going to configure the auction to 
maximize the revenue coming to the government. That's what I would do. (A while 
ago) there was a frenzy about all this, which said to me that people would 
probably overpay. I think people have gotten a little more realistic. So I 
don't know what the psychology will be when we reach that PCS bidding time. One 
of the things you don't want to do is significantly overbid for these and 
essentially subtract value from what you've already created. I think there will 
be some of that in this process.

THE CUTTING EDGE; DATA -- OR PIE? -- IN THE SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledesic Corp., backed by high-technology investors Craig McCaw and Bill 
Gates, recently announced grand plans for a $9-billion satellite network to 
provide high-speed voice, data and video communications worldwide. Skeptics -- 
and competitors -- abound, but here's how the system is supposed to work for 
users in a city, a major computer site (a business or university), and a rural 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teledesic network would consist of 840 satellites in orbit at just 430 
miles above the earth (unlike most communications satellites, which are at 
22,500 miles.) Each one would circle the globe vertically, with 40 satellites 
in each of 21 paths. Each satellite would take 99 minutes to complete an orbit, 
and would have an estimated life of 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 1. City A user sends audio, video or text through local phone lines to a 
high-speed terminal, which encrypts the data and fires it up to the nearest 
satellite. Computers direct the data onward through other satellites until the 
closest one to the recipient is found. From there, the signal is beamed down to 
another high-speed terminal, decoded and sent through phone lines to the 
recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Major computer site Using its own dedicated high-speed terminal, the 
organization would continually send large amounts of data directly to the 
satellite network, avoiding phone-line bottlenecks in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Remote residence A smaller, slower housetop dish would be available to 
users in rural or undeveloped areas, where it would obviate phone lines. The 
dish would require so little electricity that it could probably run on solar 
power.

THE CUTTING EDGE; POSTCARDS FROM CYBERSPACE; HOW TO GET SEC FILINGS ON THE 
INTERNET (HINT: IT ISN'T EASY) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have access to the Internet, or even if you have an e-mail account 
somewhere else, you can get Securities and Exchange Commission filings 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, finding what you need isn't easy and in some cases won't be 
possible at all.Only about 1,000 major corporations make their filings 
electronically, and you can only get filings made in this way. (All companies 
are expected to file electronically within a couple of years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also, all the filings are at least 24 hours old. The filings go first from the 
SEC to Mead Data, which is the government's designated wholesaler of SEC 
filings. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that getting SEC filings via the Internet is becoming easier. 
Internet users lucky enough to be using the spiffy Mosaic interface can easily 
get what they want. And very soon others will be able to gopher to 
town.hall.org, the nonprofit group running the Internet project, to get filings 
using an easy menu system. Also available at the same place: Federal Reserve 
Board data. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, send e-mail to mail@town.hall.org. The body of the 
message should consist of one word: help .

 One of the more interesting how-to guides to defense conversion is being 
written by Gordon Penharlow. 
</P>
<P>
 His little Monrovia firm, Pacific Multitech Inc., has been writing technical 
manuals for manufacturing, operating and maintaining aircraft parts, radar, 
communications gear and other defense equipment since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few years ago, Penharlow saw the handwriting on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing the downturn in military spending, he set his modest team of seven 
employees to writing manuals for complex, commercial computer software. The 
software is used by a variety of companies for their interoffice communications 
networks, financial planning and administration, Penharlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't drop aerospace, we merely added another capability," he said. Sales 
of Pacific Multitech, which is privately held, should top $1 million this year 
-- and 35% of that will be generated by its new commercial lines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a logical transition. In compiling its defense-related manuals, Pacific 
Multitech itself employs sophisticated word processors and computer graphics 
systems, using dozens of different software packages. 
</P>
<P>
 The manuals that arrive with those packages are often tough to decipher. So 
Pacific Multitech figured it could write better manuals that are free of 
computer jargon and easier for software users to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Penharlow has no plans to abandon the beleaguered defense industry, however. 
Although overall spending for new military equipment is sliding, there's still 
strong demand for defense electronics and communications systems that rely on 
state-of-the-art technology -- and whose users need manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 When defense spending began waning, "initially it took a chunk out of our 
business," Penharlow said. "But it has come back, and the past 18 months have 
been very good for us." JAMES F. PELTZ

 United Parcel Builds a Better Bar Code: Bar codes have become a fact of life. 
Just ask former President George Bush, whose astonishment at seeing a 
supermarket checkout scanner helped sink his 1992 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, United Parcel Service set out to build a better bar code. 
What the delivery service company came up with is MaxiCode, which packs a load 
of information in little more than the space of a thumbnail. 
</P>
<P>
 A traditional bar code used by UPS for tracking packages fits 18 characters of 
information in 3.5 square inches. By contrast, MaxiCode crams 100 bits of 
information into a square inch. And, unlike the old bar codes, if a piece of 
MaxiCode is torn off, the missing information can be quickly re-created by 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 UPS also developed an overhead reader that deciphers the new code at 
ultra-high speeds as packages move along a conveyor belt. A computer then 
routes the packages for shipping. The company began using the MaxiCode system 
at a new Michigan facility last year, and plans are on for a plant near Chicago 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 UPS eventually wants to use MaxiCode throughout its system, and it is making 
the new code available to other companies. Project engineer Earle Timothy said 
the savings in paper alone will pay for the investment and that UPS service 
will improve dramatically. "A package will have a personality rather than just 
an ID," Timothy said. "It will tell us things about itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Service Lets You Buy by Wire: Attention, cyberspace shoppers. Looking for a 
hard-to-find capacitor? Want to get the best price on pencils? 
</P>
<P>
 These days, some corporate and government buyers need look no further than 
their electronic mail. Thanks to an automated brokerage system developed by 
USC's Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, finding and ordering 
products has been reduced to the push of a button -- well, several buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, called Fast, was started in 1987 and has picked up speed in the 
past two years. More than 130 customers -- including large entities such as 
General Electric Co., the Department of Defense and universities -- have 
purchased more than $7 million worth of goods through Fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: A customer in search of a particular product sends an 
e-mail message to Fast via the Internet computer network. The Fast computer 
screens its database to determine which of the 2,700 vendors in its system 
carry the product, then sends those vendors e-mail or faxed requests. Fast can 
even directly access some vendors' inventory databases to find out if they have 
the item in stock, its price and the estimated shipping date. It then relays 
the information to the customer, who orders through Fast. The entire 
transaction can take less than 10 minutes, or sometimes as much as a day. 
</P>
<P>
 A buyer can also tailor a product request -- by asking Fast to find the lowest 
price, for instance. Fast then places the order automatically and sends the 
customer a confirmation. Payment also goes through Fast, which follows up to 
ensure that the product was shipped on time. Fast charges the buyer an 8% fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Location Beacon Caters to At-Risk Execs: Executives traveling abroad have a 
lot more to worry about these days than exchange rates and wrinkled shirts. 
Kidnaping, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the London-based Counter Spy Shop developed the WanderCare personal 
location beacon. While location devices have been around for about 30 years, 
this gadget would make Maxwell Smart jealous. The tiny (less than two ounces) 
beacon can be slipped in a pocket or fitted in a shoe, an eyeglass case . . . 
even a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The beacon emits a personalized digital beam that is picked up by a receiver 
connected to a laptop computer. The signal has a range of 15 miles and can 
pinpoint the location of the person carrying the beacon to within an inch. The 
computer can be programmed to track distance and direction and, if necessary, 
notify local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The product has been on the market for six months. Tom Felice, manager of the 
Counter Spy Shop in New York, said he sells about six a month for $3,800 to 
$9,400 each, depending on the degree of customization required. The Counter Spy 
Shop in Beverly Hills figures it sells three a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice doesn't know of any specific instance in which a kidnaping plot was 
foiled by the locater beacon. And he concedes that the device wouldn't do much 
good if someone were strip-searched. However, the beacon includes a panic 
button that alerts the person manning the receiver that danger may be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? A beacon device that can be inserted under the skin, Felice says. 
</P>
<P>
 Software Escrow Safeguards Source Code: When companies buy software, they're 
often buying a relationship. Software users need support and programs need 
upgrading and customizing. But if the software developer goes out of business, 
the crucial "source code" for the software might suddenly become unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the software escrow company. Like real estate escrow firms, these 
outfits serve as neutral third parties, keeping the developer's proprietary 
source code -- the guts of a program, through which upgrades, enhancements and 
corrections are made -- under lock and key. If the developer goes bankrupt or 
fails to provide the agreed-upon service, the source code is released to the 
licensee. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses simply use their attorneys or banks for this role, but 
software escrow companies say they can do more. One such firm, San 
Francisco-based SourceFile, charges companies that license software from 
developers $1,000 a year, for which it fashions an agreement between the two 
parties, stores the source code in underground, climate-controlled vaults and 
makes sure the code is kept current with the latest revisions. PATRICE APODACA

PARAMOUNT JOINS THE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE RUSH; TECHNOLOGY: VENTURE WITH 
TORRANCE-BASED DAVIDSON FOLLOWS WAVE OF MERGERS SEEKING PIECE OF BURGEONING 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eyeing what it believes will be a $1-billion market for educational multimedia 
software, Paramount Publishing said Tuesday that it has formed a joint venture 
with Torrance-based Davidson & Associates, the largest remaining independent, 
publicly owned publisher of educational software. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of the deal -- which includes an initial $50-million investment from 
Paramount -- is one of the broadest multimedia alliances in the fast-growing 
education arena thus far. The joint venture, which aims to produce electronic 
books for consumers, schools and businesses, follows a wave of multimedia 
mergers in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 For Paramount, the world's largest publisher of educational books, the 
five-year venture with Davidson offers the prospect of leveraging the vast 
library it already owns into a new medium. For Davidson, best known for its 
ubiquitous Math Blaster program, it means fast expansion and the opportunity to 
develop expertise in the lucrative school curriculum market. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson also moved into the entertainment software field recently by 
acquiring Chaos Studios Inc., a start-up Costa Mesa computer game developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which went public last year, plans to build an addition to its 
Torrance facility, complete with a one-way mirrored area to observe parents and 
children using the software. Bob Davidson, who runs the company with his wife, 
Jan, a former teacher who founded Davidson, said they plan to hire about 200 
people over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance illustrates how old-line publishers such as Paramount -- which 
has been hurriedly converting its books into computerized format but does not 
expect to finish the job until 1996 -- are turning to younger, smaller 
companies such as Davidson to help them make the transition to the digital age. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic books are published on CD-ROMs, which hold 400 times the data of a 
typical computer floppy disk and can store pictures, sound and video as well as 
text. As the price of computer equipment needed to play CD-ROMs plummeted, the 
number of titles exploded to more than 8,100 worldwide in 1993, according to 
InfoTech, a Woodstock, Vt., market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount said schools are increasingly demanding multimedia accessories to 
traditional textbooks. And educational software aimed at children and 
teen-agers, who often are more at home interacting with a computer than their 
parents, has proven to be a particularly hot segment of the CD-ROM market. 
High-growth forecasts estimate sales of home software alone will reach $300 
million this year, doubling to $600 million in 1996 -- all of which has spawned 
a rash of mergers and alliances in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramount is recognizing that there are very few horses to ride in the 
educational software area," said Charles Finnie, an analyst with investment 
banker Volpe Welty & Co. in San Francisco. "It wants to get its hooks into this 
very attractive market." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Pearson, parent company of publisher Addison-Wesley, 
bought Software Toolworks, a Novato, Calif.-based educational multimedia 
publisher. In February, Electronic Arts agreed to purchase Broderbund, the 
leading publisher of children's software, which has a separate deal to publish 
electronic children's books with Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount itself bought software developer Computer Curriculum Corp. in 1990, 
and its parent company, Paramount Communications Inc., has a minority stake in 
La Crescenta-based multimedia start-up Knowledge Adventure. Paramount was 
recently purchased by Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount and Davidson will share the investment and revenue in a set of about 
25 titles to be developed for the home and business markets, drawn from 
Paramount's library of more than 300,000 titles. Plans include interactive 
versions of the children's book "Chicka Chicka Boom Boom" and the bestseller 
"Beating the Street" by investment guru Peter Lynch. They will be sold under a 
new joint Simon & Schuster-Davidson name in computer and bookstores. Simon & 
Schuster is a unit of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a separate deal, Davidson will develop curriculum-based software for 
Paramount for schools. These CD-ROM titles will be sold with textbooks 
published by Paramount's Prentice Hall, Silver Burdett Ginn, Computer 
Curriculum, Supplemental and ESL (English as a second language) units. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount stock ended off 87.5 cents at $38.375 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Davidson rose $1 to $23.50 on Nasdaq. Viacom was off $1.125 at 
$26.625 on the American Stock Exchange.

 A former president of Abbey Healthcare Group Inc., alleging that he was 
wrongfully terminated earlier this year, has sued the health care provider for 
more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Victor Chaltiel, 52, alleges 
that Abbey used "heavy-handed, bad-faith tactics" to eliminate his employment 
contract and to push him out as president and chief executive officer. The suit 
also alleges that Abbey never intended to keep Chaltiel in the top jobs for 
more than a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel, a Manhattan Beach resident, became Abbey's president and CEO late 
last year after Abbey paid $195 million in November to acquire Torrance-based 
Total Pharmaceuticals. Chaltiel had served as Total Pharmaceuticals' chairman, 
president and chief executive since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey Healthcare, based in Costa Mesa, announced Feb. 9 that Chaltiel had 
resigned. The company would not comment Tuesday on his lawsuit, filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, Chaltiel played an active role in Abbey's acquisition 
of Total Pharmaceuticals. The suit states that Chaltiel helped to arrange 
nearly $200 million in financing to complete the friendly acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel also maintains that Abbey's board of directors assured him he would 
play a key role in the company and that he was given an employment contract 
with safeguards against being terminated without cause. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to the suit, the relationship between Chaltiel and Abbey 
Chairman Timothy M. Aitken quickly soured. According to the suit, Abbey 
"inexplicably terminated" Chaltiel after attempting to strip him of the 
employment contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel also is seeking an additional $1 million through arbitration in 
connection with an alleged breach of his employment contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey, which reported a 1993 profit of $14.3 million on revenue of $101 
million, provides drugs and health care services to patients at their homes. 
Abbey has acquired several companies in recent years, including Specialized 
Homecare Inc. in Madison, Mich., and Protocare Inc. in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Aitken described the company's recent string of acquisitions, 
including Total Pharmaceuticals, as giving it "all the tools to sustain (its) 
leadership position as a low-cost provider of health care services."

ANALYSTS SAY WIRELESS CABLE HAS BECOME RIPE FOR FRAUD; TECHNOLOGY: DEMAND FOR 
THE PROMISING NEW SERVICE IS LIKELY TO GROW. BUT THE UNREGULATED INDUSTRY MAY 
BREED SCAMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Wireless cable, which uses microwaves to beam TV programming to homes that 
conventional television cables can't or don't yet reach, is a technology with a 
bright future, analysts and industry insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the service can be offered inexpensively in areas either too remote or 
too densely populated to make installation of conventional TV cables practical, 
demand is likely to grow. More than 150 wireless cable systems already serve 
more than 500,000 subscribers nationwide, said Bruce Dickinson, senior vice 
president of Daniels & Associates, a Denver wireless cable broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a general perception in the industry," Dickinson said, that licenses 
for such wireless broadcasting "are only going to become more valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility has investors -- including broadcasters, independent phone 
companies and entrepreneurs -- scrambling to build markets. But because 
wireless cable is new and largely unregulated, the industry has become ripe for 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, regulators raided and shut down several operations in Orange, Los 
Angeles and San Diego counties that were selling wireless cable investments by 
phone, alleging that they were scams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a burden on the industry, which is a very promising technology," said 
Andrew Kreig, a spokesman for the Wireless Cable Assn., a lobbying organization 
in Washington. "Unfortunately, its promise is inflated by these people on the 
edges. It's that way with a lot of new high tech." 
</P>
<P>
 A primary target of the raids was Marrco Communications Inc. in Newport Beach, 
which does business as Micro-Lite Television. Jon H. Marple, president and 
chief executive, said that his company is legitimate and predicted that it will 
be "exonerated of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, American Wireless Systems Inc., which was then based in Irvine, 
became the target of probes by federal investigators and state securities 
regulators. The company has since moved to Phoenix and has met the federal 
requirements to sell its shares publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade 
Commission have both sued wireless operators, alleging that they have deceived 
investors. Indiana, one of the most active states, has halted sales by a dozen 
wireless entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet wireless is a viable industry, proponents say, and a legitimately 
profitable one. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country Wireless Systems in Riverside, for example, has 42,000 
subscribers in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. And the company says 
that, in areas where its service overlaps that of regular cable companies, the 
competition has prompted them to lower their prices by as much as $7 a month 
and provide better service. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts typically view wireless cable as a niche business that will 
supplement but not replace cable television as the predominant supplier of home 
entertainment. At the high end, industry observers estimate that wireless cable 
will attract as many as 20% of the potential customers in any given market. 
</P>
<P>
 "My estimate is 12%," one Wall Street analyst said Tuesday. "It's a real 
industry with real potential to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable businesses are much cheaper to set up than conventional cable 
companies, which have to lay miles of wires first, then install and maintain 
expensive equipment. Wireless cable can therefore undercut conventional prices 
by 15% to 30% for services such as HBO, MTV and CNN, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest drawback to this wireless system is that its antenna towers, which 
communicate to rooftop antennas, cannot reach into some canyons or obstructed 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology itself isn't new; it has been around for 20 years. Until the 
1992 Cable Act was enacted, however, the wireless industry was denied access to 
much programming. With that barrier removed, wireless companies could begin to 
solicit investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's potential has been limited, too, because the Federal 
Communications Commission allocated a spectrum of only 33 frequencies to 
wireless cable in any given market. But, with digital compression technology, 
wireless cable companies are predicting that they will be able to offer 150 
channels eventually if the demand is there. Cable Without Wires 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable, like its coaxial cousin, has the ability to offer subscribers 
a multiplicity of channels -- without the hard-wire intrusion. The system does 
have some disadvantages, though. Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Programming is beamed via satellite to a receive/transmit station. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Signal is converted for multichannel, multi-point distribution. Signal is 
transmitted via microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Signal, picked up by antenna and converter, travels to a decoder box atop 
television, where it is unscrambled for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 ADVANTAGES * Less downgrading of signal in transmission. * Less equipment to 
malfunction and increase costs. 
</P>
<P>
 DISADVANTAGES Microwaves travel in straight lines, so antenna must be placed 
in line of sight of transmitter. Limited programming. Thinking of Investing in 
Wireless Cable? 
</P>
<P>
 The Wireless Cable Assn. recommends that prospective investors seek 
professional investment advice or consult a lawyer before proceeding. Other 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of telephone solicitors. They may promise huge returns on small 
investments. Some are boiler-room operations raising money for a firm that does 
not yet, or may never, exist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read carefully. Ask for background materials, and ask questions about 
anything you don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you suspect fraud. Turn over the solicitor's name, company name, address 
and telephone number to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT TO ASK THE INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIVE 
</P>
<P>
 * How much of the investment will be spent on plants and equipment to operate 
the system, and how much will be spent for other purposes, such as commissions 
and other payments to the promoters of the investment opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the operator own or lease a minimum of 20 of the 32 FCC-approved 
channels needed for a viable operation? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does the operator have enough experience in subscription-TV management to 
make a success of the business? 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT TO ASK YOURSELF 
</P>
<P>
 * If the offering is for shares in a general partnership, limited liability 
corporation or other investment vehicle that is not registered with federal or 
state regulators and not subject to full disclosure laws, do you have 
sufficient knowledge about the business to make an informed decision?

 McDonnell Douglas Corp. would not comment Tuesday on a published report that 
it has won a $400-million order to launch 40 communications satellites for 
Iridium, a proposed mobile phone communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas and other rocket manufacturers across the United States and 
around the world are in hot competition for a limited number of commercial 
launch orders.Winning the Iridium contract would give a big boost to the 
company's Huntington Beach operations, where about 1,500 employees assemble 
Delta rockets. Another 200 employees work on the rockets at a site in Florida, 
and a handful more do final assembly of Delta rockets at a facility in Pueblo, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas and Motorola, the lead company in the Iridium consortium, 
will make a "major news announcement" during a news conference Thursday at 
Vandenburg Air Force Base, McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Anne McCauley said. 
During that session, Motorola will "provide significant details about our 
relationship with McDonnell Douglas," Motorola spokeswoman Stephanie Nowack 
said. Neither company would comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola previously announced that a handful of launches would be provided by 
rockets manufactured in Russia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.3-billion Iridium project would use 66 satellites to create a 
telecommunications system that would compete with conventional cable telephone 
lines and fiber-optic systems. About half a dozen competing space-based 
telecommunications systems have been proposed by different groups.

BRIEFCASE: SMALL BUSINESS; THE LITTLE-COMPANY BUSINESS DOING BETTER, SAYS 
BROKER NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Susan Christian Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to small companies, it's a seller's market, according to data 
compiled by a network of brokerages that specializes in buying and selling 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 VR Business Brokers, a nationwide network based in Newport Beach, found that 
the average prices of small businesses sold last year by its 57 brokerages was 
8% higher than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This indicates that businesses are doing better, because there is a direct 
relationship between sales price of a business and its profitability," said 
Donald B. Brown, president of Bay Shore Enterprises Inc., a Huntington 
Beach-based franchisee of VR Business Brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said his company can testify that Orange County business prices in 1993 
were similar to those nationwide. "There's not a lot of of regional variation 
in the figures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Food services -- doughnut shops, ice-cream shops and catering businesses -- 
fared well, selling 29% faster than the average business, the survey shows. 
Because of their recent popularity, espresso bars "are particularly hot," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Video store sales, however, slumped last year. "There has been an 
over-saturation of video stores," Brown said. "Also, big chains such as 
Blockbuster have really hurt the independents." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the more generous the financing terms offered by the seller, 
the easier the sale. Sellers who "took back" part of the loan had a much higher 
success rate than those who required all cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the selling of small businesses, there is very little bank financing 
available," Brown said. "It's a bit easier for someone buying an already 
established business rather than starting from scratch to find a lender. But 
lenders are still reluctant to give financing to a new owner, even if the prior 
owner has a proven track record."

SENSORMATIC CORP.'S TINY, ELECTRONIC SECURITY TAGS REAPING HUGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In security-conscious America, everything from newborn babies to health club 
towels and tubes of Preparation H hemorrhoid cream are sporting tiny magnetic 
security tags to prevent theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts expect most U.S. retailers, industrial plants and 
institutions to use tags or other kinds of electronic anti-theft devices during 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for companies such as industry leader Sensormatic Electronics 
Corp., whose revenue should top $1 billion by 1998, according to Chairman 
Ronald Assaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deerfield Beach, Fla.-based company supplies an array of anti-theft 
devices and technology, including closed-circuit television and the bulky white 
plastic "alligator tags" found on women's apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 But its hottest-selling device is a fingernail-sized disposable electronic tag 
that can be embedded in virtually any kind of product or packaging. The tag 
emits a loud sound when it passes by a magnetic security sensor at strategic 
locations, such as doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensormatic has already signed up several hundred hospitals, which attach the 
tags to newborn babies' diapers or wrist bracelets. Should anyone try to remove 
the infant from the maternity ward, an electronic tone is activated, 
automatically locking elevators and main doors on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nursing homes attach the tags to ankle bracelets of patients with 
Alzheimer's disease to prevent them from wandering, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny tags have also proven popular at health clubs, which lose thousands 
of towels to members each year, and at gambling casinos, where employees 
sometimes pocket $25 and $50 chips. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest immediate markets for the disposable tags are retailers, 
including clothing stores, discounters, record stores and drugstore chains.  
</P>
<P>
 They use the tags on selected merchandise and are now trying to persuade their 
vendors and manufacturers to install the small tags as part of the production 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are potentially so huge, it's hard to even estimate what size 
this market could become," Assaf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say Sensormatic's market share in security products already 
dwarfs its competitors, Checkpoint Systems, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing 
Co. (3M) and Knogo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But the battle to persuade manufacturers to buy the disposable tags and add 
them to goods at the plant may not be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 The major U.S. recording studios last year rejected Sensormatic's similar 
technology for cassette tapes and compact discs, saying the electronic tags 
degraded sound quality. Sensormatic denies the claim, and contends the music 
studios simply didn't want to alter their manufacturing plants to apply the 
tags. 
</P>
<P>
 Music retailers, meanwhile, are eager for the new security tags to cut down on 
shoplifting and employee theft, and are continuing to buy large numbers of them 
from Sensormatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugstores also lose huge amounts of merchandise each year, including 
batteries, cosmetics, camera film and other small items.

 The biggest trouble most senior citizens face with a personal computer is 
learning to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many retired before the machines became popular in companies, where most 
adults learn to use PCs.And some are daunted by the prospect of taking 
community college classes with students who are 40 or 50 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28,000 retirees living in this Phoenix suburb don't have to worry about 
that. Someone living here who buys a PC needs only to pick up the phone to get 
a team of golden gadgetheads dispatched from Computers West, the town's 
computer club.

 "I imagine some of us are working a good 40 hours a week," said Sam MacDonald, 
vice president of Computers West. "My wife and I have had to agree that on 
Friday I don't do any of this." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the club offers classes six days a week and lets people try out 
software from a library. A new activities center will contain a computer room 
for more than a dozen PCs, each with cable-line access to electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance given in Sun City West is an exception. Many cities have 
computer programs at recreation centers and community colleges, but few are 
geared to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Glendale Community College has developed an innovative drop-in center 
where people of all ages can learn to use computers at their own pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity for learning here is something like you've never seen," said 
Mark Montanus, who led development of the school's multimillion-dollar 
"computer pit." 
</P>
<P>
 SeniorNet, which started as an on-line community, has sprouted 60 senior 
citizens-only learning centers around the country. Six are in New York City and 
three are in San Francisco, but they are also in cities as small as 
Nacogdoches, Texas, and Smyrna, Tenn.

THEY'RE ENTERING THE COMPUTER AGE ONLY AFTER EXITING THE WORKPLACE; COMPUTERS: 
THOUSANDS OF SENIOR CITIZENS ARE PUTTING THEIR TIME AND DISPOSABLE INCOME INTO 
PCS, MAKING THEM "ONE OF THE BEST-KEPT SECRETS OF THE BUSINESS," AN INDUSTRY 
OBSERVER SAYS.

 Elizabeth Burton probably doesn't fit your image of a computer nut. 
</P>
<P>
 She's 68, a retired teacher, widowed. She bought a personal computer in 
January after watching a niece use one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone uses a computer and I know nothing about them, and it made me feel 
out of it and like an old lady," she said. "And I don't like feeling like an 
old lady." 
</P>
<P>
 The astonishing thing about old ladies and old men using computers is it is no 
longer astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a perception that they fear computers, thousands of senior citizens 
are buying them, subscribing to on-line services and filling community college 
classes and less formal settings to learn how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of the senior citizen market is "one of the most overlooked facts 
or one of the best-kept secrets of the business," said Rick Martin, director of 
consumer product marketing at Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 They use PCs to write newsletters and memoirs, trace genealogy, track 
investments, do research, schedule travel and communicate with relatives and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Merce Cunningham, the 75-year-old French dancer, choreographs works on his PC. 
Barbara Bush wrote two books on a PC. Her husband has learned to use one since 
leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a good, effective way to run your life," Bush said, responding to 
written questions. 
</P>
<P>
 SeniorNet, which started with an on-line service eight years ago, now sponsors 
computer learning centers in 60 cities. SeniorNet itself is available through 
America Online. The larger Prodigy and CompuServe services each report 200,000 
subscribers older than 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the opportunity is absolutely huge," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, 
director of PC research for International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. 
"These people are at a time in their lives when they can really benefit from a 
PC. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of time on their hands. They have disposable income. Some 
suffer from loneliness. This is a chance for them to get behind the wheel, 
reach out through technology." 
</P>
<P>
 One PC maker, Hyundai Electronics America, has made a direct effort to sell to 
senior citizens. It equipped a computer with personal finance, genealogy, home 
inventory and other software meant to appeal to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq's Martin said the company made fax modems a standard feature in its 
consumer models along with trial memberships to three on-line services, based 
on senior citizen demand. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior citizens are down the list of priorities of an industry trying to 
adjust to diverse demands of consumers while still keeping up with business 
customers' need for new products. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the problems of rapid growth. We haven't gotten to those 
secondary and tertiary opportunities," said Safi Qureshey, chief executive 
officer of PC maker AST Research Inc. in Irvine. "It is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, think senior citizens remain overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all of the images of who uses a computer have to do with youth," 
said Richard Adler, vice president of development for SeniorNet. "When they 
talk about the graying of Silicon Valley, they mean somebody has turned 35." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens do represent a smaller market when contrasted with other 
consumer categories, particularly parents of schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey in December by Inteco Corp., a research group, found about 15% of 
retirees were likely to buy a PC this year, the smallest segment of any age 
group. But, as with most adults, retirees were more interested in the machines 
than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying, Burton read magazines, visited stores and talked with 
relatives, especially that niece. Now she's one of several hundred seniors 
taking classes at Glendale Community College to learn DOS, 1-2-3 and 
WordPerfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have at least half a dozen friends who are waiting to see what I do with 
it," Burton said. "They would like to do it but some don't have the 
self-confidence. It does take some self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Sun City and Sun City West, Phoenix suburbs where homeowners must be 
at least 55, about 2,000 people belong to computer clubs. Many take classes 
hosted by the clubs to learn software or swap computer stories. 
</P>
<P>
 News is shared on electronic bulletin boards. Club members volunteer to run 
computers for the local library, art museum, food bank, hospital and even some 
nearby school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're back in the flow. You have congeniality. It's excellent," said Jack 
Fowler, president of the 1,300-member Computers West club in Sun City West. 
</P>
<P>
 So influential are clubs that Fowler and other Apple Macintosh owners in 
Computers West were invited last month to the introduction of Apple Computer's 
new generation of PC, the Power Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens typically spend more time than other adults studying their 
machines rather than experimenting with them. Burton said she wouldn't likely 
jump onto the Internet global communications network or tap into on-line 
services until she mastered some basic uses of her PC. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam MacDonald, vice president of Computers West, said, "I spent the first 
three months with my computer sitting down and reading pages and then going 
back and trying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such diligence pays off in calls to computer company help lines. Seniors 
usually call because the machine isn't working as the manual says rather than 
because they reprogrammed it, said Steve Smith, technical support director at 
Dell Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they call in, they have gone through everything we hope everybody goes 
through," he said. "They tend to know what they need to say to the technician 
so the whole process of running down and solving their problem is shortened 
immensely." 
</P>
<P>
 That intellectual challenge is another reason seniors are buying PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all go to exercise. That's very important at our age," Jack Fregeau, 77, 
said at a Computers West class. "This is a mental gym."

BECOMING PARDNERS -- WILD WEST STYLE; MARRIAGE: NUPTIALS WITH COWBOY KICK HAVE 
BECOME SO POPULAR ONE PLANNER CAN HARDLY KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.

 It was a shotgun wedding of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
 The shotgun was fired, and the bride and groom came riding over a hill on 
horseback. They wore the traditional wedding outfits -- plus cowboy hats and 
boots. The guests sat on hay bales. 
</P>
<P>
 Once hitched, the bride and groom left the ranch on a covered wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Not your typical wedding. But Cory and Jennifer Everett, who are both 26 and 
both grew up on ranches, didn't want it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on a ranch and stuff, you just kind of live everything the 
old-fashioned way," Cory Everett said. "That's what we do for a living and 
we're just trying to keep the West alive." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Linda Bonham, whose Bonham Western Wedding Service helped plan the 
Everetts' nuptials. Bonham said cowboy-style weddings have become so popular 
she can hardly keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimates she'll help plan at least 100 weddings from May through October, 
and offer advice over the phone for at least 100 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so nice about Western is it doesn't follow the traditional etiquette," 
Bonham said. "It's so laid-back, easygoing and essentially you do what you want 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes a Western wedding? As much as you want it to be Western or as 
little. You can take a traditional dress and put boots and hats with it and 
you've got the flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonham started her company after she tried to plan her own Western wedding two 
years ago but couldn't find anything she wanted -- not even a decent 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She found one with two little gophers with hats on," said her husband, Bill. 
"She brought me to town to look at these things and I said, 'No way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bonham, a fourth-generation rancher near Cheyenne, suggested his bride 
start her own business. 
</P>
<P>
 So in January, 1993, she mailed a catalogue that offered 18 invitation styles. 
She received enough responses to follow up with a survey asking women what else 
they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming answer: Dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody made dresses they wanted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonham did. She started designing simple denim, boot-cut wedding dresses with 
no trains to trip up a hoedowning bride. She also added miscellaneous wedding 
gear to her repertoire, like a $16.50 bridal garter with a tiny cowboy hat 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone started ringing off the hook," she said. Orders came from as far 
away as Europe, Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonham attributes part of her booming business to the popularity of country 
music and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 And to tradition. "A lot of people are trying to get back to their roots," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm country and Western at heart. All the values that real cowboys have is 
what I was looking for in a husband and I got one."

IRA STILL A GREAT TAX BREAK; IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TRY IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, many investors have ignored a terrific tax break by failing 
to fund their Individual Retirement Accounts. If you're among them, consider 
making a contribution to an IRA before the April 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors stopped putting money into their IRAs several years ago when 
Congress decided to limit the deductibility of some contributions. Before then, 
just about anyone who worked could throw $2,000 annually into an IRA and deduct 
the full amount from their taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, taxpayers with access to other retirement plans, such as 401(k) savings 
plans or Keogh accounts, often can't take that deduction. The amount they can 
deduct depends on their income. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a single taxpayer who is covered by a company-sponsored 
retirement plan and has an adjusted gross income of $35,000 or more cannot 
deduct any part of an IRA contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't let such limitations deter you. IRAs do allow you to shield 
investment earnings from income taxes. Thus, when you invest in a mutual fund 
through an IRA, you pay no taxes on the income or capital gains the fund 
generates until you withdraw the money from the account. Compounding 
tax-deferred returns can have a tremendous impact on your long-term investment 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Carlson, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, says that an investor who 
contributes $2,000 annually to an IRA over five years and invests the money in 
a mutual fund earning 7% annually will accumulate $12,306 in five years, 
compared to only $11,617 in a taxable account. 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years, the gap widens. You'll have $53,776 in the IRA and $45,469 in 
the taxable account. After 30 years, the IRA widens its lead to $202,146 versus 
$140,537. 
</P>
<P>
 Which funds should you choose for your IRA? In general, it makes sense for 
long-term investors to put money in stock funds. Although such funds tend to be 
more volatile, they deliver the highest returns over long periods. 
</P>
<P>
 An IRA is also a good place to park funds that generate high taxable returns 
over time. Those include income-oriented funds in your portfolio that generate 
regular taxable dividends and stock funds that generate high taxable gains 
because their managers do a lot of trading in their portfolios.

DEFIANT SERBS HARDEN STANCE; BOSNIA: REBELS LAY MINES TO TRAP U.N. TROOPS, 
APPARENTLY KIDNAP PEACEKEEPER AND INTERN 10 AID WORKERS. U.N. DOWNPLAYS MOVES, 
SEEKS TO RESTART TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels hardened their defiance of the outside world Tuesday, 
ordering troops to shoot down NATO warplanes, laying mines to trap U.N. 
peacekeepers and rebuffing high-level diplomats seeking to rescue abandoned 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government forces clashed with Serbs in the U.N. safe area of Gorazde, 
but the fighting was reported to be less intense than on the previous day, and 
the U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina blamed Muslim-led government units 
for starting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions escalated throughout Bosnia as the Serbs tightened their chokehold on 
this encircled capital. They also made clear through a coordinated series of 
retaliations for North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes that no 
foreigners are safe in Serb-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 They warned that the U.N. Protection Force is now considered an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dutch military observer in the Zepa safe area disappeared and was presumed 
kidnaped when he tried to cross into a Serb-held area. Rebels have also 
imprisoned 10 workers from a French relief agency at their garrison in the 
Serb-occupied Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, said the 
incidents were being raised with Bosnian Serb authorities "at the 
administrative level" but that he did not want the hostile actions to become an 
issue that would overshadow the broader aim of restarting negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather downplay the situation and leave things fairly calm. We are 
quite capable of existing at the moment, and this is not something I want to 
take up with them when we have more important things to discuss," Rose said of 
the blockade that has effectively made hostages of all U.N. troops, relief 
workers and foreign journalists in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo's 380,000 residents were already prisoners of the 2-year-old Serbian 
siege that has maintained armed checkpoints at all points of entry. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior relief official criticized as dangerous the U.N. commander's 
posture of ignoring the blockade. "Rose and his people are misleading everyone. 
They may even be misleading themselves," said the official, who has spent much 
of the war in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton warned both sides in the Gorazde fighting against 
improperly interpreting the NATO intervention; he insisted that the Western 
alliance simply is acting to prod the warring parties to return to peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Russian lawmakers and other officials renewed their objections to the NATO 
action, saying it now imperils Russia's prospective links with the Western 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon disclosed that most of the bombs released over Gorazde on 
Monday were duds. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Belgrade government, accusing them of unfair reporting, said it will bar 
the Cable News Network and the French news agency Agence France-Presse from 
reporting in Yugoslavia. The government said it will probably take similar 
action against other foreign media. CNN said it had not received official 
notice of the action. But it defended the fairness and objectivity of its 
reporting. It was unclear what, if any, effect the government statement would 
have on the news organizations' reporting from the rump Yugoslavia, which now 
includes Serbia and Montenegro. Fear, Defiance 
</P>
<P>
 The defiance of Bosnian Serb leaders in their mountain stronghold of Pale, 10 
miles to the east, was interpreted by some U.N. and diplomatic sources here as 
bluster and by others as evidence of fierce resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in this now, and the only question is whether we're going to know how 
to follow through, because the Serbs will keep probing and probing to see where 
the limits are," one Western diplomatic source warned. He said he feared the 
incidents suggested that the rebel leadership is in the hands of military 
hard-liners who will continue to test the international community's commitment 
to halting their deadly land-grab and "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, ordered his troops to 
fire on any NATO planes they consider a threat, Serbian radio in Pale reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A Serbian journalist contacted by telephone in Pale described the rebel 
leadership as confident. He said Mladic and political leader Radovan Karadzic 
had played a game of chess after visiting a front-line emplacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Rob Annink, a U.N. Protection Force spokesman, described most 
U.N.-patrolled areas of Bosnia as tense, including Sarajevo. It was the first 
time the atmosphere in the capital has deteriorated since a Feb. 21 NATO 
ultimatum that forced Serbs to surrender or pull back the heavy artillery used 
to batter the city to ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Top U.N. civilian and military officials, as well as U.S. special envoy 
Charles Redman, had planned to travel to Pale to meet with Karadzic and Mladic 
to discuss the situation but were told by telephone they were unwelcome, U.N. 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander for all 32,000 U.N. troops in the Balkans, French Gen. Bertrand 
de Lapresle, and the special representative of U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, flew back to mission headquarters in 
the Croatian capital of Zagreb after the rebuff. 
</P>
<P>
 They left by U.N. helicopter, the only aircraft to risk landing at the 
Sarajevo airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. humanitarian airlift of food and other supplies to the capital has 
been suspended indefinitely for security reasons. Mines, Shells 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs laid mines to hamper movement of U.N. troops at the depots where the 
Serbs' surrendered tanks and guns are stored, Annink said. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the 50-man U.N. military observer mission for eastern Bosnia, 
Canadian Maj. Roy Thomas, said about 40 of his men in Serb-held areas were 
under house arrest by the nationalist rebels and that one Dutch officer had 
been missing since crossing through a Serbian checkpoint outside Zepa early 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 French Cmdr. Eric Chaperon, another U.N. spokesman, said Tuesday that Gorazde 
was considerably calmer than the previous day, when Serbs pressed in, despite 
the first NATO air strikes Sunday, to take vast new stretches of government 
territory along the Drina River in the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose had accused the government forces earlier Tuesday of disrupting the 
morning calm by firing on Serbs who had moved to within two miles of the city 
center and conquered several densely populated suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaperon said later that shooting and shelling had come from both sides. "Both 
of the warring parties were firing at a small hill, which is southeast of the 
city," Chaperon said, confirming that the government shooting was directed at 
rebel forces that had already invaded the enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was no major change in control of territory around Gorazde. 
About 15% of the U.N. safe area has been occupied by the Serbian nationalists 
over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose and Lapresle told journalists that the resort to NATO air power was made 
because U.N. troops were endangered by the Serbian offensive against Gorazde. 
Eight U.N. liaison officers and five military observers have been deployed to 
the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my troops get put in a position where they get directly attacked and the 
only response to preserve life is to use close air support, then it is I that 
decides that's what we should do," Rose said, explaining the sequence of events 
that led to his calling in air strikes. "There's no question of it being a 
political act." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the bombings that destroyed two Serbian artillery positions as 
"very measured, very controlled, the use of minimum force to preserve the life 
of my soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Lapresle said force had been used "with great restraint and after many 
warnings."

I-10 DRIVERS CELEBRATE REOPENING OF FREEWAY; TRANSIT: FIRST-DAY VOLUME IS DOWN 
15%. CAR-POOL LANE IS ERASED, MAKING THE RUSH-HOUR COMMUTE SLOWER FOR SOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For perhaps the first time ever, motorists Tuesday celebrated rush hour on the 
Santa Monica Freeway, which reopened 84 days after the Northridge earthquake 
with drivers tooting horns and shouting gleefully as they zipped over the 
recently poured concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, one of five shattered by the quake, opened 2 1/2 months early at 
a cost of $29.4 million, the result of crews working around the clock, seven 
days a week, in rain and on holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rubber is meeting the road today," proclaimed Vice President Al Gore 
during formal opening ceremonies alongside the freeway as cars whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 For Westside motorists, who had been forced to navigate a system of 
surface-street detours, the freeway was not only back, but better. It carried 
about 15% fewer cars than its normal pre-quake volume. That meant that some 
frustrated drivers were sticking to alternative routes they carefully crafted 
after the quake, said Caltrans officials, who do not expect the trend to last. 
</P>
<P>
 The only people moving more slowly were car-poolers, who had enjoyed speedy 
rides on some sections of the freeway that had been reserved for cars with two 
or more riders in the wake of the quake. With the completion of the freeway, 
the temporary car-pool lanes were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We not only have L.A. moving again but in the fast lane," a beaming Gov. Pete 
Wilson told the small crowd near the Fairfax Avenue off-ramp. "You've proved 
what I always believed: They can shake us but they can't break us." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, Caltrans officials initially predicted that 
the Santa Monica and four other damaged freeways would be restored in 12 to 18 
months. Then, to the disbelief of many commuters, they trimmed the estimate to 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson is very simple," Wilson said. "If there's united support for the 
project, the project gets done." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Santa Monica was made more urgent by politics: President 
Clinton, who will need California's goodwill if he runs for another term, 
accelerated the flow of federal dollars, which paid for the entire project. And 
Wilson, running behind in the polls for reelection this year, made every effort 
to cut red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, by offering contractor Clinton Myers a $200,000-per-day incentive 
for every day he finished ahead of the June 24 deadline, Caltrans officials 
launched one of the great construction races of all times. The bonus was 
calculated after state officials estimated that the downed freeway was costing 
the region $1 million a day in delayed deliveries and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction of two downed portions of the freeway at La Cienega Boulevard 
and Fairfax Avenue was completed in a scorching 66 days, earning Myers a bonus 
of almost $15 million, an amount that will be partially consumed by overtime 
and other costs of the accelerated construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At the project's peak, about 400 ironworkers, carpenters, finishers and 
laborers scrambled atop the scaffolding and wood framing that would become the 
Santa Monica Freeway bridges. They worked day and night, seven days a week on 
shifts that lasted 12 hours or longer. For some it meant not seeing their 
spouses and children. For others it meant moving to temporary quarters, 
sometimes a trailer plunked right in the middle of the construction site. "At 
night, you lay down in bed, you just collapse and wake up the next morning," 
said Dan Sparks, 30, an engineer from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Denicia Mitchell, a pile driver, did not see her 7- and 8-year-old daughters 
for weeks on end while she worked on the freeway. But she looked forward to 
bringing them to see what she had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at a bridge and you say, 'I was there, I helped do that,' " Mitchell 
said. "I'll be in a car and drive by and say, 'I built that column.' It's an 
overwhelming feeling to say, 'That seam, I lined it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 With the freeway opening, the workers' pride was perhaps only matched by 
commuters' exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, in time to be aired on 11 p.m. television news programs, Wilson, 
Mayor Richard Riordan, and federal Transportation Secretary Federico Pena held 
an impromptu news conference, preparing to wave the cars onto the freeway. 
Shoulder to shoulder, the dignitaries lined up across the eastbound lanes, each 
standing by a bright orange traffic cone. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther west, Marco Ruano, a Caltrans senior construction engineer, blocked 
eager motorists from spilling onto the freeway until he had received a signal 
that all was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like running with the bulls in Pamplona," Ruano said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cones were removed, the motorists surged forward, spinning up clouds of 
dust, honking and yelling. Television cameras lined the road and helicopters 
hovered overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought that this community would get so excited over one freeway," 
said Caltrans District Director Jerry Baxter. "We cuss these freeways, 
everybody does, but you take one away and we all feel a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter and other experts believe that commuters will readily relinquish their 
carefully culled alternative routes and return to the Santa Monica, dubbed the 
world's busiest freeway and one that Angelenos either love or hate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people will go back to what used to be," said Genevieve Giuliano, 
associate professor of urban and regional planning at USC.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some motorists expressed dismay that the restored freeway returned so 
quickly to its clogged state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was distressing to find it was like it used to be, a lot of single drivers 
in cars," said Joe Lee, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Soloff, another attorney, was crestfallen for another reason. He had 
been enjoying the car-pool lanes that were installed shortly after the 
earthquake in an effort to keep traffic moving. His post-construction commute 
was longer, not shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was among the minority of commuters who benefited from the way it was -- I 
car-pooled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To the disappointment of Pena -- a proponent of car-pool lanes -- and other 
federal officials, Caltrans officials stripped the lanes from the Santa Monica 
-- an action that might imperil their return. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool lanes never quite caught on on the Santa Monica, where they had 
been tried 17 years ago with dismal results. On a typical, post-quake day, 
about 1,250 vehicles an hour drove the 4.5-mile car-pool lane on the Santa 
Monica. By comparison, on other Southland freeways, a successful car-pool lane 
-- which is much longer in distance -- usually draws more than 1,800 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' Baxter said the agency will continue to study the prospect of 
installing car-pool lanes and if enough community interest is expressed, 
officials would hold hearings. But Baxter said he is reluctant to set up a 
car-pool lane when it would mean commandeering a lane, depriving mixed-flow 
traffic of one lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is also considering building a double-deck, similar to the one 
under construction on the Harbor Freeway, in which the top deck would be 
reserved for car pools. That type of structure would cost about $50 million per 
mile, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank E. Kruesi, federal assistant transportation secretary for policy, said 
elevated car-pool lanes "are extraordinarily expensive. There's obviously a 
limit to what anybody can pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials face additional hurdles if they want to pursue a 
car-pool lane now that the freeway has been reopened, Kruesi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's a different situation after the Santa Monica reopened last 
night to go in there and say, 'OK, now we've got traffic flowing, let's talk 
about a (car-pool) lane.' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Santa Monica project completed, Caltrans awaits the finish of the 
quake-damaged freeways in the San Fernando Valley. Those projects, including 
the Antelope Valley, Golden State and Simi Valley freeways are expected to be 
done on time, from mid-May to mid-July, but probably not early. 
</P>
<P>
 "One down and four more to go," Baxter said.

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY BRIDGES TO BE RE-EXAMINED; ROADS: CALTRANS WILL SEE IF ANY 
NEED REINFORCEMENT. GOAL IS TO PREVENT QUAKE DAMAGE THAT COULD CLOSE ROUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway, which reopened this week, will 
be studied to determine whether they can withstand a major quake without damage 
that would put them out of service, Caltrans officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the importance of the freeway, Caltrans officials said they want to 
see how many of its bridges needed additional reinforcement to prevent the type 
of earthquake damage that could force closure of the freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they did not believe that any of the bridges would collapse in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the level of reinforcement in the Santa Monica bridges were 
raised during an engineering review of designs for the bridges constructed at 
La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue to replace structures that collapsed in 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Bridge Engineer James E. Roberts said he has not determined how many of 
the bridges along the Santa Monica will be reviewed but that the examination 
probably will focus on those that carry freeway traffic and not over-crossings 
and under-crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the quake, Caltrans was planning to retrofit about 65 of the 
283 bridges on Interstate 10 in Los Angeles County, including the two that 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they will reevaluate the retrofitting plans for these bridges 
to determine whether they need to be upgraded. They also are expected to study 
some of the bridges retrofitted after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and 
others for which there were no plans for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to re-evaluate the bridges came after a panel of seismic experts 
said it had concerns about the seismic rating given the two replacement 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, working with local officials, had decided not to rate the two new 
bridges as "important," a designation that requires extra reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges rated as "important" are designed so they can ride out an earthquake 
without any damage that would cause them to be closed. A bridge that does not 
have that rating can sustain earthquake damage requiring temporary closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the "important" rating was created at the 
request of a board of inquiry impaneled after the Loma Prieta earthquake to 
examine the agency's seismic retrofitting program for bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel proposed that the highest level of reinforcement should be reserved 
for those bridges that carry emergency traffic or for which there was no 
alternative route if they were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much can you tolerate having a particular structure or route out of 
service? That's really what gets to the crux of what we call the importance 
factor," Drago said. "Obviously there are certain structures like the Bay 
Bridge in San Francisco that you can't afford to go out of service because 
they're not easily detoured." 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said he did not know how many bridges on the Santa Monica carry the 
"important" rating. The Times reported Monday that the two newly constructed 
bridges were not given that designation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, Drago said, is that traffic on these two bridges is easily 
detoured to side streets and back onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel of engineering experts asked the agency to reconsider the 
designation, noting that a freeway that carries 341,000 vehicles a day should 
not be subject to closure. Bolstering the recommendation was an economic study 
by Gov. Pete Wilson's office showing that the closure of the two collapsed 
bridges had cost the Los Angeles-area economy $1 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said Caltrans agreed with the recommendation and said he would not 
only change the designation for the new bridges but also would conduct a review 
to determine if any other major bridges on the freeway had not been retrofitted 
or designed to meet the "important" standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to go back and re-look at structures on that freeway and 
decide that they are 'important,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the newly opened bridges, the change in the designation has meant that 
Caltrans will have to go back in the next few weeks and strengthen them at the 
abutments -- the concrete sections connecting the bridges to the land -- to 
prevent damage in a major earthquake. Officials say that the work, estimated to 
cost less than $300,000, would not require closure of the freeway but would 
involve noisy pile driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of experts has said that seismic weaknesses in the abutments could 
permit earthquake damage that would put them temporarily out of service. 
Caltrans said the problem can be remedied with installation of eight pilings 
four feet in diameter that will be tied to the abutments. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said if other major bridges on the Santa Monica are found to have 
similar weaknesses, they will probably be reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a frequent 
critic of Caltrans, praised the decision, saying he could never understand why 
bridges on the world's busiest freeway had not been given the highest seismic 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Santa Monica is as critical as the governor says it is, and I believe 
it is, how can you have some bridges built to no-collapse and no-damage 
standards and not others?" he asked. "It seems to me the whole freeway needs to 
be built to the same standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the freeway would be the subject a special hearing of his committee 
that he expects to call to examine the procedures Caltrans used in rebuilding 
the two bridges. Of prime concern, he said, will be the $14.5-million bonus 
paid to the contractor for completing his work 74 days early. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome the hearing," Drago said. "We believe the process we utilized can 
withstand the tightest scrutiny. We've reopened the busiest freeway in the U.S. 
in record time and it's a safe structure."

ANAHEIM PROSTITUTION RING BROKEN, POLICE SAY; VICE: WOMAN, 18, IS ACCUSED OF 
RUNNING OPERATION IN HOTEL. SIX OF 10 OTHERS ARRESTED IN RAID PLEAD GUILTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice investigators have broken up a prostitution ring based in a hotel and run 
by an 18-year-old woman who is accused of pimping for women and girls recruited 
in Mexico, some as young as 14, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrested 11 people, including four juveniles and seven women, 
Thursday after a citizen alerted police to possible prostitution at the Granada 
Inn, a comfortable hotel at 2375 W. Lincoln Ave. The arrests were not announced 
until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the ring was managed by Cera Rauda Sanchez, 18. It was 
not known Tuesday if Rauda is also from Mexico or how the women were brought to 
Orange County from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Matt Anderson said Rauda pleaded not guilty Monday to 20 
felony counts of pimping and pandering, and will face a preliminary hearing 
April 22 in Municipal Court in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Six women who police said worked as prostitutes for Rauda pleaded guilty 
Monday to misdemeanor counts of living in a house of prostitution, Anderson 
said. Each defendant was sentenced to 10 days in jail and placed on three 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile defendants remain in custody, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. R. Sutter said the ring had been operating since December and 
advertised in Asian- and Spanish-language newspapers. Sutter said the ads 
promised "a good time at the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, residents at the hotel, where rooms are rented daily or by the 
week, said they had no knowledge of any prostitution but said there had been a 
steady stream of men visiting the hotel in recent weeks. The hotel is next to a 
quiet neighborhood of older houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rica Zounatiotias, manager of the adjacent Zonos restaurant, said she noticed 
that groups of men could often be seen walking into the hotel. "A few minutes 
later they would walk out and drive away," she said. "But I had no idea of what 
was going on inside the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Although police said they found six customers in the rooms when officers made 
the arrests, a spokesman said there was not sufficient evidence to charge them 
with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report said Rauda kept the women and juveniles in 10 first-floor 
rooms of the hotel and ran the operation out of Room 125, which was vacant 
Tuesday. The room is next to a side door that exits to Gilbert Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, there were still some male customers who had not heard of the 
arrests. On Tuesday afternoon, a young Asian man knocked softly on the door of 
Room 125. When asked whom he was looking for, the man pulled out a pager and 
said that two friends had paged him and directed him to meet them at the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We meet girls here," he said sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel is owned by Sugandh Inc., according to property tax records. The 
company's president, Ravji Patel, a Torrance resident, could not reached for 
comment late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby, a sign by the front desk warned guests: "Rules, Rules. No 
parties. No visitors after 10:30 p.m." Another sign said the hotel supported 
the California Narcotics Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Sutter said the women were recruited from the Mexican interior to work as 
prostitutes for three months. At the end of three months, they would be paid 
between $2,000 and $3,000, Sutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exploitation level is just astounding," he said. "(The ring) makes $3,000 
in one day. They can pay all the girls in 10 days and the rest of it is just 
profit. (The ringleaders) are scum, low-lives." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the hotel owner and manager knew of the alleged 
prostitution activity in the rooms, police said. Rooms that police said were 
used by the ring are down a hall from the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said most of the women knew they were engaging in illegal 
activity, but the financial lure was too strong to turn down. Police reported 
finding a letter written by one of the women to family members back home that 
had not been mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not proud of what I'm doing but it (money) will make a better life for 
us," the woman wrote, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutter said the women were kept at the hotel and rarely ventured out because 
they did not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sutter, the women charged $50 for sex and worked from 11 a.m. to 
2 a.m. He said each room had "a case, not a box, but a case of condoms." 
</P>
<P>
 Police broke up the alleged ring Thursday when an undercover vice officer went 
to the motel, where he was allegedly shown photographs of several women. After 
paying $50 and selecting one of the pictures, the investigator was taken to 
another room where a 17-year-old offered to have sex with him, police said. 
Police then arrested the 18-year-old madam and the girl, and rounded up the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Los Angeles said 
Tuesday that agents will be in Anaheim today to interview the defendants and 
determine if they are in the United States illegally.

PAPER IN AKRON GETS PULITZER FOR STORIES ON RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal won the Pulitzer Prize for public service 
Tuesday for a yearlong examination of race relations and a subsequent campaign 
that enlisted more than 100 local groups in an effort to improve those 
relations in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times won three Pulitzers, two of which were awarded to staff 
members. The paper was honored for its spot news reporting on the World Trade 
Center bombing and for Isabel Wilkerson's feature writing -- a profile of a 
fourth-grader on Chicago's volatile South Side and stories on last year's 
floods in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper's third Pulitzer came in feature photography, for South African 
free-lancer Kevin Carter's photo of a starving Sudanese girl who collapsed on 
her way to a feeding center while a vulture waited nearby. The photo was first 
published in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune won two Pulitzers, for explanatory journalism -- Ronald 
Kotulak's "lucid coverage of current developments in neurological science" -- 
and for editorial writing -- R. Bruce Dold's editorials on the child welfare 
system in Illinois, specifically the events leading to the murder of a 
3-year-old boy by his abusive mother. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arts categories, the most notable victory was probably that of Edward 
Albee, in drama, for his play "Three Tall Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Albee, who had previously won Pulitzers for "A Delicate Balance" in 1967 and 
for "Seascape" in 1975, has been in artistic and commercial eclipse for almost 
20 years. But "Three Tall Women" opened Tuesday night in an off-Broadway 
theater after a successful run in a smaller, off-off-Broadway theater, and his 
Pulitzer triumph means that only Eugene O'Neill has won more Pulitzers for 
drama. O'Neill won four -- in 1920, 1922, 1928 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 The other arts winners, all announced Tuesday at Columbia University, 
included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gunther Schuller, in music, for "Of Reminiscences and Reflections." 
</P>
<P>
 * E. Annie Proulx, in fiction, for "The Shipping News" -- which, 
appropriately, has a journalist as protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Remnick, in general nonfiction, for "Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of 
the Soviet Empire." 
</P>
<P>
 * David Levering Lewis, in biography, for "W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a 
Race." 
</P>
<P>
 * Yusef Komunyakaa, in poetry, for "Neon Vernacular." Komunyakaa has Southern 
California connections, having gained his Masters of Fine Arts degree from the 
writing program at UC Irvine and having won the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award 
presented last week at the Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pulitzer Prize Board, which makes the final selections based on 
nominations by individual juries in each journalism and letters/drama category, 
decided to give no award this year in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The three history finalists were "Crime and Punishment in American History" by 
Lawrence M. Friedman, "Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of 
JFK" by Gerald Posner, and "William Faulkner and Southern History" by Joel 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which previously gave no history award in 1919 and 1984, thought 
each of this year's finalists was "flawed in certain ways," said board member 
John L. Dotson Jr., president and publisher of the Akron Beacon Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 David Kennedy, a member of the history jury and a history professor at 
Stanford University, said it was difficult not to regard the board's decision 
as "a slap in the face of the judgment of the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he was on the history jury in 1984, when the jury itself decided 
no nominee was worthy of a Pulitzer. But for a jury of respected scholars to 
select three prize-worthy books and then have their judgment overruled is 
"pretty egregious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has that absolute right, however, and invokes it frequently -- 
overruling juries by shifting nominees from one category to another or giving 
the prize to someone not a finalist or bypassing all jury nominees and giving 
no award on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for example, the prizewinning feature photograph was originally 
entered as a feature photograph, nominated as a finalist by the jury in the 
spot news category and then switched back to the feature photo category by the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service award is the most coveted journalism prize every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Allen, editor of the Akron Beacon Journal, said his paper's triumph in 
that category actually began in the immediate aftermath of the 1992 riots in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That violence "prompted a group of editors here to get together and decide the 
paper should examine race relations in Akron by getting beyond what you usually 
hear about housing, jobs, education, crime and the criminal justice system," 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing effort -- which involved 29 members of the paper's 161-member 
staff -- relied on traditional reporting as well as on focus groups and 
computerized analyses of housing patterns, ownership and discriminatory 
redlining practices by local financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters and editors shaped these findings into five separate series that ran 
four or five days each, published throughout 1993, under the title "A Question 
of Color." But editors thought that the Beacon Journal, as an institution, "had 
to do more than just report this stuff," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 After prolonged deliberation, the paper hired outside consultants and had them 
work with 140 social, civic and religious organizations in an effort to bring 
about better race relations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hired the consultants so we could continue the integrity of the editorial 
process," Allen said. "We reported on what they did that was newsworthy, but we 
didn't want to be directly involved in it editorially." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper published a model New Year's Resolution, urging readers to pledge: 
"My New Year's resolution is to do everything I can in 1994 to help improve 
race relations." More than 22,000 signed resolutions were returned to the 
Beacon Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pulitzer Prize for public service is always awarded to a 
newspaper staff, rather than to an individual, the board generally prefers to 
give most other awards to individuals. This year, however, several major team 
reporting projects won prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the New York Times' prize for what the board termed 
"comprehensive coverage" of the World Trade Center bombing by a team of more 
than 75 staff members, the board honored the staffs of the Providence (R.I.) 
Journal-Bulletin and the Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence won in investigative reporting for its disclosure of pervasive 
corruption in the Rhode Island court system. Dallas won in international 
reporting for a 14-part series examining violence against women in many 
nations. Eleven reporters from five departments at the paper traveled to more 
than a dozen countries to work on the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Landers, international editor of the Morning News, said Tuesday that one 
of those reporters, Toni Y. Joseph, was so determined to be part of the team 
going abroad that she withheld from her editors information on her heart 
condition. She collapsed and died of a heart attack not long after the series 
was published. 
</P>
<P>
 Morning News staffers toasted her with champagne during Pulitzer celebrations 
in the paper's newsroom Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne toasts were the order of the day in several other newsrooms across 
the country. Sometimes -- as in Albuquerque and Akron -- it was nonalcoholic 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Albuquerque Tribune, Eileen Welsome won the national reporting prize 
for her stories on five Americans who had unknowingly been injected with 
plutonium during government radiation experiments in the 1940s.

 Welsome was investigating radiation experiments on animals in 1987 when she 
came across a footnote mentioning the experimental injections into human 
beings. She worked on the story on and off for several years, then began to 
look into it virtually full time in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After Welsome's disclosures were picked up and advanced by other news 
organizations, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary called on the federal government 
to investigate various radiation experiments, determine their medical and 
ethical propriety and, later, to compensate victims of the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Welsome, in New York to accept another award for her work Tuesday, was on the 
telephone with her editors in Albuquerque waiting for the Pulitzer 
announcement. But the Tribune's computers were not working properly. The 
editors only found out Welsome had won when, simultaneously, a reporter heard 
it over the telephone from a friend at the Orange County Register and a staffer 
from the Associated Press office down the hall came running in with a news 
bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Pulitzer winners Tuesday included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Freedman and Jim Mitzelfeld of the Detroit News, in beat reporting, for 
stories disclosing flagrant spending abuses in Michigan's House Fiscal Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * William Raspberry of the Washington Post, in commentary, for what the board 
termed "compelling commentaries on a variety of social and political topics." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lloyd Schwartz of the Boston Phoenix, in criticism, for his "skillful and 
resonant classical music criticism." The Phoenix is an alternative weekly, the 
first such paper honored by the Pulitzers since Jules Feiffer won for editorial 
cartooning in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Ramirez of the Memphis Commercial Appeal, in editorial cartooning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Watson of the Toronto Star, in spot news photography, for his picture 
of a U.S. soldier's body being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by a 
mob of jeering Somalis. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson originally took six other photos of the soldier, all showing his 
exposed genitals, but -- certain that no paper would use them -- he ordered his 
driver to catch up with the mob so he could take more pictures. After arguing 
with his armed Somali bodyguards, he was able to take six more photos, partial 
body shots, while the hostile crowd threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press transmitted the pictures, and when newspapers in the 
United States published one of them, it helped fuel demands that the United 
States withdraw its troops from Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the Pulitzers carries a $3,000 cash award except for the public 
service prize, which consists of a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the prizes began in 1917, the New York Times has won 69 Pulitzers, far 
more than any other newspaper. This is the second time the New York Times has 
won three Pulitzers in a single year. The first time was in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times, which has won 19 Pulitzers -- eight of them in the past 
10 years -- won none Tuesday. But the paper did have four finalists, more than 
any other paper except the New York Times, which had six. The Los Angeles 
Times' finalists were: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Times staff, in spot news reporting, for its "richly detailed coverage 
of the first day of the fires that ravaged Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 * Carol J. Williams, in international reporting, for her coverage of the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peter H. King, in commentary, for his columns on California. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Times staff, in spot news photography, for pictures of last year's 
fires.

MITCHELL PULLS OUT OF RUNNING FOR HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell withdrew as a candidate for the 
Supreme Court on Tuesday in a stunning announcement that focused White House 
attention on racial minority candidates to replace retiring Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell (D-Me.) said he had come to believe that nomination would distract 
him from efforts to champion President Clinton's health care plan and other 
initiatives in Congress before his scheduled retirement from office next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointment to the court would have been "a major complicating factor," said 
Mitchell, who had been Clinton's leading candidate. He added that "it's tough 
enough to get anything done here." 
</P>
<P>
 The new White House emphasis on finding a minority candidate is likely to 
propel additional names into the mix of prospects, possibly extending the 
search to the end of this month or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diversity is something I think the President will take a very careful look 
at," said one senior White House official. "It's not to the exclusion of other 
qualifications, of course, and it will not be the only thing, but diversity is 
important to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Several minority candidates were on a short list of potential appointees that 
Clinton's advisers discussed with him Monday. These included U.S. District 
Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut, who would be the first Latino nominee, 
and U.S. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III and federal appeals court Judge 
Amalya Kearse of New York, both of whom are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Days would face some controversy because of stands he has taken as solicitor 
general -- the government's top advocate before the high court -- particularly 
a position he took giving a narrow reading of a federal anti-pornography law. 
</P>
<P>
 But that position "can be fully explained and defended," the senior official 
said. "It would not be a deterring factor." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the official added, the President may want to go beyond the existing 
list and "have a little broader group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, some Latino advisers to the Administration, as well as some 
liberal groups, have suggested that the President consider other potential 
Latino candidates beyond Cabranes. Among the names that have been suggested are 
Vilma Martinez, a prominent Los Angeles attorney and former president of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and Secretary of 
Transportation Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Martinez, who was born in San Antonio, has support among 
activists in Texas and California. In addition to her work with MALDEF, she has 
chaired the Board of Regents of the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a judge, Cabranes' record has been moderately conservative on some issues 
and the fact that he was considered for the court by the Bush Administration 
troubles some liberal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Discomfort on the part of liberals could actually be a plus in the eyes of 
Clinton, who has tried periodically to distance himself from the party's 
traditional liberal constituencies. A more serious problem, however, could be 
coolness toward Cabranes on the part of Latino organizations dominated by 
Mexican Americans or those with ties to Central America. Supporters of his 
nomination attribute this coolness in part to his Puerto Rican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 A different kind of diversity -- geographical -- has been fueling a 
behind-the-scenes campaign on behalf of federal appeals court Judge Richard S. 
Arnold of Little Rock, Ark. The legal profession holds Arnold, a 15-year 
veteran of the bench, in high regard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Arnold's supporters argue that Blackmun's departure leaves the 
court with no member from the section of the country between the Mississippi 
River and the Rocky Mountains. Such geographic considerations traditionally 
have been considered by presidents. But even Arnold's supporters concede that 
in the current political environment, Clinton would encounter difficulties in 
appointing a justice from his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arkansas has become a stigma," said one leading Arnold supporter. "That's 
where the political problem lies and that's a lot of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In public comments Tuesday, Clinton acknowledged that Mitchell had been his 
leading candidate and said that Mitchell's role in the Senate on behalf of his 
domestic agenda is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to leaders of nonprofit groups, Clinton quoted Mitchell as telling 
him: " 'I'm only sure of one thing -- I cannot imagine that the impact would be 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he wanted to thank Mitchell "on behalf of the country, for 
forgoing a great personal opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's possible selection had drawn some criticism because of a 
constitutional clause that bars lawmakers from taking a federal job after 
voting to raise the job's salary. At his press conference, Mitchell said that 
this so-called "emoluments clause" was "not a factor" in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said that Clinton and Mitchell 
had discussed this possible snag, along with other potential complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said that he would consider any later offer of a Supreme Court job. 
He was even more positive on another job for which he has been frequently 
mentioned -- baseball commissioner. "I believe I would enjoy serving as 
commissioner of baseball, if that opportunity arises," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell first talked to Clinton about the appointment in a meeting at 6 p.m. 
Monday at the White House residence. Mitchell told him of his concerns and 
showed him a copy of a statement he had drafted announcing his withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men agreed to reflect on the decision overnight. But when Clinton 
called Mitchell about 8:15 Tuesday morning, both agreed on the risks an 
appointment would pose to the legislative program and Clinton "reluctantly 
agreed" with Mitchell's decision, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the two men did not discuss whether Mitchell could be chosen for 
a later Supreme Court opening. But White House officials said that possibility 
remains open. 
</P>
<P>
 Several senators said they agreed with Mitchell's conclusions that the 
nomination could have proved a serious obstacle to his efforts to get a health 
reform bill through the chamber by the beginning of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate is really much better off," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). 
"We'll have his leadership for the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Michael Ross, Karen Tumulty and Ronald J. Ostrow

COLUMN ONE; A DUEL OVER PRAYER IN SCHOOLS; COURT RULING BACKING 
STUDENT-INITIATED PRAYER IN TEXAS HAS LED OTHER STATES TO ACT. IT'S ALSO LED TO 
A HEATED DEBATE OVER FREE SPEECH AND THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's springtime, when a high school senior's thoughts turn to the prom, summer 
vacation and the collegiate adventure just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this town -- and an increasing number like it across Texas -- many 
students are taking on weightier matters and find themselves at Ground Zero in 
a growing controversy over prayer in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 When three seniors at a public high school here proposed that a prayer be read 
at their graduation ceremony last year, their idea was put to a vote. Their 
fellow students agreed with them, and prayer -- which for decades has been 
disappearing from the public schools -- became part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 All across Texas, student-initiated prayer has spread like a prairie fire 
since a federal appeals court, breaking with 30 years of judicial precedent, 
ruled last year that, while the Constitution bars school officials from 
initiating prayers, it does not stop students. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Supreme Court refused without explanation to review the appeals 
court's decision, Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice took the 
movement nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month it initiated what it called a "nationwide campaign to educate 
students about their constitutional right to pray and to speak about God." In 
mailings to 35,000 school officials, the group asserted that students have a 
"free speech" right to have prayer at school events. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union is waging a vigorous counter-campaign. 
School officials are caught in the cross-fire as the ACLU and Robertson's group 
mail dueling videotapes to every school system in the country, the ACLU's 
stressing the traditional separation of church and state and Robertson's 
highlighting America's religious heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers in at least nine states are following Texas' lead. The legislatures 
in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Virginia have passed measures 
authorizing student-initiated prayer at school events, and similar bills are 
pending in Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate also debated long into the night last month over an amendment 
sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to shield "constitutionally protected 
prayer" in the schools. In the end, the Senate and House agreed only on a 
watered-down provision that would bar schools from using federal funds to stop 
"voluntary prayer" at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest burst of activity stems from last year's ruling by the federal 
appeals court based in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority of students can do what the state, acting on its own, cannot do to 
incorporate prayer in the public school high school graduation ceremonies," 
wrote Judge Thomas Reavley of Austin in upholding a prayer at a suburban 
Houston high school. 
</P>
<P>
 That ruling seemed to rub against the grain of more than three decades of 
Supreme Court decisions prohibiting official school prayers, daily Bible 
readings, the teaching of creationism, a state-mandated moment of silence for 
voluntary prayer and the posting of the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Supreme Court last June refused to review the appeals court's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, a federal judge in Boise, Ida. -- citing the Texas decision 
-- upheld the students' right to have a graduation prayer. A day later, 
however, a federal judge in Virginia blocked a planned graduation prayer in 
Loudon County, ruling that the Constitution did not permit "students by a 
majority vote to impose a prayer on the minority." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious-rights advocates heralded the Texas decision as a landmark in the 
law governing religion and public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay A. Sekulow, chief counsel of Robertson's law and justice center -- a 
public policy law firm based in Virginia Beach, Va. -- threatened to send 
"legal SWAT teams" to communities that blocked a prayer or "censored" its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, the ACLU accused the "extreme right" of distorting the law 
and pressuring schools to permit prayer again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an incredibly well-coordinated campaign," said Phil Gutis, an ACLU 
official in New York. "They can talk about this being led by students, but the 
religious right is spending millions of dollars to reintroduce prayer into the 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The back-and-forth has often resulted in murkiness for school boards, students 
and parents, who are not sure what they may do, if anything. When they do 
venture into the legal thicket, they often end up with bland recitations that 
satisfy no one and hardly qualify as prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has caused a horrible mess," said Gwendolyn Gregory, deputy general 
counsel for the National School Boards Assn. in Alexandria, Va. "They don't 
know who to believe. They get these missives from the ACLU and the ACLJ, and 
they are totally contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor University law professor David Guinn, asked last spring to advise 
school districts in central Texas, found board members torn by conflicting 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are fine, sweet, bewildered laymen who say: 'Tell us what to do,' " 
Guinn said. "One side says they'll sue if you have prayer, and the other side 
says they'll sue if you don't have prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 So what did he advise? Guinn said he urged caution. "If it's a religious 
exercise in the public schools, I still think it's unconstitutional," he said. 
"It's also a charade to say all this is initiated voluntarily by the students." 
</P>
<P>
 A few legal points are not in dispute. At one extreme, organized prayers in 
the classroom are forbidden. At the other, courts have recently decided that 
students may meet on campus in Bible study groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But in between, the rules are not as clear. As late as June, 1992, the Supreme 
Court in the case of Lee vs. Weisman ruled that the school district in 
Providence, R.I., had violated the Constitution by inviting a cleric to deliver 
a graduation prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction covers 
Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, said a student-initiated prayer was another 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision had an immediate impact in Round Rock, and it shows that prayer 
remains a powerful symbol, one that can quickly split a community. Round Rock's 
sprawling school district stretches out to include the fast-growing suburbs 
north of Austin, but its center remains a conservative small town where, until 
a few years ago, prayer at Friday night football games was an unquestioned 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Within just a few weeks, the fight over a graduation prayer overturned the 
school board, led to the superintendent's ouster and drove a wedge between 
Christian activists who sought prayer and Jewish parents and others who opposed 
it. In the end, the graduation day exercises left both sides unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in April of last year when three seniors at Westwood High School told 
their principal they wanted a prayer at their graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran Schools Supt. Dan McLendon had recently issued a directive to 
principals that prohibited prayer over the public address system at football 
games and other school events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that I'm opposed to prayer. I'm a 'born-again' Christian," McLendon 
said in an interview. But the district's lawyers, citing the Supreme Court 
ruling in the Providence case, said the school Administration should not be 
involved in promoting prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian activists took offense at the superintendent's no-prayer dictum, and 
three local leaders declared their candidacy for the school board. Citing the 
appeals court decision in the Houston case that sanctioned student-initiated 
prayer, they won an easy victory last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a right of the students. I see it as a matter of freedom of 
expression and freedom of religion," said Kathy Seay, a newly elected board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 After a raucous public meeting, the new board majority passed a resolution 
authorizing student prayers based on a majority vote. At Westwood High, the 
seniors met in an assembly and, with little discussion, voted in favor of a 
graduation prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remained unclear whether the prayer could be explicitly religious. The 
Texas case, Jones vs. Clear Creek, spoke of a "non-sectarian, non-proselytizing 
prayer," but that limitation has spawned new litigation elsewhere in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In McAllen, for example, Schools Supt. Jose Lopez announced that students 
could refer to a "neutral deity" such as "Lord, God, father, etc." but they 
could not make "specific references to Jesus Christ, Mohammed, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Several students said they wanted to pray "in the name of Jesus," and they 
went to court aided by a lawyer furnished by the Rutherford Institute, a 
Charlottesville, Va., group that champions religious liberty. Its lawyers have 
been especially active in Texas defending student-initiated prayers and 
on-campus Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 22 lawsuits under way just in Texas," said Kelly Shackelford, a 
regional coordinator in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the McAllen lawsuit, the students said that "as one of their normal 
religious tenets, when they pray . . . they sincerely believe that their 
religious faith compels prayer in the name of Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, a federal judge rejected their claim, but the Rutherford 
Institute is taking the issue to the 5th Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
 That controversy raises a second question: Who must assure that the student 
prayer is not "sectarian" or "proselytizing"? 
</P>
<P>
 At Westwood High, principal Linda Watkins said she was advised to "edit" the 
prayer written by the three students, although she felt uncomfortable doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my first experience with this issue," she said. "So I talked to our 
attorney. I was told it shouldn't say anything about 'Our Heavenly Father,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is that the prayer has to be pretty innocuous," said Pat 
Ahearn, director of legal services for the Texas Assn. of School Boards. "Maybe 
it can mention God. Maybe not." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the minority of students who do not want a prayer? 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins says she was concerned about the 99 seniors who voted no. "That number 
tells me there was significant opposition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seay, the board member, was more worried about the 379 who voted yes. "In 
a democracy, the majority rules. Over the last 30 years, I think we have sort 
of turned that around so that the minority rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court failed to resolve that dispute, but its last written opinion 
on the issue focused on the rights of dissenting students in Providence. Its 
author, as well as the pivotal vote in the case, was Justice Anthony M. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 An appointee of President Ronald Reagan, Kennedy had earlier voiced support 
for religion's role in public education, but he swung the other way in the 
Providence case. He concluded that a non-religious student should not be forced 
to hear a religious message as a condition of receiving her diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 "What to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that 
the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may 
appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery 
of the state to enforce a religious orthodoxy," Kennedy wrote for the 5-4 
majority that struck down graduation prayer in Providence. "The Constitution 
forbids the state to exact religious conformity from a student as the price of 
attending her high school graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's powerful affirmation of the separation of church and state 
reportedly stunned several of his conservative colleagues. A few months later, 
when the appeal arrived contesting the student-initiated prayer in Houston, 
neither the conservative nor the liberal faction at the high court could count 
on mustering a majority. Instead, the justices agreed only to put off the issue 
until later. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Round Rock one of many communities grasping for direction. Carlos 
Higgins, a former school board member, said the graduation prayer issue "has 
divided this community and encouraged conflict among neighbors. There are nine 
of them up there (at the Supreme Court), so they can't have a tie vote. I'm 
disappointed they didn't decide this one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 With no clear direction from the high court, the student prayer went ahead as 
scheduled at last year's June graduation at Westwood High, but only after 
lawyers for the ACLU approved it. In an unusual arrangement, the school 
district's lawyer faxed a copy of a student's prayer to the ACLU office in 
Austin a few days before graduation. Satisfied all religious references from 
the prayer had been deleted, the ACLU dropped a last-minute legal effort to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so watered down that I wouldn't call it a prayer," said ACLU attorney 
Patrick Wiseman. "There was not even an 'amen.' It was more like a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the new school board members arrived at the Westwood graduation 
pleased that they had at least stood up for the students' right to free speech. 
Even that victory proved a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 After one senior delivered the brief, non-religious invocation, the board 
members stood grim-faced as the class valedictorian arose and denounced the 
board for pushing a "right-wing agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I told them was that this is the first step on the slippery slope toward 
bringing back prayer in school," said Abhi Shellat, now a freshman at Harvard 
University. "If the prayer offended one person in the class, then we shouldn't 
have had it."

ROBERTI DEFEATS RECALL EFFORT BY SOLID MARGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By a wide margin, state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) proved victorious 
Tuesday over a recall drive that was closely watched nationally as a referendum 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, the first state politician in 80 years to face a recall, said the 
outcome proved that politicians can support gun control and survive 
politically. He claimed that the attempt to oust him was the work of the gun 
lobby seeking revenge because of his support for a 1989 law banning 
military-style semiautomatic rifles, known as assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 All five of the candidates seeking to replace Roberti if the recall had 
succeeded avidly championed the 2nd Amendment, the section of the U.S. 
Constitution that guarantees citizens the right to bear arms, and gun control 
foes pumped thousands of dollars into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun lobby hasn't crippled me, it's energized me," said Roberti, who 
declared victory at 10:37 p.m. at an election party at a Sun Valley restaurant 
as 150 supporters cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti pledged to fight for additional gun legislation and urged other 
politicians to do likewise. "I'm all in one piece," he said. "They weren't able 
to get a piece of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Reilly, Roberti's political consultant, predicted that the victory 
will give "enormous momentum" to the senator's campaign for state treasurer 
against former Democratic Party Chairman Phil Angelides. Amid the campaign 
paraphernalia were signs and badges announcing "Treasurer Roberti -- The Man 
Who Banned Assault Weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his opponents were Randy Linkmeyer, a Canoga Park gun store owner, and 
Al Dib, a retired grocer who advocated the repeal of statutes that outlaw 
machine guns and make it illegal to carry concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, proponents of the recall 
acknowledged that they owed a huge debt of gratitude to gun owners. But they 
also insisted that their movement was not a captive of gun interests and that 
their gripe with Roberti stemmed from a critique of the senator's 27 years in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's opponents said they were hurt by his vast campaign resources. 
Roberti had more than $750,000 to spend on the election, about nine times as 
much as his opponents. "If we'd had a level playing field and we had had the 
assets Roberti had, I think we would have won and we would have won with a 
landslide," said Bill Dominguez, a Van Nuys systems analyst and a leader of the 
recall movement, at an election party at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, throughout which recall supporters insisted that the 
election was not about guns but about good government, 15 guns were stolen from 
Dominguez's home. The incident amounted to a public relations coup for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall measure qualified for the ballot after more than 20,000 registered 
voters from Roberti's district signed petitions accusing Roberti of malfeasance 
in office and demanding that a recall election be held. Roberti, required to 
give up his Senate seat because of term limits, had planned to retire from 
politics. But, declaring that he would not be forced out by a recall, he 
decided to run for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 With local government reeling from the impact of the recession and the Jan. 17 
earthquake, Roberti charged that the extra cost of the election, estimated at 
$800,000, was exorbitant, especially because term limits were going to force 
him to leave office in December anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary election to pick Roberti's Senate successor will be held June 7. All 
the candidates who ran in Tuesday's recall election to unseat Roberti are 
running in the primary; there are other candidates as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final hours, the Roberti recall campaign turned into a battle between 
the National Rifle Assn. and Handgun Control Inc., the leading adversaries in 
nation's ongoing gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA pumped nearly $50,000 into the race to pay for a five-day phone bank 
operation, while Handgun Control poured its money into the race to pay for 
last-minute radio advertising. But perhaps more important, the group gave 
Roberti the support of its leader, Sarah Brady, a celebrated gun control 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll taken in late March found that two-thirds of the voters in 
Roberti's district supported stronger gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roberti showed up to vote at 1 p.m. in Van Nuys, he was confronted by 
Tanya Metaksa, executive director of the NRA's Washington, D.C.-based 
legislative arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Metaksa intended to berate Roberti as a soft-on-crime liberal. Instead, she 
found the senator prepared to counter her with a public relations gambit of his 
own. Accompanying the senator was Michelle Scully, who was wounded less than a 
year ago when Gian Luigi Ferri opened fire on office workers in a San Francisco 
high-rise with a .45-caliber semiautomatic gun that was one of the types of 
assault weapons banned by Roberti's 1989 legislation. Scully's husband, John, 
was killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After Metaksa squeezed in close enough to identify herself, Roberti pointed to 
Scully and said, "Here, talk to Michelle! Her husband was killed and somehow 
she survived. Talk to victims of your kind of weapons!" Roberti then shoved his 
way through to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Roberti was able to defuse charges that he was soft on 
crime by winning the support of Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams and 
two former Los Angeles police chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall supporters alleged that as an officeholder Roberti had tolerated a 
culture of political corruption that resulted in criminal charges and prison 
terms for three Sacramento legislators, including former state Sen. Alan 
Robbins of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall movement was able to win the endorsement of the California 
Republican Party. But even that fizzled when the party's leading figures, 
including Gov. Pete Wilson, shied away from the recall campaign. 
</P>

story.

STUDY SEES DANGERS IN STATE'S TAX SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when its economy recovers, California still faces a troubled fiscal 
future unless the state spends enough to provide the kind of educated labor 
force and public works that businesses need to compete in global markets, a new 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
 That higher spending could be accomplished and the state's multibillion-dollar 
deficits erased, the study says, by fixing inequities in California's 
antiquated tax system. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, 
Washington, D.C.-based think tank, criticizes Republican Gov. Pete Wilson for 
spreading the belief that California is being overwhelmed by schoolchildren, 
immigrants and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson Administration spokesman dismissed the study as "essentially a 
blueprint for more taxing and spending." 
</P>
<P>
 H. D. Palmer, assistant director of the state Finance Department, said an 
"out-of-state interest group" telling Californians they are paying too little 
in taxes is not likely to get a warm reception, especially as many in the state 
are rushing to file their annual tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just beginning to see signs of economic recovery, and one of the 
sure-fire ways to strangle that recovery is to saddle Californians with more 
taxes," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the authors of the study said the higher taxes they advocate, if spent 
wisely by government, would boost productivity by relieving businesses of the 
burden of having to train and educate their workers and by making it easier for 
companies to move their goods to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is no longer making sufficient investment in areas considered 
necessary for economic growth," said Iris Lav, director of state and local 
programs for the center. "It will be harder to go into the next century with 
poorly trained workers and inferior infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lav's study says the state could raise at least $9 billion more annually by 
restructuring the tax system in ways that would not require an increase in 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's sales tax has failed to keep pace with changes in the economy, the 
researchers said. Today, people spend less of their money on goods than they 
used to, and more on services, which tend not to be taxed, resulting in a 
$1.9-billion drop in the tax's annual yield. The center recommended broadening 
the sales tax to cover more services, as other states have done. 
</P>
<P>
 The property tax, as amended by voters with the passage of Proposition 13 in 
1978, assesses property not at its full market value but at its value when it 
changes hands. The study recommends reassessing business property more often to 
raise at least $3.3 billion more per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the study says the state has let income tax deductions and credits 
proliferate without evaluating their long-term impact on state revenues. If the 
growth in these so-called tax expenditures had been limited to the rate of 
growth in the state's general fund since 1986, the state would have $4.2 
billion more to spend in the current fiscal year, the study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also is highly critical of a 1991 report by Wilson's Finance 
Department, which argued that California was undergoing a "taxpayer squeeze" as 
more and more people needed services and relatively fewer people were working 
and paying taxes to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the Wilson report warned that the state's ratio of 
taxpayers to school students -- a measure of the state's ability to finance 
public education -- would drop from 2.6 to 1 in 1990 to 2 to 1 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lav's study provides a broader perspective, showing that the percentage 
growth in school enrollments in this decade is below average for the decades 
since World War II and well below the skyrocketing growth in the 1940s and 
1950s. That was a time when California's education system was building itself 
into the envy of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Lav said that in the 1960s and 1970s, California had only 1.5 
workers paying taxes to support each student in public schools, far fewer than 
the state had in 1990 or will have in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "By every measure," the study says, "California is better equipped today to 
finance education than when it invested heavily in education for baby-boom 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 But Palmer of the Finance Department said the center's analysis ignores the 
other demands that have been placed on state taxpayers since the baby boom 
years. Since then, he said, welfare and health services for the poor have grown 
tremendously.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The quake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway -- the nation's busiest -- opened 
Monday, less than three months after the Jan. 17 earthquake. Here is a 
numerical look at some key repair features: 
</P>
<P>
 * $29.7 million: Total construction cost, including bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * $14.9 million: Original bid amount for completion in 140 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * $14.8 million: Bonus paid to the contractor, C. C. Myers Inc., for 
completing the project in slightly more than half the time originally 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
 * $8 million: Net profit for C. C. Myers, headquartered in Rancho Cordova, 
Calif., after paying for extra crews and equipment and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6 million: Pounds of steel used in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * $1 million: Lost in production and wages each day from traffic delays, 
according to a study by the governor's Office of Planning and Research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 600,000: Pounds or 17,000 linear feet of 12-by-12 timbers used during 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 * 341,000: Average number of vehicles that travel the Santa Monica Freeway 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 20,000: Cubic yards of structural concrete poured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1,000: Construction workers, including 228 carpenters, 134 ironworkers and 
four superintendents, who worked 12-hour shifts on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 66: Days needed for repair work, which began Feb. 5 and was completed 74 
days ahead of schedule. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY: OPEN AGAIN; THE MAN WHO PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL; 
CONSTRUCTION: CLINTON MYERS IS A BOOTSTRAP MILLIONAIRE WHO SPEEDED UP THE JOB 
BY NEVER TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. "NO ONE WILL EVER TOUCH WHAT WE HAVE DONE," 
HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the railroads told contractor Clinton Myers that it would take three 
weeks to deliver steel beams needed for rebuilding the Santa Monica Freeway, 
Myers spent $119,000 to rent his own trains to carry supplies from Arkansas and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 When the ironworkers said they were tired from working 10-hour days, seven 
days a week, Myers, a bootstrap millionaire, hired more. 
</P>
<P>
 Day and night, Myers pushed, prodded and urged the workers. A man in constant 
motion, he stopped only when the freeway opened. Then he gazed at the 
structures, which still have wood framing attached, and pronounced: "No one 
will ever touch what we have done, no one will ever come close." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, he added: "But I could do it in 10 days less if I were to design and 
build it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he started on Feb. 5, the day he won the contract to rebuild the 
Santa Monica Freeway, Myers planned on accelerating construction. Caltrans gave 
him 140 days to reconstruct quake-damaged sections, at La Cienega Boulevard and 
Fairfax Avenue, and Myers figured that he would do the job in less than 100 
days -- like the feat he accomplished when he was assigned to rebuild two 
Watsonville bridges that collapsed after the Loma Prieta quake. There, he took 
45 days to complete a project allotted 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica was bigger and more complicated. It also took the confidence 
of an experienced bridge boss and the savvy of a gambler: While Myers stood to 
win $200,000 for each day he finished early, he also faced a penalty of the 
same amount for every late day. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Santa Monica Freeway, Myers immediately made sure all the crews and 
subcontractors knew his goal. He demanded every boss's home number and he was 
not shy about calling day or night. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he first told me his plans to finish mid-April, I thought he was trying 
to light a fire under me. I'm thinking, 'Yeah, right, finish in April,' " said 
Dean Bubion, president of Tri-City Reinforcing Corp., the subcontractor that 
handled the steelwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Bubion quickly learned, Myers meant it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you want something bad enough, you've got to go for it," said Myers, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers grew up in a family of 13 children raised on a farm in the San 
Bernardino County community of Highland. But farming never held his interest. 
He dropped out of 10th grade and ran away from his father's home. With all his 
belongings packed in a small carton, he headed to his mother's trailer in Long 
Beach. There, he slept under the awning at night and worked as a carpenter's 
apprentice by day. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked his way up, a tale that most of his crews have heard. He was once 
just like them, they say, maybe a little bit tougher, maybe a little bit more 
ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be a wimp and be as big as he is," said Lester Jennings, 52, a 
carpenter foreman. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Santa Monica Freeway was under construction, Myers was constantly on 
the prowl. He strode across plank bridges and climbed the scaffolding ladders 
in his black cowboy boots. Constantly in motion, he juggled the mundane and the 
serious with equal care. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when he saw a driver loading his flatbed truck, Myers shouted: "Is 
that all you are putting on there? Move those pallets so you can fill that up. 
That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the driver could sputter a response, Myers had refocused his 
sights. Spotting a worker getting out of a white company pickup, Myers abruptly 
changed his course. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to my truck?" He growled as he corralled the hapless man, who 
stumblingly told Myers that he had had a traffic accident the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't make me too happy," said Myers, glaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he reprimanded the driver, Myers was, in fact, quite content. He knew 
he had done what most would consider impossible. He had delivered the Santa 
Monica 2 1/2 months ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we achieved," he said, "was no surprise to us whatsoever."

BATTLE HEATS UP OVER LAST UNTOUCHED COAST; LAND USE: DEVELOPERS SAY FOUR 
PROJECTS ON SOUTHLAND'S REMAINING PRISTINE STRETCH WOULD ADD TAX REVENUES AND 
JOBS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE JOINING FORCES TO PRESERVE THE AREA. 
</P>

<P>
 This is the Southland's Big Sur, the final stretch of pristine coastline in 
Southern California -- 20 miles of mesa stretching from this oceanfront suburb 
up the coast to Gaviota. 
</P>
<P>
 Still undeveloped -- but also unprotected -- this swath of shoreline is home 
to great blue herons, snowy egrets, red foxes and great-horned owls. Rolling 
fields are carpeted with mustard, lupine and thigh-high grass. Monarch 
butterflies roost in stands of eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a national treasure," said Mark Holmgren, curator of the 
Vertebrate Museum at UC Santa Barbara. "What makes the area's unusual ecosystem 
work is the large amount of open space." 
</P>
<P>
 But this national treasure is also the battleground in a brewing fight between 
concrete and butterflies. Four proposed developments threaten the crucial 
stretch. Lawsuits have been filed, hours of testimony given, and today, the 
California Coastal Commission gets into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake, developers say, are millions of dollars in tax revenues and hundreds 
of construction and service jobs. The question facing the region is how to 
balance economic growth with environmental preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight local organizations plan to join forces during commission hearings in 
Inglewood to voice their concerns. "This is the first coordinated effort to 
protect the coast," said Bob Keats, director of the Haskell's Beach/Naples Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Keats is part of a broad grass-roots effort to treat the entire stretch of 
land as a whole rather than continuing to fight projects piecemeal as they 
arise -- a condominium complex here, golf courses there, a sprinkling of 
private residences, a resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally realized that what really works -- whether you're a tree-hugger or 
a landowner -- is a comprehensive plan that allows for everyone to plan 
intelligently for the future," said Chris Lange, head of the 600-member Save 
Ellwood Shores group. 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled turf is nestled between U.S. 101 and the sea, a wide-open space 
that evokes a postcard image of California, the type of "wish-you-were-here" 
greeting card sold in the porch-front general stores that dot the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the space are mesa bluffs that drop 80 feet to the beach. Here 
seals, dolphins and pelicans forage for food. On the other side are groves of 
eucalyptus trees, which form some of California's largest monarch butterfly 
roosting sites. In winter, the trees are covered with thousands of 
gold-and-black wings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, and perhaps most controversial, of the four proposed plans would 
develop Ellwood Beach in Goleta. The plan encompasses 135 acres including rare 
vernal pools, native grasses, a number of threatened species and a large 
monarch butterfly roosting site. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Diversified of Irvine owns the land, where it wants to build 161 
homes and condominiums. But over four years, the developer has had to scale 
back the project twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's environmental impact report listed 20 adverse impacts the 
development would have on the ecosystem. As a result, the Santa Barbara County 
Planning Commission recommended that supervisors reject the project. But in an 
unusual move, the County Board of Supervisors approved it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Coastal Commission denied the county's plans to proceed with 
the development, citing, among other reasons, the threat to the fragile 
ecosystem. Now, the developers may have to scale back their plans again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission was very restrictive," said Randy Fox, vice president of 
Southwest Diversified, which has sued the commission for $50 million. "It takes 
all 161 units to make this thing work for us financially." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the coast is Haskell's Beach, where Hyatt Corp. has spent nearly $8 
million since 1983 trying to build a 400-room resort on a 73-acre site. After 
47 public hearings during a five-year span, the developer obtained approval in 
1988 to build on the site, which has a monarch butterfly habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citizens for Goleta Valley filed three lawsuits against the developer, 
charging among other things that the $160-million project would harm the 
environment and that less sensitive areas should be considered for the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lawsuits went to the California Supreme Court, which in January, 
1991, ruled that Hyatt could move ahead with its project. But the site remains 
undeveloped because Hyatt cannot secure financing for the project, spokesman 
John Tynan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still committed 100%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third project is planned for 202 acres owned by Arco Corp., which operates 
an oil and gas field that produces an average of 200 barrels of oil a day. Arco 
has offered to shut down its coastal oil operation prematurely in exchange for 
permission to develop an 18-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a better use of the land," said Whitt Hollis, an Arco 
spokesman. "I think the projects works out well for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The county approved Arco's conditional use permit request last summer. The 
approval was immediately appealed. "We believe the fertilizers and chemicals 
used in the project will harm a seal colony that lives below the cliffs," said 
Keats, one who appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth project is planned for a 500-acre parcel that forms the township of 
Naples, which was created before the county's current zoning regulations. The 
Morehart family, which owns the parcel, sued the county for permission to 
develop residential complexes in an agriculturally zoned area. The case went to 
the California Supreme Court, and a decision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bureaucratic wheels turn, residents along the coast are trying to draw 
together public and private land interests to save the area. On Saturday, the 
local chapter of the Audubon Society and UC Santa Barbara are hosting a 
conference to discuss how to join forces to form a long-range protection plan. 
One solution: Creating a national seashore park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, developers continue to push their projects through the pipeline, 
although the process is an increasingly tangled one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to use the word frustrating, but anyone who tries to develop 
here must know it will be a long and expensive process," Arco's Hollis said.

 Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell was headed for defeat Tuesday in one of 50 local 
elections where voters turned out many incumbents, making some dramatic changes 
in the ethnic makeups of several city councils but forestalling other chances 
at historic shifts in political power. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maywood, where more than 93% of the population is Latino, voters installed 
the city's first Latino-majority council. Tomas Martin and Elvira Moreno ousted 
longtime incumbents Mayor Thomas Engle and Councilwoman Rose Marie Busciglio. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of South Gate, where 83% of residents are Latino, also elected its 
first Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, incumbent Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, the top 
vote-getter in two previous elections, lost after drawing fire from critics 
including the Beverly Hills Police Officers Assn. He finished third in an 
eight-way race, beaten in the contest for two seats by MeraLee Goldman and Les 
Bronte, both supported by the police union. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Hollywood, a sweep of the three seats at stake would have given gays a 
majority on the five-person council for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of two seats were gay men -- challenger Steve Martin and incumbent 
John Heilman. But incumbent Sal Guarriello, a heterosexual, held onto his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Monterey Park, final unofficial returns showed that voters decided not 
to make their city the first in California to have an Asian American majority 
on its council. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's elections loomed significant because of what the results could 
say about the city's direction and because of the latest debate on smoking in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the city's top post, Kell, 65, was bidding to remain the only 
mayor Long Beach has known since voters began electing their top official in 
1988. However, with more than 50% of the vote counted late Tuesday, Kell was 
running fifth in a field of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had six good years. It's not the end of the world if we don't win," he 
told a supporter as the early returns were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell's well-financed challengers -- those raising more than $100,000 -- were 
council members Ray Grabinski and Jeffrey A. Kellogg; former Long Beach City 
College President Beverly O'Neill; redevelopment board member Don Westerland 
and Belmont Shore businessman Frank Colonna. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate won more than 50% of the vote, which given initial returns 
seemed almost certain, the two top finishers will meet in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, O'Neill and Grabinski were leading the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the campaign centered on the need to stem crime, create jobs, unite 
the city's increasingly diverse neighborhoods and establish an international 
image for the city, which has seen its economy tumble as the Navy and defense 
contractors have scaled back or closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Long Beach elections, two Latinas were making strong bids to become 
the council's first Latino members. In the 1st District, Jenny Oropeza, the 
first Latino elected to the Long Beach school board, waged a well-financed 
effort. In the 7th District, Tonia Reyes Uranga was considered a leading 
contender to succeed Grabinski, who is giving up his council seat to run for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, both appeared to have secured positions in runoffs for the 
council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3rd District, incumbent Douglas S. Drummond faced three challengers, 
two of whom decided to run after Drummond made anti-gay remarks during a 
conservative forum last fall. Drummond said gays did not concern him because 
they were dying from AIDS, and he supported Cuba's policy of quarantining 
people with the disease. Drummond later voted with the council majority to 
censure himself and offered an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond took an early lead in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach voters also were deciding whether to ban smoking in all businesses 
used by the public, except in patio restaurant areas and in bars where up to a 
third of the seating could be set aside for smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, it appeared Measure K would be victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the measure received little attention in a city where wars over 
proposed smoking bans have generated big news in years past. The council backed 
down from a 1991 ordinance to outlaw smoking in restaurants after a petition 
drive financed by the tobacco industry collected enough signatures to put the 
issue on the ballot. Last July, the council passed a less sweeping ordinance. 
Once again, a coalition of smoking interests launched a petition drive. So 
council members, all nonsmokers, decided to put the issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Lomita, voters ousted council incumbents Robert Hargrave, Peter J. 
Rossick and Chuck Taylor. Their challengers, David Albert, Lawson Pedigo and 
Ben Traina, said the city needed new leadership because of continued problems 
with crime and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the South Bay, Carson voters were directly electing a mayor for 
the first time. The vote followed a bitter campaign pitting Michael I. Mitoma, 
50, the city's appointed mayor, against retired economist James Peoples, 60. 
Each accused the other of playing racial politics. 
</P>
<P>
 With most precincts reporting, Peoples and Mitoma were locked in a close race. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monterey Park, where a majority of residents are of Asian descent, the 
state's first City Council with an Asian American majority had seemed a 
possibility. But with all of the city's 19 precincts reporting, incumbents Fred 
Balderrama and Marie T. Purvis and challenger Francisco Alonso were victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers in the race for three council seats included incumbent Sam Kiang. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Chu is already on the five-member council, and Kiang and two 
other Chinese Americans -- Peter Chan and Mitchell Ing -- were among the six 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the San Gabriel Valley was the fight for political clout more 
bitter than in El Monte, where police officers went door to door trying to oust 
Mayor Patricia A. Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial final vote, however, showed Wallach winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte Police Officers Assn.'s campaign to remove Wallach stemmed from 
the mayor's refusal last year to support the hiring of 10 more officers in the 
city, which ranks near the bottom of the county's cities in the number of 
officers per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 With three candidates for mayor and six for two council seats, the association 
spent nearly $13,000 on a slate made up of mayoral challenger Terry Keenan, a 
sheriff's deputy, and incumbent council members Jack Thurston and Maria F. 
Avila. Wallach fought back with her own slate, which included Gregory B. 
Griffith and Planning Commission Chairman George Williams.

FLEEING BELGIANS TELL OF CARNAGE, ATROCITIES IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Belgian nationals fleeing from the violence in Rwanda returned home early 
Tuesday, carrying with them tales that detailed the horrors that have swept the 
Central African nation for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting erupted after the country's president, Juvenal Habyarimana, along 
with the president of neighboring Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira, was killed in a 
plane crash, apparently after the craft was hit by rocket fire near the airport 
at Kigali, the Rwandan capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has been characterized by savage, often random attacks between 
members of the Hutu majority and the minority Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most chilling accounts to come out of the carnage -- which Western 
aid workers remaining in the country believe may have left more than 20,000 
people dead in less than a week -- was given by a Belgian soldier serving with 
a U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibly shaken, the soldier -- identified as Cpl. Antoine Gaston -- told how 
he watched a series of atrocities but was helpless to stop them, even though he 
was armed. The U.N. mandate, he explained, strictly forbids any intervention to 
stop fighting between Rwandans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was real butchery," he said. "Ten meters (about 30 feet) away from me, I 
saw people being massacred, a little girl being raped, then killed with a 
machete. All of this under our eyes and without being able to intervene. And 
why? Because we are U.N. soldiers (and) it is not possible (to intervene to 
stop the killing). 
</P>
<P>
 "The blue helmet missions for me are over," he said. "I don't want to 
participate in them anymore. You can't intervene, and I'm out there risking my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Another returnee, who was not identified but who said he had spent 
considerable time in Africa, seemed stunned by the level of bloodshed he had 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening in Rwanda I've never seen anywhere else, and I was in Zaire 
in the '60s when we had to flee that country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also confirmation of an account related by a Belgian priest in 
Tuesday's editions of the Brussels daily La Libre Belgique. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest, Jozef Schmidt, described how several hundred people sought refuge 
from the fighting in his church in the town of Boussassamama. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two soldiers who were supposed to be guarding them started acting crazy," he 
recalled. "It was raining. I saw everything from my room. It was horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness said the two soldiers took four hours to kill everyone in the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Belgians recounted their chilling experiences from the safety of their 
homeland, conditions in Kigali disintegrated further, with the interim 
government fleeing the city as units from the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
reportedly entered the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian government sources indicated that the evacuation of foreigners from 
the country was nearly complete, with only about 50 to 100 mainly expatriate 
Europeans still in the capital. Before the start of the violence last week, 
there were about 3,000 Westerners in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters still in the city said heavy fighting between the Tutsi-dominated 
RPF and units of the mainly Hutu Rwandan army continued through the afternoon. 
But the flight of the Hutu-dominated government was perhaps the most striking 
evidence that the RPF seemed to be gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Brussels, an RPF representative, James Rewgo, said the rebel units 
would act quickly to end the bloodshed. "We will be able to stop the 
massacres," he said. "After establishing public order, we will try to set up a 
government with a broad base." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments seemed to imply that the rebels were at least open to the 
possibility of an ethnically mixed power base for the country.

ZULU CHIEF IN DRAMATIC PLEA TO DELAY VOTING; SOUTH AFRICA: BUTHELEZI LEAPS INTO 
GATHERING OF FOREIGN MEDIATORS TO WARN OF WORSENING VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Already 40 minutes behind schedule, the seven foreign dignitaries, South 
Africa's foreign minister and hundreds of journalists, diplomats and others had 
just settled down for opening speeches here when a commotion erupted at one 
side of the hotel penthouse ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As heads and television cameras turned, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi 
suddenly bounded onto the dais, throwing the news conference into an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic entrance briefly upstaged former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger and six other international mediators who arrived here Tuesday to try 
to narrow constitutional differences between Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party 
and Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens over the next week to 10 days, while the seven mediators 
retire to a game lodge somewhere in the northern Transvaal, may determine if 
the charismatic Zulu chief will be able to stay in South Africa's limelight 
much longer or will be left in the dark after national elections scheduled for 
April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Buthelezi has essentially hijacked his nation's attention at a time 
when Mandela appears only two weeks away from achieving his lifelong vision of 
holding democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Buthelezi, whose political support is tiny in comparison to Mandela's, 
can hijack the elections as well remains to be seen. He has demanded the 
balloting be postponed until the 1993 constitution can be amended to make it 
sufficiently "federal" to guarantee a degree of Zulu autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks Tuesday, Buthelezi warned that the violence that has 
ravaged the Zulu strongholds of Natal province in recent weeks will worsen if 
the vote is not postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to see how the seven foreign mediators can heal the wound. 
Their mission -- whom they will talk to and what they can do -- was not clear 
even as they arrived. Most of the group had never met before, Kissinger said. 
"Seven extraordinarily busy individuals have managed to clear their schedules 
and done the unimaginable -- arrive the same time in a distant place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He appealed to the ANC and Inkatha to be flexible. "Sometimes in negotiations, 
people put forward a bargaining position and then go back step by step to their 
real point," he said. "In the limited time available, can I ask everyone 
involved to start with their real position?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the ANC and Inkatha have yet to agree on just how broad the mediators' 
mandate will be. And the two political rivals remain diametrically opposed on 
Inkatha's key demand since the ANC refuses to consider postponing the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mediator, A. Leon Higginbotham, a former federal judge in 
Philadelphia, said he was optimistic anyway. "I'm coming with the belief that 
rational people can make rational decisions," he said.

MRS. CLINTON'S TAX DEDUCTIONS DISCLOSED; WHITEWATER: SHE USED LOSSES IN 
MONEY-LOSING REAL ESTATE VENTURE TO CUT COMMODITY TRADING LIABILITY, MCDOUGAL'S 
DOCUMENTS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took tax deductions from the money-losing 
Whitewater real estate venture to reduce her personal tax liability on the 
extraordinary profits she earned from commodities trading in the late 1970s, 
James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton prepaid interest on Whitewater debt to reduce her tax liability 
on the nearly $100,000 that she had earned by trading in commodities, McDougal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources familiar with the Clintons' taxes confirmed Tuesday that the 
Clintons made some accelerated interest payments on Whitewater debt but the 
sources said that the Clintons did so only on McDougal's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's assertions and supporting documents released by him Tuesday offered 
the first evidence of a connection between Mrs. Clinton's commodity trading and 
the Clintons' investments in the Whitewater real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements also marked the first time anyone involved in the Whitewater 
development has suggested that the Clintons used the venture to reduce their 
tax liabilities. Until now, Whitewater had been portrayed by the couple as 
simply an attempt to operate a profit-making business that went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax experts question whether the Clintons properly claimed tax deductions for 
loan payments made on behalf of Whitewater. Mark S. Rogers, a Little Rock 
accountant hired by The Times to analyze the tax documents, said he would have 
advised the Clintons that the Whitewater corporation should take the tax 
deduction for all payments made on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been more prudent to deposit the money into the Whitewater 
account and let Whitewater make the payment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal made his statements as he released more than 2,000 pages of financial 
records from the Whitewater Development Corp., which the White House earlier 
had refused to make public. He charged news organizations $1,000 for a complete 
set of the records and said that he also has sent copies to Whitewater special 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate tax records show that the Whitewater corporation consistently 
lost money and never paid any corporate income taxes. By the early 1980s, in 
fact, Whitewater had more than $100,000 in cumulative tax losses that could be 
used to shelter future company earnings. Records show that McDougal attempted 
to turn Whitewater into a tax shelter for income from other real estate 
projects beginning in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater records do not substantiate the Clintons' claim that they 
invested approximately $46,000 in the venture by paying interest on Whitewater 
loans. But they do show that Mrs. Clinton made an interest payment of 
$10,130.58 to a holding company owned by McDougal in 1978 -- the same year she 
reported a big windfall from her commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that Mrs. Clinton prepaid the interest on a Whitewater loan at 
his recommendation, after she asked him how she might use the real estate 
venture to reduce the tax consequences of her successful commodities trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only suggestion I had was, since we had accrued interest which we had not 
paid, (that she should) go ahead and pay it (ahead of schedule), McDougal said. 
The early payment allowed Mrs. Clinton to deduct it from her taxes during the 
year in which she reported a profit from her commodities trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say that legal and ordinary expenses in connection with Whitewater 
which were deductible had the effect of reducing her tax liability." 
</P>
<P>
 A White House source said, however, "there was no thought of sheltering income 
in Whitewater. He said that, although the Clintons made some accelerated 
interest payments, they "paid the interest McDougal asked them to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Another White House source noted that they "paid short-term capital gains at 
the highest possible rate" on their income from commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Clintons were questioned about their Whitewater investment during the 
1992 election campaign, they issued a report by Denver attorney James M. Lyons 
stating that they had put $68,900 of their own money into the venture -- all of 
it in interest payments on loans owed by Whitewater. But more recently, the 
White House revised the Lyons report to say that the Clintons paid only 
$46,635.75 into the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater tax records made available to reporters by McDougal show only 
two payments to the company by the Clintons -- Mrs. Clinton's payment of 
$10,130 to McDougal, which was listed as a loan, and another loan of $2,900 in 
1979 from Bill Clinton, of which $500 was later deemed to be for the purchase 
of his Whitewater stock. 
</P>
<P>
 These entries appear to support McDougal's contention that the Clintons put no 
more than $13,000 into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons took a deduction for the $10,130 payment on their 1978 personal 
income taxes. Nowhere do the corporate records reflect the receipt of a $9,000 
interest deduction which the Clintons took on their personal income taxes in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater records also show that the company received loans from several 
other McDougal business entities, including subsidiaries of McDougal's Madison 
Guarantee Savings & Loan. Federal investigators believe as much as $100,000 of 
Madison money was funneled into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corporate tax year ending May 31, 1985, Whitewater reported unexplained 
income of $21,720. In the same year, it reported paying out $28,000 in 
"professional fees" to an unidentified recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year ending May 31, 1982, it reported paying $20,264 to an unnamed 
shareholder. The Clintons and the McDougals were the only stockholders in 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax returns also show that in 1980, McDougal transferred his half 
ownership of Whitewater to another corporation that he owned, Great Southern 
Land Co. Attachments to Whitewater's tax returns show that Whitewater was 
jointly owned by Great Southern and Hillary Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Whitewater began in the late 1970s as a simple money-making venture, 
it clearly became a vehicle for sheltering other income from taxes, records 
show. By the early 1980s, Whitewater had more than $100,000 in tax losses that 
could be used to avoid taxes on future income. By 1986 McDougal was 
transferring what he hoped would be profitable land projects into Whitewater to 
take advantage of the corporation's tax losses, his attorney, Sam Heuer, said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances the Whitewater tax records released by McDougal are missing 
so much supporting documentation that it is difficult to analyze all of the 
actions of its owners. McDougal has refused to release Great Southern's 
corporate records.

GOP THREATENS TO SLOW DOWN HOUSE ACTION ON CRIME BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the House back in session this week, leading Republicans are threatening 
to use parliamentary guerrilla warfare to oppose a Democrat-sponsored package 
of crime bills embraced by President Clinton -- legislation the GOP lawmakers 
call worse than none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The partisan lines were clearly drawn Tuesday, with a final vote on the 
legislation only about a week away. The battleground for the opening skirmish 
was the House Rules Committee, where Republicans staged a mini-filibuster to 
protest the Democratic majority's refusal to allow a floor vote on nine 
proposed GOP amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated Republican lawmakers threatened to slow down consideration of the 
crime package by employing rarely used parliamentary procedures when debate on 
the bill begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to express to the public the outrage we feel," said Rep. Bill 
McCollum (R-Fla.), a leading GOP spokesman on crime issues. "The bill out there 
is worse than no bill at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats scoffed at their colleagues' threat to delay passage of the 
crime legislation at a time when public concern over street violence is at a 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want us to get on with this bill and not talk it to death," Rep. Bart 
Gordon (D-Tenn.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans complained that the measure would interfere with implementation of 
the death penalty and prevent them from earmarking $10 billion for state prison 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that it would allocate $8 billion to what they call dubious 
federal programs intended to deter youngsters from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats tout this as a tough crime bill, but actually, it is quite weak," 
McCollum said. "Passing it in its present form would do more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a chief architect of the crime package, 
argued that Republicans were simply worried that the Democrats had taken an 
issue that once belonged to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're afraid we Democrats have come up with a good, smart, tough bill," he 
said, predicting that many Republicans ultimately would vote for it despite the 
outburst of partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) speculated that some Democrats would 
find it difficult to support a crime bill that she said lets lawmakers appear 
to be fighting crime while failing to address its causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation before the House -- a package of 21 separate bills -- includes 
$3 billion for prison construction, mandatory life sentences for certain repeat 
offenders and expansion of the federal death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would authorize funds for 50,000 more police officers and ban gun 
ownership or possession for almost everyone under age 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate last year passed its own bill with more severe provisions, 
including one that would give the federal government jurisdiction over crimes 
committed with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the House bill is passed, a Senate-House conference would resolve 
differences and produce a compromise version that would have to be ratified by 
both chambers before it is sent to the President.

POWERBROKER CASTS SHADOW ON POTENTIAL PREMIER; JAPAN: FOREIGN MINISTER HATA 
COULD BECOME THE NEW PRIME MINISTER. BUT MANY IN THE RULING COALITION OBJECT TO 
HIS STRATEGIST, OZAWA.

 Tsutomu Hata, this nation's mild-mannered foreign minister, was thrust into 
the spotlight as Japan's tattered coalition began discussions today on choosing 
a new Japanese leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese media reported the choice of Hata as a foregone conclusion. But at a 
key meeting of the deputies of the eight parties in the coalition this morning, 
the Socialists, the Democratic Socialists and the New Party Harbinger insisted 
that new arrangements for decision-making first be worked out to restrict the 
power of Hata's strategist, Ichiro Ozawa -- who served as the mastermind for 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa -- in any Hata government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, for his part, told reporters that he pushed for an agreement on 
policies the new government would follow on the economy, tax reform and North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies scheduled another meeting for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' secretary general, had predicted Tuesday that a 
decision on a successor might be made today. NHK, the semi-governmental 
national TV and radio network, reported that a quick decision is unlikely but 
said the lower house is expected to elect a new prime minister early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, reports were circulating about of likely appointments in a Hata 
Cabinet. Kubo, for example, was cited as the choice for chief Cabinet 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata, one of the rebels who bolted the Liberal Democratic Party last June and 
deprived it of its majority, had been one of the former ruling party's chief 
advocates of political reform. His experience as both finance minister and 
agriculture minister was expected to help him carry out reforms of Japan's 
economy that Hosokawa had promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Hosokawa accepted responsibility for a controversy over his 
personal financial dealings and declared his intention to resign to break a 
parliamentary boycott that has prevented enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his coalition appeared to be on the brink of a split, its members 
apparently realized they could not succeed in their rival attempts to link up 
with segments of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to elect a prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa had sent out feelers to an eager Michio Watanabe, 70, a Liberal 
Democratic bigwig, to join his Renewal Party and the Buddhist-backed Clean 
Government Party in a new mix that would exclude the left-leaning Socialists. 
On Monday, Watanabe declared he had "the will, the spirit and the physical 
strength" to serve as prime minister. But by Tuesday night, it became clear he 
did not have the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe -- who resigned as foreign minister and deputy prime minister a year 
ago because of ill health -- would have to gather at least 80 Liberal 
Democratic defectors to win a lower house election for prime minister with 
backing from Ozawa's group and the Buddhist party. But lower house followers in 
his faction, the LDP's third largest, number only 46. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Socialist leaders had hinted that they would be willing to 
join a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, whose 38-year rule ended last 
summer, to counteract moves to pick Watanabe. Rank-and-file members, however, 
rebelled against the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist, New Party Harbinger and Democratic Socialist leaders initiated a 
truce in their fight with the Hata-Ozawa Renewal Party and the Clean Government 
Party on Tuesday by dropping their insistence that all discussions to choose a 
leader be held among only top leaders of the eight parties. Instead, they 
agreed to allow party deputies to continue talks. The bid to end the deputies' 
discussions was designed to push Ozawa, deputy leader of the Renewal Party, out 
of the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 The new moves did nothing to remove the distrust and enmity that have been 
building in the coalition since January, when it achieved an assurance that 
political reforms would be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Political reform and opposition to the Liberal Democrats were the only common 
goals that brought together the entourage of leftist and conservative 
politicians last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura, head of the tiny 
New Party Harbinger, both repeated demands Tuesday that decision-making within 
the coalition must be "democratized." Their meaning: Curtail Ozawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, the leader of last June's revolt against the Liberal Democrats, 
infuriated coalition members in February when he persuaded Hosokawa to announce 
a plan to increase a 3% consumption tax to 7% three years from now to finance 
an immediate three-year, 20% income-tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Without consulting the Socialists and leaving even members of his Cabinet in 
the dark, Hosokawa made the announcement at one of his frequent 
middle-of-the-night news conferences. The next day, he was forced to rescind 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying anything about the possibility of his selection, Hata surprised 
fellow politicians by leaving today to attend a meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, 
at which a world trade agreement is to be signed. Hata will meet with U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and is expected to seek his agreement to 
resume U.S.-Japan "framework" talks. Hata is scheduled to return Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, as the coalition moved toward unity, the Liberal Democrats turned 
toward chaos. An announcement by Yohei Kono, the party's president, that he 
will run for prime minister spurred a group of 10 younger Liberal Democrats to 
threaten to leave the party.

BLUNT POLITICO, IDEALIST VIE TO DEFINE JAPAN'S FUTURE; POLITICS: THE 
CONSERVATIVE OZAWA AND THE LIBERAL TAKEMURA ARE CHIEF RIVALS IN THE CURRENT 
POWER STRUGGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One is a brilliant policy strategist and ace at brute-power politics who 
criticizes Japan's consensus decision-making as "collective irresponsibility." 
He says Japan must become a "normal nation" by ending its free ride on American 
security policies and by more actively cooperating with such global ventures as 
U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 For such views, Ichiro Ozawa of the Renewal Party is praised as a visionary 
and condemned as a dangerous autocrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is a liberal who rejects any role as a military or political giant. 
He says Japan should be a "small but shining nation" serving the world through 
ventures such as environmental cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Masayoshi Takemura, chief of the New Party Harbinger, is nicknamed Mumin Papa 
after a roly-poly creature in a Norwegian fairy tale; his kindly manner and 
consensus style may fit the Japanese character, but he is criticized as lacking 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 They differ in policy, personality and political style. But Ozawa and Takemura 
have now become focal points and chief rivals in the monumental power struggle 
shaking Japan. That struggle -- set off by the collapse last July of the 
Liberal Democratic Party's 38-year rule -- came into sharp relief after Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, 51, is de facto commander of the ruling coalition's conservative forces 
from the Renewal Party, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party and 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party, an alliance that totals 150 members. Takemura, 59, 
leads the 108 members of the liberal wing's New Party Harbinger, Socialists and 
Democratic Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 As the political world lurches toward a historic realignment, the two rivals 
represent the sharp choices Japan faces in deciding what role to play 
internationally in the post-Cold War world. "This is a war between a Japanese 
idealist, Takemura, and a Japanese realist, Ozawa," said political commentator 
Yoshimi Ishikawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men also display different attitudes toward two of Japan's hottest 
issues: North Korea and tax policy. Ozawa says North Korea has a nuclear bomb 
and Japan might be a target, all the more reason to prepare defenses. Takemura 
has remained conspicuously silent. He enjoys friendly relations with the 
Pyongyang regime, having forged fishing treaties as governor of Shiga 
prefecture south of Kyoto. He visited North Korea in 1990 with former LDP 
kingpin Shin Kanemaru. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa has advocated a 10% increase in the consumption tax to pay for a 50% cut 
in income and residence levies -- a bold plan that would probably offer a 
powerful economic stimulus. But Takemura has balked at raising the consumption 
tax and has advocated using deficit-financing bonds instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The two rivals have carried their war to bookstores, where Ozawa's 
best-selling policy tome has outsold Takemura's book more than 4 to 1, with 
670,000 copies sold. In his "Blueprint for a New Japan," Ozawa bluntly takes 
Japan to task for weak leadership, selfish economic development and slavery to 
the company; he offers explicit proposals for change, saying, "We continue to 
receive and not to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura, in his "A Small but Shining Nation," says such a path is a dangerous 
invitation to rearm. Japan, he says, should look for less provocative ways to 
contribute, such as devoting 0.5% of its annual gross national product -- about 
$20 billion -- to global environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than their policies, their differing political styles have drawn the 
sharpest attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are former LDP members but were groomed under radically different 
masters. Ozawa is a disciple of legendary political shogun Kakuei Tanaka, the 
former prime minister who honed to an art the corrupt system of money politics. 
Takemura is allied with Masaharu Gotoda, a godfather of the LDP liberal wing 
who accelerated the crackdown on corruption in the construction industry in 
1992 as justice minister under then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan's long tradition of political puppet and puppeteer, Ozawa works in 
the shadows, skillfully wielding power. He was said to be the mastermind behind 
the Hosokawa government and, over the years, has brokered agreements on such 
fractious issues as Japan's $13-billion contribution to the Persian Gulf War 
and trade compromises with the United States in areas including 
telecommunications and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 His brute effectiveness has won him ardent fans and virulent enemies. He is 
resented not only by Takemura but also by a majority of LDP members, who blame 
him for destroying the party's grasp on power by bolting with 35 members last 
year. As a result, he has become the lightning rod in the political turmoil, 
which is dividing along pro- and anti-Ozawa forces. 
</P>
<P>
 His shadowy style is coming under increasing attack. "In the Japan of today, 
politicians must take responsibility upfront for the power they wield," said 
Teruaki Nakano, a Tokyo advertising executive and admitted Takemura fan. 
</P>
<P>
 As criticism against him mounts, Ozawa -- a policy wonk and an intensely 
private leader -- made a startling appearance last week on an entertainment 
show catering to women. He smiled it up, lovingly talked about his pet birds 
and gamely endured a "fashion check" of his dark blue suits. He confessed that 
he calls his wife, Kazuko, "Mama" and sometimes lies to her. (He was so 
obedient to his mentor Tanaka that he married her on his advice, sight unseen.) 
</P>
<P>
 He said his life's greatest influence was his mother, a strict disciplinarian. 
He does not want his three sons to become politicians. He thinks about quitting 
at least half the time; his hero is a comic book character who enjoys total 
freedom as a masterless samurai. 
</P>
<P>
 The ladies loved him. "My image of you has really changed," one woman in the 
audience gushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura, meantime, enjoys a warm, fuzzy reputation as a conciliator. Even 
after leaving the LDP, he never burned his bridges. He employs a more 
traditional style of consensus building. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike Ozawa, Takemura operates in the open. He was the first governor in 
the nation to publicly disclose his assets when the Lockheed bribery scandal 
shook the country in 1976, and later wrote several political reform bills as a 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Takemura lacks the raw power to deliver the goods, analysts say. Nor does 
he possess the skill with politics and money that Ozawa learned from the 
master, Tanaka. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura and his pals "are utterly decent, genuine internationalists who don't 
have much power and are used as potted plants to decorate the rougher, tougher 
side of Japanese politics," said Chalmers Johnson, a University of California 
professor emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson noted that despite Ozawa's questionable tactics, he "does have the 
power to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura, raised by grandparents in Shiga after his farming mother died of 
overwork when he was 2, graduated from Tokyo University in economics in 1962. 
He married his wife, Chizuru, after meeting her at a dance party; they have two 
children. At 36, he became known as the "Bicycle Mayor" of his hometown of 
Yokaichi because he commuted to work by bike, and he distinguished himself for 
his anti-pollution policies as governor three years later. He was elected to 
the lower house of Parliament in July, 1986, and broke with the LDP in June, 
1993, when it failed to approve political reform, founding the New Party 
Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa was born in Iwate prefecture (state) in northern Japan. A graduate in 
economics of Keio University, he is the son of a politician and was elected to 
the lower house in 1969. He has held such posts as minister of home affairs and 
LDP secretary general. He left the LDP and established the Japan Renewal Party 
last year after the arrest on tax evasion charges of his political mentor, 
Kanemaru, threw the party into chaos.

AUTONOMY TALKS HALT ON EVE OF DEADLINE; MIDEAST: NEGOTIATORS SAY PACT BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND PLO IS WEEKS AWAY. SETTLER IS ACCUSED IN DEATH OF PREGNANT 
PALESTINIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the eve of the official deadline for a historic peace accord between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, negotiators in Cairo adjourned 
Tuesday, still weeks away from a final autonomy agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the killing continued in the occupied lands to which Israel and the 
PLO last September promised to bring peace through a plan for limited Israeli 
withdrawal and Palestinian autonomy by today. 
</P>
<P>
 There were encouraging statements from the delegations as they left for home 
Tuesday. They appeared to agree on the size of the Palestinian force that will 
police an autonomous Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho and on the 
weapons its members will wield. And they promised the return of up to 50 more 
Palestinian deportees in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the territories, there was more violence: A 36-year-old Jewish settler 
allegedly shot and killed a pregnant, 18-year-old Palestinian woman in her home 
in the occupied West Bank village of Al Jib near Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli soldiers destroyed the home of Dr. Mohammed Woheidi, a prominent 
supporter of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in the West Bank town of Ramallah. The 
Israeli army directed small arms fire and antitank missiles into the home and 
then finally bulldozed it in an unsuccessful operation to capture armed 
Palestinian extremists suspected of hiding there. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian sources said the operation continued into the night, with intense 
firefights reported in and around Ramallah. But Israel Television, which 
confirmed that the house had been demolished, reported there were no injuries 
in the initial siege, which had sealed off the entire town for more than 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Israeli military, which is on high alert to guard against 
vows by Palestinian Islamic extremists to attack during two important Israeli 
holidays today and Thursday, said he could not comment on the Ramallah 
operation. But he confirmed that soldiers fatally shot a Palestinian refugee, 
Awad Hassan Tafish, 23, in an unrelated incident; he is said to have stoned a 
military patrol at a camp near Ramallah. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Al Jib attack, three miles north of Jerusalem, Israeli police said they 
arrested the Israeli driver of a soft-drink delivery truck after he opened fire 
on a crowd of Palestinian stone-throwers, killing Fatma Khalifa as she was 
cleaning her house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and Palestinian witnesses said the driver, Natan Engelsman, a resident 
of the Jewish settlement of Shiloh, apparently fired repeatedly from his moving 
truck after it was stoned by Palestinian youths near Khalifa's roadside home. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop of Arab-Israeli violence, Israeli and PLO negotiators in 
Cairo said they did not expect final agreement on the long-delayed autonomy 
plan for Gaza and Jericho for at least several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing that Israel had agreed to permit the return of more deported 
Palestinians today or Thursday, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Shaath conceded that 
the embattled residents of the territories "really will not see their dreams 
fulfilled until we sign this agreement. And when we sign this agreement, within 
two weeks they will see everything we had hoped. . . . They will see the 
beginning of the end of occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 The two delegations announced a tentative agreement on the size and weaponry 
of the future Palestinian force that will police an autonomous Gaza and Jericho 
within weeks of a final autonomy agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two sides indicated that they remain far apart on key issues that will 
consume weeks more of negotiations when they return to bargaining on Sunday, 
after Israel's celebration of its Memorial Day today and Independence Day on 
Thursday and the Muslim and Jewish Sabbaths.

CREATIONIST TEACHING LEADS TO SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A part-time instructor at Wright State University was relieved of his teaching 
duties after students accused him of injecting religious views into a class on 
evolution, the school said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Scott, 43, of Springfield deviated from the course curriculum by 
expressing views of creationism, said university spokeswoman Lynette Heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was inserting his personal religious views into the course content after 
being asked not to," she said. "And his personal religious views were offensive 
to some students." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone messages left for Scott were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Creationism, a fundamentalist view of how life began, says God spontaneously 
created the Earth and life on it. Evolution says plants and animals originated 
from pre-existing organisms.

DOCTOR DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS HIT RECORD HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

</BYLINE>

<P>
 A record 3,081 doctors in the country were disciplined by state authorities 
last year but further efforts are needed to weed out incompetent or unfit 
physicians, officials of a national organization said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of disciplinary actions has increased 14% in four years, according 
to Dr. Hormoz Rassekh, president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, 
whose members include 67 state and territorial medical licensing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The encouraging part of this data is that we see overall continued activity 
in an upward movement," said Dr. James R. Winn, the federation's executive vice 
president. But he added: "We think more can be done and we intend to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Disciplinary actions rose in California as well, although the Medical Board of 
California disagreed with the federation's figures for the state. According to 
the federation, California officials took action in 280 cases last year. But 
Dixon Arnett, executive director of the state board, said that the actual 
number was 367 -- an increase from 202 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers differ because the state counts certain actions, such as temporary 
restraining orders and interim suspensions, that the federation does not 
include, Arnett said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuring high quality medical care has become a clarion call in the health 
care reform debate in part because the White House has embraced it as an 
abiding principle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development Tuesday, union officials announced that the labor 
movement has begun an aggressive grass-roots lobbying effort to persuade 
undecided Democratic members of the House to support President Clinton's health 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-time staff members of various unions have been dispatched to 32 
congressional districts to coordinate volunteers on behalf of the legislation, 
said Gerald Shea, who heads the AFL-CIO's health care efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference earlier Tuesday, union officials released a study 
claiming that working families could lose as much as $128 billion over the next 
six years if a tax is placed on employer health benefits to help finance health 
care reform. The tax would be passed along to workers, forcing them to dip into 
their pockets to maintain coverage, according to the study, which was conducted 
by the Lewin-VHI research firm for the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax on benefits is included in a health care reform package 
sponsored by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) that is being advanced as an alternative 
to the Clinton health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary actions against doctors cited by the federation cover a range 
of punishments, including the most serious steps -- revocation or suspension of 
licenses to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Winn said that the federation hopes to encourage greater funding for state 
boards to speed up disciplinary proceedings. Currently, an average of 37 weeks 
passes between the receipt of a complaint and disposition of a case, said 
Gerald J. Bechamps, a Winchester, Va., physician and incoming federation 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over quality also has been fanned by the growth of managed care 
networks, which many believe is not always consistent with the delivery of the 
best quality care. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations announced Tuesday that it has launched a major new program to 
provide public evaluations of medical provider networks. Hospitals, insurance 
companies and doctors are rapidly forming combined service networks.

U.S. WARNS MUSLIMS AGAINST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF STRIKES; BALKANS: AMERICA MUST 
PERSUADE SERBS TO END GORAZDE SIEGE WITHOUT ENCOURAGING THEIR FOES TO INTENSIFY 
BID FOR LOST LAND. 
</P>

 President Clinton on Tuesday warned Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina against 
trying to take advantage of the allied air strikes outside the city of Gorazde 
by intensifying their fight against the Bosnian Serbs, saying both sides must 
now go back to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cautioned the Bosnian government forces not to try to take advantage 
of this and violate the understandings themselves," Clinton told reporters 
here. The State Department issued a similar statement later, urging all sides 
to resume negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The President made his remarks in response to earlier reports that the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government had resumed its shelling of the Bosnian Serbs -- 
apparently to provoke them into firing their artillery and thus risking further 
NATO air strikes. Serbian batteries were quiet Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual American warning to the Bosnian government reflected a major 
dilemma in the Clinton Administration's current strategy: how to persuade the 
Serbs to end their siege of the mostly Muslim city of Gorazde without 
simultaneously encouraging their foes to step up their bid to regain lost 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton left open the possibility that the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization might broaden its air attacks to the five other U.N. "safe 
haven" cities besides Gorazde, where the last two days' air strikes have taken 
place. "I wouldn't rule anything out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, had suggested 
Monday that the model used by NATO in Gorazde could be applied to the other 
U.N. safe zones as well. At the least, she said, it should "be seen as a signal 
for the other safe havens." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials indicated that the Administration still is split over whether 
the arrangement used in Gorazde should be extended to other cities. Although 
the State Department has been willing to widen the military operation in 
Bosnia, the Pentagon has been opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how serious a problem the Bosnian government's new 
aggressiveness ultimately will prove to be for the peace process, or whether 
Bosnian Serb gunners will remain silent today or resume shelling, as their 
leaders threatened during Tuesday's hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 George Kenney, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 
said that the dilemma posed by the Bosnian government is "potentially a really 
serious problem," particularly since Washington has refused to spell out what 
terms it wants the Muslims to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not enough to say, 'Let's go back to the table,' " Kenney said in a 
telephone interview. "If we're serious about an outcome, we'll have to tell 
everyone involved that we want them to accept something they don't like. And 
that includes the Muslims as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the Administration continued to try to smooth over 
earlier protests by the Russians that they had not been consulted before NATO 
launched its air strikes on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he was "very encouraged" that the Russians had resumed pressing 
the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. He said he had assured Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin that Washington has no interest in using NATO's air 
power to affect the outcome of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
spoke by telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev on Tuesday 
to make a similar point. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin himself once again stopped short of condemning the NATO air strikes -- 
though he did say, on a visit to Spain on Tuesday, that the air action may have 
dampened Moscow's enthusiasm for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the bristling in Moscow continued, as Russian lawmakers denounced the 
air strikes and the Foreign Ministry said that Russia "will never put up with 
the role of a so-called junior partner who is informed only after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that the issue might well heat up in Russia today when the Duma, 
the lower house of Parliament, is expected to discuss the situation. Some 
factions already have drawn up a draft resolution accusing the United States of 
fanning the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the White House won bipartisan backing for its current 
policy in Bosnia as congressional leaders of both parties -- summoned by 
Clinton for a private briefing -- told reporters that they support the U.S. 
actions there. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House minority whip, said that there is 
"overwhelming support" for using U.S.-led air strikes to support U.N. ground 
forces around Gorazde if the Bosnian Serbs continue to shell the city in the 
face of international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) echoed Clinton's warning to 
the Bosnian government, saying that he hopes it "would not be provoking these 
incidents that we hear about." He said American policy in the region is to 
press both sides to resume peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said Tuesday that more reports showed only one explosion from the 
four conventional, 500-pound Mark-82 gravity bombs that U.S. Marine F/A-18 
warplanes targeted on Bosnian Serb forces Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen deLaski, Defense Department spokeswoman, said two of the bombs did 
not go off when they hit the ground and a third jammed on the wing-carriage of 
one of the jets and could not be released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon had said previously the raid destroyed a tank and several armored 
vehicles. It said Tuesday no tank had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said such problems with bombs can occur. But deLaski said that 
authorities are examining the bombs stored at Aviano, Italy, where the F/A-18s 
are based, to be sure they are in order. Bombs released in a similar raid on 
Sunday all exploded.

REMAINS OF 9 MORE MIAS SENT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. military Tuesday sent home nine more sets of remains believed to be 
those of servicemen killed in the Vietnam War and said Vietnamese cooperation 
in the search for American war dead has improved since the economic embargo was 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine wooden boxes of fragments -- five discovered by joint U.S.-Vietnamese 
search teams at crash and burial sites and four handed in by Vietnamese 
villagers -- were placed in metal caskets and loaded onto a U.S. Air Force 
C-141 transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains were flown to Hawaii, where military forensic and dental experts 
will try to make positive identifications. 
</P>
<P>
 They were turned up by eight teams that investigated more than 60 MIA cases 
and excavated 12 burial or crash sites during a search that ended March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The search was the first since President Clinton lifted the 30-year-old U.S. 
economic embargo against Hanoi in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said when he lifted the embargo that the action was the best way to 
help resolve the fate of 2,238 servicemen, mostly airmen, still listed as 
missing in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
 But some opponents of the move feared the Vietnamese would stop cooperating in 
the MIA search effort once the embargo was lifted.

PROSECUTORS WON'T FILE CHARGES AGAINST MAN IN DAUGHTER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors have declined to file charges against a Santa Ana man arrested in 
connection with the death of his 6-month-old daughter, but the case remains 
under investigation, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction worker Ruperto Ramirez, 28, a father of five, was arrested 
Thursday on homicide charges after paramedics were called to his house at 4 
a.m. because his daughter Cathy Licet Ramirez had stopped breathing, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl died at UCI Medical Center in Orange, apparently after 
suffering severe blows to the stomach, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde Von Der Ahe said Tuesday that he reviewed and 
rejected the case for filing, but said he could not discuss the reasons because 
of the ongoing investigation. Police say they are not dropping the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're searching for additional information on Ramirez to take to the district 
attorney's office," said police Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez remains in custody at the Orange County Men's Jail on an unrelated 
probation violation, authorities said.

POLICE LOOKING FOR BRAIN-INJURED MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are searching for a 57-year-old, brain-injured man who walked away from 
a Laguna Hills board and care facility Sunday night. The man, John K. Sorensen, 
was injured in a 1991 auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen is 6-foot-1, weighs about 180 pounds and walks with a limp, according 
to Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. He has blue eyes 
and gray hair, worn in a crew cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen has no money or identification and was last seen wearing jeans, a 
short-sleeved checkered polo shirt, a white or blue sweat shirt and white 
athletic shoes, Martini said. He is a quiet man who has trouble answering 
complex questions, but will probably respond if asked if his name is John 
Sorensen.

ASSEMBLY DRIVER PUT ON PAID LEAVE DURING DRUG INQUIRY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly driver arrested in a state car on drug charges last week in Los 
Angeles is on paid administrative leave while the matter is investigated, 
Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Thompson, who has worked for the Assembly as a sergeant-at-arms for 
more than 20 years, was arrested Friday night with another man on suspicion of 
possessing cocaine for sale in Encino, according to the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes as a great shock that someone who has worked for us for more than 20 
years would be near the activity reported by the press and would be that late 
at night in a state car in an area nowhere near state activities," Brown (D-San 
Francisco) said at a Capitol news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the matter is being investigated by the Assembly Rules Committee, 
which oversees the sergeants. The investigation will probably be finished by 
the end of the week, he added. Sergeants keep order in the Legislature and do a 
variety of jobs for lawmakers that include driving, messages and errands. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Thompson is one of three sergeants permanently stationed in Los 
Angeles to drive legislators to and from the airport and legislative meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was released on $10,000 bail and ordered to appear in court May 4.

FRISK FOR GUNS AT HOUSING PROJECTS, PANEL URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic response to concerns about crime, an Administration task force 
will propose to President Clinton more aggressive frisking of people suspected 
of carrying weapons in and around public housing projects, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The call for police to stop and frisk more people in streets and other common 
areas is a central element of an Administration plan to increase security in 
public housing projects. The review was prompted by a federal district court 
decision last week barring the Chicago Housing Authority from conducting 
warrantless searches for guns and drugs in the city's crime-ridden public 
housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to present the plan to Clinton today. If the President is 
satisfied with the recommendations, he may announce the new policy as soon as 
Thursday, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 These new measures, though, may provoke almost as much controversy as the 
program they are intended to replace. Officials at the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Illinois, which brought the suit that barred the warrantless sweeps in 
Chicago, suggested Tuesday night that a policy of intensified frisking might 
prompt another lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to expand the use of frisking "would raise grave concerns among civil 
libertarians," said Harvey Grossman, legal director for the Illinois ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's decision, U.S. District Court Judge Wayne R. Anderson ruled 
that warrantless searches conducted without "probable cause" violate the Fourth 
Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. Within hours, 
Clinton ordered Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros "to develop promptly a search policy for public 
housing that is both constitutionally permissible and effective." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at HUD and the Justice Department have concluded that the 
Chicago Housing Authority policy of sweeping buildings without warrants cannot 
be restructured in a manner that will pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they believe that Anderson's decision leaves room for housing 
authorities to pursue other forms of searches in common areas, vacant 
apartments and apartments where residents have consented. In addition, 
Administration officials believe that the decision could allow police to sweep 
more limited sections of a building after a crime -- for instance, if they see 
a shot being fired from a window but cannot identify the specific apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the searches, the two departments will urge a major effort to renovate 
and find occupants for vacant apartments, which are often used by drug dealers. 
They will also encourage the targeting of funds from pending crime legislation 
for recreational and social programs for housing project residents, 
particularly teen-agers, and call for aid to help housing authority police in 
Chicago acquire more metal detectors and hire more officers. But officials 
cautioned that the Administration still has not found the money to augment the 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial idea in the package being prepared for the President 
will be the call for greater use of frisking of individuals suspected of 
carrying weapons. In contrast to the warrantless searches, officials stressed, 
the frisking policy would be applied only in common areas of the projects, not 
in residents' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have been very strict in interpreting searches of the home but 
more lenient in allowing frisking for reasonable suspicion" in public areas, 
one senior Administration official said.

INJECTION THAT KILLED MAN ILLUSTRATES HEALTH DILEMMA; MEDICINE: THE DEATH 
UNDERSCORES A GROWING PROBLEM FOR IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD 
INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Choking back tears, Carlos Sandoval said he knew something was horribly wrong 
when his mother's patient fell into convulsions after an injection for a sore 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the woman -- Refugio Sandoval -- could do little more than 
pray, he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had treated scores of patients for illnesses over the past two 
years in her Reseda home, Sandoval -- who is being sought by police -- had no 
training or license to practice medicine in the U. S. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the death Sunday of 22-year-old Jesus Nicholas Anchondo in 
Sandoval's home underscores a growing problem among immigrants and the working 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who cannot afford to buy health insurance or to spend a workday waiting 
for treatment at a low-cost clinic are seeking help from unlicensed, untrained 
medical practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Those providing such services range from the local folk healers, such as 
Sandoval, to swap-meet vendors prescribing brand-name antibiotics smuggled from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a matter of economics," said Prosy Abarquez-Delacruz, local 
administrator for the state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some of it is cultural. A lot of people come from countries where the 
primary health-care practitioner was the local pharmacist, who would give 
injections on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is understandable, Abarquez-Delacruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a lot of uninsured patients who have no access to proper medical care . 
. . they will seek alternatives that are within their reach," she said. "But it 
can be deadly." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the illegal prescription and sale of restricted drugs has 
become a widespread problem among Latinos and Asian immigrants in California, 
many of whom come from villages where the practice of medicine follows 
different standards and customs. 
</P>
<P>
 State inspectors have identified more than 700 products being sold illegally 
at swap meets, bakeries and butcher shops. 
</P>
<P>
 They include cures for pain, colds, heart conditions, insomnia, arthritis, 
anemia and kidney infections, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police found what looked like a pharmacy stockpile of drugs in 
Sandoval's home, including many that appear to have been manufactured in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 They have recovered the substance used to inject Anchondo, but would not say 
what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Anchondo, who grew up in Pacoima, sought the help of the woman 
largely because it was affordable and convenient, reasons that authorities say 
account for the growing illegal trade in prescription drugs and unlicensed 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 But enforcement of laws controlling the sale of drugs and the practice of 
medicine falls to different jurisdictions, prompting the practice to go largely 
unpunished, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California has the power to revoke the license of bona 
fide physicians, while county district attorneys are responsible for 
prosecuting those practicing medicine without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 The food and drug branch of the state Department of Health Services is 
responsible for halting the illegal sales of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles regional director Abarquez-Delacruz said she can spare only 
one or two agents to perform the work in an area that reaches from the Mexican 
border to San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Berchem, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn., said the 
problem is largely one of enforcement, with little that the firms can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian Kelberg, head of the division that 
prosecutes those practicing medicine without a license, believes that the 
practice is widespread in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows of only one prosecution involving a so-called curandero, or folk 
healer, in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, an ailing infant died after being given an injection of aspirin 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts were never able to determine the exact cause of death or if the 
curandero's actions contributed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Malnutrition was also suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, no charges were filed, Kelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution is also hampered because customers are seldom willing to report 
the practice to authorities, especially if they were cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they were not, some may fear deportation if they tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, cases are reported to police only after a person dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People rarely want to come forward," said Mike Bryan, supervising 
investigator for the Medical Board of California in the agency's Woodland Hills 
office. "I suspect they are afraid of the system and concerned with being taken 
out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who served on a multi-agency task force 
looking at the issue until 1992, said drug manufacturers and the government 
need to warn people of the dangers of seeking medical care and drugs from 
untrained practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go into neighborhoods where English is not spoken and explain to 
people there are better ways to get health care besides going to the corner and 
getting a needle stuck in your arm by someone who doesn't know what they are 
doing," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physician Maria Ortiz, of the Northeast Valley Health Corp., a federally 
subsidized clinic serving a predominantly poor, Latino clientele, said it is 
common to hear Spanish-speaking patients talk about buying prescription drugs 
at local swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northeast Valley center's medical director, Dr. Richard Seidman, said he 
recently treated an 18-month-old boy for lead poisoning contracted when his 
parents administered one of two popular Mexican folk remedies for stomach 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The normal lead level is 10 (micrograms per deciliter of blood). This kid's 
lead level was 48 . . . He probably got a teaspoon of that stuff in a cup of 
tea," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, it is a cheaper and more familiar cure. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, especially in rural areas where there are few physicians, residents 
have learned to depend on curanderos as well as pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who kind of make a living out of injecting other people," 
said Miguel Escobar, a spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have (an ailment) on a very minor level or you feel down with the 
flu, you can go to whatever friend or an old lady who makes her living giving 
injections to get a shot. That's a common practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Refugio Sandoval's son said Tuesday that his mother had studied medicine in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was only trying to help people," said Carlos Sandoval, the youngest of 
Sandoval's seven sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was scared. She didn't want it to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his mother worked as a nurse to those who were too poor to afford 
traditional medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, crowded entryway of the family home served as a waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients needing privacy were seen in her bedroom, which was furnished with a 
white daybed and a white dresser that served as a medicine cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Sandoval said he was sitting at the family's dining table when he heard 
Anchondo's wife scream. 
</P>
<P>
 He jumped up from his seat and saw the man in convulsions on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his brothers called 911 and an ambulance arrived. An hour later, 
Anchondo was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Sandoval was well-known for her treatments, dispensing 
penicillin to cure colds, even treating a man for a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Carbajal, 28, of Reseda said that even on Monday, the day after the 
death was widely reported, as many as six cars stopped by the Sandoval home 
within half an hour with families seeking treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview Tuesday in the Sandoval home, the telephone rang several 
times, all patients calling for medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just saying forget about her," her son said.

ROBERTI RECALL EFFORT FAILING IN EARLY TALLIES; POLITICS: THE STATE SENATOR 
CLAIMS THE DRIVE IS AN ACT OF REVENGE BY THE GUN LOBBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In early election returns Tuesday, State Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) was 
leading by a 2 to 1 margin in his effort to survive a recall drive that has 
been closely watched nationally as a referendum on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, the first state politician in 80 years to face a recall, has claimed 
that the effort to oust him is the work of the gun lobby seeking revenge 
because of his support for a 1989 law banning military-style semiautomatic 
rifles, known as assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 All five of the candidates seeking to replace Roberti if the recall succeeded 
avidly championed the 2nd Amendment, the section of the U.S. Constitution that 
guarantees citizens the right to bear arms, and gun-control foes pumped 
thousands of dollars into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 At his election night party at an Italian restaurant in Sun Valley, Roberti, 
54, said he was optimistic he would win a victory big enough to persuade 
elected officials nationwide that they need not be intimidated by the gun 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very, very good about it," Roberti said. "They're going to know you 
can't shoot at us without getting fire back." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his opponents were Randy Linkmeyer, a Canoga Park gun store owner; and 
Al Dib, a retired green grocer who advocated the repeal of statutes that outlaw 
machine guns and make it illegal to carry concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity, proponents of the recall 
acknowledged that they owed a huge debt of gratitude to gun owners. But they 
also insisted that their movement was not a captive of gun interests and that 
their gripe with Roberti stemmed from a critique of the senator's 27 years in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This recall is about taking government away from the politicians and the 
political machines who abuse the electoral system," said Bill Dominguez, a Van 
Nuys systems analyst and a leader of the recall movement at an election party 
at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominguez inadvertently handed Roberti a public relations coup during the 
campaign when he had 15 guns stolen from his home -- this as the recall 
supporters were insisting that the recall election was not about guns but about 
good government. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall measure qualified for the ballot after more than 20,000 registered 
voters from Roberti's district signed petitions accusing Roberti of malfeasance 
in office and demanding that a recall election be held. Roberti initially 
planned to retire from politics, but declaring that he would not be forced out, 
decided to run for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides demonizing his foes as "assault weapons extremists," Roberti's other 
favorite campaign tactic was to charge that the recall was a waste of taxpayer 
money. According to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder, the cost of the 
special election will run at least $800,000. With local government reeling from 
the impact of the recession and the Jan. 17 earthquake, Roberti charged that 
the extra cost of the election was exorbitant, especially because term limits 
were going to force him to leave office anyway in December. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary election to pick Roberti's successor in December will be held June 
7. All the candidates who ran in Tuesday's recall election to unseat Roberti 
are running in the primary, as well as other candidates. State Sen. Herschel 
Rosenthal is among those seeking the Democratic nomination. Rosenthal, 75, lost 
his West Side seat due to reapportionment and has moved into Studio City as 
part of his bid to shift his political base to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final hours, the recall campaign turned into a battle between the 
National Rifle Assn. and Handgun Control Inc., the leading adversaries in the 
nation's ongoing gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA pumped nearly $50,000 into the race to pay for a five-day-long 
phone-bank operation while HCI poured money of its own into the race to pay for 
last-minute radio advertising. But perhaps more importantly, HCI loaned Roberti 
the support of its leader Sarah Brady, the celebrated gun control advocate. 
Brady, the wife of former White House press secretary James Brady, who was 
severely injured in the 1981 assassination attempt against President Reagan, 
was the key draw at a fund-raiser for Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll taken in late March found that two-thirds of the voters in 
Roberti's district supported stronger gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roberti showed up to vote at 1 p.m. in Van Nuys, he was confronted by 
Tanya Metaksa, executive director of the NRA's Washington, D.C.-based 
legislative arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Metaksa intended to berate Roberti as a soft-on-crime liberal. Instead, she 
found the senator prepared to deal with her with a public relations gambit of 
his own. Accompanying the senator was Michelle Scully, who was wounded less 
than a year ago when Gian Luigi Ferri opened fire on office workers in a San 
Francisco high-rise with .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol that was a copycat of 
one of the assault weapons banned by Roberti in 1989. Scully's husband, John, 
was killed in the same attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After Metaksa squeezed in close enough to identify herself, Roberti pointed to 
Scully and said, "Here, talk to Michelle! Her husband was killed and somehow 
she survived. Talk to victims of your kind of weapons!" Roberti then shoved his 
way through the camera crews to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Roberti was able to defuse charges that he was soft on 
crime by winning the support of Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams, two 
other former city police chiefs, including Ed Davis, and the endorsements of 
numerous law enforcement organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of Roberti's incumbency was evident Tuesday as Sacramento lawmakers, 
led by Roberti's successor as president pro tempore of the Senate, Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward), converged on Van Nuys to help their embattled colleague 
with his get-out-the-vote drive. Joining this elite crowd of precinct workers 
were labor union and church activists who have had long relationships with the 
liberal Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall supporters alleged that Roberti had during his 27 years in the state 
Legislature at the very least tolerated a culture of political corruption that 
resulted in criminal charges and prison terms for three Sacramento legislators, 
including former state senator Alan Robbins of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't know about the corruption he was incompetent, if he did he was 
corrupt himself," said real estate broker Dolores White, one of five candidates 
who ran to replace Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the recall proponents argued, Roberti was a carpetbagger (in fact, 
Roberti lives in Los Feliz, well outside the 20th District) who has championed 
ineffective gun control laws instead of laws to get tough on criminals. Here, 
they pointed to the fact that Roberti is philosophically opposed to the death 
penalty and had praised former California Supreme Court chief justice Rose 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall movement was able to score the endorsement of the California 
Republican Party. But even this fizzled when the party's leading figures, 
including Pete Wilson, shied away from recall. 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled senator also benefited from the political gaffes of his foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the start-up of the election, Roberti's opponents fell into a 
credibility gap after the gun theft from Dominguez's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, recall proponents tumbled into another public relations fiasco after it 
was disclosed that one of their constituent groups, Californians Against 
Corruption, was holding a raffle to raise money for the recall -- with guns, 
including a semiautomatic rifle, among the prizes. Russ Howard, leader of the 
group, even admitted later that the raffle was poorly timed. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates in the race included Dolores White, 59, a real estate 
broker who is making her second bid to knock out Roberti and win his seat. In 
1991, when Roberti first ran for the Valley-based 20th District seat, White was 
one of nine who challenged him. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidate in Tuesday's race was Larry Martz, 51, chairman of the 
American Pistol and Rifle Assn.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; BURBANK SCHOOL BOND TRAILS IN EARLY RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $100-million bond referendum to rebuild Burbank public schools appeared to 
be failing in early returns Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 With the absentee ballots counted, the referendum was receiving less than the 
two-thirds majority it needed to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank school board, with the backing of the city, major employers and 
parent groups, pitched the $100-million bond referendum to voters, explaining 
that rebuilding the schools would cost the average homeowner a little more than 
$33 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing days before the election, the bond campaign swung into high 
gear, with two phone banks totaling about 80 volunteers calling to make sure 
that voters who supported the bond went to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident that we've done as much as we could have done," board 
President Elena Hubbell said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who oppose the bond referendum criticize the figures drawn up by the 
district's financial experts and say that the $33-per-year cost on a home worth 
$101,000 -- the average property value in Burbank -- is based on overly 
optimistic assumptions of how much property values will grow and could cost 
taxpayers far more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the campaign is Burbank High School, a cramped and 
haphazardly built facility with some buildings that date back to the 1920s. The 
school needs to be rebuilt because of a poor design that gives few options to 
expand to accommodate overcrowding, and because of a deterioration faced by all 
the schools in the district, school officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burroughs High School, also dating back to the 1920s, would undergo major 
renovations, and every other school in the Burbank Unified School District 
would be upgraded and modernized if the bond referendum passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools have such problems as leaking roofs, falling tiles, poor lighting 
and sewage backup. Many classrooms have no air-conditioning and sometimes 
become so hot that computers shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board and district have put together a $138-million plan to rebuild 
the schools, with $100 million coming from the bond referendum, another $23 
million donated by the city of Burbank and $15 million coming in state aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school board voted to go ahead with the bond referendum because the 
$33-per-year cost for the average homeowner fit with the results of a survey 
taken in June that showed that nearly two-thirds of voters -- the majority 
needed to pass a bond referendum -- would support rebuilding of schools if it 
did not cost them more than $39 a year in extra taxes. 
</P>

 In other Los Angeles County voting, early returns showed Long Beach Mayor 
Ernie Kell struggling for reelection in one of 50 local elections Tuesday, 
contests in which voters were weighing in on everything from school bonds and 
smoking bans to potentially historic reconfigurations of city councils. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Hollywood, there was the potential for the first gay majority on the 
council since 1986, but early returns cast doubt on that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, there were numerous opportunities for ethnic groups 
to attain or increase political power. But in one case, Monterey Park, final 
unofficial returns showed that voters decided not to make their city the first 
in California to have an Asian American majority on its council. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's elections loomed significant because of what the results could 
say about the city's direction and because of the latest debate on smoking in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the city's top post, Kell, 65, was bidding to remain the only 
mayor Long Beach has known since voters began electing their top official in 
1988. However, with about 20% of the vote counted late Tuesday, Kell was 
running fifth in a field of 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had six good years. It's not the end of the world if we don't win," he 
told a supporter as the early returns were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell's well-financed challengers -- those raising more than $100,000 -- were 
council members Ray Grabinski and Jeffrey A. Kellogg; former Long Beach City 
College President Beverly O'Neill; redevelopment board member Don Westerland 
and Belmont Shore businessman Frank Colonna. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate won more than 50% of the vote, which given initial returns 
seemed almost certain, the two top finishers will meet in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the campaign centered on the need to stem crime, create jobs, unite 
the city's increasingly diverse neighborhoods and establish an international 
image for the city, which has seen its economy tumble as the Navy and defense 
contractors have scaled back or closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Long Beach elections, two Latinas were making strong bids to become 
the council's first Latino members. In the 1st District, Jenny Oropeza, the 
first Latino elected to the Long Beach school board, waged a well-financed 
effort. In the 7th District, Tonia Reyes Uranga was considered a leading 
contender to succeed Grabinski, who is giving up his council seat to run for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3rd District, incumbent Douglas S. Drummond faced three challengers, 
two of whom decided to run after Drummond made anti-gay remarks during a 
conservative forum last fall. Drummond said gays did not concern him because 
they were dying from AIDS, and he supported Cuba's policy of quarantining 
people with the disease. Drummond later voted with the council majority to 
censure himself and offered an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Drumond took an early lead in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the mayor's contest, the two top finishers in each council race will 
meet in a runoff if no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach voters also were deciding whether to ban smoking in all businesses 
used by the public, except in patio restaurant areas and in bars where up to a 
third of the seating could be set aside for smokers. Very early returns showed 
Measure K winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the measure has received little attention in a city where wars 
over proposed smoking bans have generated big news in years past. The council 
backed down from a 1991 ordinance to outlaw smoking in restaurants after a 
petition drive financed by the tobacco industry collected enough signatures to 
put the issue on the ballot. Last July, the council passed a less sweeping 
ordinance. Once again, a coalition of smoking interests launched a petition 
drive. So council members, all nonsmokers, decided to put the issue before 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Lomita, voters ousted council incumbents Robert Hargrave, Peter J. 
Rossick and Chuck Taylor.

POLICE WILL ASK MEXICO TO PROSECUTE WOMAN OVER LETHAL INJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday that they believe a Reseda woman suspected of killing a 
patient by giving him an injection while illegally practicing medicine in her 
house has fled to Mexico, and that they will ask the Mexican government to 
prosecute her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't imagine that she's going to come back. So, I guess we will" contact 
the Mexican authorities, said Los Angeles Police Detective Joel Price. "The 
Mexican government doesn't like to give us people back." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said despite concerns that local and state authorities in Mexico 
sometimes drag their feet in criminal cases, the Los Angeles Police Department 
will seek the involvement of Mexico's federal police and prosecutors. They are 
seeking Refugio Sandoval, 60, on suspicion of manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are dealing with the (Mexican) state or local government, you are at 
their whim," said Price, a West Valley Division homicide detective who is 
heading the dragnet for Sandoval. "But the federal government actively 
prosecutes these cases. They will go get people and bring them to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval fled from her Hesperia Avenue home Sunday after Jesus Nicolas 
Anchondo, 22, went into convulsions after she gave him an injection for 
flu-like symptoms. He was pronounced dead at noon -- an hour after being taken 
by paramedics to Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of death, but a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office said it could be weeks 
before the results are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have said Sandoval had a house full of medications and was practicing 
medicine without a license. In her home, they found chairs lined up as if they 
were in a waiting room, and hundreds of different vials, bottles and boxes of 
medicines and medications, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval appeared to have gotten at least some of her medications in Tijuana, 
and she was providing significant medical care to a steady clientele through 
word of mouth, police said. Unlicensed medical practitioners known as 
curanderas , or healers, cater to low-income clients in many immigrant 
communities, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said police will probably transcribe all their reports into Spanish and 
give them to Mexican prosecutors, who would then decide whether to file 
criminal charges, issue a warrant and arrest Sandoval. He said he didn't know 
exactly where she was, but that several anonymous callers had said she had fled 
to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchondo had gone with his mother and common-law wife to see Sandoval after he 
began complaining of a fever, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. His 
mother told police that she had been seeing Sandoval for health problems for as 
long as five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, practicing medicine without a license is a misdemeanor, but the 
charge can be pursued as a felony if harm occurs, authorities said.

COMMENTARY; KINGS LOSING LAST JEWEL FROM THE TRIPLE CROWN; HOCKEY: DAVE TAYLOR, 
SIDELINED SINCE JAN. 4, WILL MAKE FINAL APPEARANCE THURSDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Taylor sat in the Kings' dressing room one day at practice and watched 
the trainers distribute equipment. He kept watching and waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, everyone had skates except Taylor. Somehow, his were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Something like that would normally cause a full-scale gripe session. Some 
hockey players consider it a crisis if the edges of their blades aren't sharp 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody else on the team would have made a big deal of it and then acted up," 
left wing Luc Robitaille said of Taylor's missing skates. "They would have made 
it a big thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said nothing. The only players aware of the situation were Robitaille 
and Tony Granato, who were sitting near him. Taylor quietly got an extra pair 
of skates from a teammate and reported for work as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way he was grew up in Levack, Ontario, the son of a miner and a 
post-office worker. Do your job and never complain. And he always maintained 
that ethic and sense of dignity through his 17 seasons with the Kings, an oasis 
of reason in an often chaotic organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings lost some class on the ice and in the dressing room when Taylor, 38, 
officially retired Tuesday, announcing his decision at a Forum news conference. 
He surprised no one because he had been sidelined since Jan. 4, when he 
suffered a mild concussion in a collision with teammate Warren Rychel. 
</P>
<P>
 Head injuries have plagued Taylor the last few seasons and he retired because 
he could not risk another one. He played his customary right wing position in 
January's All-Star game -- played quite well, in fact -- but was plagued by 
headaches and dizziness whenever he tried to increase his exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough day," said Taylor, who acknowledged being nervous before the 
news conference. "I've wrestled with this ever since I was injured this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Taylor will make one last appearance on the Forum's ice, taking the 
opening faceoff in the Kings' season finale against the Edmonton Oilers. After 
the faceoff, the game will be stopped and the puck will be given to Taylor. He 
won't return to the game, but will be credited with the 1,111th appearance of 
his NHL career. The Kings will retire his jersey, No. 18, on opening night next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Barry Melrose: "I think our troubles began when Dave left the 
lineup. Looking back, if this guy's in the lineup, I think it is a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're seeing one of the greatest players in league history leaving 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much doubt about that. Taylor retires as the No. 2 King scorer 
with 1,069 points, including 431 goals. He has spent his entire career with the 
same team, a rarity in professional sports. Only Bill Russell, who played for 
the Dodgers for 18 years, and Jackie Slater, who completed his 19th season with 
the Rams, have played more seasons for a major professional sports franchise in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was one of the few bright lights when the outlook for the King 
franchise was dim. He played on the Triple Crown line with Marcel Dionne and 
Charlie Simmer, which scored 146 goals in the 1979-80 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer, now a broadcaster with the Mighty Ducks, was at the news conference 
and recalled the formation of the line and his friendship with Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was able to adjust each season," Simmer said. "He went from being one of 
the premier scorers in the league to a different style than was expected from 
him. He became one of the best checkers. That takes talent. He was able to 
master both offense and defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor went from a kid who was the Kings' 15th-round selection -- 210th 
overall -- in the 1975 NHL entry draft to a future Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was drafted in the 15th round," Robitaille said. "It was so long ago, 
those rounds don't even exist now." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor overcame a severe stuttering problem the same way he faced everything 
else, refusing to take any shortcuts.

 "It was very difficult for me," Taylor said. "I used to stutter from when I 
was 4 years old. I used to hide from my problem. I learned to be more open and 
I faced my fear." 
</P>
<P>
 The nerves returned for a few minutes when he announced his retirement. But 
the tension was eased when King owner Bruce McNall told a few jokes. Taylor 
said he would like to remain with the team in some capacity and it appears to 
be mutual on the part of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 17 years, I've been a player, and I know that side of it pretty well," 
said Taylor, who played for 11 coaches. "I'm open for discussion with the 
Kings. We're going to have some talks." Dave Taylor With the Kings

ASBURY TO WAVE GOODBY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PEPPERDINE COACH ACCEPTS JOB AT 
KANSAS STATE AFTER HIS TEAM GOES 19-11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From Malibu to Manhattan -- Manhattan, Kan., that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Asbury, having previously been offered several coaching jobs, finally 
accepted one Tuesday, leaving Pepperdine to head the men's basketball program 
at Kansas State of the Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a great situation," Asbury said. "The Big Eight 
presents great challenges. The school has great administrative leadership, and 
great facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury, 48, succeeds Dana Altman, a Nebraska native who resigned two weeks ago 
to coach at Creighton in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom has a presence about him that captures your attention right away," said 
Max Urich, Kansas State's athletic director. "He has terrific values, work 
habits and technical knowledge of the game. Exceeding all that is his 
communication skills." 
</P>
<P>
 After succeeding Jim Harrick as Pepperdine's coach in 1988, Asbury guided the 
Waves to a 125-59 mark in six seasons. He has led the team to three NCAA 
tournaments berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Waves were 19-11 and took Michigan to overtime before losing 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm getting to an age when it's time to move on," Asbury said. "I've 
taken this program -- I don't want to say as far as I can -- to a level where 
we have really done well. I don't know how much more I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury was offered the Kansas State job during his visit to the school Sunday. 
He delayed making his decision until Tuesday because Iowa State Coach Johnny 
Orr is expected to announce his retirement and the Cyclones had made overtures 
to Asbury. When Orr did not announce his retirement Tuesday, Asbury accepted 
Kansas State's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to make any snap decisions," he said. "I looked at the Iowa 
State job, but it wasn't really open. They said they would contact me if it 
(opened). It's been a slow year in the West for good jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury, who plans to be in Manhattan on Thursday for a news conference, was an 
assistant at Pepperdine for nine seasons before replacing Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he became head coach, Asbury has weighed coaching offers from Wichita 
State, Colorado State, Montana State and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Asbury, the Waves won 20 or more games four times and never finished 
worse than second in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy for Tom to be accepting this position," said Wayne Wright, 
Pepperdine's athletic director. "Tom is at a stage of his career where he was 
either going to be here another 15 years and then retire, or move on. This one 
job came on and provided such a challenge that he had to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State had also offered the job to Tubby Smith, whose Tulsa team upset 
UCLA in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Smith rejected that offer last 
Friday and is expected to replace Billy Tubbs at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury suffered his biggest loss before the season started. His daughter, 
Stacey, died of complications from an eating disorder in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough year. Boy, it was really a tough year," Asbury said. "I'm 
tired, but it doesn't take long to re-juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Altman, Kansas State had a 63-42 record in five seasons, including a 
20-14 overall mark and a fourth-place finish in the National Invitation 
Tournament last season. The Wildcats, however, were 4-10 in the Big Eight and 
Altman was criticized for using a deliberate offense and for playing a weak 
nonconference schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury plans to pick up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we need to recruit good players, play up-tempo style and try to 
get people back into the seats," he said. "They don't have great personnel 
coming back. That's the only downside of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said Steve Aggers, Asbury's top assistant, will be given top 
consideration for the Wave job. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury said there were no advantages to recruiting for a university near the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to recruit anywhere," he said. "The fact that Pepperdine is near 
the beach is way overrated. Kids don't care about the beach. They want to play 
for a winning program." Tom Asbury at Pepperdine 07,09,09,06,07,07,07,12 Season

THE GENES FIT; DRIVER DAVID DONOHUE HOPES TO EMULATE THE SUCCESS OF HIS LATE 
FATHER, FORMER INDY 500 CHAMPION MARK DONOHUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you see David Donohue at the racetrack, you don't need to be told whose 
son he is. 
</P>
<P>
 The same crew-cut hair style, the same cherubic look, and the same wry humor 
and friendly intensity in his conversation make David, 26, the image of his 
father, the late Mark Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
 David hopes that some of the Donohue genes will help him move up the racing 
ladder the way his father did, although he admits he is sometimes overwhelmed 
when friends from Mark's era tell him of his father's exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm the son of Superman," Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Donohue won the 1972 Indianapolis 500, the 1973 Can-Am and three Trans-Am 
championships while driving for Roger Penske. He was 38 when he died Aug. 9, 
1975, of head injuries suffered in a crash while practicing for the Grand Prix 
of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 David Donohue will drive a four-door BMW sedan Saturday in a 30-minute 
Bridgestone Supercar championship race as part of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long 
Beach. It will be the second round of the International Motor Sports 
Assn.-sanctioned series and will pit Donohue's BMW against the world's fastest 
sports cars, such as Porsche, Corvette, Nissan 300ZX and Pontiac Firebird. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his competitors will be actor Paul Newman, driving a Lotus Esprit X180R. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue won the pole for the season opener last month at Sebring, Fla., 25 
years after his father had won the pole on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how good it feels to finally begin measuring up to the 
standards 
</P>
<P>
 he set," the younger Donohue said. "But the fact that he set his pole shortly 
after having the car run over his foot in the pits should serve to keep me from 
getting a swelled head." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Donohue's first pole in a professional racing series. He then started 
fourth in the Supercar series' random-draw starting grid and after dropping 
back as far as eighth on the first lap, rallied to finish second behind Peter 
Farrell in a Mazda RX-7. 
</P>
<P>
 David was 9 and his parents were divorced when his father was killed, so he 
has little recollection of Mark's racing career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my memories of my dad are of my brother and me on his boat, his time 
away from the track," David said. "The only time I remember being at the track 
when he was driving was when our mom took us to Pocono (in 1971) and he won. I 
think we were with him in the victory circle, but I was only 3 at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1990, when David and his brother, Michael, accepted a plaque 
for their father's election to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in Novi, 
Mich., that Donohue -- after getting a degree from Lehigh University -- decided 
to embark on a professional racing career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been a driving-school instructor and did a little amateur racing around 
home (Malvern, Pa.), but colleagues of my father who were at the Hall of Fame 
ceremony encouraged me to do more," he said. "I got a car from a friend of mine 
in the Porsche Club and started racing." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he branched out from club racing to drive in the Firestone Firehawk 
endurance series and also drove in eight Busch Grand National stock car races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting started is very difficult in NASCAR because it is so competitive," he 
said. "There are so many drivers, so close together, it is tough to even 
qualify. You can see how competitive it is when (six-time Winston Cup champion) 
Dale Earnhardt couldn't make the field at Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the future holds. At the moment, all I want to do is help 
(car owner) Ed Arnold win the Supercar championship with his BMW. We've been 
testing at Firebird Raceway (in Chandler, Ariz.) and I'm looking forward to 
Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's 1.59-mile temporary course will be a rare experience for Donohue. 
Only once before has he raced on a wall-lined street circuit. Last year at 
Miami, he was knocked off course on the first lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving between the walls was a tremendous rush, like riding a concrete 
roller coaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue got his biggest rush last year when he was invited to drive the 
legendary yellow and blue Sunoco Porsche 917 30 Can-Am car that his father had 
driven 20 years ago. The car, one of motor racing's most dominating vehicles, 
was flown from the Porsche museum in Stuttgart, Germany, for a historic car 
weekend at Laguna Seca. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask me to describe how I felt, all I can say is that nothing can 
describe the feeling," he said. "I tell them to use their own imagination, to 
let it go as far as they want. It was just awesome, not just the car, but the 
emotions, knowing my father drove it on the same track." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue was to have taken a few exhibition laps, but he stayed out for eight 
trips around the Monterey Peninsula track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed do no more than four, but I decided to stay out until they 
waved me in . . . and even then, I thought of ignoring them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The German mechanics were worried I'd foul all 24 spark plugs and they've 
have to work overtime to replace them. And the German public relations people 
were worried I might go too fast and crash. They kept reminding me that the 917 
was insured for $3 million in transit, but had no insurance while it was on the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to keep from going too fast, it was so powerful. The mechanics 
had de-tuned it from 1,500 horsepower to 1,140, but even though I tiptoed 
around the corners in fear of locking up the brakes, my times were 13 seconds 
quicker than the BMW running as hard as I could. The car is 20 years old, but 
it still goes like a rocket. It was good for my self-confidence, finding out I 
could control a machine that my dad controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also learned what it felt like to be a celebrity. When I was in the car, I 
felt the way the President of the United States must feel in the middle of a 
controversy. I could barely breath for all the people crushing around me. The 
car, that is. My wife couldn't even get close." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue also drove the Penske Camaro in which his father won 10 of 12 Trans-Am 
races in 1968, including eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars are totally different, but the feelings were the same, knowing that 
these were two of the cars he drove to championships," Donohue said. "It was a 
weekend I'll never forget. I never grew up around racers, the way Michael 
Andretti and Al Unser Jr. did, but that one weekend made me feel much closer to 
my dad."

ANGELS' FINLEY SHOULDERS BLAME; BASEBALL: PITCHER KNOWS HE NEEDS TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL FOR THE TEAM TO DO WELL, YET HE ENDURES ANOTHER ROUGH OUTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Chuck Finley feels no added burden of responsibility now that Mark Langston 
won't be available to the Angels for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so he said after a 5-4 loss to Cleveland on Tuesday night at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, Finley came to spring training knowing the Angels needed all 
the help they could get from him. And he was fully prepared to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why he was so disappointed after his second consecutive 
lackluster start. He felt he let his teammates down Tuesday, falling into a 3-0 
rut in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw out the first inning and Finley fared OK against the hard-hitting 
Indians. But that rocky trip through the Indian batting order wiped out 
anything good that followed, as far as Finley was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Three runs, three hits, eight batters faced, 43 pitches thrown -- those were 
the disturbing results from the top of the first. Never mind that the only ball 
driven to the outfield was Albert Belle's run-scoring sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a (lousy) outing," Finley said. "Maybe my standards are too 
high, but I don't appreciate putting my teammates in a hole like that. It was 
3-0 before we had a chance to swing the sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first inning I just kind of started over." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley placed the blame for the rough start on his left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it was," he said. "My arm was just dead. It didn't have any 
life in it." 
</P>
<P>
 He felt better later on, throwing with more zip in giving up four runs and 
seven hits in seven innings.  
</P>
<P>
 In two starts, he is 0-1 with a 6.94 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 No reason to panic, even with Langston sidelined after undergoing elbow 
surgery Tuesday, according to Finley and Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By July, I'll look back and it's not a big deal," Finley said. "It's all out 
in the wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers: "As long as he's healthy I'm not concerned. It's just a matter 
of time before he can work it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley and Rodgers agree that there's more to the Angels' "Mark and Chuck and 
You're Outta Luck" rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley simply despised the notion of a three-run first inning, and he's not 
ready to settle for bouncing back over the course of the next six innings. He 
knows that's not living up to expectations -- his own and the those of his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers wants to see what happens with starters Phil Leftwich, who pitches 
tonight, Mark Leiter, Brian Anderson and John Dopson before passing judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it depends on how we do with the other guys," Rodgers said. "If the 
other guys win their starts, there's no problem. It's all relative. We're .500 
(4-4) and Finley is 0-1." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are still trying to work a deal that would involve trading first 
baseman J.T. Snow, now at triple-A Vancouver, for a starting pitcher. But they 
haven't been successful. Until then, they're stuck with what they've got. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Finley didn't like what he saw and hopes he's seen the last of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can throw the ball better than that," he said. "It doesn't concern 
me as much as it disappoints me."

RULES MAKE COACHES USE FULL DECK, NOT JUST ACES; ATHLETICS: TEAMS ARE 
DEVELOPING NEW SOURCES OF PITCHING BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITS ON INNINGS. 
</P>

 Bob Canary was in a bind. Dana Hills' baseball team had to play six games in 
seven days -- four in the West Anaheim Lions Tournament and two crucial South 
Coast League games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules, not to mention his conscience, forbade the Dolphins' coach from taxing 
his top two starters. They had to be saved for league games. 
</P>
<P>
 So just where in the name of Cy Young was he going to find the arms? 
</P>
<P>
 His problem was not unusual to high school baseball these days. The game has 
changed. Coaches who once handed their ace the ball game-in and game-out with 
the instructions, "Bring it back and don't get it dirty," are now more adept at 
handling pitchers. They realize that those strong arms are also delicate limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 So Canary had to prioritize and do some juggling. Anyone who could lob a ball 
60 feet 6 inches was a potential pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may see every one of our infielders throw an inning or two," Canary said 
before the tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't get quite that desperate, but Canary did do some finagling. He 
spotted a guy here, tried a guy there. He even called on his third baseman, who 
hadn't pitched in a game in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the week was done, Dana Hills had won five of the six games -- including 
both in league -- and finished second in the tournament. Canary had handled his 
"pitching staff" to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of having one pitcher get you through a season are long gone," 
Canary said. "You have to count on a group of pitchers. We try to carry five. 
We usually only use three, but we may need the others." 
</P>
<P>
 There is safety in those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers are limited to no more than 30 outs or three appearances per week. 
And coaches are more aware of the dangers of overuse. The combination has been 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were guys who would pitch 85% of their team's games," Fullerton College 
Coach Nick Fuscardo said. "A coach would ride that horse through a season, 
sometimes to a championship. I've seen a big change. I think (high school) 
coaches are taking better care of pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 They have to these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of innings a young pitcher piles up has been among the most 
controversial issues in high school sports and probably always will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball, more than any other sport, can be impacted by one player, and 
that's the pitcher," Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said. "And that causes a lot of 
stress on young arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Too much, sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on youth baseball 
Monday that said restricting how long children pitch can prevent permanent 
elbow injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section began limiting the innings a player could pitch in 1990 
after a state rule was put into effect. The rule followed a directive from the 
National Federation of High School Athletic Assns. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, pitchers are allowed the equivalent of 10 innings or three games in 
which he throws at least one pitch. Games that start but are rained out count 
toward limit. A team isn't penalized if a double- or triple-play pushes a 
pitcher over the limit. Any violation of the rule is an automatic forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule was necessary because a few coaches had abused pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were guys out there who didn't know how to use pitchers," Esperanza 
Coach Mike Curran said. "They weren't in the majority. But if one guy abuses a 
pitcher, then it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than one guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The section does not keep records on innings pitched, but the constant use of 
certain pitchers wasn't exactly a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about human beings, and they make mistakes," said Gary 
Johnson, a scout with the Kansas City Royals. "The rule prevents human 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches say some colleagues seemed to over-use their pitchers, throwing 
their best pitcher as often as possible. Those players may have been eager to 
carry that heavy workload, but eventually they suffered the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peterson pitched in 47 games for Sonora from 1971-73. He won 40. He 
pitched nine innings of one playoff game -- striking out 22 -- then came back 
three days later to pitch in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a price to be paid. Peterson had one good season at Arizona State, 
then went downhill rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Salkeld was a pack mule for Saugus High in 1989. He pitched 32 1/3 of 
his team's 36 1/3 playoff innings, bringing his high school career total to 
264. Salkeld, a first-round pick of the Seattle Mariners, missed the 1992 
season because of a sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Claes went 14-2 for Fullerton in 1982 and pitched in 33 of 36 innings in 
the playoffs; the three innings he missed came after he was hit by a line 
drive. Claes went to San Diego State but never pitched for the Aztecs. He ended 
up at Rancho Santiago and was all but finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wasn't the same pitcher," said Fuscardo, who previously coached at 
Troy High School. "A kid may not be affected today, but it has an effect down 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Said La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest: "There are only so many pitches in an arm 
and when they're used up, they're used up." 
</P>
<P>
 The rules have had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know that when you draft a kid he doesn't have a ton of innings 
on his arm already," said Ken Compton, West Coast supervisor in the Mariners' 
scouting and player development department. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches now are more apt to protect a prospect than waste him. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella's Jaret Wright is ranked as the nation's fourth-best high school 
prospect by Baseball America, but he has hardly been burdened this season. He 
has pitched 39 innings, roughly one-third of the Knights' innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a kid of this caliber, you are really careful," Katella Coach 
Tim McMenamin said. "He has a tremendous future. If he doesn't feel right, we 
don't even let him take infield at first base." 
</P>
<P>
 Katella will use two or three pitchers a week during league play, much like 
other teams. It spreads the innings out and keeps the pitchers fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta's Jim Livernois was The Times Orange County player of the year in 
1993, but he has not been a workhorse this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois, 13-3 a year ago, is 6-3 this season. But he has pitched in only 38 
innings. Teammates Joe Garcia and Steve Combs have pitched in almost as many: 
Garcia has 34 2/3, Combs 33 1/3. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Demarest: "We don't chart the types of pitches or the location. We just 
chart the number of pitches. When a kid reaches a certain number, and he 
doesn't look sharp, we pull him." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia took a 3-2 lead into the seventh inning against Lakewood last week. He 
was yanked with one out, and La Quinta ended up losing, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe walked a batter, and it wasn't even close," Demarest said. "I knew he was 
tired. He said he was tired. He had to come out. What it gets down to is you 
may have to lose a nonleague game to protect a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest benefit, coaches say, has been the competitiveness. No longer can 
a team be carried to a championship by one arm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Lakewood beat previously undefeated Esperanza in the Southern Section 
Division 4-A championship game. Mike McNary pitched all 37 innings in the 
playoffs for the Lancers, including nine in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You now get a truer champion," Esperanza's Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get through the season and to that championship, you might need more arms. 
Teams that used to depend on a maximum of two starters are now putting together 
staffs that include as many as six pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule gives other kids a chance to pitch," Dana Hills' Canary said. "As a 
coach, you have to develop more pitchers. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 And to develop arms, coaches have turned to pitching coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 High school baseball has traditionally been the highest level that did not 
have a coach specifically working with pitchers. Now, that's changing. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado Coach Steve Gullotti runs practice and works with the team while Ira 
Novick works with the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gullotti: "Our pitchers worked for two hours during practice the other 
day. If I didn't have Ira, I would have to work with the pitchers either before 
or after practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are benefiting from the specialized instruction and supervision, learning 
to care for their arms while they develop theirskills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a really great addition to the high school game," Fuscardo said. 
"You have someone up in the bullpen to make sure things are done properly. 
There are a lot of good pitching coaches out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, coaches don't kid themselves. Pitchers still are being abused, if not 
during the high school season, then after. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more opportunities for kids to pitch -- and thus to be overused -- 
than ever before. With summer, winter and scout leagues, some kids will play 
year round for two or three teams with no pitch-limit rules. 
</P>
<P>
 It increases the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Pete Zamora, considered a top prospect, pitched seven 
innings for the Cougar summer-league team. The next night, he played in another 
league in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That coach asked him how his arm felt, and Pete said fine," said Cougar Coach 
Bob Zamora, Pete's father. "So he went another seven innings. I found out a few 
days later and couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora has been sidelined with an elbow injury the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids, coaches say, have to learn to just say no, especially during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, who is also a first baseman, played in five summer leagues two years 
ago. Every coach wanted him to pitch, according to Bob Zamora, who tried to 
make sure that didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, these teams are run by coaches who lack expertise in handling 
pitchers or stretch the limits in an effort to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Esperanza's Roger Weems pitched the first game of a doubleheader in a 
Mickey Mantle League regional final. His coach had him warming up for the 
second game when Curran intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely see a problem with all these leagues," Curran said. "I'll send a 
position player to play without batting an eye. But I'm real leery about 
sending a pitcher to one of these teams." 
</P>
<P>
 But the overkill isn't limited to the off-season. Some pitchers are still 
being overworked by high school coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common problem is at the start of the season, when kids have had only 
two weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 30-out rule has worked, but it can be misleading," Demarest said. "I'm 
just amazed at the number of kids who go seven innings in that first game. They 
think that winning that nonleague game is more important than the kid's arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Demarest said that coaches sometimes will count innings but don't take into 
account the number of pitches a kid will throw. If a player pitches twice in a 
week, it means he has warmed up in the bullpen twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule also doesn't take into the number of pitches thrown in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's an inning anyway?," Demarest said. "It can be a four-pitch inning or a 
30-pitch inning." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Renfrow: "We have an obligation to use common sense. Coaches get caught 
up in the moment and try to win. Instead of playing to win, we need to be 
responsible to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, Renfrow said, is what they are hired to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We share only a short time with these kids," Renfrow said. "We need to 
protect them."

SOFTBALL PITCHERS GO THE DISTANCE, AND BEYOND, WITH PROPER MECHANICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year's high school softball playoffs got off to a bizarre start for 
former Los Alamitos pitcher Carrie Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered a concussion in an automobile accident and didn't play in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, still a little stiff, she pitched seven innings and shut out 
Santa Maria Righetti, 2-0. That was on a Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, she pitched 22 innings -- 179 pitches -- in a 1-0 quarterfinal 
victory over Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan pitches underhand, and when you throw underhand, you can throw forever 
-- almost. 
</P>
<P>
 She pitched 42 innings -- allowing no runs in the first 41 -- over a 12-day 
period that ended in the Southern Section championship game. That's the 
equivalent of six seven-inning games -- 428 pitches, total -- and it would be 
absurd for a baseball pitcher to try to match that feat. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a fairly typical occurrence in softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have the right mechanics, you swing the arm, you snap the wrist, you 
can pitch three, four games a week and not injure the arm as long as you're in 
good physical condition," said Brea-Olinda's Don Sarno, pitching consultant for 
the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarno pitched on five national championship teams, has taught pitching for 30 
years and was elected to the International Softball Congress Hall of Fame in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying you want to make a steady diet of throwing five games a week," 
he said, "but if your mechanics are correct, you can throw three to five games 
-- a tournament, for instance -- without injuring your arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch pitched at the nationals last summer in the 16-and-under division 
for the Outlaws. During one stretch, she said she pitched 30 innings one day 
and 20 the next. She had also pitched single games the two previous days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toward the end, you have to change your style; I have to go to more off-speed 
pitches because I can't overpower batters," said Crouch, who pitches for 
second-ranked Marina. "I'm not throwing as hard but it's OK. Sometimes I do 
better toward the end because it's a more thinking game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get sore every once in a while, but it's when I haven't been pitching for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sarno: "Dolan and Crouch are excellent pitchers, both are in shape; it 
proves you can do that. That's why it's important they develop proper mechanics 
early on -- even before they go into high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Stories such as those of Crouch and Dolan make the tale of Ocean View's Kathy 
Ponce mild by comparison: Two weeks ago, she pitched 25 innings over a 
three-day period -- seven, three and 15innings. She threw 165 pitches in a 
17-strikeout performance in the last game, against Rosary, the longest 
performance of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last inning, I couldn't feel my hand," said Ponce, one of the county's 
hardest throwers. "I wanted to finish what I started; I had gone that far, and 
I was going to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sore about a day, but that's pretty usual when you throw really hard 
and use all the muscles you have. It's just normal soreness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce usually throws between starts, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's a much more natural motor movement than the overhand 
action," Sarno said, "you can overuse it." 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems only in the most extreme circumstances do softball pitchers have 
arm problems that rival that of their baseball counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, the NCAA's top-ranked women's softball program, recruited a freshman 
pitcher who suffered a stress fracture in her forearm while pitching her club 
team to the 18-and-under national championship in August, 1992. In the final, 
her ulnar bone broke completely. Seven months later, she was on the mound again 
for her high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she is 8-1 with a 2.32 earned-run average for the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Carrie Dolan.

USC BACKS OFF DESAUSSURE FOR TIME BEING; TRACK AND FIELD: TAFT SPRINTER'S 
PARTICIPATION IN QUINCY WATTS INVITATIONAL MAY HAVE BEEN AN NCAA VIOLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Taft High, runner-up in the boys' 400 meters in last 
year's state track and field championships, figured he had all his bases 
covered when he ran a leg on a 400-meter relay team in the Quincy Watts 
invitational at USC last month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Trojans have interpreted DeSaussure's actions as a violation of 
NCAA rules, they said in a statement, "because a prospect competed in the same 
heat as collegiate athletes and that can be construed as a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 "USC has ceased recruiting him and has declared him ineligible to participate 
in athletics at USC. But USC is petitioning the NCAA to restore his eligibility 
to participate in athletics at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 The possible rules violation occurred March 26 when DeSaussure ran a leg on a 
400-meter relay team that included Watts, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist in the 
400 and 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the unattached team -- which finished in second place -- competed in a 
race that included teams from USC, Fresno State, Boise State and Iowa, 
DeSaussure's appearance could be interpreted a violation of an NCAA rule that 
prohibits schools from holding tryouts for a "prospective student-athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Article 13.12.1.1 of the NCAA Constitution describes a prospect as "any 
individual who has started classes for the ninth grade and is not enrolled in 
the member institution at the time of the practice or test therein described." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, the 1993 City Section champion in the 100, 200 and 400, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Lipkis, his personal coach, said that USC's actions surprised him 
because he and fellow coaches checked with both the California Interscholastic 
Federation and the NCAA compliance office to make sure DeSaussure would not 
break any rules by competing in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told that everything was OK or we never would have let him run in the 
meet," Lipkis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although DeSaussure has yet to make a commitment or sign a letter of intent, 
he has said that USC tops the list of schools recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
 He has taken trips to Washington and Arizona, but his heart seems set on 
playing football and running track at USC, Watts' alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure has personal bests of 10.72 seconds in the 100, 21.1 in the 200 and 
47.11 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wide receiver in football, he had 27 receptions for 656 yards and five 
touchdowns last season.

FAST FROM THE START; VENTURA'S KRABILL GOT THE JUMP ON DRAG RACING AT AN EARLY 
AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As his engine rattles loudly behind him, teen-age drag racer Kris Krabill 
focuses on the lights ahead, knowing that if he waits until he sees green to 
step on the gas, he probably has already lost. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three amber lights flash Krabill, a senior at Ventura High, has 
exactly four-tenths of a second before the green light flashes, just enough 
time for his 1,350-pound dragster to react after he jams his left foot on the 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a second, he will be going 60 m.p.h. A second later, 150 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 With the seat of his pants about three inches above the hot, sticky track, 
Krabill -- ideally -- will cover the quarter-mile in 8.9 seconds. No more, no 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this how most high schoolers spend their weekends? 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sitting there at idle and you can feel the engine rattling behind 
you," said Krabill, who has been a professional drag racer since before he 
could drive legally. "Then you see the (light) tree, and it's like, vrooooom, 
you're gone. It's such a rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go down the track it gets more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill, according to his mother, was always in a hurry. For starters, he was 
born seven weeks prematurely. As he grew up, only the mode transportation 
changed. Not the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had little cars, a Big Wheel," Carol Krabill said. "He was always going 
fast on those things. He liked to do jumps too. Daredevil stuff. He always 
wanted to drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill, 18, fell in love with drag racing when he was about 14 and his uncle, 
who races Pontiacs, let him sit in the passenger seat during a race. He also 
went with his father, another former drag racer, to the Winternationals in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was the best thing," Krabill said. "I was just overwhelmed with 
how exciting it was. After that, I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 When Krabill was 15, his parents bought him a 1970 Chevy Nova, "a pretty 
hopped-up street car," as he described it. Soon thereafter, Krabill started 
entering races illegally -- he didn't have a driver's license yet -- with the 
Nova. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was not right," Carol Krabill said, "but this was just with the 
Nova, so we're talking about only 80 miles an hour. And it was just a few 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill finally stopped racing illegally after he won an event at the Los 
Angeles County Raceway in Palmdale. He was afraid race officials would check 
for his license when he picked up his trophy. They didn't, but Krabill quit 
anyway. Temporarily, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of searching classified ads in drag racing magazines, Krabill and 
his father, Dick, a conveyor belt salesman, found the perfect dragster. In 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill flew to Houston, and his father drove a trailer. They paid $10,000 for 
the car, and Krabill spent a day with the previous owner learning how to drive 
it. He and his father then towed it back to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step was finding a sponsor. Krabill responded to an ad from a motor 
oil company that offered racers the opportunity to be trackside dealers for the 
motor oil in exchange for a few perks, such as the company painting the car. 
</P>
<P>
 At every race they enter, the Krabills set up a stand and actually sell motor 
oil, along with caps and T-shirts bearing the company's logo. Besides keeping a 
portion of the revenue from sales of the merchandise, the Krabills are able to 
write off the racing expenses, starting with the car's $10,000 price tag, as 
business deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The family formed KDC Enterprises. The initials stand for Kris, Dick and 
Carol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom is the manager, dad is the crew chief and my uncle is the crew," Krabill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While his father worries primarily about the mechanics of the car, his mother 
does a little of everything, from retrieving her son from the end of the track 
after a run to making sure he completes his homework between races. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill plans to study business management at Cuesta College in San Luis 
Obispo next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still going to be involved in racing when I have time, but I feel it's 
important to get my education to fall back on," he said, "because you never 
know what is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill couldn't make much of a living drag racing, anyway. The richest events 
in his division pay about only $1,500 to the winner. The most he has taken home 
is about $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill said most events pay from the quarterfinals on, which means winning 
four races before you see a dime. About 120 drivers, most of them weekend 
warriors with other jobs, compete for a championship. They are paired off in a 
single-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In super comp eliminator racing, the idea is not necessarily to floor it and 
go as fast as possible to beat the guy next to you, but to come closest to the 
index, which, in Krabill's division, is 8.90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, the racer who finishes closest to 8.90 seconds, without going 
under, wins. If both racers are quicker than 8.90 seconds, the slower racer 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill, who races primarily in California, Nevada and Arizona, has finished 
on top in five events in the three seasons he has been racing. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished 1993 in eighth place in the Southern California Econo Drag Racing 
Assn. points standings, and he didn't even compete in two of the eight events 
from which the points are totaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the events he competes in are regional, but he raced in his first 
national event in Pomona in October. He did so well, he was disqualified. 
Krabill anticipated the green light nearly perfectly, but he started one 
thousandth of a second before the green. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrations come in many varieties. Last month, Krabill and his father 
drove eight hours in the dead of night to Phoenix for a race. After three 
practice runs, less than 30 seconds of driving, the dragster's engine failed. 
They turned around and drove back to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But, fortunately for Krabill, his racing problems have not caused him any 
injuries. The most serious trouble came when one of his crew members left the 
cap off the fuel cell and gasoline spilled onto the tires during the run, 
causing the car to lose traction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was all over the track," Krabill said. But he was able to safely stop 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother used to worry about his safety, but now she seems more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a safe sport," she said. "With all the safety equipment, the 
five-way seat belt and the fire suit, it's probably safer than him getting in 
his pickup and driving to school every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. 
</P>
<P>
 Krabill will be spending a day in traffic school sometime soon. He recently 
received his first moving violation. 
</P>
<P>
 A speeding ticket.

TIRED OF DISHING IT OUT, NFL TO SELL PACKAGE DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of battling satellite dishes, the NFL is now going into the 
business itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has put together a package called "NFL Sunday Ticket," which offers 
regional telecasts to home dish owners, providing as many as 12 games every 
Sunday.That's a total of more than 180 games in the 17-week season. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has had years of court fights with taverns that used dishes to bring 
in games that otherwise would not be televised in their areas. However, games

PREYING ON MANTAS; AFTER DIVERS VIDEOTAPE SLAUGHTER, OFFICIALS ENACT REGULATION 
TO AID RAYS OFF MEXICAN ISLAND 
</P>

 Terry Kennedy was stunned, but he managed to push the button on his video 
camera and keep a steady hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Clinton couldn't hold back the tears as she watched, but she, too, was 
able to shoot away. 
</P>
<P>
 The two American divers, during a recent trip to Mexico's Revillagigedo 
Islands, could do little else but take pictures as fishermen aboard two 
Mexican-flagged boats moved into the government-protected waters of San 
Benedicto Island, the northernmost of the chain, and used nets, baited hooks 
and harpoons to catch and kill anything they could.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were outnumbered," Kennedy, who lives aboard his sailboat with Clinton, 
said after reaching La Paz late Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The St. Valentine's Day Massacre, as the incident has been called, occurred on 
Feb. 14. But the issue remains hot in Mexico, and Kennedy's video has become a 
catalyst in the movement to save the giant Pacific manta rays of the 
Revillagigedos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Divers who have been to the Revillagigedo Islands, a volcanic chain of four 
islands stretching from 220 miles to 400 miles south-southwest of Cabo San 
Lucas, say there is something magical about the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins seem always to be in a playful mood. Turtles use their little legs to 
push their way around the colorful reefs, which flourish under the penetrating 
rays of a tropical sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is so clear that schools of tuna and marlin and even large sharks 
can often be seen patrolling the offshore canyons and drop-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 But divers say the manta rays make a trip to the islands special. With their 
20-foot spans, they often hover below boats "like giant space stations" waiting 
for divers to jump in and grab hold for a guided tour of their blue-green 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started eight years ago trying to swim with these animals and after 
several weeks and many hours in the water, they started to come closer and let 
you touch them," said Mike McGettigan, 54, owner of the dive boat Ambar III, 
who has made more than 100 trips to the islands. "As soon as that happened, 
they were our friends forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Riding on the back of a giant manta, La Paz-based dive boat operator John Rife 
said, "is like riding on a magic carpet." Killing one for a small profit, he 
added, "is no different than killing a panda bear to make a rug." 
</P>
<P>
 Rife's comparison might sound extreme, but divers believe they have developed 
a special bond with the manta rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 50, says one manta he named "Willy Wow" years ago lets him know when 
it's time to go for a swim with a "gentle slap of his wing on the hull of the 
boat."  
</P>
<P>
 Days went by without an appearance by Willy Wow on Kennedy's latest trip, 
which began Feb. 4. Kennedy feared the worst, especially after witnessing the 
events of Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and Clinton were anchored at the south end of San Benedicto. They were 
awakened by fishermen laying out their gear only 200 yards from shore. Mexican 
law prohibits commercial fishermen from fishing within two miles of the 
islands.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the fishermen started to haul in their catch.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our worst fears came true," Kennedy said. "Two of the mantas that we were 
riding the day before were hopelessly tangled in the nets. (They) were torn to 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's camera was rolling while the crew struggled to get one manta out of 
its net. Clinton's sobbing, and cries of "Oh, God, no!" were picked up by the 
camera.  
</P>
<P>
 The nets were so damaged by the struggling mantas that they were tossed 
overboard, the mantas still in them. Thousands of feet of monofilament nets 
settled over the reefs, trapping and killing other fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members turned their attention to the long-line gear, hauling it in and 
finding little but dead or dying reef sharks on the hooks. The larger sharks 
had their fins removed for sale on the Japanese market. The reef sharks were 
cut from the hooks and dumped overboard. A once-thriving reef was soon littered 
with dead sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew aboard the other boat, the Mero VII, was busy harpooning a manta ray 
that had come too close to the boat. A large manta hanging from gaffs at the 
side of the boat was being stabbed repeatedly in the stomach with a small 
harpoon. The crew then got into a smaller boat and, at water level, used axes 
to cut the wings from the large ray. The wings, sometimes served as seafood, 
were then loaded aboard the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy had radioed McGettigan in Cabo San Lucas while the nets were in the 
water, and McGettigan had contacted the Mexican navy, which has a small base on 
Socorro Island, 30 miles south of San Benedicto. The navy arrived in time to 
seize one of the boats. The other escaped, but was later captured. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the boats were fined and their fishing licenses were revoked, 
but more important, according to divers and conservationists, the documentation 
of the incident helped call attention to an apparent problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very sad to say, but what is going on is, little by little those islands 
are receiving more people, more commercial boats of several kinds," said 
Enrique Fernandez Del Castillo, manager of Cabo Isle Marina in Cabo San Lucas. 
"These people were caught doing that and we think this is happening 
continuously because there is a drop in the number of manta rays at the 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Mauricio Ruiz Galindo, president of Pronatura, a privately funded Mexican 
conservation movement, has been pushing hard for some sort of action by the 
government since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they did with (the manta rays), but whatever they did, it's 
not worth it," Ruiz Galindo said. "The animal is worth more alive than it is 
dead, because it's a tourist attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's department of fisheries, or Pesca, had already begun working with 
other government agencies and on March 26 ruled it illegal to catch manta rays 
within 12 miles of the Revillagigedos "due to the slow growth and the low 
reproduction potential of the animals, so as not to affect their population 
levels," said Xavier Gutierrez Tellez, director general of Pesca. 
</P>
<P>
 Manta rays taken accidentally must be released if still alive, and willful 
violators are subject to fines of up to $10,000 for each manta killed. 
</P>
<P>
 McGettigan hailed Mexico's quick action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we've got to try to protect the area, to get word out that this problem 
is not going to go away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Means, owner of the La Paz-based Baja Expeditions, who has been running 
diving trips for the last 15 years, was more skeptical, saying that mantas at 
the Revillagigedos will go the way of the mantas in the Sea of Cortez if 
fishermen are allowed to fish with gill nets near the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to make a regulation, but still allow the nets," Means 
said. "We used to be able to ride mantas at the El Bajo Seamount, but it's rare 
to see them these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "These big critters are worth thousands of dollars to me and others as a 
resource, and $20 to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo expressed concern over Mexico's ability to enforce the new regulation 
in an area as remote as the Revillagigedos.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is more vessels of the navy in the area, more policemen," he 
said. "Unfortunately, those islands are so far away it is very difficult to 
have them under control . . . and the boats we have here (at Socorro Navy 
Station) are boats bought from the United States from World War II. We are 
looking for alternatives to control the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Pesca has asked the San Diego-based long-range fishing fleet, which fishes the 
islands extensively for giant yellowfin tuna and wahoo, to help keep an eye on 
the area. McGettigan says now that the word is out, fishermen will be more 
reluctant to raid the near-shore reefs of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 He said members of Sea Watch will also make a more concentrated effort to keep 
an eye out. * 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and Clinton had spent 23 days at San Benedicto, remaining long after 
the Feb. 14 incident, cutting loose nets the fishermen had left on the reefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We collected all the net our boat will hold, 100 pounds of evidence," Kennedy 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the 24th day, there was a gentle slap on the hull of his boat. Willy 
Wow had shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped over the side and we were having a ball," Kennedy said. "We spent an 
hour riding out over the lava flow. . . . I was blown away. Then he stopped his 
trip right underneath the boat, he took me back where he got me. I just pushed 
off his back and went straight up and started yelling."

WARGO LOSES HIS SHOCK VALUE; GOLF: HE HAS SINCE PROVED THAT WINNING THE SENIORS 
CHAMPIONSHIP WAS NO FLUKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tom Wargo surprised the golf world by winning the PGA Seniors 
Championship a year ago, many, including some fellow professionals, considered 
it a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 It was widely believed that the former club pro, who had earned only $9,000 on 
the regular PGA Tour, did not belong in the top echelon of the 50-and-over 
group. After all, he had failed to make it in qualifying school and had failed 
to win in five previous tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 How things change. Wargo will be one of the favorites in this year's 
tournament, starting Thursday on the Champions Course at PGA National Resort & 
Spa in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and not merely because he is the defending 
champion. He has already won a tournament this year, has been in contention in 
three or four others and is the second-leading senior money winner. No one 
thinks Wargo doesn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 In a field that includes Jack Nicklaus, Tradition winner Raymond Floyd, 
leading money winner Lee Trevino and last year's player of the year, Dave 
Stockton, Wargo is one of the chief contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 His two-hole playoff victory over Bruce Crampton last year capped a turnaround 
for the once struggling golf course owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did it exempt Wargo from Monday qualifying, but it earned him 
$110,000, more than twice as much as he had ever earned in any one year before. 
This year, he already has won nearly a quarter of a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning all of that money has not changed Wargo, who still owns the course in 
Centralia, Ill., where he earned enough so that he could give the senior tour a 
fair shot. Money doesn't seem that important to him. Last month at Ojai, when 
he won $1,400 in a pre-tournament shootout, he donated it to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I haven't changed," Wargo said after finishing in a tie for ninth in 
the Tradition, the first of the senior majors, earlier this month in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. "I still feel like a club professional. The hoopla and all 
the notoriety is very nice, but when I'm through out here, I'll go back to 
running my golf course. Hopefully, old Tom will be old Tom." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed only fitting to Wargo that he should have won his first senior event 
at PGA National. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my home away from home," the 51-year-old Michigan native said. "In the 
mid-'80s, I won my first tournament in the PGA club professional tournament 
series right there. As I was walking the course during the championship last 
year, I tried to bring back the days when, though the course had changed a 
little, there were the same shots to hit. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Wargo and Crampton, a 33-time winner on the PGA and senior tour, finished the 
72 holes at 275, 13 under par. On the first playoff hole, Wargo had to blast 
out of a bunker to within four feet and putt for a tie. On the next hole, a par 
three, Crampton hit a six-iron into the water on the right and it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Before settling on golf, Wargo tried his hand at many things. He has been a 
dairy farmer, an ironworker -- "I've worked at 400 feet, where there's nothing 
but air below" -- a salmon fisherman and an assembly-line worker.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still finding it hard to get used to being around the likes of Arnold 
Palmer and Jack Nicklaus," he said. "I . . . watched them on TV. I dreamed of 
playing with them. In the Senior Slam in Mexico, I played with Nicklaus and got 
to know him a bit. That was nice. I've played with Palmer a couple of times and 
he's asked me to be his partner in the Legends of Golf in May in Austin, Tex. 
That will be a thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "But actually, not much has changed. I still stay at Motel 6 and Team Wargo is 
intact. Irene (his wife) manages the club in Centralia, joining me once a 
month, and Butch (Williams) is still my caddie and doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing has changed, though. The fans know him and seek his autograph. They 
know now that he can play.
