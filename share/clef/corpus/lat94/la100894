IN LOVE WITH ALL HER HEART, AND A KIDNEY; TRANSPLANT: O.C. COUPLE SO COMPATIBLE 
THAT BRIDE WILL DONATE AN ORGAN TO GROOM FOR A WEDDING GIFT.

 On Tuesday, Victoria Ingram and Randall Curlee will wed. On Wednesday, she 
will give him a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee, 46, a diabetic, learned he needed a transplant shortly after the 
Mission Viejo couple became engaged in February. When he made an appointment 
with a transplant specialist, he "brought Victoria along so she could have an 
idea of what I was looking at in the future. I said, 'We're getting married and 
I want you to now what the future could be like.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, who directs the kidney team at Sharp Memorial Hospital in 
San Diego, outlined the daunting prospects to the couple. Approximately 36,000 
people are on the waiting list for kidneys, and only about 4,000 kidneys become 
available each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most come from patients who die in hospitals. Live transplants usually come 
from blood relatives, but Curlee's relatives were not compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victoria said, 'Why don't you test me?' " Curlee said. "Both the doctor and I 
looked at each other, and we thought it was way off the wall. We thought it was 
just impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he said, they went home and "kind of forgot about the test." 
</P>
<P>
 When Curlee returned from a trip out of the country, Ingram said, "he had a 
funny look on his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee said, "I got a call, and they told us we were a match with the two most 
important antigens. The doctor explained to us that our immune systems are 
identical, and that it was like winning the lottery as far as our matching." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember how I felt," Ingram said, "but I said, 'That's fantastic. 
Let's do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the couple will marry in the hospital chapel. The next day, Mendez 
who has performed 3,000 kidney operations, will perform the four- to six-hour 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victoria is someone who is totally unselfish, and 100% behind me because she 
wants me to be around," Curlee said. "She's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel gifted," Ingram said. "I keep using the term giving life. I can share 
what was given to me. I look forward to many years of happiness. It's something 
I can give him that we'll both enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met two years ago at an open house that Ingram, a 45-year-old real 
estate agent, was holding in Curlee's neighborhood. He was strolling down the 
street and, since "I was planning on selling my house," he walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was this big, burly guy wearing this red baseball cap, with a great big 
monster beard and mustache," Ingram said. "We just got to talking about real 
estate." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, he said, "like we were old friends right off the bat."  
</P>
<P>
 Curlee, now a marketing director for QSC Audio Products in Costa Mesa, had his 
diabetes diagnosed in his teens and has suffered many of the complications 
associated with the disease, including a heart attack, open-heart surgery, 
blindness and eye surgery that restored his sight. He takes injections twice a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude is, you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself, or deal with 
it as it comes," Curlee said. "I've come out a better person for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although their honeymoon will have to wait until he recovers, the couple plan 
a wedding re-enactment and reception at their Mission Viejo home in December 
and a European honeymoon in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Victoria is trying to do is to impress on people is that you can be a 
living donor for someone and preserve their life," Curlee said. "Being a donor 
doesn't lower any life expectancy for even one minute. They've assured us it's 
a very safe procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's relationship also has been good for Ingram's career. She sold 
Curlee's Lake Forest house when he moved into her Laguna Hills home. Then she 
sold that house and handled the sale and purchase of the couple's new home in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is her best year ever," Curlee said with a laugh. "She's sold 17 houses 
so far, and three of them were ours."

TUNNEL SUPERVISOR GOT JOB BACK DESPITE SAFETY ISSUE; SUBWAY: A TOP MTA OFFICIAL 
REVERSED EXPULSION OF SUPERINTENDENT, CALLING HIM A 'VALUABLE ASSET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after the expulsion of a tunneling contractor's superintendent 
from the Los Angeles subway project for allegedly unsafe work practices, a top 
executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reversed the decision, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal of the superintendent had been ordered last March by the agency's 
inspection-management firm after a tunnel accident along Vermont Avenue. Edward 
McSpedon, president of the MTA's rail construction unit, withdrew the 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon and his staff have come under increasing criticism for a series of 
management decisions on what is the most expensive subway project per mile in 
U.S. history. The Clinton Administration on Wednesday froze $1.6 billion of 
future funding for the Los Angeles subway, citing design, construction and 
engineering problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent, Norm Hutchins, has headed Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's tunneling 
efforts along Vermont and Hollywood Boulevard since the firm began work 15 
months ago, except during his ouster last spring. Excavation was halted Aug. 18 
because of ground sinkages in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea-Kiewit-Kenny officials fought the expulsion of Hutchins earlier this 
year, describing him in letters to the transit authority as an exemplary 
employee, crucial to successfully completing the largest-ever subway contract 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon defended his decision in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not happy with Norm Hutchins' performance, no question about that," 
McSpedon said. But he added: "This was a judgment call made on the best advice" 
possible, in consultation with two board members of the MTA's subagency, the 
Rail Construction Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon noted that all aspects of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's role with the subway 
work remain under review by the transit authority. The MTA's chief executive 
officer, Franklin E. White, said earlier this week that he is considering 
whether to terminate the contracts of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny and the 
inspection-management firm of Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton said he is waiting for MTA 
officials to make changes and demonstrate that they can competently manage the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The local agency's first challenge is to begin resolving the problems with the 
Hollywood tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the 
decision by McSpedon to allow Hutchins back on the project "should be 
reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very troubling," said Yaroslavsky, an appointee to the MTA board. "This 
is the kind of thing that bothers me about the diffused accountability on this 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky has called for the MTA board to give White tighter control of the 
construction that McSpedon has helped oversee. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said McSpedon's decision to reinstate Hutchins may be added to the 
management decisions to be discussed Tuesday, when the MTA board will meet in a 
special session to address the federal government's cutoff of $1.6 billion of 
future subway funding. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Ed Edelman predicted that the MTA board would vote to 
dissolve the rail construction unit that McSpedon heads. "Their time is running 
out," said Edelman, who also serves as MTA board chairman. "It's got to be 
changed. There is no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
 State Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz, dissatisfied 
with the MTA's performance, has called for McSpedon's firing. McSpedon has said 
he wants to remain and believes he has performed well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins was ordered removed from the project on March 11, the same day that a 
construction locomotive he was driving careened out of control. He was 
hospitalized and several workers were less severely injured in the incident. 
Alleging "unacceptable safety and (construction) quality performance," transit 
officials announced the expulsion and a temporary shutdown of tunneling in a 
press release and pledged to take a firm stand against Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's 
alleged deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the state labor department fined Shea-Kiewit-Kenny $250,750 for 
"willful/serious" violations related to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that McSpedon withdrew the expulsion of Hutchins in July, when a 
Disputes Review Board for the project was considering the matter at the urging 
of the contractor. McSpedon told The Times that he acted before the dispute 
board ruled, in advance of a second hearing scheduled to review the matter. He 
said he did not know how the panel would have ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 14 memo addressed to transit authority board members, McSpedon 
offered this explanation for allowing Hutchins to return: 
</P>
<P>
 "As these difficult hearings progressed, it became increasingly obvious to 
both parties that no matter how the (review board) process finally concluded, 
there could be no winners and, in fact, the project would likely suffer" if the 
expulsion of Hutchins was not dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon added in the letter: "The contractor believes that reinstatement of 
his general superintendent is essential to his successful management of the 
remaining work on this contract. We concur that the superintendent is a 
valuable asset to the contractor's work effort, and would likely improve the 
execution of this important job." 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon said further that he and Shea-Kiewit-Kenny agreed to the 
reinstatement with two conditions: Hutchins' future performance would "be 
managed and controlled," and the contractor would have to achieve "a higher 
safety standard than originally specified in the contract" in order to receive 
bonuses of up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 According to materials prepared for the Disputes Review Board by McSpedon's 
staff, Hutchins in 1990 also was threatened with expulsion from a Los Angeles 
sewer tunnel project because he "verbally abused and physically assaulted" city 
personnel and "created a hostile and unsafe work environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins did not return calls Friday seeking his comment. Representatives of 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, controlled by the Walnut-based J.F. Co., have said that the 
firm's contract prohibits them from speaking to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor defended Hutchins in letters to the Disputes Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety and (construction) quality record of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny on this 
project, considering the difficult conditions it has encountered, has been 
exemplary and Norm Hutchins is in large part responsible for this record," said 
one letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins returned to the job July 18, four days after McSpedon circulated his 
decision. That same day, an explosion of acetylene and oxygen bottles rocked a 
tunnel on Vermont, seriously injuring three Shea-Kiewit-Kenny workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchins was not in the tunnel at the time and was not considered responsible 
for that event, according to McSpedon and others familiar with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But daily inspection reports reviewed by The Times show that the bottles 
continued to be repeatedly stored in what inspectors described as an unsafe 
manner in the weeks after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Again we find oxygen and acetylene bottles traveling (through the) tunnel on 
top of" a construction locomotive, inspector Steve Toney wrote, on Aug. 18. 
"Advised operator that it was illegal and unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Richard Simon contributed to this story.

FLASHY WHEEL RIMS LURE DEADLY VIOLENCE; CRIME: LAPD SOUTH BUREAU SAYS ROBBERS 
KILL ABOUT 10 PEOPLE A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They sparkle and beckon, luring the eye into an intricate, mesmerizing tunnel 
of deep-set cold, shiny chrome or gold-plated spokes. Wheel rims make the car, 
transforming even a rusty junker into a flashy, cherried-out ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killer rims," they're called, $1,500 to $7,000 a set. And now they are living 
up to their name. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a college basketball player lost his life on Normandie Avenue -- 
one of about 10 people killed every year for rims in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's South Bureau alone, according to detectives, who fear that a 
pattern of violence has emerged as rims have gained popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilling twist in Southern California car culture, drivers live and die 
over their wheels. Like overpriced sneakers, expensive rims have become 
improbable emblems of power and fearlessness, especially in crime-ridden 
neighborhoods where aficionados flirt with disaster every time they hit the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drive a car with flashy wheels and you are waving a red flag that says: 'Come 
get me,' " said Los Angeles Police Detective Pete Razanskas, who investigated 
the slaying of an 11-year-old boy in a bungled South-Central Los Angeles 
rimjacking last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlo Davis, a 23-year-old high-scoring guard on Cal State Sacramento's 
basketball team, found out the hard way. He liked the way that Dayton wire 
wheel rims looked on his baby blue 1989 Thunderbird. He liked driving down the 
street and seeing heads turn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 24, three days before he was scheduled to take an exam to become a 
police officer, Davis was shot dead at the carwash a few blocks from his 
mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to take those wheels off that car; I hated those wheels," said 
Virginia Davis, his mother, crying softly. "I was so upset with that car, I 
wanted to beat it with a hammer. But that wouldn't have done me any good -- it 
still wouldn't have brought Charlo back." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched by the lowriders of the 1950s and '60s, the rim fad has taken on a 
new dimension in recent years as manufacturers started using gold plating, 
stoking up the cost and dazzle. Today, Dayton Wire Wheels, produced by an 
Ohio-based company, are the rim of choice. Popularized by various rap stars, 
including Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose songs refer to "D's" or "Danas," rims have 
become more mainstream, appealing to the driver who wants to add glitter to an 
otherwise ordinary chassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Schardt, a company vice president who was reluctant to comment on the 
violence connected to the rims, defended the wheels. "People will kill people 
for anything; people in L.A. certainly know that," he said before hanging up on 
a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 But police believe that rims have become a factor. When a car-related crime is 
reported, detectives now want to know not only what type of automobile is 
involved but what kind of wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's getting worse every year. As the callousness of 
people grows, so does the lack of respect for people's property," said Lt. 
Sergio Robleto, commanding officer of the LAPD's South Bureau homicide unit. 
"Many times we are unable to determine the exact cause of a carjacking, but all 
too often we find the rims are there." 
</P>
<P>
 In an age of computerized automobile manufacturing, car rims -- one of the 
most vulnerable parts of a vehicle, subjected to dings during parking, dirt 
from the streets and water from inclement weather -- are also one of the 
easiest areas to personalize, said Brenda Jo Bright, a professor of Latin and 
Caribbean studies at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the simplest modifications to make your car look like you've 
really done something different," said Bright, who is writing a book about 
lowrider culture. "Cars are important vehicles metaphorically and intrinsically 
for the kinds of things people are allowed to do and expected to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, such transformations, whether wheels or exquisite paint jobs, 
inspired robbers but not violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It boils down to grim economics. Stolen rims move fast on the black market, 
selling for about half their retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy money," said Steven, 20, who asked that only his first name be used 
because he's looking for legitimate work after serving three years at Soledad 
state prison for holding a gun to a woman's head and commandeering her car. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue Chevrolet Blazer coming out of Cypress College caught Steven's eye 
because it sported expensive rims. He figured that he could net as much for the 
wheels -- $1,000 -- as for the car. So Steven thrust a 9-millimeter gun in the 
driver's face and demanded her car. The woman slammed the accelerator and 
peeled out. According to his probation officer, Steven jumped into a car driven 
by an accomplice and chased his prey along the freeway, shooting out her rear 
window. When his victim got stuck in Orange County rush-hour traffic, he got 
out and, clutching the gun, ordered her to give up the car. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the terrified woman complied and Steven pounced. "When you see a 
car, your adrenaline flows, you get really hyper excited. You want it; you 
don't want to let it go," he said. "It's like playing video games -- when 
someone is scared the enemy gets boosted up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such widely acknowledged dangers, why cruise the avenues in a 
rim-bedecked car? Wheel buffs have several answers. Aesthetics, says one. 
Attention, says another. Street respect, says a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an elite class: To have rims means you are a successful person," 
said Ricky Donnell Ross, known as Freeway Rick, once one of South-Central Los 
Angeles' most notorious drug lords, who used his illicit proceeds to purchase a 
now-defunct wheel shop. Ross, who completed a prison sentence recently, drove a 
car with rims until he felt that he needed to maintain a lower profile on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as Andrew Martinez, a 20-year-old high school graduate from 
Pico Rivera, enjoy being noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez works seven days a week to support his car, earning $5 an hour at a 
Whittier automobile tint shop. He purchased the 1978 Cadillac Coupe de Ville 
from its previous owner, who was heartbroken when it was stolen and recovered 
completely stripped. Using his savings, Martinez set about refurbishing it: a 
brandy-wine paint job, stereo, and, of course, $2,000 rims. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Martinez's car was stolen and stripped. When it was recovered, 
Martinez's heart sank. But he started over again. As soon as he could, he put 
on another set of Dayton rims. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues laugh at him because he takes the freeway to get to work, even 
though his home is only a few blocks from the shop. Martinez, however, believes 
that driving surface streets will only bring trouble. In fact, he tries to 
limit his driving so he goes few places other than home and work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't leave my car anywhere -- it's too dangerous," said Martinez, whose 
family has begged him to remove his rims. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Martinez made a crucial mistake and drove to the mall, where he was 
spotted by a carful of men in gang attire. Martinez quickly left when they 
pulled alongside. Telling himself not to panic, he zipped over to a grocery 
store and went in. But when he emerged, he saw the same car circling again. He 
jumped behind the wheel and drove to the San Gabriel River Freeway, losing his 
pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rimjackers are not the only hazard. Martinez is frequently pulled over by 
police who are suspicious of the baby-faced youth piloting a set of expensive 
wheels. He does not care. "It's just something I always wanted. I will some day 
get rid of them, but right now I'm having fun," he said. "It's not worth dying 
for, but I love driving my car." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Martinez, many wheel enthusiasts strike bargains with themselves, 
devising elaborate schedules to dodge danger and only driving in certain areas 
at specific times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ferguson, for instance, who was shopping recently for a set of 100-spoke 
Dayton wheels, figures he has a solution: two cars. The 27-year-old structural 
ironworker doesn't plan to often use his 1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville once he 
buys the fancy rims. "It'll be a car you drive on weekends when you have a lot 
of people," said Ferguson, a lowrider enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical car wheels, which have solid centers, are held on by lug nuts. Dayton 
Wire Wheels are suspended by spokes. Set in a deep dish, they are anchored by a 
round piece of metal, called an adapter, which is held in place by a knockoff 
bolted on top. They are easy to remove and lack visible serial numbers that 
would help police identify a stolen set. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not statistically track rim-related crimes, but after reviewing 
cases, Robleto estimated that 10 deaths each year in the 58-square-mile South 
Bureau were the result of fancy wheels. Police in other areas of the city said 
they do not see as many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of 11-year-old Jajuan Avenido of Lynwood, police knew almost 
immediately that the youngster's death was the result of a bungled carjacking, 
inspired by the gold and chrome Dayton rims on his cousin's 1982 Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Jajuan begged to go for a ride in his cousin Landry Wright's 
car. When his stepfather Larry (Junior) Newell said it was too late in the 
evening, the young boy turned to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama, why can't I go?" cajoled the sixth-grader, who wanted to be a truck 
driver when he grew up. "I want to listen to the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Since school hadn't started, Helen Allen relented and let her only child climb 
into Wright's car. At 10:20 p.m. on Central Avenue, two gunmen approached the 
car, one on each side, and ordered Jajuan and Wright to get out. Wright hit the 
accelerator and the gunmen opened fire. Wright was wounded in the shoulder. 
Jajuan, struck by a bullet in the head, slumped in a puddle of blood. He was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Several callers to the police explained the carjackers wanted the rims -- not 
the boy, not the car, Razanskas said. No one provided enough information to 
enable police to capture the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about the Daytons," said Allen, 31. "I wasn't thinking about 
nobody killing each other over Daytons."

U.N. SEEKS MORE U.S. TROOPS FOR HAITI MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing serious shortages of specialist troops, senior U.N. military officers 
arriving in Haiti this week told U.S. commanders that they will need at least 
1,000 more American troops than originally planned for a U.N. force that they 
now say will not be prepared to take over the U.S. military mission here until 
well into next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings with U.S. officers in Port-au-Prince during the last two days, key 
officers of the future U.N. military command said that after soliciting forces 
from more than 80 nations, they have commitments for fewer than 60% of the 
6,000 multinational troops that planners estimate will be needed to maintain 
stability and democracy after the United States hands over command to the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, according to the U.N. officers: At least 3,000 American 
soldiers will remain in Haiti, probably until February, 1996, under U.N. 
command, even if the U.S. force commanders and the bulk of the troops withdraw 
from the mission early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just some of the hard realities likely to fuel the American debate 
about the length of its Haitian intervention as the United Nations begins to 
prepare for its first joint military mission with the United States since 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters a day after arriving in the Haitian capital, commanders of 
the 60-member U.N. advance team that will eventually run the U.N. Mission in 
Haiti -- it already has an acronym, UNMIH -- said they told deputy U.S. forces 
commander Maj. Gen. David C. Meade that they will need the extra American 
forces, particularly engineering, aviation and logistics specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bangladeshis would love to give us another battalion of infantry troops, 
but our biggest problem is getting the specialized troops we need to make this 
mission work," said Canadian army Col. William Fulton, who heads the advance 
team and will serve as chief of staff, the third-ranking officer in the future 
U.N. multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said it is too early to predict when the United Nations will be 
prepared to assume command. First, he said, his team must determine that the 
U.S. forces have created a "safe and stable" environment in Haiti. That 
probably will take at least three or four more weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after Fulton's determination is approved by U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali will the United Nations begin to deploy its multinational 
force and the United States begin to withdraw its troops, a process he said 
will take at least several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "By early next year," he said, "we should be well on our way to being halfway 
through the transition." 
</P>
<P>
 With just 260 of those U.N. troops in Haiti so far, a combined force of 
soldiers from Caribbean nations, Fulton and U.N. civilian officials here said 
that the details of their future mission have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Just who will command that force remains unclear -- and a potential source of 
conflict between the Clinton Administration and Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said Boutros-Ghali is insisting that a general officer from a Caribbean 
nation serve as commander of the entire U.N. force, including all U.S. forces 
in the contingent. The mission's deputy commander would be an American general 
who also reports directly -- and only -- to the secretary general, U.N. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar command structure caused frequent conflict in Somalia and was partly 
blamed by U.S. military planners for some of the failures in the bloody 
mission, which left 42 U.S. servicemen dead before President Clinton pulled 
Americans out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This operation will work only if the American troops here follow absolutely 
the chain of command and the chain leads directly back to Boutros-Ghali -- not 
the White House," one U.N. source in Haiti said. This source stressed that U.N. 
peacekeeping experts in Somalia blamed the mission's failures on America's dual 
chain of command there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon is equally emphatic, however, that the U.N. force in Haiti will 
be commanded by an American, with a separate command channel leading back to 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Pentagon officials said Friday that they expect that a Jamaican 
will be commanding the U.N. contingent and that they are satisfied with that.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite any potential differences over command, the arrival of Fulton and his 
team just two weeks into the U.S. military intervention in Haiti underscored 
one major lesson that U.N. officials said the United States and the United 
Nations learned from Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're increasing the level of cooperation right from the start," said Eric 
Falt, the U.N. mission spokesman here. "It will not be a sudden transition as 
it was in Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 Army Lt. Col. Michael Bailey, a Pentagon planner who arrived with Fulton and 
will serve as his operations chief in the future mission, added that the 
meetings with U.S. commanders are aimed specifically at ensuring that the 
United Nations is better prepared here than it was in Somalia. There, an 
undersized U.N. force was attacked by fighters of Somalia's most powerful clan 
just a month after the world body took over command from the U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Col. Fulton, the most important thing is that we have sufficient force 
and we have sufficient logistical apparatus before we take over the mission," 
Bailey said. "These are the lessons learned in Somalia, and we're doing this 
one smarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, a native of Claremont who served briefly in Somalia, said he learned 
those lessons largely by taking part in a highly classified, monthlong 
post-mortem on the Somalia mission and the future U.S. military role in U.N. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicknamed the Montgomery Board, the seminar at the U.S. Army War College in 
Carlisle, Pa., was chaired by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, who was 
deputy commander of the U.N. military mission in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said another key lesson learned from Somalia will be to avoid 
personalizing the mission in Haiti. Critics of the Somalia operation, 
originally a humanitarian mission, say that the decision to portray Somali 
warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid into the main villain and to hunt him changed the 
nature of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "What caused much of the problem in Somalia was the hunt for Aidid," Bailey 
said, referring to the futile, months-long search by U.S. Army Rangers for the 
warlord after his supporters attacked and killed 25 Pakistani peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing here in Haiti is demonstrating a process -- a democratic 
process. It has nothing to do with personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bailey and nine other U.N. military planners here said the 
Somalia mission taught "how important it is to understand the environment we're 
in, to be more sensitive to the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the similarities between Haiti and Somalia, Fulton and his team 
stressed that there is one key, fundamental difference. As Bailey put it: "The 
biggest difference right now is that the Haitians want us here." 
</P>
<P>
 Crucial to maintaining that public support through a U.N. mission that is 
likely to last a year and cost more than $500 million, though, will be a clear 
explanation to Haitians about the reasons and goals of the U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the U.N. advance team acknowledge that much has to be done before 
that is clear -- even to them. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, for example, said he has yet 
to learn how his U.N. police observers and trainers will relate to a parallel 
U.S.-sponsored mission led by former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond 
Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military sources said Kelly's International Police Monitor program, which 
is funded by the State and Justice departments, eventually will merge with the 
U.N. police observers, who will then take over training at a new, U.S.-financed 
Haitian Police Academy and observe Haitian graduates in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials, however, said they hope that the police transition will be as 
deliberate and gradual as the transfer of military command. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalia has created a trauma within the U.N. system," one U.N. official said. 
"We're still reeling from it. We cannot allow the Somalia experience to be 
repeated. And at this point, at least, we are going to make sure it's not going 
to happen, because we're establishing good relations with the Americans right 
from the start."

SIMPSON'S ATTORNEYS ASK DETECTIVES FOR HAIR SAMPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to bolster their argument that police officers may have mishandled or 
planted evidence in the O.J. Simpson murder case, Simpson's attorneys have 
asked four detectives to supply hair samples so they can compare them to a hair 
from a bloody glove found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources close to the case, the request infuriated the officers, 
particularly when they learned that prosecutors had not objected to it. The 
defense has previously sought and been granted photographs of the shoes that 
officers wore on the night of the murders in order to compare them to bloody 
shoe prints leading away from the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both requests grow out of the Simpson team's efforts to establish that police 
officers investigating the murders botched the probe, compromising key 
scientific evidence. The defense attorneys have also suggested that one 
detective, Mark Fuhrman, may have planted a glove at Simpson's home, a 
suggestion that Fuhrman's attorney has vehemently denied and that police 
officials say would have been virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the latest attack on their investigation and by their belief that 
prosecutors failed to stand up for them, detectives took their complaint to the 
Los Angeles Police Protective League. One of them, Detective Ronald Phillips, 
went even further, consulting with attorney Darryl Mounger, a former police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions with Mounger and league representatives were held in private, 
but some details were relayed to Protective League delegates at a meeting this 
week. At that meeting, league Director Cliff Ruff briefed delegates on the 
defense request and the ensuing controversy, according to sources who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement sources, the detectives met Sept. 29 and 
grudgingly decided to comply with the defense request -- if only to prevent the 
Simpson team from later making an issue out of their refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, sources said, the four detectives -- Phillips, Fuhrman, Philip L. 
Vannatter and Tom Lange -- will supply hair samples so defense investigators 
can compare them with a single Caucasian hair found on a glove discovered lying 
near the feet of the two bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that the murderer wore that glove -- as well as a matching 
one found outside Simpson's Brentwood home two miles away. Analysis done so far 
on the hair suggests that it did not come from Simpson or from either victim, 
the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to comment on evidence in the case, Simpson attorney 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. confirmed Friday that defense lawyers are seeking hair 
samples from the four white detectives and added that they also hope to secure 
a sample from an African American officer who records show was among the police 
at the murder scene June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case have said that a hair found on Goldman's body has 
been microscopically analyzed, and that investigators concluded that it came 
from a black person. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding could help link Simpson to the murder scene, but if the hair 
matched the police officer's, that could defuse its value as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a reasonable request," Cochran said of asking the policemen for hair 
samples. "That's why the district attorney's office went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Monica city attorney's office is considering whether to file 
misdemeanor theft charges against a clerk who removed Nicole Simpson's medical 
files from Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center and provided them to a curious 
relative of the clerk, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The files have been returned to the hospital after Santa Monica police 
detectives hunted them down at the Playa del Rey home of the relative, who 
"denied making copies of the files and indicated that his sole reason for 
wanting the files was curiosity's sake," a police spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Cortrite, chief deputy of the criminal division, also said her office 
will probably make a decision by the middle of next week about what charges, if 
any, will be brought against the clerk and her relative. Police declined to 
release the names because neither was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking at is the possibility of theft-related charges -- petty 
theft, embezzlement or receiving stolen property," Cortrite said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office subpoenaed the medical 
records for use in its double murder case against the football great but 
discovered that they were missing and asked Santa Monica police to investigate 
Sept. 27, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The empty file folder which contained Nicole Brown Simpson's medical records 
was found in a clerk's file cabinet by a hospital supervisor," the spokesman 
said. "The clerk was subsequently interviewed by detectives and admitted to 
taking the files." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the clerk brought officers to where her relative worked, 
and the family member immediately led police to his house, where the files were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Braun, a hospital spokesman, said late Friday that the medical center 
"does not tolerate any breach of patient confidentiality. In this, we contacted 
the police, cooperated fully with the investigation and immediately terminated 
the employee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every employee has a critical responsibility to protect patient 
confidentiality. We stress that to them when they are hired and throughout 
their period of employment," he said. "It is rarely a problem. However, if any 
employee does breach patient confidentiality, they are subject to severe 
disciplinary action, including termination." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said the files have been turned over to the district attorney's office, 
and the hospital has retained a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A man who was jailed because he refused to testify before a grand jury 
investigating O.J. Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings, was ordered released 
Friday after his behavior was characterized as "illogical and irrational." 
</P>
<P>
 John Dunton, 32, was released from the infirmary building of the Men's Central 
Jail, where he had been held for a month, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had subpoenaed Dunton to testify before the grand jury after he 
reportedly gave the prosecutors secondhand information about the Simpson case. 
Dunton's lawyers have contended that their client never intended for his talks 
with prosecutors to be made public and that when he received a subpoena, he 
felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunton refused to testify before the grand jury, the lawyers said, because he 
feared retaliation from people other than Simpson or Cowlings. Dunton has not 
said from whom he feared such retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Zajec told Superior Court Judge 
J. Stephen Czuleger that his office had independently tried to corroborate the 
information Dunton provided and was unable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * A form was distributed to news organizations Friday asking members of the 
press to pledge not to broadcast an audio feed that Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito will allow to be used during the upcoming phase of jury selection. Any 
journalist who violated that pledge could be held in contempt, according to the 
form, which asks reporters to sign on behalf of their news organizations. Court 
representatives were not available to answer questions about the forms, which 
were distributed by officials of the Radio Television News Assn. and City News 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has attempted to rein in coverage of the case for weeks, threatening to 
pull the plug on television coverage altogether. And, responding to an article 
unrelated to the Simpson case, Ito on Sept. 30 sent a letter to the Los Angeles 
Daily Journal complaining about the use of anonymous sources, which he called 
the "legal world's equivalent of a drive-by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 That letter was distributed to his colleagues on the bench, and in an 
accompanying cover letter Ito advised that judges not grant interviews to the 
paper for its daily profiles until it agrees to stop using anonymous sources.

IRAQ SENDS TROOPS TO KUWAIT BORDER; U.S. ISSUES THREAT; MIDEAST: AS WASHINGTON 
WARNS IT WOULD INTERVENE, OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE UNSURE WHETHER HUSSEIN IS 
PLANNING INVASION OR IS POSTURING FOR RELIEF FROM U.N. SANCTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Iraq began massing troops near the Kuwaiti border Friday in an apparent effort 
to pressure the United Nations into lifting its economic sanctions. The action 
prompted a blunt warning from President Clinton that Washington will intervene 
militarily if Baghdad does not stop. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference at the White House, Clinton warned that it would be "a 
grave mistake" for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to repeat the miscalculation 
he made in August, 1990, when he invaded Kuwait under the assumption that 
Washington would not be willing to fight for the tiny emirate. A U.S.-led 
international coalition drove Hussein's forces out of Kuwait in the 1991 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after Clinton spoke Friday, the Pentagon disclosed that the 
aircraft carrier George Washington, which had been steaming in the Adriatic 
Sea, had been ordered to the Red Sea, accompanied by the guided-missile cruiser 
San Jacinto, which is equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Military authorities also began moving toward the area several maritime 
pre-positioning ships, which are stationed throughout the globe to transport 
troops, tanks, ammunition and equipment. They placed several Army and Air Force 
units on alert for possible deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy said the amphibious assault ship Tripoli and an accompanying 
amphibious-ready group were preparing to steam toward the Kuwaiti coast after 
loading up troops and equipment in Oman, at the foot of the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 As Middle Eastern neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt expressed support 
for Kuwait, the emirate called up its troop reserves, and its Cabinet went into 
emergency session. At the United Nations, Security Council President David 
Hannay summoned Iraqi U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun to explain the troop 
movements and to warn against provocations that could threaten Kuwait and 
regional security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let it be absolutely clear to the Iraqi government that a repetition of its 
past mistakes will be met by my government with the same resolve as before," 
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 A government spokesman in Baghdad admonished the world to mind its own 
business, saying outsiders "have no right whatsoever to discuss Iraqi troop 
movements within the boundaries of Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's enemies are looking for "false pretenses to prolong their aggression on 
Iraq and the starvation of its people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials cautioned that it is not yet clear whether the Iraqis actually 
are planning to invade Kuwait, in a reassertion of its longstanding territorial 
claim, or simply are posturing in an attempt to pressure the United States and 
its allies into granting them more concessions to provide relief from the U.N. 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts raised the possibility that Hussein was ordering the movements 
mainly to quell dissent within his own army. Reports from Baghdad, the Iraqi 
capital, have suggested that, in part because of the U.N. sanctions, the Iraqi 
army suffers a shortage of supplies and low morale. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Administration official said intelligence reports have suggested 
that Iraqi forces had been rounding up dissidents throughout the country 
recently, cutting off their left ears and carving Xs into their foreheads. And 
there were reports of an uprising last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi buildup involves about 40,000 to 50,000 troops, including two 
divisions of the elite Republican Guards. The push began Thursday, and the 
units sped toward the border Friday. Officials said the leading elements were 
only about 18 or 19 miles from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said the United States will step up its 
reconnaissance of the Persian Gulf region -- by repositioning spy satellites 
and increasing the number of reconnaissance flights -- to enable authorities to 
track the Iraqi movements more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to continue to watch this for the next 24 or 48 hours to see how 
things develop" before finally deciding what action to take, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not overreacting in any way. We are going to do our best to send an 
important signal" to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in Washington was tense. Clinton's top national security advisers met 
in the late afternoon, in part to review the situation, and officials said that 
further decisions might come sometime this weekend after Washington gets a 
better idea of Iraqi intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. strategists strongly implied that if the Iraqis continued to pour 
troops and equipment into the area, the United States would launch heavy 
attacks -- possibly including both air power and precision-guided missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Friday that Clinton met late in the day with Prince 
Saud al Faisal, the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, and won a pledge that the 
Saudi government would again cooperate with U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 And the British Ministry of Defense announced that it was sending an extra 
frigate, the Cornwall, to patrol off Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now has only a few hundred soldiers in Kuwait, and the 
border is largely undefended. During the Persian Gulf War, U.S. forces used 
Saudi airfields as staging bases for air strikes and armored operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the dilemma facing policy-makers is that U.S. troops, aircraft, ships 
and equipment are stationed so far from the area that it is likely to take 
several days to deploy U.S. forces in Kuwait. As a result, officials must move 
quickly to anticipate Iraqi action. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, strategists said Hussein is adept at feigning hostilities 
and pushing to the edge before pulling back. If Washington sends a sizable 
military contingent, it could be tied up indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials speculated that Iraq launched its troop movements toward the 
border to help pressure other countries -- particularly Russia and France -- to 
go along with its bid to lift the U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Security Council members want to grant Baghdad's request, but the United 
States, which has veto power in the council, has opposed it. The Security 
Council is expected to take up the issue formally Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said the push by Iraq is more likely to 
solidify allied opposition to lifting the sanctions than to split the major 
powers further. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Iraq also might have assumed that Washington would be too tied 
up militarily in Haiti to send troops to the Middle East. But Clinton sought to 
dispel that notion, saying: "Saddam Hussein should be under no illusions. The 
United States is not otherwise occupied." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the move by Iraq did raise questions among some observers about how 
effectively the United States would be able to mount military operations 
against Iraq while it has more than 20,000 troops -- and many of its transport 
aircraft -- tied up in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Pentagon and private analysts asserted Friday that the United States 
would have no major difficulties in meeting both challenges. Much of any U.S. 
operation in Iraq would be carried out by bombers or missiles. Officials said 
only 15,000 troops might be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters that U.S. forces are 
"prepared to make any necessary troop deployments" that Clinton orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have substantial capabilities in the region" already, he noted. Analysts 
said that Iraq now is much weaker than it was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the force that Iraq has assembled near the Kuwaiti border 
does not necessarily mean that Iraq is planning to invade. Baghdad often moves 
its divisions, and carried out similar moves six months ago, the last time the 
sanctions issue was on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has 80 warplanes and 800 troops in the region, along with 
substantial supplies of tanks, ammunition, parts and other equipment stockpiled 
in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia since the 1991 war. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 As Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz complained to the United Nations 
about trade curbs imposed during the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraqi troops amassed 
at the Kuwait border. President Clinton later warned Baghdad not to repeat the 
mistake of invading Kuwait. He also put troops on alert. 
</P>

CLINTON HOLDS OUT HIS RECORD AS ELECTION ISSUE; POLITICS: IN RISKY MOVE, HE 
URGES VOTERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS POLICIES AND WHAT THE GOP IS PROPOSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 President Clinton challenged voters Friday to turn the November midterm 
elections into a referendum on what course the nation should pursue over the 
next two years -- a high-risk strategy that flies directly against the desires 
of many of his party's candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to now resolve to give the American people a choice," Clinton said at 
a news conference. Americans, he said, must decide whether they want the sort 
of changes he has proposed but that Republicans have strived to kill in 
Congress or whether they prefer the very different kind of policies embodied in 
the GOP's much-debated "Contract with America."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he understands that many voters are distressed at what the 
government has achieved so far but warned against electing candidates -- 
Republicans, in his view -- who would make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters are going to decide whether this is the right direction and I hope 
they decide that it is," he said. "My only concern is that the American people 
not go out and vote against what they are for and vote for what they are 
against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting our economic house in order. Jobs are being created at home. 
We are moving in the right direction," he added. "It's only a beginning, and 
more could have been done. But too many times an idea for creating jobs, 
reforming government, educating students or expanding income, fighting crime or 
cleaning up the environment or reforming the political system was met by 
someone trying to stop it, slow it, kill it or just talk it to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, according to officials close to him, is convinced of two things: 
first, that despite setbacks on issues from health care to political reform, 
the record of his first 20 months in office is better than most Americans 
appear to believe and, second, that if he can just get out of Washington and 
make that case, the voters will agree.  
</P>
<P>
 "The record is a good one and there is ample evidence that, if people know the 
record, they respond to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democratic campaign strategists doubt that, however, and -- while they 
resist criticizing the White House in public -- many are chilled by the idea of 
an unpopular President urging Americans to vote up or down on the future of his 
policies. Across the country, Democratic candidates have been distancing 
themselves from Clinton, trying to focus the voters on local concerns, not 
broad, national themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In private meetings, many strategists have urged that the White House avoid 
precisely the sort of argument Clinton made Friday. Clinton plans to make his 
argument repeatedly in the month remaining before the election. White House 
officials already have scheduled appearances for him in more than a dozen 
states over the next two weeks with an even more hectic schedule planned for 
the final days before voters go to the polls Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 On other topics, Clinton delivered a strong defense of Henry G. Cisneros, the 
secretary of housing and urban development, and also said that he has not yet 
figured out what strategy to follow in reopening the health care debate next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has been investigating whether, at the time he was 
nominated, Cisneros had fully disclosed to the FBI that he had been making 
monthly payments to a woman with whom he had had an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have said that if the FBI concludes he was not fully 
forthcoming, Cisneros will resign. But Clinton indicated that he believes 
Cisneros will be exonerated.  
</P>
<P>
 "We know what the facts were at the time" he was named, Clinton said. "He is 
doing the job that I hired him to do for the American people and, as long as he 
is doing that job at a high level, I think he ought to be permitted to continue 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the midterm elections, the essence of Clinton's argument is that what the 
Republicans are offering is a return to Reaganism and he repeatedly accused the 
GOP of seeking to take the country "back to the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democratic strategists agree that many parts of the Republican "contract" 
are vulnerable to attack. While polls show Clinton is unpopular, voters have 
not, in hindsight, warmed to the policies of former presidents Ronald Reagan 
and George Bush, the Democratic pollsters have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already many Democratic candidates have begun attacking the GOP contract, 
arguing that the large tax cuts it urges would go primarily to wealthy 
Americans, that its calls for tax cuts and defense-spending increases would 
lead to huge deficit increases and that its advocacy of a balanced-budget 
amendment to the Constitution without specifying how to pay for it would 
require huge cuts in Medicare, Social Security or other popular benefits 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes many Democrats nervous is not the idea of attacking the Republican 
platform, but of trying to defend Clinton's policies. The White House has 
directed the Democratic National Committee to offer money to state parties to 
air a national television advertisement touting Clinton's record but many in 
the party are skeptical that candidates will want to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, on the other hand, have argued that Democrats are 
deluding themselves if they believe they can completely separate their fate 
from Clinton's. If the President can boost his approval ratings by even a few 
points, that could be enough to help some endangered Democrats over the top, 
they believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, for their part, already have been doing their best to make 
Clinton the issue in races across the nation. Many of them have said they 
welcome the chance to run the sort of referendum Clinton says he wants.  
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans should welcome the chance to make this election a referendum on 
the Reagan years versus the Clinton years," said Jack Kemp, the former 
secretary of housing and urban development, who may run for President in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 What Clinton calls obstructionism, many Republicans have argued, is no vice. 
"Saying 'no' to bad laws, bad programs and bad government is a good, positive 
thing," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), another possible 1996 presidential 
hopeful. "I'm not going to apologize for being an instrument of the public 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton faces two huge problems in making his case to voters. First, as even 
White House polls show, the majority of voters simply do not believe that he 
has accomplished as much as he claims.  
</P>
<P>
 On the deficit, for example, the budget legislation Clinton pushed through 
Congress a year ago has, in fact, resulted in a large reduction in the 
government's red ink -- an accomplishment that Clinton trumpets in nearly every 
speech he makes. But poll after poll has shown that most voters flatly do not 
believe the deficit has been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 A second problem, as Clinton acknowledged, is that -- despite nearly two years 
of solid economic expansion in most of the country -- the majority of Americans 
have not seen their own circumstances improve. This is particularly true of 
lower-income Americans on whom Democrats rely for support.  
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau reported earlier this week that in 1993, the nation's median 
income fell, average wages declined after adjustment for inflation and -- while 
the richest 20% of Americans continued to gain ground -- those on the lower 
half of the income scale were worse off. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made those trends the centerpiece of his campaign -- indicting the 
1980s as a decade in which the rich grew richer while the poor and the middle 
class suffered. Now, he said, while he believes his policies eventually will 
reverse those trends, he does not know if the results will show up before he 
must face the voters again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "These trends have been developing for nearly 20 years," Clinton said. "I 
don't think anyone thought I could turn them around in a year or that I alone 
could turn them around." 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he said, the country must improve the education and skills of its 
workers, increase the percentage of high-wage jobs in the economy and "bring 
free enterprise to the inner cities and the isolated rural areas."  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know" if that can be done in the two years remaining in his term, 
Clinton said. But, he added, "we have to stay on this course. If we change 
course in this midterm election . . . we'll be going in the wrong direction."

JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 5.9%, A 4-YEAR LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's economy enjoyed a healthy expansion of 239,000 jobs last month, 
cutting the unemployment rate to 5.9%, the lowest level in four years, the 
Labor Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently because job gains fell slightly below expectation, the financial 
markets, always fearful of inflationary pressures, remained calm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip stocks gained 21.87 points to 
close at 3,797.43 in moderate trading. Interest rates eased. The key 30-year 
Treasury bond yield fell to 7.91%, down from 7.96%, a 28-month high on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton was jubilant as the unemployment rate fell from its 6.1% 
level in August. "We're getting our economic house in order," he said during a 
White House news conference. "Jobs are being created at home." 
</P>
<P>
 But the national business expansion is still running far ahead of California, 
which is moving much more slowly out of the doldrums of recession. The state's 
jobless rate dropped to 8.3% last month, down from 8.9%. However, California's 
total employment still lags about 300,000 below its peak in June, 1990. The 
nation by contrast, has added 5 million jobs since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's unemployment rate improved to 8.3% in September, a sharp 
gain from 10.3% in the previous month. However, experts noted that the 
individual monthly figures are highly volatile, based on a small survey sample 
and without adjustment for seasonal changes, such as the return of summer 
workers to schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are looking for signs that the worst is over but it may not be 
that time in Los Angeles," said Vincent Canales, labor market analyst for the 
state's Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's jobs report marked another step in the delicate dance of expectations 
involving the business community and the financial markets. Corporations are 
enjoying increased orders with stable wages and generally want to avoid any 
actions that would make it more costly for them to borrow money.  
</P>
<P>
 But investors in the bond market still have deep-seated fears of inflation 
eroding the value of their bonds. They worry constantly that falling 
unemployment could signal labor market shortages leading to higher wages and 
then to higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really haven't had much true inflation but the bond market has become 
overly nervous," said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA business project. 
"Fears have been exaggerated, and markets are kind of hypersensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts had expected employment gains of 260,000 or 270,000 in Friday's 
national report. When the figure came in at 239,000, the markets were 
temporarily reassured. But there are still widespread expectations that the 
Federal Reserve Board could raise rates at its Open Market Committee meeting 
next month.  
</P>
<P>
 The reports on wholesale and consumer prices scheduled for next week could 
precipitate Fed action if those statistics show a blip in inflation, said 
Martin Regalia, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed wants to raise rates -- that is clear," he said. "They are perched on 
the cusp of the next increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's jobless rate was the lowest since October, 1990, when the jobless 
figure was 5.8%. However, the government revised its survey this year and the 
numbers may not be precisely comparable. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little doubt that a solid economic expansion is under way, 
although growth is somewhat slower than during the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the growth is coming in services, with major expansions in retail 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing is growing more slowly, because companies prefer to pay overtime 
and keep their work force stable, rather than hire new employees. The workweek 
averaged 42 hours last month, with 4.6 hours of overtime, some of the highest 
levels since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 123.6 million Americans working last month. Unemployment totaled 
7.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Gov. Pete Wilson said: "Although the unemployment rate is a 
volatile statistic, this demonstrates a continuing sign on an improving 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 14.2 million persons working in the state last month, a gain of 
149,000 over August, according to the government's household survey. A separate 
government survey of business payrolls, considered more accurate, showed a net 
gain of 4,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of unemployed Californians fell to 1.3 million, a healthy drop of 
77,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have started to make our recovery," said John O. Wilson, chief economist 
of the Bank of America. After averaging job losses of 167,000 a year between 
1990 and 1993, California should have a net job gain of 100,000 for this year 
and 150,000 next year, the BofA economist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aerospace and defense spending cutbacks have ravaged Los Angeles 
County, the decline in high-tech employment is slowing. A September drop of 300 
in high-tech jobs was the smallest monthly decline this year, the Employment 
Development Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outlook is still poor" in Los Angeles for the high-tech industries, said 
Canales of the EDD, warning against any premature optimism. The drop from 10.3% 
to 8.3% appears to be a statistical "anomaly," he said. There were 4 million 
persons working in the county, a gain of 62,000. Unemployment dropped to 
368,000, down 98,000 from August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's office said that the Los Angeles economy could indeed be 
strengthening because revenues from sales taxes and payroll taxes are showing a 
strong gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 7.7 million Americans looking for work but unable to find 
it during September, there were another 4.3 million part-time workers who 
wanted full-time jobs. Jobless Rates

year: 03,07,06,08 U.S. Calif. Sept. 5.9 8.3 Aug. 6.1 8.9 July 6.1 9 June 6.0

 FIGHTING BACK: Domestic violence might not be on the increase here, but calls 
for help have skyrocketed -- double over last year. And law enforcement sources 
say most have come since the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. Hot line calls also shot up at the local Women's Transitional Living 
Center, which aids battered women. . . . Says its spokeswoman, Melinda 
Everhart: "The Simpson case triggered awareness, especially after those 911 
tapes were played on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 WARDROBE HELP: Battered women are getting some extra help in their job 
searching. Working Wardrobes is having a workshop today for 150 women from 
local shelters at Our Lady Queen of Angels Parish in Newport Beach. The 
volunteer group, which helps enhance women's self-esteem going into the work 
force, will try to prepare them for a job hunt. And a bonus: Each participant 
will get five complete outfits suitable for interviews.

 HELLO COLUMBUS: Christopher Columbus' legacy as the man who discovered America 
has taken a bit of a beating in recent years. But he's still got big fans, like 
Claudio Arena, owner of Tutto Mare Restaurant in Newport Beach. Today, Arena 
will don a Christopher Columbus costume and spin yarns about Columbus' exploits 
to abused children from Childhelp Village. Then Monday -- Columbus Day -- he'll 
hold a $75 per person Italian buffet benefit dinner for them.

 SAWING TIME? The county's signs in English tell you its offices are closed 
every other Friday. But its Spanish signs, at the registrar of voters office 
and at nearby county buildings, read: "Este edificio estara serrado los 
siguientes viernes. . . ." meaning the county buildings will be "sawed off." 
The word should be cerrado (closed). . . . Says Fullerton College professor 
Kiki Zuniga, a Latino activist: "If the county was in compliance with 
affirmative action, that never would have been overlooked." Domestic Disputes

 Requests for police to respond to domestic violence are expected to double

D.A. TO REVIEW CHARGES IN SANTA ANA GANG RAID; LAW: ANOTHER OPERATION ROUNDUP 
DEFENDANT HAS A JAIL ALIBI. ACTIVISTS ASK IF LATINOS WERE UNFAIRLY TARGETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Orange County prosecutors announced Friday that they will take a second look 
at charges against more than 100 suspects arrested in a massive gang sweep 
after it was discovered that two more people may have been wrongly jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 After previously acknowledging they may have wrongly charged a man who already 
was jailed in Texas, the district attorney's office conceded Friday that 
another man with an ironclad alibi may have been mistakenly charged. This time, 
the defendant was locked in a California prison on the day he is accused of 
selling drugs on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
 And a supervising prosecutor revealed Friday that his office is trying to 
determine whether yet another man was wrongly charged during last month's 
Operation Roundup, the Santa Ana gang sweep that brought Gov. Pete Wilson to 
town for a much-publicized news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's revelations came two days after Orange County prosecutors, in a 
stunning move, admitted they were duped by a bogus confession from a disturbed 
man who said he set the devastating Laguna Beach fires. The district attorney 
dropped felony charges Wednesday against Jose Soto Martinez, 26, after learning 
that he was jailed in Mexico when the Laguna Beach firestorm broke out last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans said prosecutors will review all 
Operation Roundup indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans defended his deputies as doing the best they can in difficult 
circumstances and noted that prosecutors have acted quickly when presented with 
evidence in four separate cases that they may be pursuing the wrong suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not been a pleasant week for a person in my position, but it comes 
with the territory," Evans said. "Our office always strives to do the right 
thing and we will continue to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, prosecutors agreed to release a 20-year-old Santa Ana man who 
was arrested Sept. 8 during Operation Roundup after the Orange County public 
defender's office provided information that Luis Fernando Lopez was jailed in 
Texas on a theft charge on the day investigators allege he sold cocaine to an 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were awaiting documentation from Texas before deciding 
whether to dismiss charges against Lopez, who was held at County Jail for 
nearly a month on two felony drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, two more cases from Operation Roundup -- which targeted Santa Ana's 
West 3rd Street neighborhood -- came under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors dismissed drug charges Friday against 26-year-old Gustavo Martinez 
after the public defender's office presented information that the defendant was 
sitting in the California state prison at Avenol on unrelated charges on April 
15, the same day he was supposedly videotaped peddling narcotics to an 
undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen also revealed that his office is investigating 
whether an error was made in a fourth case involving Jose Aguilar, who was 
released from jail shortly after his arrest during Operation Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges are pending against Aguilar, but Jensen said his office independently 
raised questions about whether Aguilar could have committed the drug crimes. 
Jensen declined to elaborate on the case or to say what has caused prosecutors 
to question the validity of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But some defense attorneys and community activists said the four cases raise 
questions about whether Latino defendants were unfairly targeted for 
prosecution.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really wholesale justice," supervising Deputy Public Defender Jeff Lund 
said of the Operation Roundup cases. "The way these cases are being pushed 
through, there are bound to be mistakes and situations where people are 
convicted unjustly."  
</P>
<P>
 Art Montez, a locally based leader with the League of United Latin American 
Citizens, said he was not surprised that all four incidents involved Latino 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that Latinos in Orange County are being unfairly targeted as 
criminals, and accused law enforcement officials of seeking a scapegoat in the 
midst of the hotly contested campaign for Proposition 187, which seeks to strip 
illegal immigrants of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't see this happening with rich, white people," Montez said. "One 
wonders how many other individuals wind up in jail cells and wrongly 
convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, defense attorneys say it is an unhappy irony that only defendants 
who have such an airtight alibi as being in jail can overturn such charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund said he believes its clear from the police video that his client, Gustavo 
Martinez, was not the man taped selling drugs on the street. The attorney said 
he later learned that his client had an even better defense: He was in state 
prison when the sales occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund said his client was in County Jail on an unrelated offense last month 
when he was indicted in Operation Roundup and said his client did not spend any 
extra time in custody because of the wrong charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you wonder how many other people might be wrongly convicted if 
someone hadn't stood up for these guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the best intentions of police, Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said, 
greater care must always be taken when investigations result in dozens of 
defendants being taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happens in a fairly large operation, you are bound to have 
mistakes and misidentifications," Butler said. "This has been a unique week. 
I'm looking forward to next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said he is also concerned that Operation Roundup targeted a mainly 
Latino neighborhood and relied on an informant whose credibility has come under 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "By keying in on a certain gang, of course they are keying in on a certain 
population, and it could smack of discriminatory prosecution," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 During Operation Roundup investigators used FBI informant Henry Gomez, who has 
a long criminal history and admitted to the Orange County Grand Jury that he 
stole $115 from law enforcement officials while posing as a drug buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the probe, agents asked Gomez to point out drug dealers from 
unrelated booking photos, gang books and other sources to make the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Bill Tegeler said the undercover informant worked well 
during the operation precisely because he is a convicted criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This person was able to infiltrate the gangs," he said. "Anytime you use an 
informant like this, you choose someone like this because he has committed 
crimes in the past and that's how he knows to infiltrate these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Tegeler said his department's main goal was to clean up a troubled part of 
town where gang members and drug dealers ruled the streets. "We certainly do 
not want to prosecute someone who did nothing wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said police and prosecutors do their best to learn about the people they 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we don't also learn the entire background of an individual 
until they have been charged," he said. '

COLUMN ONE; MOVING VOTERS, NOT MOUNTAINS; HOW MUCH IMPACT DOES A GOVERNOR HAVE 
ON CRIME, IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY? NOT MUCH. OVER TIME, THOUGH, A CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE'S INFLUENCE CAN BE PROFOUND ON THE STATE'S PSYCHE AND POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pity the poor governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Leader of a nation-state of 32 million people, commander of a small army, boss 
to a quarter of a million civil servants, California's chief executive seems to 
hold awesome powers. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the issues that people care the most about right now -- crime, 
immigration, the economy and education -- a governor's impact is only marginal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those problems are simply beyond the reach of a governor's authority. 
In other cases, legislators, lobbyists and courts stand in the way. And even 
when a governor does get something done, it might be years before the public 
sees the result. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never know it though from listening to the campaign now under way 
for the job. Here, the candidates trawl for votes as if governors move 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown accuses Republican Pete Wilson of sleeping at the 
switch while the state lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, while thugs murdered 
innocent victims, and while school test scores floundered. She promises to make 
everything right again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson takes credit if a factory adds a job or two, or when local crime rates 
dip. And he boasts of cutting government spending -- something that never would 
have happened had a depressed economy not reduced tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 These claims and counterclaims tossed about in the heat of the campaign often 
have little connection to what a governor can or cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
 "A governor's authority, while probably more awesome than any other single 
Californian in terms of making a difference in people's lives, is still 
relatively limited," said Steven Merksamer, who was former Gov. George 
Deukmejian's chief of staff. "It's not nearly as great as people generally like 
to think." 
</P>
<P>
 California's governors, in some respects, are not unlike the managers of 
baseball teams: They can influence the game by naming the lineup and calling 
the signals, but the outcome almost always depends on factors outside their 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering these limitations, does it matter who is elected governor? The 
answer undoubtedly is yes, but not for the reasons that the candidates often 
would have us believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, a governor's impact can be profound. From Hiram Johnson to Earl 
Warren to Ronald Reagan, many of California's leaders have left indelible marks 
on the state's psyche and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most visible of all the state's officeholders, governors can rally the 
public to a cause, whether it be wresting power from a monopolistic 
corporation, building world-class universities and colleges, or undertaking a 
historic expansion of the state prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, a governor's primary powers are to propose a budget, sign and 
veto legislation and organize the executive branch, which while it employs 
about 250,000 souls, has fewer than 1,000 who depend upon the governor's good 
graces for their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors also appoint the state's judges and the members of important 
regulatory boards that do everything from setting utility rates to directing 
smog-fighting programs and controlling development along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has the power to grant clemency, which means that the occupant of 
the office can decide whether to spare a life or execute a condemned felon. 
</P>
<P>
 And during an emergency, a governor can suspend state laws and regulations, 
commandeer private property and call out the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Guard is not much help on the problems that most bedevil 
California today. There is no law for a governor to suspend when companies 
complain that Johnny may be able to read but can't perform other basic tasks 
required of entry-level employees in the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
 A governor does have a say in how much money the schools get and appoints 
members of the State Board of Education, which sets broad policies. But the 
schools really are run by locally elected trustees. Fixing what ails them would 
take years even if everyone in state and local government, the business 
community and labor were on the same political page, which they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true, to some degree, of the other issues in this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider crime. 
</P>
<P>
 While experts debate whether tougher laws have much bearing on criminal 
activity, a recent RAND study concluded that the new "three strikes" sentencing 
law would reduce serious crime 28%. That is a bullish assessment of the ability 
of the governor and lawmakers to improve the lives of the citizenry -- if they 
are willing and able to nearly double what the state is spending on its prison 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if that projection is accurate, it means that the lion's share of the 
serious felonies being committed would be unaffected by the toughest sentencing 
law enacted anywhere in the nation. There were 4,158 people murdered in 
California in 1992. How many fewer killings must there be before Californians 
feel that crime is no longer an important issue? 
</P>
<P>
 A great deal of crime, of course, is beyond the reach of stricter judges, 
longer sentences and more prisons -- the solutions advocated by those who would 
be governor. Demographics -- particularly the number of young males in their 
peak crime-committing years -- is regarded as the most important factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot you can do about it," said Peter Greenwood, an author 
of the RAND report. "A lot of it reflects larger societal trends." 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics on other issues are similar. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economy has suffered through an awful downturn mainly because it 
was hit by the twin blows of a national recession and reduced federal military 
spending. Governors -- in concert with the Legislature -- can raise or lower 
taxes, reduce or increase regulation, offer incentives for companies to stay 
here or expand, all of which can affect the pace of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's decisions are important at the margin," said Lynn Reaser, 
chief economist for First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, most experts say, the fluctuations in the state's $800-billion 
economy are more dependent on whether the Federal Reserve Board raises or 
lowers interest rates than whether the state, for example, trims the scope of 
its Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, the other major issue in this year's race, a governor's direct 
powers are even more limited. States have no ability to control the nation's 
borders, and they play no role in deportation proceedings. A governor is pretty 
much limited to pressuring the federal government into action, a task that 
Wilson has pursued with great vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the governor may be the state's chief executive, the job bears little 
resemblance to the CEO of a major corporation. Private executives answer only 
to their board of directors, whose members they often help choose. If the top 
executives decide that change is needed, they make it, then reap the rewards or 
suffer the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 But governors must share their power with the other branches of government. 
There are 80 members of the Assembly and 40 in the Senate. The governor needs a 
majority of those lawmakers for most major endeavors. The courts also can stand 
in the way, as they have when Wilson has tried to cut public employee benefits 
and reduce welfare grants, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Constitution deliberately established competing branches of 
government to check the power of the executive does not make it any easier for 
governors to accept the reality of their diluted authority. They know that 
voters -- thanks in part to the way campaigns are run -- hold them accountable 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Gov. Deukmejian, a Republican, often complained that the Democrats who 
controlled the Legislature tried to use their leverage to extract concessions 
from him whenever he proposed a new program or policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That can be very frustrating," Deukmejian said. "It's very difficult to 
understand how after you've had a statewide election and the people have chosen 
this person to go forward and carry out the program, the promises, the pledges 
he or she made during the campaign, they can be thwarted or blocked or held 
hostage by one key legislator who was elected by just 1/80th of the people in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the impact a governor does have can be enormous, if not immediate, and the 
results can be felt for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiram Johnson in his two terms in the 1910s brought forth the Progressive Era, 
wresting control of the state from the railroads and handing it to the public. 
More than 70 years after Johnson left office, the ballot initiative -- one of 
his creations -- still is being used by the voters to set policy that lawmakers 
refuse to enact. 
</P>
<P>
 This time-release nature of a governor's accomplishments can make it difficult 
to judge their record until well after they have left office. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown was trounced by Reagan when he ran for a 
third term in 1966. Years later, Brown was more appreciated for the vision he 
displayed in pushing development of a state water project, parks, highways and 
the higher education system -- the infrastructure upon which California's boom 
business years were built. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian in his time was seen widely as a passive governor, little more than 
a caretaker. But by reshaping the state's judiciary in his conservative image, 
he accomplished the one major goal he set for himself when he first ran for the 
job. The young judges he appointed will be dispensing rulings from the bench 
well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Some governors leave lasting legacies that run counter to the popular images 
we hold of them. Reagan is remembered as a conservative ideologue, but he 
signed laws responsible for such liberal staples as legalized abortion, 
automatic annual cost-of-living raises for welfare recipients, and the state's 
landmark Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan, however, did articulate a conservative vision for the state, and later 
the nation, and in doing so took advantage of what may be the governor's most 
important power: setting the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 No other state official commands the kind of attention afforded the governor, 
and a chief executive can exploit that opportunity to move public opinion, or 
to marshal it to pressure for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is more powerful than a compelling idea," said state Controller Gray 
Davis, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 California has become the prism through which the nation first notices 
fundamental shifts in its demographic composition, its multiculturalism, its 
relationship to Mexico and other Third World countries. So when governors talk 
about these subjects, what they say is heard throughout the country and around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one would postulate that in the sixth-largest commonwealth on the planet 
that the executive officer did not have this bully pulpit, then we are really 
in bad shape, and I don't think we are," said historian Kevin Starr. "That's 
why the governor's race is so intense this time. It's a position worth having." 
A Governor's Power 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY 
</P>
<P>
 A governor's primary powers are to propose a budget, sign and veto legislation 
and organize the executive branch. Other powers: 
</P>
<P>
 * APPOINTMENTS: Governors also appoint the state's judges and the members of 
regulatory boards that do everything from setting utility rates to controlling 
development along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLEMENCY: The governor has the power to 
</P>
<P>
 grant clemency, which means deciding whether to 
</P>
<P>
 spare a life or execute a condemned felon. 
</P>
<P>
 * EMERGENCIES: During an emergency, a governor can suspend state laws and 
regulations, commandeer private property, and call out the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * AGENDA: Many observers say that a governor's greatest power is enumerated 
nowhere: the power to set the state's agenda and marshal public opinion on 
behalf of a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 RHETORIC 
</P>
<P>
 KATHLEEN BROWN: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has had his chance and he has failed. That is the issue in this 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame Pete Wilson for the national recession or the end of the Cold 
War any more than I blame him for earthquakes or fires. But I do blame him for 
his failure to lead California through this time of crisis and to provide 
leadership when people need it most." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have leaders who can see the future, who understand it and who are 
willing to invest in it, who are willing to fight for it, and who care what 
happens to average Californians. That is why I want to be governor, and I'm mad 
that this guy hasn't done the job for the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does matter who sits in the governor's chair when it comes to 
restoring the promise of a quality higher education system to our middle-class 
families. It matters because, as governor, I will make it my mission to defend 
the principles of affordability and accessibility that have been under assault 
these last four years." 
</P>
<P>
 PETE WILSON: 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor of California must be many things -- a crisis manager when the 
earth shakes or the forest burns, a booster for California jobs across the 
country and around the world, a person of conviction who can stand up for 
what's right no matter what the consequences or who's opposed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back from that pleasant academic cloister, the U.S. Senate, to make 
change, and I'm running for a second term as governor to continue fighting for 
the change we need to improve our jobs climate and overhaul our welfare system, 
to improve the quality of our schools and reclaim our streets from violent 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to California has happened because of the recession, 
because of Washington making deep, deep defense cuts. . . . (Voters) clearly 
think that they've been through hell for the past 3 1/2 years, and they have. 
But they also are smart enough and honest enough to know that that is not of my 
making." About This Series 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of a gubernatorial campaign, the candidates sometimes dwell on 
matters that have little to do with the larger problems facing Californians in 
the years ahead. Campaign rhetoric has far more to do with what appeals to 
voters in the here and now. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and Election Day, Nov. 8., The Times will publish a series of 
stories -- State of the State: The Challenges Confronting California -- to 
provide a foundation for evaluating how the state is faring. Each story will 
include a description of what the candidates have said or done about these 
challenges -- and what they propose to do should Californians elect them 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's story sets the stage by exploring the limits -- and possibilities -- 
of gubernatorial power. The other installments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Changing population: Are demographic forces reshaping California more 
quickly than the political system can react? 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy and education: Are California's schools providing an underpinning 
for the state's economic future? 
</P>
<P>
 * Fiscal straitjacket: Can the state government solve its budget problems and 
provide for future growth? 
</P>
<P>
 * Environment: How will California balance environmental protection against 
the pressures of economic need? 
</P>
<P>
 * Poverty: What are the living conditions of California's poorest citizens, 
and what do they auger for the state's future?

 SNEAK PREVIEW: Notice something odd about the weather Friday? Those were the 
strange winds from the east, the Santa Anas. They're baaaaak. . . . but only 
for a few days. According to WeatherData Inc., a forecasting service, the Santa 
Anas should be gone by Tuesday. . . . The winds make people do strange things. 
Wrote author Joan Didion: "It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly 
dread, whenever the wind blows." 
</P>
<P>
 WRONG SHOW: People offer all kinds of excuses when stopped by the cops. But 
one Newhall motorist, chased by the CHP on Friday for reckless driving, picked 
a doozy. . . . After officers followed him from Santa Barbara to near Magic 
Mountain, the driver explained he had seen a TV truck on the road, and assumed 
he was on "Candid Camera." Nice try, but next time, pick a show that is still 
on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 OVERPOWERING: Running back John McPherson (above) helped Van Nuys High bowl 
over Grant in a Valley Pac-8 Conference football game Friday afternoon at Grant 
(C12). . . . McPherson scored twice and teammate Larry Reed added three 
touchdowns as part of a 52-25 victory for the Wolves. For complete high school 
football results, see Valley Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY TOGETHER: Palmdale should be packed today as folks gather for the 
two-day fall festival. More than 35,000 people are expected to show up for the 
event, which includes concert performances by two rock 'n' roll legends -- the 
Turtles and America (B11). . . . Don't worry about the sun. Organizers are 
putting up 35,000 square feet of tents to keep people in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW STATUS: The Jewish Spectator, a quarterly based in Chatsworth, is shedding 
its longtime independence. It has become linked to the University of Judaism in 
the Sepulveda Pass (B13). . . . In the new issue, Rabbi William Kramer of 
Burbank's Temple Beth Emet writes Jews are in denial about spousal abuse: "In 
the past 18 months, I've talked to at least one family a month with this 
problem." Michael Arkush

UNLICENSED CONTRACTOR NOW IN NORTHRIDGE; RECONSTRUCTION: MAC BAGBY LOST HIS 
LICENSE IN SAN DIEGO, WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LAWSUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK B. WILLIAMS and JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A contractor who authorities say left a trail of unfinished houses and a 
criminal investigation by the district attorney's office when he departed San 
Diego earlier this year is now doing business in quake-ravaged Northridge with 
a new company and using a license not registered to him. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles he blends easily with the hundreds of other contractors 
repairing quake-damaged homes and attracts relatively little attention to 
himself. But 120 miles away in San Diego, contractor Mac Bagby has earned a 
distinction that some of his customers and authorities won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego D.A.'s office is investigating Avon Home Remodelers and 
Builders, a company where he was executive officer, for fraud. State 
authorities revoked that company's contractor's license -- under which Bagby 
operated -- and angry homeowners have filed numerous lawsuits accusing Avon and 
Bagby himself of fraud and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to stop him before he just does it to more people," said Karen 
Isbell of San Diego, who has filed complaints with the Contractors State 
License Board and the San Diego district attorney's office, alleging she lost 
thousands of dollars in her dealings with Bagby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's in L.A.," Isbell said. "It just keeps going on and on. It's 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Bagby said in an interview that he is unaware of any criminal 
investigation in San Diego and that none of the accusations made by homeowners 
there "have anything to do with my work in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have numerous satisfied customers out here (in the Valley) who are happy to 
be back in their homes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But already Bagby is the subject of a complaint filed with the state 
contractors board by a Woodland Hills couple alleging that he took a deposit 
check and now refuses to return it. 
</P>
<P>
 Board officials say they have not started their investigation of that 
complaint but they said Bagby no longer holds a valid contractor's license and 
is not registered as a sales agent. It is unlawful for unlicensed contractors 
to engage in construction work that requires a license. Home improvement sales 
agents, who sell and negotiate contracts, must be registered with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. David Stutz, who is in charge of the probe there, 
said his office is investigating Bagby and Avon, his former San Diego company, 
for diversion. That is a pyramid scheme in which the money homeowners pay a 
contractor to complete a specific job is instead used to begin other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stutz, who identified Bagby as an executive officer at Avon, said Bagby was 
described in many of the suits filed by San Diego homeowners as the main 
negotiator of contracts and is the focus of much of the D.A.'s investigation 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not surprise him that Bagby had moved to the Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are like telemarketers," Stutz said. "They just keep moving on to 
another customer." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has been like a magnet, attracting contractors to the Valley from as 
far away as Arizona and Nevada, state contractors board officials said. Calls 
to the board's Van Nuys office have increased more than threefold as homeowners 
have made complaints against both licensed and unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, Bagby and his brother, Shawn, have been associated with U.S. 
Builders & Development Corp., a Northridge company with an office on Reseda 
Boulevard. Signs placed in the yards of homes under construction indicate that 
U.S. Builders is involved in at least four Valley projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Bagby -- who is also known by the name Mehrdad Baghbeh -- 
said he is only acting as a consultant on behalf of the company. But on a 
construction contract viewed by The Times, his name is clearly signed as the 
contractor/seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph and Linda Mazzei say they contracted with Bagby to repair their 
quake-ravaged Northridge home in early July after seeing a sign for U.S. 
Builders in a Northridge yard. According to Joseph Mazzei, "Bagby represented 
himself as the contractor and even signed the contract as seller and 
contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mazzeis, however, are satisfied customers; their only criticism is that 
the work is a few weeks behind schedule, as is typical of large construction 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like they (Bagby and his brother) have good taste, plus they also 
helped us out with the insurance agency to get more money to repair our house," 
Joseph Mazzei said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, thousands of San Diegans watched Bagby on the evening news as 
tearful homeowners accused him of abandoning their homes before the job was 
complete or of performing shoddy work. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABC affiliate aired seven segments featuring Bagby -- one in 1989 and six 
in 1993. In at least one of the programs, Bagby contended that the unfinished 
homes were the result of shoddy work by subcontractors who had been working for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Had she seen those news segments, Tina Van Benschoten of Woodland Hills said, 
she might have thought twice before signing a contract with Bagby. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Van Benschoten and her husband, Matt, contracted with Bagby to repair 
their quake-damaged home on Mariano Street. In their complaint to the 
contractors board, the couple said they gave Bagby a check made out to U.S. 
Builders for a $14,500 deposit on a $44,500 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Benschotens said that after their insurance company, State Farm, gave 
them the first estimate of how much the repairs would cost, Bagby met with 
insurance officials and negotiated an additional $34,000 in repair money. 
</P>
<P>
 When the couple refused to agree to the higher estimate and told Bagby they 
were unhappy with what they describe as his poorly crafted job contract, they 
contend he refused to return the deposit. Tina Van Benschoten said the check 
has since been cashed, even though no work was ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby, whose name is signed on their contract as the "contractor/seller," 
admits that he cashed the $14,500 check and said that he will not return the 
couple's money. They should honor the contract and let him do the project, 
Bagby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never let me start building," he said. "They are the ones who tried to 
take advantage of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Benschotens have retained a lawyer and demanded that Bagby return the 
money or face a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 State law provides that only a licensed contractor can legally request a 
deposit and only in the amount of "$1,000 or 10% of a contract, whichever is 
less," said officials with the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Mac Bagby nor his brother is licensed as a contractor or a home 
improvement salesperson, officials say. According to the contractors board, the 
license number on the Van Benschotens' contract actually is that of another 
company, W.B. Schulte Construction, formerly of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby is not listed on Schulte's license nor is he a registered salesman for 
that company. Repeated phone calls to the company's owner, W.B. Schulte, were 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Contractors State License Board has no record of U.S. 
Builders & Development Corp., even though it has a listed telephone and Bagby 
answers the phone there. 
</P>
<P>
 "No such entity exists," said Larry Chafe, assistant regional director of the 
contractors board's central region, which includes Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities with the contractors board in San Diego said they contacted their 
Los Angeles counterparts about Bagby. But officials in Los Angeles cannot act 
"until we believe some law has been violated here," Chafe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby's difficulties with the contractors board -- and with his customers -- 
are not new. He has a long and tangled history of violations with the board -- 
violations that prevent him from working again as a licensed contractor for at 
least five years, said Paige Rousch, an assistant regional deputy with the 
contractors board. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Bagby was issued a contractors license for a company he owned, 
Cadillac Builders. But within a year board officials cited Bagby for offenses 
including poor workmanship, diversion of contract funds and requesting 
excessive down payments. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of winding through the legal system, the case was finally resolved 
and that license was revoked in January, said Philip Treas, district supervisor 
in San Diego with the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby eventually began working as executive officer for Avon Home Remodelers 
and Builders Inc., a company owned by his father-in-law, Bernard Greenberg. But 
at Avon he once again got into trouble: He was investigated four times by the 
contractors board for the misdemeanor offenses of selling construction 
contracts even though he was not a registered sales agent, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cases were referred to the San Diego district attorney's office, which 
began an investigation in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials revoked Avon's license in July for a string of violations they 
say were linked to Bagby, including abandonment of projects, diversion of 
funds, poor workmanship, deviations from plans and specifications and violation 
of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, neither Bagby nor his father-in-law, Greenberg, can reapply 
for a contractor's license until July, 1999, and then the company would have to 
pay a disciplinary bond of $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty serious revocation," Chafe said, noting that the company "is 
effectively out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The violations that resulted in the revocation of Avon's license also form the 
heart of several lawsuits. Those same violations are part of the San Diego 
district attorney's investigation, Treas said. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigation last year resulted in prosecution, during which Bagby 
pleaded no contest to "attempted illegal disposal of hazardous waste (asbestos) 
and destruction of evidence," said Steven Gold, who heads the Consumer and 
Environmental Protection Unit in the district attorney's office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records say that in March, 1993, Bagby illegally removed and then dumped 
asbestos taken from the home of Chris and Dayon Higgins of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his sentence, Bagby was ordered to pay $20,000 in restitution to 
the Higginses, take out asbestos warning ads in the local paper and perform 
community service. He is still on probation from that case, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 That Bagby has managed to escape serious repercussions and is still in the 
contracting business despite the revocations and investigations frustrates 
those San Diego homeowners who feel they were wronged by him. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, they have been entangled in legal battles and in some cases face 
severe financial hardship because of their dealings with Bagby, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael and Nancy Biggane, for instance, had plans for an ambitious addition 
to their San Diego home. In May, 1993, they found Bagby through a friend. Work 
started in June, but a month later the project stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple paid Avon a total of $50,000, according to the contractors board, 
but the company failed to pay both the lumber company and subcontractors. 
Eventually the construction workers stopped showing up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Left with their home half done, the Bigganes did the only thing felt they 
could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take over the building of it," Nancy Biggane said. 
</P>
<P>
 But finishing it meant shelling out more money, and the money ran out before 
the job was done. More than a year later, the house is only about 90% finished. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before the couple learned from a local news report and by 
word-of-mouth that more than a dozen other San Diego families were claiming to 
be in the same straits -- alleging they were victims of Bagby and the Avon 
company. In fact, said Nancy Biggane, she later hosted meetings of those 
families as a kind of group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the San Diego homeowners who contracted with Bagby ended up with 
multiple problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state contractors board records, in case after case, -- often 
contracts negotiated by Bagby -- Avon failed to pay debts to subcontractors 
like construction workers, specialists such as cabinetmakers and roofers and 
the suppliers of lumber and other building material. Those companies then 
placed liens against the homeowners' properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, a person or company can file a lien to recover payment 
for improvements to a property. The action can eventually result in the loss of 
a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Maria Murietta, who paid Avon $34,700 to remodel their Chula Vista 
home, found themselves with more than $17,000 in liens against their property 
after the company allegedly abandoned the project.  
</P>
<P>
 The Murpheys, Mary and Tro, contend in their civil suit that they paid Bagby 
more than $120,000 to build their dream home last year. But after just one 
month of construction, the work suddenly stopped. A complaint brought by Chris 
Higgins, who claims Bagby failed to finish a second-story addition to his home 
last year, is scheduled for trial Dec. 2. Higgins said he is fighting to make 
sure Bagby "pays for what he has done to so many families." But he is worried 
that the Bagbys may know the legal system better than he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the financial burden of pursuing legal action and finishing their 
houses, the ordeal has levied a heavy emotional toll on the families involved. 
Nancy Biggane said her elderly mother-in-law, who owns the house, was baffled 
by the idea of liens and the possibility of losing the home she has owned for 
years. "She's totally bewildered by all of this," Nancy Biggane said. "She's 
distraught. She's been hospitalized just because of this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about the same time the lawsuits and debts began piling up, Bagby 
tried to file for bankruptcy, saying he was more than $350,000 in the red, 
court records show, but his petition was denied. His father-in-law, Bernard 
Greenberg, filed for bankruptcy in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate records indicate that Bagby has deeded property to his wife. 
According to records, Bagby transferred property in October, November and 
December, 1993, and as recently as March of this year. His wife, Joan, is the 
owner of property in both Los Angeles and San Diego valued at more than $2.1 
million, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that kind of transfer is a common device to try to protect property 
from seizure in a court settlement, San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. Stutz said if 
criminal charges are filed against Bagby as a result of the Avon investigation 
any property he has owned during the last few years can be frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stop him from what he does tomorrow," he said, "I can only penalize 
him for what he did yesterday."

CULTURE; RESURRECTION TO ATONE FOR SINS OF SOVIET PAST; YELTSIN SAYS REBUILDING 
A MOSCOW TEMPLE DESTROYED BY STALIN WILL HERALD A RETURN TO RUSSIA'S LOST 
HERITAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If one piece of real estate symbolizes the struggle for Russia's soul, it is a 
984-foot-wide pit by the Moscow River not far from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, when construction workers fenced it off and drained it, the 
place was a complex of outdoor swimming pools. But that was only one chapter in 
a bizarre history now coming full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chapter One, the world's largest Orthodox cathedral stood there. 
Consecrated in 1883, the Temple of Christ the Savior accommodated 15,000 
worshipers, a grandiose monument to the dual authority -- secular and divine -- 
of the czar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chapter Two, Christ the Savior became one of the world's largest demolition 
projects when Soviet dictator Josef Stalin decided to replace it with a temple 
to Communist supremacy. Looted and dynamited, the cathedral crumbled in 1931 
and Stalin commissioned work on a Palace of Soviets that was to stand taller 
than the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
 But the swampy site proved incapable of supporting such a monster -- divine 
punishment, believers say. With the coming of World War II, and then Stalin's 
death, the palace never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter Three, in 1960, saw the abandoned site turned into a network of heated 
pools, where bathers could frolic in subfreezing weather while steam rose from 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in Chapter Four, the Russian Orthodox patriarch and Moscow Mayor Yuri M. 
Luzhkov have unveiled plans to rebuild Christ the Savior on its original site 
and according to Konstantin Ton's 19th-Century design. Luzhkov assigned 
Mospromstroi, a construction company controlled by the city, to start work. 
</P>
<P>
 The project and its estimated minimum $300-million price tag are as 
controversial as the history behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers, including President Boris N. Yeltsin, say Russia needs the cathedral 
to herald the return of its lost culture and religion, to atone for excesses of 
its Soviet past. Critics call the cathedral, built to commemorate Russia's 
defeat of Napoleon in 1812, a waste of money and an inappropriate salute to 
militarism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to start this sacred venture," the mayor said in announcing the 
project. "Russia is ready financially and, what is more important, morally. Our 
generation should compensate for the huge damage done to our cathedrals, to the 
Russian Orthodox Church, to the Russian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Soviet authorities ended restrictions on religious life five years ago, 
thousands of Orthodox parishes have sprung to life. Yeltsin and other 
post-Soviet leaders find it politically prudent to attend services and adopt 
the causes of Russia's dominant church. 
</P>
<P>
 Luzhkov and Alexy II, the Orthodox patriarch, have set up a foundation that is 
supposed to finance the new cathedral entirely with private money -- from the 
church and its faithful, from bankers and other newly rich entrepreneurs who 
want their names on a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics cite Czar Alexander I's promise that the original cathedral would be 
paid for by donations; it ended up costing the state a fortune over 45 years of 
construction that dragged on after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the church is separated from the state, let it build the cathedral and not 
stretch its hand into my pocket," said Maria Lukashenko, a Moscow mother of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the project is politically driven. Luzhkov wants the outer 
structure restored for Moscow's 850th birthday in 1997 and the inside finished 
for services by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 For such an ambitious work in Russia, the timetable will be hard to meet. And 
it is uncertain whether the builders can duplicate the 19th-Century techniques 
that supported a cathedral more than 30 stories high, laden with marble and 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the remake cannot be more than an imitation, because so many 
splendid original icons, sculptures and frescoes were looted. The city is 
appealing for their return and hopes to get the main altar and dazzling 
iconostasis back from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 Others question whether $300 million would be better spent restoring parish 
churches and religious life -- "the only assurance that the cathedral will not 
be left empty in future years," Dmitry Popov wrote in the Moscow Times. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, though, the idea of a new cathedral is popular in Moscow; one 
opinion survey showed 65% backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Christ the Savior cathedral from my childhood," A. P. Dyachenko, 
80, wrote to a Moscow newspaper. "It was so big, and I was so small. I thought 
that it was God Himself. It must be restored, no question."

ARMS TRADING; S. AFRICA FIRM UNDER THE GUN TO EXPLAIN WAYWARD WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An aging Danish freighter, now anchored off Port Elizabeth, is an unseemly 
reminder of this nation's unsavory past -- and uncertain future -- in the 
shadowy world of international arms trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the Arktis Pioneer are enough guns to equip a fair-sized army -- almost 
25,000 AK-47 and G-3 assault rifles, plus 14 million rounds of ammunition. But 
controversy rides with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The rifles were bought from Armscor, South Africa's state-owned weapons 
broker, by a Lebanese middleman named Eli Wazen. Armscor says Wazen provided an 
end-user certificate, the required international document, showing that the 
guns were for the government of Lebanon. The ship sailed for Beirut on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a still-unfolding scandal, the vessel instead went to Hodeida, a Red 
Seaport in war-torn Yemen. Press reports suggesting that South Africa's new 
government would fuelarmed conflicts in Africa, not to mention violate an 
international arms embargo against Yemen, have created huge embarrassment here 
as President Nelson Mandela completes his state visit to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Armscor officials claim that they were conned. Wazen faked the certificate, 
they insist, and now has dropped from sight. The Justice Department has begun 
to investigate. For now, there are more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear why the ship did not off-load in Yemen, for example, or what will 
happen to the cargo now. The intended recipient of the guns has not been 
identified. Armscor has denied press reports that the cache was meant for Jonas 
Savimbi's rebel UNITA forces in Angola. That too would violate a United Nations 
arms embargo.  
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps most important, it is not clear if Armscor was duped for the first 
time, as officials insist, or whether it was simply the first time the 
company's long-covert business practices were exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, until the last U.N. sanctions against the old apartheid regime were 
lifted in May, all of Armscor's foreign trade violated international law. The 
United States retains an arms embargo because Armscor and two former 
subsidiaries are under a 1991 federal indictment in Philadelphia for allegedly 
smuggling banned military components to South Africa and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the errant arms shipment simply reflects Armscor's long tradition 
of subterfuge and deception. "This is one of the old-type Armscor 
transactions," said Bill Sass, a retired brigadier who is now senior researcher 
at the independent Institute for Defense Policy. "A year or so ago, this was 
how they did most of their business." 
</P>
<P>
 Armscor spokesman Don Henning doesn't deny it. "Up until May, we were never in 
the position to demand end-user certificates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armscor's dirty side was never very secret. Under apartheid, they armed the 
police who brutalized black townships, helped the government develop a nuclear 
weapon and sold arms to renegade states such as Iraq, Libya and Sudan. Despite 
sanctions, Armscor boasted that it was South Africa's largest exporter of 
manufactured products and the world's 10th-largest arms dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, Armscor has desperately tried to fend off critics who say the 
new government should not sell arms and should divert military spending to 
hospitals, schools and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 With exports last year of about $250 million, South Africa controls about 0.5% 
of the world arms trade. Armscor aims to double exports this year, and double 
them again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials fear that the current uproar has hurt Armscor's image. "We 
believe it's had a very negative impact on us," Henning said. "We lost 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Sass said he doesn't fear for Africa's strongest weapons industry, however. 
"Wars may come, and empires may change, but arms companies go on forever," he 
said with a laugh.

PACKWOOD ETHICS PROBE IS STILL UNFINISHED -- 19 MONTHS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The preliminary investigation of Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) remains incomplete 
after a 19-month probe of sexual misconduct and other matters, the Senate 
Ethics Committee announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays in obtaining Packwood's diaries have left the inquiry more than a year 
behind schedule and postponed a decision on holding public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 During the remainder of the year, the committee said, it will review tapes of 
the diaries, finish taking a sworn statement from the senator "and undertake 
any additional inquiries necessitated by the review and deposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing a status report after months of official silence, the committee said 
in a written statement that it has yet to receive the tapes -- which may, 
according to the panel, have been altered by Packwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Provided the tapes are received and no unforeseen circumstances arise, the 
committee staff will then prepare the preliminary inquiry report for 
presentation to the committee," the statement said. "Any discussion of the 
future course of the inquiry will occur after the committee receives the 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen women have accused Packwood of making unwanted sexual 
advances, and some have accused him of touching and kissing them against their 
will. Several were Senate employees at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is also looking at job offers that businessmen and lobbyists made to 
Packwood's wife while the couple were going through a divorce -- and his 
alimony payments were being determined.

SHUTTLE'S ORBIT LOWERED TO GET 3-D RADAR MAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Endeavour dipped closer to Earth on Friday to create 
astonishingly detailed 3-D radar maps of the planet that might one day enable 
scientists to predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 By retracing its orbital steps and passing over the exact spot two days in a 
row, the shuttle can use its radar to map the same ground features from 
slightly different angles and detect changes in terrain as small as half an 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if we could globally monitor earthquake faults prior to the eruption 
of earthquakes and see very minute changes in those earthquake faults, or if we 
could look at volcanoes as the domes start to expand," said astronaut-physicist 
Peter (Jeff) Wisoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might lead to some type of early-warning system for population centers 
that are nearby those earthquake faults or volcanoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Flying over the same spot on Earth is easier said than done -- there are no 
road markers or maps in space. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA has never attempted to match shuttle orbits before. Earlier this week, 
flight directors succeeded in bringing Endeavour's orbit to within 30 feet of 
where it was during a similar radar-mapping mission in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real test came Friday. Commander Michael Baker lowered Endeavour's 
altitude from 135 miles to 127 miles -- one of the lowest ever for a space 
shuttle -- to begin duplicated passes just 24 hours apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday afternoon, the radar surveyed a swath of North America, from 
western Canada to the Great Lakes to the Chesapeake Bay. Endeavour is supposed 
to fly the same course today so the radar can scan the same area. Repeat 
observations are planned over Africa, the Middle East and Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining these repeated images, scientists hope to produce topographic 
maps of incredibly high resolution -- accurate in elevation to within six yards 
or less, compared to the current 10 yards and more. These "stereo" views will 
allow researchers to detect changes in the Earth's surface as small as half an 
inch, said Mike Sander, project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena.

WOMAN ALLEGING THEFT OF BABY GAINS CUSTODY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who claims her baby was stolen from her womb two years ago during a 
Cesarean section at a clinic in Mexico regained custody of the boy Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end, the truth comes out and everything is fine. Everything is great," 
said Laura Lugo, emerging from the courtroom with tears of joy. "He's ours." 
</P>
<P>
 State District Judge Robert F. Barnes ordered the 2-year-old boy to be taken 
from foster care to Lugo's Brownsville home this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes issued the ruling on the basis of two rounds of DNA tests that ruled 
out Paulyna Botello as the biological mother. The genetic tests indicated a 99% 
chance that Lugo is the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugo, 27, has seen the boy in only three brief visits since he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 She claims Botello and her sister, Rosa, befriended her, then lured her to a 
clinic in Matamoros during her final month of pregnancy for what she believed 
would be a routine prenatal exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugo says doctors drugged her, delivered the child, then gave him to Paulyna 
Botello, who raised him as her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Botellos are charged in Mexico with child abduction; they face no U.S. 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulyna Botello, 33, a Mexican citizen who lives legally in Texas, is in 
custody in Brownsville awaiting extradition. Rosa Botello is at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The Botellos say Lugo agreed to give up the boy because of financial problems, 
then changed her mind and made up the story about an abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got his room ready and everything. We're all waiting for him," Lugo 
said. "We are a loving family. We want this baby. He's going to be loved very, 
very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy -- named Rafael Olvera Jr. by Paulyna Botello -- has been in foster 
care since she was arrested June 30 by the FBI on a fugitive warrant from 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Lugo said she will rename the boy Jorge Daniel Alaniz, using her maiden name. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnoldo Cantu Jr., the court-appointed lawyer for the boy, urged the judge to 
delay transferring custody for a few weeks and have Lugo visit the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want this to happen, judge, I just don't want it to happen overnight," 
Cantu said. "I think it would be traumatic for the child." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lugo's lawyer, Dorina Ramos, said her client has no car and could not 
afford to make frequent hourlong trips to the foster home in McAllen.

WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CULT CHIEF, AIDE; OFFICIALS SAY THEY MAY NOT HAVE DIED; 
SWITZERLAND: POLICE SAY THE TWO MEN WERE SEEN BEFORE SEVERAL FIRES ERUPTED. 
AUTHORITIES RAID HOUSES, SEIZE DOCUMENTS.

<P>
 An international arrest warrant was issued Friday for doomsday sect leader Luc 
Jouret and his chief aide, reflecting investigators' growing concern that the 
men may be at large after the mass murder-suicide of 53 of their followers in 
Switzerland and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss police said Friday that both men were spotted in this Alpine village the 
afternoon before fires broke out in three chalets, where 25 of the sect members 
apparently had been killed by drugs or poison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible that Mr. Jouret is among the dead; it is possible he isn't," 
said Beat Karlen, spokesman for the police investigating the deaths of 23 
people in a farmhouse in Cheiry, north of here. "We are looking into all 
possible theories." 
</P>
<P>
 However, investigators are following strong leads that suggest one or more 
people were present just before the fires at all three locations where bodies 
were found in Canada and Switzerland. Although police originally called the 
deaths of the Swiss, French and Canadian cult members a "collective suicide," 
they now say they believe some victims were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 And until all the victims have been identified, authorities are operating on 
the assumption that the leaders may still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 As the probe widened Friday, police in Geneva raided several houses and 
apartments connected to the group, the Order of the Solar Temple, confiscating 
financial documents and membership lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss police have also detained several sect members for questioning, and 
others are being sought. None has been arrested, and the arrest warrants for 
Jouret and his deputy, Joseph Di Mambro, do not mention a charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the fires, and the fact that the gun used in the deaths in 
Cheiry has not been found, has complicated the case, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fire, apparently triggered by a timing device, was started late 
Monday or early Tuesday in a duplex in Canada owned by Di Mambro. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five victims in Canada were alive when the fires started, autopsies 
have indicated. The three others, including a 3-month-old baby, were killed 
before the fire began. On Friday, police classified those three as murder 
victims. The two adults -- a Swiss citizen and his British wife -- were 
discovered Thursday wrapped in a carpet and blankets in the basement of the 
duplex. The body of the couple's infant son was found a few hours later wrapped 
in a plastic bag and hidden behind a water heater in the basement. The child 
had been stabbed as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bodies carried wounds made by a hand weapon, probably a knife," said 
Michel Brunet, a Quebec provincial police spokesman. He said later the three 
definitely had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's head was hooded with a plastic garbage bag, similar to those found 
on some of the cult members in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been living in a village near the chalet that had served as 
headquarters for the cult. Their car was found at Montreal's Mirabel 
International Airport. Police theorized that the killer probably drove the car 
to the airport and took a flight out of Canada. That would have given the 
killer time to take part in the mass suicide and murder in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The next afternoon, Jouret and Di Mambro were seen in the village of 
Granges-sur-Salvan. Swiss radio quoted the region's investigating prosecutor as 
saying the two had sought the aid of a locksmith to enter one of the chalets. 
The owner of a grocery store near the chalet has said Jouret bought 30 to 40 
garbage bags that day. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, fire broke out in the sect's farm house in Cheiry, about a 
75-minute drive northwest of Granges-sur-Salvan. Three hours later, the fires 
began in the three chalets used by the group in Granges-sur-Salvan. Among the 
reported victims there was Di Mambro's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the answers to the remaining mysteries, including the timing of the 
deaths that preceded the fires, depend on the outcome of autopsies being 
conducted by Dr. Thomas Krompecher, a respected pathologist at the University 
Center of Legal Medicine in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
 Krompecher said Friday that he had completed autopsies on 12 of the 48 victims 
in Switzerland. Although he declined to reveal the causes of death, he said he 
had seen evidence of an injection in the arm of one victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five of the bodies have been positively identified. Although the names 
have not been released, Canadian authorities have named four of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Krompecher said neither Jouret nor Di Mambro was among those so far 
identified. He added that he had yet to receive dental and other records on 
those two men, which he said will be necessary before any identification could 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of about 14 victims, from the chalets in Granges-sur-Salvan, had 
been badly burned. Krompecher said it will be days, if not weeks, before 
autopsies on those bodies can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Piller, the Swiss prosecutor leading the investigation in Cheiry, said 
police found cars belonging to three cult members who left the farm shortly 
before the fires broke out. He declined to say whether the cars were owned by 
survivors or by people who died later in Granges-sur-Salvan. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mysteries is the whereabouts of the weapon used to shoot 20 of the 
23 cult members discovered in the Cheiry farmhouse. (The others probably were 
suffocated by the plastic bags on their heads, police have said.) Although 52 
bullet casings were found, they had not been fired from the three rifles that 
police discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was certainly another person who put several bullets into the heads of 
these victims," Piller has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Granges-sur-Salvan, police are still making discoveries in the burned 
ruins. On Friday, they said they found vials of what appeared to be 
tranquilizers, hypodermic syringes and intravenous drips. None of the victims 
in Granges-sur-Salvan, including at least four children, had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said all appeared to have been drugged by a "powerful" substance, still 
unidentified, that could have killed them. Farewell letters from some of the 
victims have been found, police said, and a lengthy letter apparently from the 
group, saying it was "leaving this earth to find a new dimension of truth and 
absolution," was sent to a Swiss cult expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorities also found a Canadian passport and several driver's licenses, 
apparently belonging to victims, in cars parked outside the chalets. Police 
declined to comment on reports that Jouret's Canadian driver's license was 
among those discovered there. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Geneva, where Jouret, a homeopathic doctor, had a practice and led 
regular meetings of the sect, have sealed off several homes and apartments used 
by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss newspapers reported Friday that bank documents and other papers 
confiscated from those houses suggested that the group's members had argued 
about finances in recent months.

7 KILLED IN INDIA AS HINDUS, MUSLIMS FIGHT OVER LANGUAGE

 At least seven people were killed and 113 injured when Hindus and Muslims 
clashed in a crowded market Friday over a language dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Police opened fire twice after failing to stop the fighting in Bangalore with 
nightsticks and tear gas. Four people were killed by police gunfire and three 
by stabbing, said Sharad Chandra Burman, a senior police official in Karnataka 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Rioting began after Muslims inside a mosque threw stones at Hindus marching 
through the marketplace to protest new Urdu-language broadcasts on state 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindu activists have protested daily since the 10-minute newscasts in Urdu, 
the language of India's Muslim minority, started on Sunday.

SOME SAY CULT HAD REPLACED LEADER; QUEBEC: GROUP'S TREASURER SAYS NEW CHIEF 
DIED IN SWITZERLAND. MEMBERS WHO REPORTEDLY JOINED SPLINTER GROUP WERE ALSO 
AMONG VICTIMS.

<P>
 As specialists, friends and associates tried Friday to shed more light on the 
doomed Swiss-Quebec cult that is somehow mired in more than 50 deaths, the 
picture only grew murkier. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the cult's treasurer insists that Luc Jouret, the supposed chief of 
the cult now sought by the Swiss police, lost the leadership position seven 
years ago and took three of its most prominent members -- all apparently among 
the dead found in Switzerland -- out of the cult with him a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 This version of events -- which contradicts Quebec and Swiss police reports 
that describe Jouret as the cult's current leader -- was repeated by Roger 
Giguere, treasurer of the Order of the Solar Temple, to both the Montreal 
Gazette and a Quebec radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 Giguere said Jouret was succeeded as president and grand master of the order 
by Robert Falardeau, a Quebec civil servant who was one of the victims in the 
mass murder-suicide in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Giguere acknowledged that Jouret, a Belgian doctor, was an incredibly dynamic 
speaker. But he said the doctor become too egotistical and too outlandish in 
his futurist predictions for the taste of most order members. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret then founded another sect, known as ARCHS -- the French acronym for the 
Academy of Research and Knowledge of the High Sciences. He then won the 
allegiance of temple members such as Mayor Robert Ostiguy of the town of 
Richelieu, his wife and Quebec journalist Joce-Lyne Grand'Maison. All three 
died in Switzerland this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Giguere's comments may simply represent an attempt by surviving members of the 
order in Quebec -- estimates of their number vary from 30 to 50 -- to 
disassociate the group from Jouret now that he is officially a fugitive. But 
there is evidence that there had been some kind of split within the order in 
recent years and that Jouret had a penchant for setting up new, yet 
interlocking, organizations in both Quebec and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 To confuse matters even more, some police believe that the real power behind 
Jouret was a Swiss businessman named Joseph Di Mambro, who was Jouret's partner 
in the ownership of the three buildings that served as cult headquarters.  
</P>
<P>
 Government-run Radio Canada reported that Di Mambro may have used the cult as 
a front for an international arms-smuggling ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Canada said Di Mambro sold the arms and laundered millions of dollars in 
Canadian banks and in the purchase of real estate that he then sold to cult 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kind of financial crisis may have overtaken these organizations recently. 
Giguere said Falardeau had gone to Europe to straighten out business dealings 
involving the European branch of the Solar Temple. Falardeau had informed him 
by phone recently, Giguere said, that the Europeans wanted to depose Falardeau 
and stop paying dues to the Quebec temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives continued to insist Friday that the victims were 
upstanding citizens who had joined the Solar Temple only because of Jouret's 
motivational teachings and their desire for an intense religious experience. 
Those who knew that their friends had joined the temple did not think of the 
sect as bizarre in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 La Presse, a Montreal newspaper, reported that the journalist Grand'Maison had 
twice proposed that the editors hire her as their Swiss correspondent. She had 
traveled often to Switzerland, she told the editors, and had many friends 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Audsley, her British husband, told Radio Canada he believed she had 
become less involved with the cult in the last few years, although she 
continued her close friendship with other members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew members of the order," Audsley said. "They were very normal people 
with many responsibilities. They wanted to do something positive in this world 
and to go farther than others." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sainte-Anne-de-la-Perade, where the Solar Temple operated an organic farm, 
neighbor Danielle Auclair told La Presse: "Don't judge! It's too easy and, 
what's more, they are gentle people who live in harmony with nature, in 
equilibrium with themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Auclair said she had worked on the farm and listened to lectures by Jouret but 
had never joined the sect. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Jouret, in the lectures, "offered us a way of living and, as he had 
so much magnetism and charisma, the things he taught were extremely 
attractive."

KOHL'S POPULARITY UP, BUT COALITION VICTORY IN VOTE FAR FROM ASSURED; GERMANY: 
CHANCELLOR SELLS CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS AS SECURE CHOICE. ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED. 
BUT SISTER PARTIES MAY FALL SHORT IN OCT. 16 ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First, his wide forehead appears through the crowd; then his familiar jowls; 
suddenly, a smiling Chancellor Helmut Kohl bursts 6-foot-4 into the October 
night, extending a beefy hand to well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 On friendly turf in this town of conservative entrepreneurs, the chancellor 
crisscrosses the plaza before storming up to the podium on one of his final 
campaign swings before the Oct. 16 federal election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secure Into the Future," says an election poster behind him. Other posters 
bear no words at all, satisfied just to picture the beaming chancellor amid a 
throng of supporters: Kohl himself is the picture of security. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is he? 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor for the last 12 years and seeking a fourth term, Kohl sells himself 
as the veteran statesman, the leader who helped reunify Germany and build the 
European Union. He asserts in a folksy baritone that he is the one who has 
steered Germany through its worst recession since World War II, the leader of a 
country at peace with its neighbors, the candidate of stability. 
</P>
<P>
 But his most urgent message on this Thursday night -- and at a rare press 
conference Friday -- is just a nitty-gritty appeal for votes: His ruling 
coalition might not have enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no vote to give away. We need every vote to continue the politics of 
good sense, the politics of a coalition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the 64-year-old Kohl has risen dramatically in popularity since the 
beginning of the year, when polls and pundits were forecasting his political 
finish over an ailing economy. Back then, they said the country was hungry for 
a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has turned around in the last six months -- on Friday, Kohl told 
reporters to expect 2.5% growth this year -- and today there is no doubt that 
his Christian Democratic Party will again garner the most votes among a handful 
of parties, thanks largely to Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian 
Social Union, apparently do not have enough votes to govern alone, and their 
junior coalition partner, the liberal Free Democratic Party, or FDP, could lose 
out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDP has failed to win legislative seats in the last six state elections. 
Now, several polls show that the FDP may not register the 5% of the federal 
vote needed to win seats in Parliament, which then elects the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's cover of the weekly magazine Der Spiegel carries a torn photograph 
with half of Kohl's face and half of his challenger's, Social Democratic Party 
leader Rudolf Scharping. 
</P>
<P>
 "FDP slides down: Kohl's majority crumbles. A Change of Power After All?" asks 
the headline. 
</P>
<P>
 Various polls give Kohl a slight lead over Scharping, and the magazine 
predicts a tight race on election day. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kohl, the come-back chancellor, is pulling out the stops. He tells his 
crowds the choice is clear between his center-right Christian Democrat-FDP 
government or a leftist Social Democrat-Greens government that would have 
support from the reformed Communists of the former East Germany, the Party of 
Democratic Socialism. He then proceeds to demonize the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 In rally after rally, the old Cold Warrior launches into a tirade against the 
Social Democrats for having formed a government in the state of Saxony-Anhalt 
this summer with the tacit support of the former Communists. He takes credit 
for ridding Germany of Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experiences of the fall of the Weimar Republic have taught us the lesson 
that there shall never be common ground with Nazis, neo-Nazis, Fascists and 
Communists of any kind," Kohl said to his Limburg crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have paid dearly in Germany, first with the Brown dictatorship and then 
after the division, with the Red dictatorship. . . . We have had enough of 
Communists in Germany," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he warned that the country's economy was at stake: A Social 
Democrat-led coalition would scare off international investors and ruin the 
country's reputation as a reliable ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Democratic leader Scharping has denied that he plans to form a 
government with the former Communists. He also stopped his own free-fall in the 
polls recently with a late but impressive show of unity with more charismatic 
rivals in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "troika" by the European press, Scharping and his colleagues Oskar 
Lafontaine, the premier of Saarland state, and Gerhard Schroeder, premier of 
Lower Saxony, finally stopped bickering and began appearing together at 
campaign rallies to take on Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong," says the party's new campaign posters showing the troika 
shoulder-to-shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scharping has an image problem among voters who find his toothy smile 
forced. In an election of personalities, he is seen as stiff compared to the 
down-home Kohl. Some Germans believe that the bright career politician and 
premier of Rhineland-Palatinate talks down to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "His face is too perfect," said Torsten Roeder, 18, a student and undecided 
voter at the Kohl rally. Kohl, he said, seems to be "a capable man." 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing Kohl seems to have going for him, however, is something he 
really didn't do at all: the end of the recession. At the end of an economic 
cycle, unemployment had dropped to 3.5 million in September from a postwar high 
of 4.04 million in February.  
</P>
<P>
 Werner Fruehwirth, 45, who works in an optical factory, said he would be 
voting for Kohl because "I feel good. I have a job and can make quite a good 
living. And I think Kohl has done a good job with the unification." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the cost of unification -- about $300 billion to the West so far? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have cost just as much with the other guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kohl isn't taking any chances. He goes after the uncommitted with a litany 
of his good deeds and prods his own supporters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let anybody tell you that this election has already been decided," he 
said. "Nothing has been decided yet."

REFUSING TO JOIN MORATORIUM, CHINA CONDUCTS NUCLEAR TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China on Friday conducted its second nuclear test this year, defying pressure 
to join an international moratorium on such blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement confirming that an underground 
nuclear test had been conducted, the official New China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The test explosion was China's third in just over a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House issued a statement declaring that the United 
States "deeply regrets" the Chinese nuclear test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge China to refrain from further nuclear tests and to join the other 
nuclear powers in a global moratorium," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department said other nuclear powers around the world have honored 
the moratorium on nuclear testing since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The first news of the test, which had been expected for weeks, came from 
Australia, which said the blast had an estimated yield equivalent to between 40 
and 150 kilotons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 China also conducted tests in October, 1993, and June, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese statement did not say where the test was conducted or give its 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 China is the only one of the five major nuclear powers still conducting 
nuclear weapons tests. Russia, France, Britain and the United States are 
observing a voluntary moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 China maintains that its tests have been limited in scope and says its nuclear 
weapons are solely for defensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese statement said China was "actively participating in the 
negotiations" for a global Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "China will put an end to its nuclear test once the treaty comes into effect," 
the statement said.

IRAQ BACK TO SQUARE 1 ON SANCTIONS; MIDEAST: BUILDUP OF TROOPS 
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO EFFORTS TO GET U.N. TO LIFT CURBS THAT HAVE CRIPPLED THE 
NATION'S ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By sending some of his best troops south toward the border with Kuwait, Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein seems to have shattered his country's hope of having 
the United Nations lift the sanctions that have devastated its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the troop movements came Friday as Iraq's top diplomat, Deputy Prime 
Minister Tarik Aziz, was appealing to the United Nations to lift the sanctions, 
which he said are responsible for growing malnutrition, inadequate medical care 
and widespread suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly devoted almost entirely to the issue 
of sanctions, Aziz claimed that Baghdad has fully implemented many of the 
conditions imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's defeat in the 1991 
Persian Gulf War and is entitled to at least partial relief from the sanctions. 
But he said the United States has prevented the council from relaxing the 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 From Iraq's standpoint, the most troublesome sanction prohibits Baghdad from 
selling its oil on world markets except under a tight U.N. supervision in which 
all of the revenue would be devoted to humanitarian relief within Iraq and to 
payment of war reparations to Kuwait. Iraq denounced the restrictions as a 
violation of its sovereignty and refused to sell its oil under those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq offered no explanation for advancing its forces toward Kuwait. A Defense 
Ministry statement said only that Iraqi troop movements on Iraqi territory were 
no one else's business. But coupled with Aziz's speech in New York, the action 
seemed a particularly heavy-handed -- and almost certainly self-defeating -- 
attempt to intimidate the world community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is a serious deployment, then it runs counter to any interest in 
lifting the embargo," said William B. Quandt, a former National Security 
Council Middle East expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are trying to get countries to ease up on the embargo, it seems 
counterproductive, because one requirement for lifting the embargo is for them 
to respect the Kuwait border," said Quandt, now a professor at the University 
of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions originally were imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 
August, 1990. After Iraq's defeat the following year in the Persian Gulf War, 
the Security Council ruled that the sanctions would remain in place until Iraq 
destroyed its nuclear and chemical weapons programs, ended persecution of Kurds 
and other Iraqi minority groups, recognized the sovereignty of Kuwait and 
accepted a U.N.-imposed settlement of a border dispute with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the latest troop movements, Iraq seemed to be making some headway in 
its effort to win the right to unrestricted sale of its oil. Earlier this year, 
U.N. inspectors reported that Iraq was in substantial compliance with the 
provisions requiring destruction of its nuclear weapons potential. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said recently that his country -- like the 
United States a permanent member of the Security Council -- believes that it is 
time to allow Iraq to resume oil sales, at least for a trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States continues to insist that the sanctions be kept in place, 
saying the Iraqis have not complied with all aspects of the resolution. Iraq 
has not yet officially recognized Kuwait or accepted the border demarcation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech to the General Assembly, Aziz bitterly attacked the U.S. 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States of America is persistently obstructing any steps toward the 
direct legal application of the resolutions of the (Security) Council, 
particularly those provisions relating to lifting sanctions from Iraq, and is 
conducting itself on the basis of biased political motives which bear no 
relation to either the resolutions of the Council or the (U.N.) charter," he 
said.

HAITIAN SENATE SENDS AMNESTY BILL TO ARISTIDE; CARIBBEAN: LEGISLATION LEAVES 
QUESTION OF IMMUNITY FOR COUP PARTICIPANTS IN OUSTED PRESIDENT'S HANDS. SO FAR, 
CEDRAS STAYS PUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian Parliament completed work Friday on a limited bill renewing and 
slightly expanding the right of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to extend 
political amnesty to the military forces that overthrew him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 9-1 vote, with one abstention, the Haitian Senate passed a bill already 
approved Thursday by the Chamber of Deputies. A copy of the provision was sent 
by fax to Aristide for his signature, and it will become law when it is 
published here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure itself does not provide for amnesty, nor does it define who would 
be qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it leaves the question of political amnesty entirely to the 
discretion of Aristide, who has said frequently that he could not give immunity 
to anyone involved in the September, 1991, coup who engaged in "general" or 
"criminal actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The new measure renews amnesty powers granted the Haitian president under two 
existing laws and contains language that appears to increase Aristide's 
latitude in exercising those powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an accord brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Sept. 18, 
the leaders of the military who overthrew Aristide agreed to give up power upon 
passage of "a general amnesty" or by Oct. 15, whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Haitian army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras said after the 
Senate vote that the parliamentary action falls short of the Carter accord 
requirement and that he would not resign, at least not before Oct. 12, the 
anniversary of his appointment as head of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. officials visiting here said they will consider the possibility of 
forcing Cedras to leave in the next few days on grounds that the Parliament's 
vote did meet the accord's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.S. official indicated that the measure would be used as leverage to 
ensure that Cedras not only retires from the military quickly but that he 
leaves Haiti altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that we would like to see him leave the country," said yet 
another U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. Army teams, backed by tanks and mounted machine guns, 
continued their disarmament program in Haiti. Acting on intelligence supplied 
by detained Cedras aide Jerry Murra, a large force raided the Citadelle 
Protection Agency, arresting five security guards as suspected paramilitary 
members and confiscating four shotguns, an M-1 rifle, an Uzi submachine gun and 
two pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear the Army's ongoing crackdown on Haiti's paramilitary forces, in 
which more than 80 suspected agents have been taken into custody, was paying 
off. Throughout Friday, several pro-democracy demonstrations snarled traffic in 
the capital but passed without incident.  
</P>
<P>
 With U.S. MPs heavily patrolling and protecting the route of the march, 
thousands of demonstrators cursed Haiti's generals and praised Aristide and the 
United States as they paraded through the same district where marchers in a 
similar pro-democracy rally were clubbed and shot at by civilian thugs a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some carried giant U.S. flags or portraits of the ousted president as they 
paused outside the Haitian army's headquarters to kick and spit on an effigy of 
Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Baubrun summed up the sentiment of many in the crowd at the end of 
the three-hour march. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm demonstrating for Aristide today," he said. "I wasn't pro-Aristide 
before. But I spent four years doing nothing -- not working. Now I'm convinced 
he's the only one who can save the country."

ARISTIDE FOE TALKS, AND U.S. LISTENS; CONTROVERSY: CIA, EMBASSY TIES TO LEADER 
OF PARAMILITARY GROUP RAISE QUESTIONS IN CONGRESS. OFFICIALS CITE PARADOXES OF 
INTELLIGENCE WORK. 
</P>

<P>
 During the three years of Haiti's military regime, Emmanuel (Toto) Constant 
ran one of the country's most feared paramilitary groups, terrorizing opponents 
of the government and even humiliating the United States by forcing the Harlan 
County, a cargo ship carrying peacekeeping troops, to turn tail and withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of that time, he was also an agent in good standing with the CIA. And 
today, Constant is once again working for the U.S. Embassy here, acting as a 
source of intelligence for diplomats and military officers -- protected, at 
least for the moment, from arrest for his earlier actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's back, and he's providing information," a U.S. official in Washington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Constant is being paid for his work, the official replied, "You 
think he does it for free?" 
</P>
<P>
 Constant's new role as a U.S. intelligence source -- he had also been an 
informant in earlier years -- is explained by American officials as merely one 
of the normal paradoxes of intelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We often have to deal with unsavory characters," a CIA official said, 
shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant is being consulted because he may have information about potential 
resistance movements against the U.S. military force occupying Haiti or against 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is scheduled to return from exile next 
week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his new role has already led to controversy among members of Congress, 
who want to know how close the U.S. link with the anti-Aristide agitator will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, members of Congress expressed amazement that Constant was a CIA 
"asset" and was apparently being paid even as he helped destroy the Clinton 
Administration's policy toward Haiti by blocking the landing of the Harlan 
County a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post reported today that the CIA paid Constant more than $500 a 
month from 1992 until 1994. Officials refused to confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre ceremony of repentance this week, Constant turned himself in to 
the commander of U.S. forces here, Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton. U.S. officials had 
earlier threatened him with arrest and said he might still be punished if he 
fails to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Constant stood on a wooden podium built by U.S. troops and 
read a statement that turned out to have been written by Stanley Shrager, the 
U.S. Embassy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only solution for Haiti today is the reality of the return of Aristide," 
he told the television cameras as U.S. troops stood guard. "Put down your 
stones; put down your tires. No more violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Constant is head of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, or 
FRAPH, a shadowy political-military group created, controlled and funded by the 
Haitian military and believed to be responsible for several killings and 
terrorism since its founding in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 His televised statement, officials said, was intended to show any remaining 
FRAPH militants that their day is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FRAPH has been used as a civilian cover for brutalizing pro-Aristide 
and other anti-military elements here, its most notable act was the 
organization of a mob of about 100 thugs last Oct. 11 to oppose the docking of 
the Harlan County, a U.S. Army cargo ship carrying American and Canadian 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined force of engineers and other technical personnel was scheduled to 
land to carry out a training and construction mission as part of an agreement 
to restore Aristide and remove the military from power. 
</P>
<P>
 But FRAPH's thugs marched to the pier, harassed U.S. diplomats and threatened 
to attack the American-Canadian forces if they disembarked. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Harlan County turned back, Haiti's military leaders reneged 
on their agreement to restore Aristide, and the United States was humiliated, 
at least until U.S. troops returned in force last month to drive the Haitian 
army from power. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant, the 37-year-old illegitimate son of the man who commanded Haiti's 
army during much of the reign of dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, has 
been on the fringe of the country's military for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he served as an intelligence adviser to the current army commander, 
Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, a post he held until he left to lead FRAPH, along with a 
former army captain, Jodel Chamblin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while working for Cedras in 1991 that the CIA reportedly paid Constant 
for information, mostly about what he knew of Aristide's organization. 
According to intelligence sources, he knew very little and was quickly dropped 
as an informant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked for the CIA, but not for money," Constant said in an interview with 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in The Nation magazine this week asserted that U.S. Army Col. Pat 
Collins, defense attache at the U.S. Embassy until early 1993, urged Constant 
to form FRAPH. But senior officials in Washington denied that Collins or any 
other U.S. official had ever encouraged or supported the group. Collins left 
Haiti eight months before FRAPH was formed. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant and Chamblin appeared to be little more than tools for the military, 
particularly Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the Port-au-Prince police chief, 
and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff. But they made a bid 
for independent power late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant began a political organizing drive throughout the country, using 
bribes and threats of beatings and death as his recruiting tools. In an 
interview with The Times, he said, "I am building a political base that will 
make FRAPH so strong it will be independent." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Biamby and Francois decided that he had gone too far. Francois 
had FRAPH disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant complained in a recent interview that he was humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There we were, JoJo (Chamblin) and I at my house on Christmas Eve with only a 
bottle of wine. I didn't even have a gun to fire to celebrate the coming of 
Christ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Constant has been virtually cut off from any political 
organization, although military-supported thugs asserting FRAPH membership were 
used off and on in Port-au-Prince to terrorize Aristide supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Constant, whose yellow-stained and crooked teeth and spectral facial structure 
give him a sinister appearance, has trawled for attention in recent months, 
offering himself to reporters for interviews and bragging about his political 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Constant and Chamblin are heavy and public users of narcotics, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamblin apparently came to grief with his superiors about four months ago 
when someone tried to kill him. He said it was the army, a claim supported by 
diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamblin asked the U.S. Embassy for protection. The request was ignored, and 
he has been in hiding ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed reported from Port-au-Prince and McManus reported from Washington.

U.S. BOTH SUPPORTIVE, WARY OF NEW ARISTIDE; TRANSITION: OFFICIALS HOPE HAITIAN 
PRESIDENT WILL PRACTICE WHAT HE'S NOW PREACHING: RECONCILIATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a student in Haiti's Roman Catholic schools for most of the 1960s and 
1970s, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was regarded as gifted and promising, finishing 
near the top of his class in qualifying both for a master's degree and for 
ordination as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Aristide became a parish priest, his sermons about the condition of 
the island's poor proved too provocative for the taste of the church hierarchy. 
After thugs working for Haiti's dictator of the day burned down his church and 
tried to kill him in 1988, the Salesian order expelled him for "fomenting class 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Aristide, as Haiti's exiled president, is once again proving to be an 
exceptionally apt student. Tutored by such leading Clinton Administration 
officials as National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott and a handful of other top officials, Aristide has embraced the 
principles of democracy, national reconciliation and market economics with a 
zeal that Washington would like to see in all leaders of developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Aristide, who is to be restored to his office within a week, courtesy 
of 20,000 U.S. troops in Haiti, continue to sing these tunes once he is back in 
power? Or will he revert to the firebrand priest who preaches Marxist economics 
and feeds Haiti's class struggle? Administration officials, while concerned, 
say they have reason to believe in a new Aristide.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has been cooperative with us in every way," a senior Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another official added: "He is, we are convinced, serious about wanting a 
broad-based government . . . serious about wanting a political environment that 
is peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States wins if Aristide keeps his promises to consolidate democracy 
by stepping aside for an elected successor in early 1996 and if, in the 
meantime, he repairs the country's tattered economy while discouraging his 
impoverished followers from taking revenge on those who have oppressed them. 
But if the Haitian president changes his message once he is back in power, 
President Clinton would be a big loser. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of the Administration, Aristide has established a transition 
office in Port-au-Prince to smooth the way for his return. In the closing weeks 
of his three years in exile, Aristide has met almost daily with U.S. officials 
to discuss economic reconstruction, reform of the brutal police force and 
formation of a new Cabinet, according to Administration officials and Aristide 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the Administration's priority list is reconciliation between Aristide 
and the wealthy families who control much of the island's commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The animosity between Aristide's impoverished supporters and the tiny elite 
could hardly be greater. Aristide's backers hate the wealthy families because 
they bankrolled the coup that overthrew him. For their part, the elite Haitians 
hate and fear Aristide because they believe that he will nationalize their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite generations of hatred, U.S. officials believe that Haiti will never 
become a stable democracy until rich and poor at least learn to tolerate each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said: "He understands that he has to bring those 
that are fearful of his return into the political process. He is impressing 
everyone that he talks to with his understanding of the need for 
consensus-building." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's supporters insist that the president will not deviate from the 
message he sounded earlier this month at the U.N. General Assembly: "Yes to 
reconciliation! No to violence! No to vengeance! . . . Yes to justice!" 
</P>
<P>
 Under current plans, there will be U.S. troops in Haiti until after Aristide's 
successor is elected and sworn in. That would certainly seem to give Washington 
plenty of influence over the Aristide government. Indeed, some of the Haitian 
president's supporters fear that the United States will try to manipulate their 
government, especially if Aristide deviates from his present message. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insist that the United States will not interfere. But there is 
an underlying message that this will be true only as long as Aristide does what 
he says he will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is highly intelligent and he seems to have gotten the message," one 
Administration official said. "He seems to realize that it is in his own best 
interest to perform the way we want him to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Aristide aides do voice some concern about potential U.S. 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton V. Wides, a Washington attorney representing the Haitian president, 
said the Aristide camp is concerned about possible U.S. interference in matters 
that should be decided by the Haitian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that there is an effort, however subtle, to take that (control) 
away from the government and act like the U.S. government is the emperor, there 
will be trouble," Wides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government advised Aristide to slash the size of Haiti's 7,000-member 
army, establish a civilian-controlled police force and rid the police of the 
often-brutal officers who served under the military government. Those steps are 
also on Aristide's own priority list, so no disagreement is expected there. 
</P>
<P>
 At U.S. urging, Aristide and his economic advisers have developed a $1-billion 
economic recovery plan that Washington, the European Union, Japan and other 
donors will help to finance. Despite the Marxist economics that marked his 
earlier career, Aristide has given a hearty endorsement to U.S. economic 
priorities, which are intended to pay off Haiti's international debt, 
strengthen the private sector and generate jobs for the country's unemployed 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that Aristide is sincere in what he says he plans to do when he 
regains office, there should be a substantial honeymoon in relations between 
the U.S. government and the new Haitian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts say that both sides can expect trouble if Aristide is unable 
to meet the expectations of a Haitian public, which clearly expects conditions 
to become far better than they have ever been.

NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN ZHIRINOVSKY'S RUSSIA; EUROPE: NATIONALIST SEEKS U.S. 
VISA, PARALYZES PARLIAMENT. NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS, HIS RATINGS REMAIN JUST 
HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN'T BE IGNORED.

<P>
 He destroys Parliament sessions with a single tantrum; pays friendly state 
visits to North Korea and Iraq; vows to sire children in every Russian 
province, and now, he may be coming your way. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist demagogue who shocked the world 
with his strong showing in December elections, plans to visit the United States 
next month, he announced Friday -- if, that is, he is granted entry. 
</P>
<P>
 His visa request is now being considered by the State Department, but it 
appears likely that the United States will join France, Germany, Switzerland, 
Slovenia, Norway and Spain, all of which have denied the motor-mouthed populist 
entry in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Zhirinovsky believes that a visa denial by U.S. authorities would 
only add to the personal popularity that brought his party top scores in voting 
last December and continues to hold steady despite his failure to fulfill any 
of his wild election promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greater the resistance we meet, the more popularity we will have," he 
said. "Without such resistance from authorities, we wouldn't have been able to 
get as far as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Zhirinovsky is wreaking enough havoc at home to make up for all the 
scandals he did not have a chance to create abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he and his party members walked out of the Duma, the lower house of 
Parliament, and gathered enough support from other factions to paralyze the 
body indefinitely just two days into its autumn session. 
</P>
<P>
 He also declared that he and his followers will no longer consider themselves 
signatories to the Civil Accord, a formal pledge to maintain the peace signed 
by hundreds of parties, groups and unions last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cup of patience is overflowing; we have to react," Zhirinovsky, his hair 
cut super-short to reveal a bullet head sweating freely in the stuffy hall, 
told reporters at the Duma.  
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old lawyer's cup apparently overflowed Sunday when he and more 
than 20 other deputies from his inaptly named Liberal Democratic Party were 
trying to fly to North Korea to visit its new leader, Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Zhirinovsky, his plane was supposed to stop for refueling in the 
Western Siberian city of Kemerovo, but the local governor rolled fuel trucks 
across the runway, blocking it. At the last minute, Zhirinovsky said, he called 
off the landing and the plane barely made it to the city of Tomsk, its fuel so 
low that the deputies faced "mortal danger." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Transport Ministry is investigating the incident, but Zhirinovsky 
said a government report will not satisfy him; he called for a change of 
Cabinet, particularly the resignation of Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, whom 
he accuses of hampering his travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky has been up to all kinds of shenanigans since he was elected, from 
fisticuffs with a fellow lawmaker in the Parliament's lunchroom and with a 
traffic cop on a central Moscow street to wild threats against Japan and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But, seemingly no matter what comes out of his mouth, Russian polls show that 
his ratings remain fairly steady, with a core of support that ranges between 5% 
and 20% of the population -- never high enough to give him a shot at the 
presidency in 1996 but never low enough to laugh off. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine Stolitsa offered a recent analysis of Zhirinovsky's appeal, 
saying his aggressive stance reflects "a sublimated feeling of fear, the kind 
of fear that gives one a sense of loneliness and defenselessness in a hostile 
world. And these days, the majority of Russians share this sense." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Mneniye polling service in July showed that, if elections were 
held now, President Boris N. Yeltsin would garner about 11% of the vote, 
followed by economist Grigory Yavlinsky with 9% and former Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi with 7%. Zhirinovsky would come in fourth with about 6%, 
close to his performance in the 1991 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he may not be a contender, his corps of angry-young-man followers, 
his support among the dispossessed and his ability to foment a perpetual 
brouhaha keep other Russian politicians watching him warily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zhirinovsky is a serious phenomenon from any point of view," Communist leader 
Gennady A. Zyuganov said. "I think he has gained popularity as the situation in 
the country gets worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 "His current position is no less firm than it was on Dec. 12," concurred Lev 
Ponomaryov, a prominent member of the reformist Russia's Choice. "Yes, he is a 
force. To ignore him would be a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a force, and he may be multiplying. Already the father of one son, 
Zhirinovsky proposed last month that he sire children in every region of Russia 
as his contribution to stopping the country's negative population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1995, according to the Liberal Democratic Party press service, Zhirinovsky 
wants every region to "witness the birth of at least one baby directly from the 
chairman of the LDP" in order to counter the "disastrous demographic 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky has yet to clarify whether he plans to found his own sperm bank or 
visit each of the regions in person.

GREATER AIR THREAT IN BOSNIA URGED; BALKANS: NATO ASKS U.N. TO STREAMLINE 
PROCEDURES AND MAKE IT EASIER TO LAUNCH PUNITIVE STRIKES. BUT NEW MEASURES 
WON'T ADD MUCH DETERRENT FORCE, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 After intense prodding from the United States, the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance 
on Friday formally pressed the United Nations for measures to intensify the use 
of Western air power in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures, detailed in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamline mandatory consultations between North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and U.N. officials before any punitive air strikes against forces 
violating U.N.-declared weapons exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the target lists for such reprisal raids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate the need to give violators a warning before attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials said the measures would change procedures that have proven 
dangerous to the alliance's pilots and so cumbersome that they have frequently 
made raids impossible to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time the green light comes, our aircraft are out of fuel," a senior 
NATO official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of violations have been by Bosnian Serb forces, who 
have largely -- and so far successfully -- ignored U.N. warnings to respect the 
resolutions establishing the exclusion zones around the cities of Sarajevo and 
Gorazde, as well as other "safe" areas. 
</P>
<P>
 (This week, however, the violations have been committed by Bosnian government 
troops. In an operation begun a day earlier, U.N. troops intervened in 
escalating clashes around Sarajevo, expelling more than 500 government troops 
Friday from a demilitarized zone on Mt. Igman, near a site where 20 Serbs were 
killed in a commando raid, wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
 (U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi had accused the Bosnians of mutilating and 
burning some of the victims of that raid, but Friday the United Nations 
withdrew those charges. Spokesman Tim Spicer said: "With the benefit of 
hindsight, I would say it was an aggressive military attack on a command post . 
. . there was no suggestion of people being executed.") 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials said the new measures were desperately needed to restore 
credibility to the air power deterrent and thus prevent further erosion of 
these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all worked hard to get these zones established, and no one wants to 
have them eaten away," the senior NATO official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO proposal comes amid U.S. efforts to increase pressure against the 
Bosnian Serbs to force them to accept a peace agreement worked out by a 
five-nation group made up of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even if accepted by Boutros-Ghali, the measures seem unlikely to have 
much of an impact because they fail to address the more fundamental differences 
between NATO and the United Nations that have made allied air power more of a 
joke than a deterrent in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite increasingly brazen violations by Bosnian Serb forces of the exclusion 
zone around Sarajevo through the summer and early autumn, NATO aircraft have 
only been ordered into action twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The total damage inflicted by the world's mightiest military alliance during 
these sorties near the Bosnian capital amounts to the destruction of one 
outdated anti-tank gun Aug. 5 and a single derelict tank Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 This impotence can be traced only in part to the procedures NATO now wants to 
streamline, according to many of those familiar with the Balkan crisis. The 
problem lies far more in a failure of political will on the part of the United 
Nations, which has consistently shied away from using air strikes to protect 
the exclusion zones, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO sources stressed Friday that even under the proposed changes, U.N. 
representatives would retain their right to veto any air strike that NATO 
wanted to launch. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations' failure to be more aggressive in defending its exclusion 
zones has steadily increased tensions with NATO. One measure of those tensions 
is that NATO ambassadors spent three days drafting their letter; apparently 
they feared that Boutros-Ghali would reject a too-sharply worded demand as an 
affront, but not take seriously a too-politely worded request.

HOUSE OKS BILL ON VITAMIN BENEFIT CLAIMS; HEALTH: MEASURE GIVES CONSUMERS 
CONTINUED ACCESS TO PRODUCTS BUT AFFORDS GOVERNMENT RIGHT TO OVERSEE 
NUTRITIONAL AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The House ended an intensely fought battle between the dietary supplement 
industry and its critics Friday by approving a measure that guarantees 
consumers' continued access to the products but also preserves the government's 
right to regulate claims used to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the House bill is regarded as a victory for the Food and Drug 
Administration and members of the public health community, who wanted 
undisputed scientific evidence of a supplement's health benefits before claims 
of such benefits can be used to promote or sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill differs from a more restrictive version passed earlier by the 
Senate but the Senate is expected to approve the House bill before Congress 
adjourns. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was one of the most hotly debated in Congress this session, 
prompting a multimillion-dollar campaign by the $4-billion industry and a 
widespread grass-roots letter-writing campaign by consumers who feared that 
they would lose access to their vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill resolves an extremely contentious issue," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), who was instrumental in drafting the House compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The House legislation, which passed on a voice vote, would prohibit the makers 
of supplements from making health claims for their products for four years 
while the issue is under study by a special commission. After two years, the 
commission would make recommendations, which would be reviewed by the secretary 
of health and human services and possibly by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, manufacturers would have to comply with existing law, which 
requires "significant scientific agreement" before a vitamin or supplement 
maker can claim on a product's label that it prevents a certain disease or 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the measure would set the first specific safety standards for dietary 
supplements, requiring that they not pose a "significant or unreasonable risk" 
of harm if used as directed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill slightly weakens current rules. Now, manufacturers have to 
provide the FDA with safety evidence 75 days before a product is introduced 
into the market and the FDA must approve the product before it can be sold. The 
bill changes that slightly, saying that if the FDA does not specifically 
disapprove the supplement within the 75-day period, the product can go onto the 
market. But the FDA could still later try to remove the product. 
</P>
<P>
 In another concession to the supplement industry, manufacturers gained 
permission to make certain nutritional claims, such as "Vitamin A is necessary 
for good vision." While such statements are medically accurate, industry 
critics fear that they would be used in a way that would imply nutritional 
supplements are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the House bill would allow supplement makers to distribute reprints of 
preliminary scientific studies that describe potential health benefits of 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides seemed pleased with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation "will help to keep our industry alive," said Gerald Kessler of 
the Nutritional Health Alliance, which represents the dietary supplement 
industry. "We have made great progress. . . . Many compromises were made to 
achieve a workable bill." 
</P>
<P>
 FDA spokesman Jim O'Hara said that the agency "will work hard to protect 
consumers from unsafe or deceptively labeled products." But he cautioned: "We 
are concerned, though, that some dietary supplement manufacturers might try to 
interpret this legislation in a way that would let them make deceptive claims. 
Consumers need to exercise vigilance in judging the validity of many of the 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer 
advocacy group, called the compromise a "win-win" for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill preserves access to supplement ingredients while protecting 
consumers from misleading health claims and unsafe products." 
</P>
<P>
 But "consumers should remain wary of other dubious marketing practices," he 
added.

THANKFUL EMIGRANT LEAVES $5.6 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Austrian emigrant has left $5.6 million to the U.S. government as a thank 
you to the country that took them in. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley S. Newberg, who died in 1986 at age 81 without any surviving blood 
relatives, left most of his $8.4-million estate to the government.The Justice 
Department received its $5.6 million earlier this week, U.S. Atty. Donald K. 
Stern said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The will tied no restrictions to the gift, which was forwarded to the Bureau 
of Public Debt in Washington to be used to cover general government expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cover less than two minutes of government spending, based on the 1994 
federal budget, which is $1.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Newberg married once, to a woman who had three children from a previous 
marriage, and the stepchildren, Julian and Felix Porter and Letty Pearl, 
contested the will. 
</P>
<P>
 They produced a document they said Newberg had signed that gave them half his 
assets upon his death, officials said. However, a handwriting expert determined 
the document had been forged and they settled out of court for an undisclosed 
amount.

ANAHEIM OFFICER WON'T BE CHARGED IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office decided Friday that an Anaheim 
police officer would not be prosecuted for shooting to death a 25-year-old 
criminal suspect following a high speed chase on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the officer, who has not been identified, fired two shotgun rounds 
at Gary Boomer after he refused orders to stop and hit the same uniformed 
officer with his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood said her investigation turned up 
"insufficient evidence of culpability" in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the incident began when Boomer's girlfriend called Anaheim 
police and Orange County sheriff's deputies to say that Boomer, who was wanted 
on a felony assault warrant, was harassing her and had just driven away from 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and deputies pursued Boomer, who was driving his mother's car, for 15 
minutes at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour on the Riverside Freeway before he 
took the off-ramp at Imperial Highway. Other officers, alerted by Boomer's 
girlfriend that he would be heading for his mother's home at the Friendly 
Village mobile home park, were waiting for him there. 
</P>
<P>
 With police helicopters hovering above, Boomer drove into the park about 1:15 
a.m., but failed to stop, although witnesses said he was ordered to halt by 
officers. Boomer's car jumped the curb and hit a uniformed officer. Boomer was 
shot twice and died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Boomer's parents filed suit in U.S. District Court against the city 
of Anaheim disputing the police version of events and alleging civil rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Steering, the elder Boomers' attorney, said that a videotape of the 
shooting shot from a camera mounted on a police vehicle indicates that Boomer's 
"car was stopped when he blasted him the second time. I don't understand why he 
shot him the second time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood, the district attorney handling the criminal charges, declined to 
discuss the investigation in detail, but said "the videotape was part of the 
entire body of evidence we reviewed."

COUPLE SHOT AFTER LEADING AUTHORITIES ON FREEWAY CHASE IN STOLEN POLICE CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and woman stole a police car and led officers on a 30-minute freeway 
chase through parts of Riverside, Norco and Ontario on Friday before they were 
surrounded and shot when the man drew a shotgun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the woman, who was critically injured, nor the man, who suffered a 
serious gunshot wound in the shoulder, were identified late Friday, said Sgt. 
Don Padelford of the Riverside Police Department.The male suspect refused to 
give his name, and neither victim carried identification, Padelford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple -- believed to be in their 30s -- were first noticed loitering at 
the entrance to Riverside's Crestlawn Cemetery, Padelford said. When approached 
by a Riverside police officer, the man pushed the officer and the couple jumped 
into the patrol car and drove away, Padelford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen police car led other units, including two helicopters, on a chase 
lasting 30 to 40 miles before they were forced from the Pomona Freeway and 
rammed by another police car. Officers surrounded the suspects, but the man 
refused to surrender, Padelford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The male suspect somehow was able to remove a shotgun from the (police car) 
and was raising the shotgun in a firing stance," the sergeant said. "That's 
when the officers opened up." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 shots were fired, Padelford said. The woman was hit several times in 
the upper body and rushed to a hospital in Loma Linda, he said. Police hoped to 
identify the couple today from fingerprints.

BROWN ACCEPTS WILSON DEBATE PROPOSAL; 'ONE OF US HAS TO BREAK THE STALEMATE,' 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TELLS THE GOVERNOR. THE TWO WILL MEET FRIDAY AT A PUBLIC 
TV STATION IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown broke a months-long stalemate with Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson on Friday when she unexpectedly agreed to a one-hour gubernatorial 
campaign debate over a statewide public television network next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters of this state cannot go to the polls without seeing the two of us 
debate the real issues that confront California," Brown said in a 
seven-paragraph "Dear Pete" letter that ended: "See you on the 14th -- 
Sincerely, Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, acted one week after an apparent breakdown in 
negotiations over various proposed debate formats, dates, times and sites. On 
Sept. 30, both sides agreed that there was no chance of reaching an agreement 
and that therefore there would be no debate. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Friday morning, Brown had rejected the public television encounter, 
arguing that it was like "debating in a box" because of the relatively small 
audience compared to commercial television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's letter to Wilson, faxed to his Sacramento campaign headquarters about 
3:30 p.m., was a surprise to most observers, who thought the debate issue was 
settled and buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the widest possible exposure for this debate," Brown wrote. "You 
apparently do not. One of us has to break the stalemate. I will." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, just back from a two-day fund-raising trip to Washington and New 
York, accepted immediately, said Dan Schnur, his campaign spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will originate from station KVIE, the public television station in 
Sacramento, between 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The two candidates will be asked 
questions by a panel of political reporters. The debate is expected to be 
carried live on public television stations in San Francisco, San Diego and Los 
Angeles, and perhaps other areas. (The Los Angeles public station is KCET 
Channel 28.) 
</P>
<P>
 The telecast will also be made available to commercial television stations for 
tape-delay broadcast, Wilson aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of laying down scores of precise conditions for the debate, 
Wilson forces issued an ultimatum Sept. 30: Accept the KVIE debate offer or 
there would be no debates. Although Brown had earlier expressed a willingness 
to debate any place, any time, her campaign rejected the take-it-or-leave-it 
offer. At that point, Brown aides indicated that they would just as soon have 
the issue to use against Wilson as they would to debate under conditions they 
did not consider advantageous to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Brown aides continued efforts to arrange a debate venue 
that was acceptable to both Brown and Wilson, said Kim Wardlaw, who was head of 
Brown's debate negotiating team. When all those efforts failed, Brown agreed, 
essentially, to Wilson's week-old offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is being a statesman and recognizing that both campaigns should just put 
bickering on the debates aside," Wardlaw said. "If all Wilson is willing to do 
is a debate he hopes nobody will see, that's too bad. But we think the voters 
deserve a debate, so we'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wardlaw said Brown would like to hold additional debates, specifically a 
meeting in San Francisco sponsored by the California Broadcasters Assn. on Oct. 
16. Wilson aides had no immediate comment, but political experts did not expect 
the governor to want more than the one meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally challengers benefit from the exposure they get on a debate. Last 
week's Wilson ultimatum was considered part of a typical front-runner's 
strategy: Avoid debates if you can get away with it, or hold one at the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson led Brown by nine points among likely voters in the most recent Los 
Angeles Times Poll and by nearly that in the Field Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments also came the day after Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and 
the challenger for her seat, Republican Rep. Mike Huffington, debated on the 
Larry King show on CNN. Schnur said more people would see the Wilson-Brown 
debate over public television than had access to the Senate debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and Feinstein are attempting to negotiate further meetings before 
the Nov. 8 election. Feinstein debated Wilson once in 1990 when she was the 
Democratic nominee for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Brown embarked on a sales blitz on behalf of her 62-page 
economic plan, which she said would revitalize the depressed California economy 
and pay off the state budget debt accumulated during Wilson's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Going from the Pacific Stock Exchange in Los Angeles to Sproul Plaza at UC 
Berkeley, the state treasurer picked up the support of two Nobel Prize 
laureates in economics and more than 200 California business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Stanford economics professor William F. Sharpe, winner of the 
1990 Nobel Prize for economics, who said during the Berkeley rally: "The 
investment approach in this plan will put California on the road to creating 1 
million new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the stock exchange, former Southern California Edison Co. President Michael 
Peevey said California needs leadership in Sacramento "to rev up jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Peevey, chairman of a public-private firm developing electric autos, 
particularly commended the portion of the Brown plan that proposes assistance 
to defense contractors in converting from being weapons producers to creators 
of high-tech jobs for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things I find most exciting," Peevey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's plan was attacked by Wilson forces as basically mimicking actions 
Wilson had taken or proposed, or discarded as unworkable.

SUPREME COURT MAY REVIVE STATE LAW ON WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court announced Friday that it will consider reviving a California 
law that cuts welfare benefits for one year for newcomers to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 law, part of Gov. Pete Wilson's bid to reduce the state's 
$5.5-billion annual welfare program, was struck down as unconstitutional by a 
federal judge in Sacramento because it penalized new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of past rulings, a liberal-dominated Supreme Court had said that 
the Constitution does not permit states to discriminate against new residents 
by refusing medical or welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court's decision to hear California's appeal may portend a major 
change in the law. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a dissenter in the 
earlier rulings, has maintained that states should be free to pay benefits as 
they see fit. He may now believe that he has a majority to rewrite the 
constitutional standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high-benefit states such as New York, Minnesota and Illinois also have 
sought to limit benefits temporarily for new residents but they too have been 
blocked by court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great news," state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said. A ruling in favor of 
the state is a needed first step "to reform the welfare system in California, 
as well as the rest of the country," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But a Los Angeles lawyer who led the challenge to the reduced benefits said 
the state's restrictions would not save much money in total but would "punish 
battered women and their children when they flee back home to California." 
</P>
<P>
 If the lower benefits for new residents had been in effect this year, the 
state would have saved $22 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the existing benefits (for all recipients) were reduced by 76 cents a 
month, they could save that much money. This is driven by political hype," said 
Mark Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 California's welfare benefits are the nation's fourth-highest and the "welfare 
magnet" draws poor people into the state, Wilson said in pressing for the 
so-called "two-tier benefit" plan. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawyers contended that these lower benefits are legal because they are 
temporary and do not stop people from immigrating to California from other 
states. New residents who are eligible for welfare are paid the benefit they 
would have received in the state they left. The dispute does not affect illegal 
immigrants, who are not eligible for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Unquestionably, though, the law would have a major impact on people who move 
to California from Southern states, which pay much lower welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Deshawn Green, a Sacramento native, lived in Louisiana for 
several years and gave birth to two children. As a full-fledged California 
resident with two children, she would have been eligible for a grant of $624 a 
month. But under the 1992 law, she would have received only $190 a month, the 
welfare benefit in Louisiana. She became the lead plaintiff in the case before 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A second plaintiff, Debby Venturella, also a mother with two children, 
returned to California after several years in Oklahoma but would have received 
$341 a month, Oklahoma's benefit.  
</P>
<P>
 The third plaintiff, Diana Bertollt, a mother with one child, moved to 
California from Colorado in 1992. While the state's standard welfare benefit 
would have been $504 a month, she would have received $280 a month under the 
two-tier plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Levi struck down the law before it took effect, saying that the 
Constitution "does not permit significant distinctions between new and old 
residents based on the duration of their residency." The U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals affirmed his decision in June. The high court will hear arguments in 
the case in January and issue a ruling by July. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also agreed to decide: 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether states can force private insurers to pay higher hospital charges 
(Cuomo vs. Travelers Insurance, 93-1414). New York imposes a hospital surcharge 
on patients who have private insurance but not those who have Medicaid or Blue 
Cross. A federal appeals court struck the practice down as a violation of 
federal law, but the Clinton Administration urged the justices to uphold this 
form of hospital cost regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether truckers who cause accidents can be sued because they failed to 
install anti-lock brakes (Freightliner Corp. vs. Myrick, 94-286). State courts 
have allowed such suits but truckers say they are preempted by federal laws 
that set safety standards for vehicles.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / LT. GOVERNOR; DAVIS, WRIGHT ENGAGE IN SPIRITED DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the first face-to-face clash of the major contenders for lieutenant 
governor, Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Cathie Wright staged a spirited 
debate Friday on issues such as immigration policy and Davis' record as state 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Wright, a Simi Valley state senator, came out swinging at the 
better-known, better-financed Davis. Wright needs to score points in these 
kinds of forums and in television commercials if she is to overtake 
front-runner Davis in the race to succeed the retiring Leo T. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a lunchtime business group at a Beverly Hills hotel, Wright zeroed in 
hard on Davis' performance as the state's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 She questioned whether Davis has been properly tending to his job during his 
two terms as controller. She contended that for the past five years Davis has 
only attended 2% of the meetings of the State Board of Equalization, of which 
the controller is one of five members.  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that if someone is not there on your job 98% of the time, 
you would have fired him," Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, once again Mrs. Wright is wrong," Davis replied, emphasizing that he is 
a member of 63 boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you don't attend 63 boards, sir," Wright snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis replied that he is empowered to send deputies to fill in for him and 
that their votes count as his vote. "So, I have not missed a single meeting of 
any of the 63 boards on which I serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, half-jokingly, Davis said he would wind up in the grave very quickly if 
he tried to go to all the meetings of all the boards. He said he attempts to 
regularly attend sessions of the State Lands Commission and the Franchise Tax 
Board. On the State Board of Equalization, which collects most of the state's 
taxes and hears appeals of income tax cases, Davis said his attendance practice 
is standard. Like his predecessors, he said, he usually sends a deputy to 
attend meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the board said Davis typically attends the annual meeting at 
which utility property taxes are set but usually dispatches a representative 
the rest of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, another sharp difference was reflected in the views of 
Davis and Wright on the anti-illegal immigration measure on the state ballot, 
Proposition 187. Wright favored passage, saying that voters need to send a 
message to Washington about their concerns over illegal immigration into the 
state.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure would bar illegal immigrants from public education and 
non-emergency public health care, and require schools to expel children who 
cannot prove they are in the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the wrong answer to a very real problem," Davis told the 
luncheon sponsored by the Southern California Business Assn. and the Los 
Angeles County Hotel and Motel Group. Davis urged federal authorities to beef 
up the Border Patrol to block illegal crossings and funnel more money to the 
state to pay for services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the debate, Davis, who is making his fifth run for statewide 
office, sought to ignore the attacks by Wright and not make a misstep that 
would undermine his commanding lead over Wright. A recent Field Poll showed 
Davis leading 2 to 1, and he recently reported having $1.7 million in cash in 
his campaign treasury compared to Wright's $73,000.

103RD CONGRESS GRINDING TO A HALT AMID PARTISAN RAGE; GOVERNMENT: MANY 
LAWMAKERS CAN'T RECALL A SESSION MORE BITTERLY SPLIT. THE YEAR IS AN ESPECIALLY 
BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was late in the morning of the day before its scheduled adjournment and the 
Senate had just ground to a halt -- not for the first time but perhaps for the 
last in the ill-starred 103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans had just killed another major Democratic initiative, lobbying 
reform, and were launching into another of a long series of filibusters by 
forcing the Senate clerk to read aloud the entire text of the House-Senate 
conference report on the California desert bill, a process that would take 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 With audible groans, weary senators started heading for the doors, emptying 
the chamber of all but two figures who remained sitting stone-stiff in their 
seats, glowering at one another across the empty aisles. Like partners in a 
deadly duet, Sens. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the 
chief protagonists in the desert bill debate, just sat there and stared at one 
another, each seemingly transfixed by the other's venomous glare. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus is the year on Capitol Hill drawing to a close -- with neither a bang nor 
a whimper, but with a partisan rage so deep that many Democrats and Republicans 
were barely on speaking terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as they waited to learn the fate of the desert bill, the last major 
legislation on the year's calendar, many lawmakers agreed that they could not 
recall a Congress that has been more bitterly partisan than this one. 
</P>
<P>
 As Democrats struggled to enact President Clinton's legislative agenda, only 
to be thwarted by Republicans at nearly every turn, the level of discourse in 
both the House and Senate sank to a depth that Rep. Robert T. Matsui 
(D-Sacramento) said was "much more mean-spirited" than any he can remember in 
his 16 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is no longer to win on an issue but to destroy your opponent," he 
lamented. "It's mean, it's personal and it's for keeps." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Democrats, confronting the possibility of their worst electoral losses 
since 1980, the year was especially disappointing as, one by one, the signature 
reforms they had hoped to enact after 12 years of divided government went down 
to defeat, partly because of Republican opposition but also because of major 
divisions within their own fractious ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, only one of the three main priorities that Clinton set before the 
Congress in his State of the Union Address was finally passed. But even the 
luster of their hard-earned victory in passing a landmark crime bill, with its 
controversial ban on assault weapons intact, was somewhat diminished by the 
intraparty feuding and the embarrassingly close votes that preceded its 
adoption in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the graveyard, or the legislative limbo of next year, went the grand 
designs that were supposed to reform health care, welfare and the way money is 
raised for political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawmakers had regarded efforts to reform Congress itself as essential, if 
painful, first steps toward restoring the public's badly sagging confidence in 
government. But that fared no better, with bills to streamline the 
congressional bureaucracy and ban lawmakers from receiving meals, gifts and 
travel junkets from lobbyists both falling victim to Republican delaying 
tactics in the waning hours of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stumbling or snarled by gridlock in the final days was Superfund 
legislation to clean up hazardous wastes, telecommunications reform and a 
landmark law that would have increased federal royalties on minerals taken from 
government land. Even the major international trade agreement that enjoyed 
bipartisan support for most of the year fell victim to conflicting special 
interests and election year politics, although Congress is scheduled to return 
in late November for a rare lame duck session to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corridors of the Capitol on the eve of adjournment, the mood was as 
foul as anyone could remember. "Normally there's a great rush at the end of a 
session to get things passed" so lawmakers can go home and tout their 
accomplishments to the voters, noted Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.). But with 
"gridlock by filibuster in the Senate and gridlock by procedural votes in the 
House," he said, "there is nothing left to do but rap the gavel and get out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not sensed a greater anxiety, especially among Democrats, since Jimmy 
Carter led his party to defeat in 1980," added Rutgers University political 
scientist Ross K. Baker. "The impending sense of doom and demoralization is 
palpable." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the real possibility that Republicans could recapture the Senate for 
the first time in 10 years and win enough seats in the House to form an 
alliance with conservative Democrats that would deny Clinton an effective 
majority next year, Democratic leaders insisted that their stewardship of both 
Congress and the White House over the last two years had still produced major 
legislative accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an extraordinarily productive Congress," insisted House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), citing the crime bill and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement as "historic" achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "With time and perspective, this Congress will be seen as one of significant 
accomplishment," added retiring Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.). As other major initiatives approved by the 103rd Congress, he listed 
legislation enabling Americans to earn stipends for schooling by performing 
community service, providing for voter registration at state motor vehicle 
offices, and requiring larger businesses to grant unpaid leave to employees to 
deal with family circumstances, such as a new child or a relative's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem, another senior Democrat privately conceded, is that 
"perspective is for historians, not voters." Most of the accomplishments the 
leadership touted, he noted, occurred in the first year of the two-year 
congressional session, perhaps too long ago to erase the impression "shared by 
most of our constituents that this was a do-nothing Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a productive session if you look at both years but it was also a very 
messy one and that's what voters are reacting to," agreed Penny. "There were 
too many cliffhanger votes, too much partisanship, too many promises 
unfulfilled. . . . It's left a bad taste in peoples' mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats blamed Republican gridlock -- "Dr. Frankendole's monster," as 
one Democrat called it, referring to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
Indeed, the GOP filibusters, even of bills that had passed by huge margins 
earlier in the year, came in such dizzying succession near the end that even 
some GOP moderates agreed that their leadership, sensing Clinton's weakness, 
was bent on denying the Democrats any opportunity to reverse their fortunes 
before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 To many observers, for instance, it was hard to see a motive that was not 
political in the Republicans' refusal to end their filibuster of the lobbying 
bill even after the Democrats offered to drop the provisions to which the GOP 
lawmakers had been objecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to everything they asked for but they still would not let it pass, 
obviously because they want to deny the President the opportunity of signing a 
bill that the public supports" before the elections, charged the bill's 
sponsor, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
 But the partisanship was by no means one way as the Democrats, especially 
those in the House, sought to deny the GOP any constructive opportunities to 
influence legislation through a combination of restrictive rule-making and 
closed-door negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a growing frustration on our side that we were not even allowed 
access to the rules of the House, let alone fair play under them," complained 
Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa.). 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in the House have "basically treated the Republicans with contempt . 
. . like they were the idiot children of Congress," agreed Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, several analysts added, was a highly partisan struggle that in 
recent years helped to push the GOP leadership to the right and the Democrats 
to the left, leaving a leadership hole in the center that Clinton alone could 
never manage to fill as he veered first one way and then the other in an effort 
to win support for his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the House, you had a Democratic caucus controlled by liberals and a 
Republican caucus controlled by conservatives, with fewer conservative 
Democrats and moderate Republicans in Congress than at any time before," noted 
political analyst Charles Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a prescription for gridlock," he said, adding that if the trend 
continues into the next Congress, it will raise the question "of whether 
anything but the farm bill will be able to pass in 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, even a large and reform-minded freshman class of lawmakers, which 
brought more women and minorities into Congress than ever before, seemed to 
splinter and fall victim to division, leaving many of them disillusioned and 
asking, as Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego) did aloud recently: "What went wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to health care reform, but it was a question that many 
lawmakers were asking about the year in general as they headed home to confront 
the uphill task of convincing the voters that they can do it better next year.

MALE NURSE ACCUSED IN RAPE OF 4 UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nurse was charged with raping four unconscious women in a hospital recovery 
room after they had undergone surgery, and 20 more women have come forward to 
say he may have attacked them too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Alan Young, 45, was arrested Monday after a female nurse allegedly 
caught him having sex with an unconscious 15-year-old girl.Police said he told 
them he picked the girl because she was "helpless and pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's alarming -- we're still receiving calls," Inverness Police Chief Bill 
Vitt said Friday. "Some have said they were waking up and they felt this man 
doing things to them. They were totally helpless to resist." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the alleged victims told the St. Petersburg Times that hospital 
officials did not take her seriously when she said she had been assaulted in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would just say I was on anesthesia and he was a medical professional, 
and they would make me feel like I was foolish," the 23-year-old woman said. 
"But now that he has admitted what he did, I feel I've convinced people it 
wasn't a dream or an hallucination." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the alleged attacks took place at Citrus Memorial Hospital in 
Inverness, about 90 miles north of Tampa. Young has been a registered nurse at 
the hospital since 1990 and worked at three other hospitals in the Tampa Bay 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, police said, he confessed to raping the 15-year-old and the 
23-year-old. On Wednesday, he was charged in two more attacks -- in July and 
last year -- after two women, ages 34 and 24, saw his photo in the newspaper 
and came forward. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing Thursday, the short, blond and pudgy defendant shielded his 
face with a piece of paper as a judge set bail at $80,000.

COUPLE WHO MET AT HARVARD LAW GIVE SOMETHING BACK: $13 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Love and money: Gustave and Rita Hauser got both with the help of Harvard Law 
School and on Friday gave $13 million back. 
</P>
<P>
 The two met at the school in 1955, got married the day after final exams in 
the spring of '56 and went on to make their fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard officials said the donation is the largest cash gift ever given to a 
law school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school had a unique role in bringing us together," Hauser said at a 
ceremony Friday on the steps of a new building to be called Hauser Hall. "But 
for that, we probably would have never met." 
</P>
<P>
 Gustave Hauser, 65, is a pioneer of cable TV, and helped develop Nickelodeon 
and the technology used for pay-per-view. He is chairman and chief executive 
officer of Hauser Communications and used to head the Warner Bros. cable unit, 
Qube. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Hauser, 60, is president of the couple's charitable foundation, the 
Hauser Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a first-year Harvard student and he was a teaching fellow when they 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser Hall, to be dedicated in April, will house classes and faculty offices.

JONES TO PURSUE SUIT IN WAKE OF CLINTON'S SETTLEMENT REJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The woman who claims she was sexually harassed by President Clinton said 
Friday his rejection of a settlement offer would force her to take the matter 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sorry that Bill Clinton did not accept my settlement offer," said Paula 
Corbin Jones, a former state government worker in Arkansas."It provided him 
with a chance to end the case without having to admit his own conduct. At the 
same time, it would have restored me my reputation. No payment of money was 
ever required." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who claims Clinton sexually propositioned her in a Little Rock, Ark., 
hotel room in May, 1991, when he was governor of Arkansas, sued the President 
earlier this year for violation of her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, through his attorneys, has denied the accusations and has sought a 
stay of the proceedings until his term in office expires. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jones' lawyer, Gilbert Davis, of Fairfax, Va., Clinton could have 
avoided the lawsuit with an apology saying: "I am sorry for the untrue 
assertions which have been made about (Jones), and which have adversely 
affected her character, good name and reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at the offices of Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer, said 
Friday that Bennett's response to the settlement offer was "basically, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who has largely avoided the media since going public with her claims, 
appeared briefly at a news conference in Hollywood on Friday to read a 
statement to reporters about the failed settlement negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas native, who now lives in Southern California, declined to answer 
questions.

O.J. SIMPSON MASKS A MACABRE HALLOWEEN SENSATION; COSTUMES: STORE OPERATORS SAY 
WIGS, FOOTBALL JERSEYS AND OTHER ITEMS ARE SELLING BRISKLY. SOCIOLOGISTS CALL 
SALES TREND DISTURBING. 
</P>

<P>
 Call it bad taste or just plain gross, but one of the hottest-selling 
Halloween items in the country is a mask bearing the likeness of accused killer 
O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragztop-Vintage, a costume shop on Commonwealth Avenue in Fullerton, received 
its first shipment earlier this week and promptly sold out, store manager 
Victor Pahl said. He noted Friday that a fresh order of the leathery masks -- 
which sell for $20 -- is once again selling fast. 
</P>
<P>
 At costume outlets in Los Angeles, early shoppers were combining the mask with 
other props suggesting elements of the celebrated double-murder case. One man 
bought the mask along with a $25, black and white striped prison outfit, said 
Philip Reynoso, an employee of the Halloween Castle on the Eastside.  
</P>
<P>
 Short Afro wigs, patterned after Simpson's hairstyle, were selling briskly, 
said Ron Ede, co-owner of Junk for Joy, a Halloween shop in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be one of the hottest characters -- that's for sure," Ede said, 
adding that blond wigs are likely to be hot items too because women want to 
dress as murder victim Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The scariest aspect of the costumes may be what they say about American 
culture, according to some sociologists and others who say the sales trend is 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reminds me of people cheering O.J. from the overpasses during his 
infamous Friday night drive," said Gordon Clanton, a sociologist at San Diego 
State. "As society becomes less and less clear about right and wrong, people 
are more swept up into entertainment generally. And these days, people live 
through entertainment in a powerful way." 
</P>
<P>
 The power of the Simpson case as entertainment has given rise to a full line 
of Halloween gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Step in Time, a costume shop in Laguna Niguel, is planning to rent black and 
white prison shirts with Simpson's No. 32 -- the football great's jersey number 
-- on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had calls about blond 'Nicole wigs,' dark makeup, Afro wigs, big butcher 
knives and, of course, the O.J. mask," said Dena Teeter, the manager of Step in 
Time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even trick-or-treaters overseas appear to be clamoring for the Simpson line. 
"A woman came in this week wanting to send a bunch of this stuff to Japan," 
Teeter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragztop in Fullerton, like stores throughout the country, is also selling 
jerseys similar to the kind Simpson wore with the USC Trojans and the Buffalo 
Bills -- only these are splattered with fake blood and for legal reasons bear a 
different number. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Costumes Galore, a costume shop in Orange, who asked not to 
be quoted by name, said her store had received "tons of calls about O.J. 
paraphernalia, but we thought it was just too tacky." 
</P>
<P>
 Clanton, the San Diego State sociologist, said the rush to capitalize on the 
Simpson case may reflect the baser side of the American attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Events like this tend to bring out the worst in us -- that which is marginal 
in all of us," Clanton said. "In this case, there's a kind of general erosion 
of morality, of ethics. As social life becomes increasingly less substantive, 
then entertainment steps in to fill the space." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Clanton said, those offended by the selling of such 
merchandise "run the risk of going too far because it's the nature of 
Halloween. Halloween is an odd holiday to have kept, but its social usefulness 
is in there somewhere, to provide an outlet for the dark, the scary, the 
macabre -- and even that in the popular culture that is difficult to grasp and 
understand, like the O.J. case."

WILSON DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY IN VENTURA COUNTY; MEDFLIES: THE DECLARATION 
CITES 'EXTREME PERIL' TO AGRICULTURE. IT WAS NEEDED BEFORE MALATHION SPRAYING 
COULD BEGIN OVER POPULATED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the Medfly infestation in eastern Camarillo widened, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Friday declared a state of emergency in Ventura County that cited conditions of 
"extreme peril to the agriculture industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's declaration came one day after aerial malathion spraying was ordered 
over a 16-square-mile area of fields and residences in eastern Camarillo and 
Somis to prevent the spread of the county's first Mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of the region -- containing a population of 29,000 -- begins 
at 9 p.m. Wednesday barring bad weather, and will continue every two weeks for 
about six months. Wilson's emergency order was needed before helicopters could 
begin an air assault over any populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going into the air because the potential for loss of crops in Ventura 
County is so great and the number of people employed in agriculture there so 
many," Wilson spokeswoman Kristine Berman said. "We could also face an embargo 
from Japan or domestically." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the aerial spraying of residential areas -- which required the 
governor's approval -- some growers in the spray zone and the wider 
86-square-mile quarantine area imposed earlier this week were proceeding with 
plans of their own for low-level aerial malathion spraying limited strictly to 
fields and orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aerial spraying of malathion over agricultural areas receives little 
attention in the absence of Medfly infestations, it is a relatively routine 
practice. As long as the spraying is confined to fields, no special approval by 
the governor is required. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial spraying zone announced Thursday is limited to eastern Camarillo 
and a stretch of unincorporated county land around Somis. But the larger 
quarantine area extends into parts of Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. Growers in 
those areas with fruit that is a host for Medflies will have to pay for 
low-level aerial spraying of malathion on their fields if they want to ship 
their produce outside the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 In justifying the need for the aerial spraying, county Agriculture 
Commissioner Earl McPhail estimated that up to 22,000 people work in the 
agriculture industry in the county and up to $439 million in crops could be at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Ventura County emergency declaration Tuesday, Sheriff Larry Carpenter 
asked the governor to seek a federal declaration from President Clinton. But 
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the governor, said Friday that Wilson had decided 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we acted so quickly, we expect to knock this pest down so quickly 
that costs will be minimal and we won't need a federal emergency declaration," 
Walsh said. At this point, no disaster funds are considered available to 
growers, but assessments of damages will continue through the quarantine 
period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from Japan, which buys about one-third of the county's 
$216-million lemon crop and substantial quantities of oranges and avocados, 
will arrive in California Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They will tour the Cooperative Medfly Project facilities in Los Angeles 
County, where a team of state and federal agriculture officials oversees the 
state's Medfly eradication programs, before coming to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation is expected to arrive in Camarillo on Wednesday, said Rex 
Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be looking for our level of diligence in controlling the 
infestation, how organized we are and how well we can track the fruit from the 
packinghouse through the Port of Hueneme to exclude exposure to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Japanese will not accept any fruit from within the 86-square-mile 
quarantine area, growers and state and local officials fear Japan may place an 
embargo on the entire county, or possibly the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot depends on what happens next week when the Japanese tour the area," 
Laird said. But he said the potential for financial disaster with the Medfly 
infestation is great. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my 14 years in the county, through frost and flood and drought, I 
can't think of anything worse for potential across-the-board losses in the 
county than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The new finds confirmed Friday brought the total Medfly count to three 
egg-carrying females and 60 males. All males were found within a quarter-mile 
of the site where the first two females were found last week, in the center of 
a grove on the grounds of St. John's Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent female fly found was more than a mile from the original site, 
still within the grove and away from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Los Angeles County began its program of releasing sterile males to mate 
with fertile female Medflies four years ago, the sterile flies have been 
routinely found in Ventura County along major routes and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those finds, Laird said he always expected that any Medfly 
infestation would be found along a major highway or route, and not in the 
center of an orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought it would be through a commuter car as opposed to what 
appears to be an importation of a host material from an infested area," he 
said. "It's off the beaten path and appears to be connected with the seminary." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Agriculture Henry Voss, who announced the spraying program 
Thursday, said the spraying area boundaries would be expanded if a wild Medfly 
were found within half a mile of the spraying perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 But state agriculture officials said Friday there is no plan now to expand the 
spraying area because the find was still within 1 1/2 miles of the core area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boundaries stay as they were outlined," said Carla Agar, a spokeswoman 
for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Camarillo on Friday, 150 members of the California Conservation 
Corps fanned out to distribute pamphlets to those whose residences would be 
sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams of youths handed out about 15,000 leaflets in Spanish and English to 
every residence and business in the area, said Tony Haro, an entomologist with 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Zook , who has a 3-year-old daughter, stood on the front stoop of her 
Somis home with her husband, Eric, and quickly read over the information handed 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little concerned because of our daughter," she said. "My husband runs a 
landscaping business and uses malathion so he's not as worried. But I'll take 
precautions -- make sure the dog is inside and bring the swing set in." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks down the street, Gail Mier, 58, looked over the leaflet she had 
been handed. Her house is next to an agricultural field. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about people with allergies?" she asked. "My grandson has allergies and 
it gets to where he can't breath sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although growers in Ventura County, along with back-yard gardeners, have 
routinely used malathion for years in the county, the aerial spraying program 
will mark the first time it will be widely distributed over people's yards and 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 The pesticide will be mixed with corn syrup bait to attract the flies to eat 
the substance, which is lethal to the insects. 
</P>
<P>
 The three helicopters that will take off from Camarillo Airport will carry on 
each spraying operation a total of 90 gallons of pesticide to distribute over 
the 16-square-mile area, or about 1.2 ounces per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quantities are considered extremely small by state health 
officials, they could still be enough to be harmful to sensitive people, Dr. 
George Rutherford of the state Department of Health Services said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged people to use common sense, keeping small children, the ill and the 
elderly out of the pesticide spray and washing off any skin that comes into 
contact with the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also suggest that shallow fish ponds or wading pools be covered 
during the applications and that lawn furniture and playground equipment be 
washed off before they are used.

SENATE VOTE EXPECTED TODAY ON DESERT BILL; POLITICS: LEADING REPUBLICAN 
OPPONENT AGREES TO DEMOCRATS' MOTION ON ENDING DEBATE OVER FEINSTEIN'S 
ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the clock ticking down, Senate Democrats scrambled Friday night for the 
60 votes necessary to cut off a Republican filibuster against the California 
desert protection bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which would preserve nearly 8 million acres of fragile 
California desert, passed the House early Friday on a voice vote. But it faces 
an uncertain future in the Senate as Congress rushed to adjourn for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate was to have adjourned Friday night, but Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) said he would keep the body in session "however long it takes" 
to dispose of the desert bill one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 That, according to Mitchell's GOP counterpart, Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), could mean that the Senate may stay around until Tuesday or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday afternoon, Mitchell filed a cloture motion to end debate on the 
desert bill. And just before midnight, the bill's lead opponent, Sen. Malcolm 
Wallop (R-Wyo.), agreed to allow a vote on the motion at 10 a.m. today. If it 
succeeds, passage of the bill seems virtually assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Democrats decried what they called Republican efforts to 
deny Democrats another legislative accomplishment, saying in particular that 
GOP senators were sacrificing ecologically fragile desert land to deny Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) a feather in her cap as she campaigns to retain her 
Senate seat in a tight race with Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the American people mean by gridlock," Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.) fumed in a floor speech as Feinstein presided over the Senate. "I 
think it's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein sounded frustrated during a speech later in the evening, urging the 
bill's adoption. "I have done everything one is supposed to do when one seeks 
legislation," she said plaintively. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness that had come to enshroud the debate was such that by Friday 
night Wallop successfully demanded that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt be 
escorted out of the Senate chamber, even though Babbitt has floor privileges 
because he heads a government department. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt had entered the chamber unobtrusively while Wallop was speaking and 
took a seat in the back among Senate aides -- on the Republican side of the 
aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is someone on the floor who is not authorized," Wallop soon noted, 
asking that Babbitt be escorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, embarrassed Senate aides rushed out after Babbitt, with one 
telling him: "That was a mistake. You may go back on the floor. In fact, I wish 
you would." Babbitt did. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the floor again -- on his own volition -- Babbitt did not seem 
flustered. In fact, escorted out this time by Feinstein, he laughed about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Desert Protection Act would create two national parks and 
dozens of wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, the Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments 
would become national parks, and their lands would be expanded. Millions of 
acres of desert territory would be off-limits to mining and motorized 
recreation.

WHEEL RIMS ADD GLITTER, BUT INCREASINGLY LURE DEADLY VIOLENCE; CRIME: IN ONE 
LAPD BUREAU ALONE, ROBBERS KILL ABOUT 10 PEOPLE A YEAR FOR THE ACCESSORIES THAT 
COST UP TO $7,000 A SET. POLICE SAY THEY'RE BECOMING A SIGN TO 'COME GET ME.'

<P>
 They sparkle and beckon, luring the eye into an intricate, mesmerizing tunnel 
of deep-set cold, shiny chrome or gold-plated spokes. Wheel rims make the car, 
transforming even a rusty junker into a flashy, cherried-out ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killer rims," they're called, $1,500 to $7,000 a set. And now they are living 
up to their name. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a college basketball player lost his life on Normandie Avenue -- 
one of about 10 people killed every year for rims in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's South Bureau alone, according to detectives, who fear that a 
pattern of violence has emerged as rims have gained popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilling twist in Southern California car culture, drivers live and die 
over their wheels. Like overpriced sneakers, expensive rims have become 
improbable emblems of power and fearlessness, especially in crime-ridden 
neighborhoods where aficionados flirt with disaster every time they hit the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drive a car with flashy wheels and you are waving a red flag that says: 'Come 
get me,' " said Los Angeles Police Detective Pete Razanskas, who investigated 
the slaying of an 11-year-old boy in a bungled South-Central Los Angeles 
rimjacking last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlo Davis, a 23-year-old high-scoring guard on Cal State Sacramento's 
basketball team, found out the hard way. He liked the way that Dayton wire 
wheel rims looked on his baby blue 1989 Thunderbird. He liked driving down the 
street and seeing heads turn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 24, three days before he was scheduled to take an exam to become a 
police officer, Davis was shot dead at the carwash a few blocks from his 
mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him to take those wheels off that car; I hated those wheels," said 
Virginia Davis, his mother, crying softly. "I was so upset with that car, I 
wanted to beat it with a hammer. But that wouldn't have done me any good -- it 
still wouldn't have brought Charlo back." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched by the lowriders of the 1950s and '60s, the rim fad has taken on a 
new dimension in recent years as manufacturers started using gold plating, 
stoking up the cost and dazzle. Today, Dayton Wire Wheels, produced by an 
Ohio-based company, are the rim of choice. Popularized by various rap stars, 
including Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose songs refer to "D's" or "Danas," rims have 
become more mainstream, appealing to the driver who wants to add glitter to an 
otherwise ordinary chassis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Schardt, a company vice president who was reluctant to comment on the 
violence connected to the rims, defended the wheels. "People will kill people 
for anything; people in L.A. certainly know that," he said before hanging up on 
a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 But police believe that rims have become a factor. When a car-related crime is 
reported, detectives now want to know not only what type of automobile is 
involved but what kind of wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's getting worse every year. As the callousness of 
people grows, so does the lack of respect for people's property," said Lt. 
Sergio Robleto, commanding officer of the LAPD's South Bureau homicide unit. 
"Many times we are unable to determine the exact cause of a carjacking, but all 
too often we find the rims are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County law enforcement agencies said they knew of no such thefts here 
yet. Such crimes, they said, tend to originate in central city areas and take 
some time to surface in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In an age of computerized automobile manufacturing, car rims -- one of the 
most vulnerable parts of a vehicle, subjected to dings during parking, dirt 
from the streets and water from inclement weather -- are also one of the 
easiest areas to personalize, said Brenda Jo Bright, a professor of Latin and 
Caribbean studies at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the simplest modifications to make your car look like you've 
really done something different," said Bright, who is writing a book about 
lowrider culture. "Cars are important vehicles metaphorically and intrinsically 
for the kinds of things people are allowed to do and expected to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, such transformations, whether wheels or exquisite paint jobs, 
inspired robbers but not violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It boils down to grim economics. Stolen rims move fast on the black market, 
selling for about half their retail price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy money," said Steven, 20, who asked that only his first name be used 
because he's looking for legitimate work after serving three years at Soledad 
state prison for holding a gun to a woman's head and commandeering her car. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue Chevrolet Blazer coming out of Cypress College caught Steven's eye 
because it sported expensive rims. He figured that he could net as much for the 
wheels -- $1,000 -- as for the car. So Steven thrust a 9-millimeter gun in the 
driver's face and demanded her car. The woman slammed the accelerator and 
peeled out. According to his probation officer, Steven jumped into a car driven 
by an accomplice and chased his prey along the freeway, shooting out her rear 
window. When his victim got stuck in Orange County rush-hour traffic, he got 
out and, clutching the gun, ordered her to give up the car. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the terrified woman complied and Steven pounced. "When you see a 
car, your adrenaline flows, you get really hyper excited. You want it; you 
don't want to let it go," he said. "It's like playing video games -- when 
someone is scared the enemy gets boosted up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such widely acknowledged dangers, why cruise the avenues in a 
rim-bedecked car? Wheel buffs have several answers. Aesthetics, says one. 
Attention, says another. Street respect, says a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an elite class: To have rims means you are a successful person," 
said Ricky Donnell Ross, known as Freeway Rick, once one of South-Central Los 
Angeles' most notorious drug lords, who used his illicit proceeds to purchase a 
now-defunct wheel shop. Ross, who completed a prison sentence recently, drove a 
car with rims until he felt that he needed to maintain a lower profile on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, such as Andrew Martinez, a 20-year-old high school graduate from 
Pico Rivera, enjoy being noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez works seven days a week to support his car, earning $5 an hour at a 
Whittier automobile tint shop. He purchased the 1978 Cadillac Coupe de Ville 
from its previous owner, who was heartbroken when it was stolen and recovered 
completely stripped. Using his savings, Martinez set about refurbishing it: a 
brandy-wine paint job, stereo, and, of course, $2,000 rims. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Martinez's car was stolen and stripped. When it was recovered, 
Martinez's heart sank. But he started over again. As soon as he could, he put 
on another set of Dayton rims. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues laugh at him because he takes the freeway to get to work, even 
though his home is only a few blocks from the shop. Martinez, however, believes 
that driving surface streets will only bring trouble. In fact, he tries to 
limit his driving so he goes few places other than home and work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't leave my car anywhere -- it's too dangerous," said Martinez, whose 
family has begged him to remove his rims. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Martinez made a crucial mistake and drove to the mall, where he was 
spotted by a carful of men in gang attire. Martinez quickly left when they 
pulled alongside. Telling himself not to panic, he zipped over to a grocery 
store and went in. But when he emerged, he saw the same car circling again. He 
jumped behind the wheel and drove to the San Gabriel River Freeway, losing his 
pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rimjackers are not the only hazard. Martinez is frequently pulled over by 
police who are suspicious of the baby-faced youth piloting a set of expensive 
wheels. He does not care. "It's just something I always wanted. I will some day 
get rid of them, but right now I'm having fun," he said. "It's not worth dying 
for, but I love driving my car." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Martinez, many wheel enthusiasts strike bargains with themselves, 
devising elaborate schedules to dodge danger and only driving in certain areas 
at specific times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ferguson, for instance, who was shopping recently for a set of 100-spoke 
Dayton wheels, figures he has a solution: two cars. The 27-year-old structural 
ironworker doesn't plan to often use his 1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville once he 
buys the fancy rims. "It'll be a car you drive on weekends when you have a lot 
of people," said Ferguson, a lowrider enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical car wheels, which have solid centers, are held on by lug nuts. Dayton 
Wire Wheels are suspended by spokes. Set in a deep dish, they are anchored by a 
round piece of metal, called an adapter, which is held in place by a knockoff 
bolted on top. They are easy to remove and lack visible serial numbers that 
would help police identify a stolen set. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not statistically track rim-related crimes, but after reviewing 
cases, Robleto estimated that 10 deaths each year in the 58-square-mile South 
Bureau were the result of fancy wheels. Police in other areas of Los Angeles 
said they do not see as many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of 11-year-old Jajuan Avenido of Lynwood, police knew almost 
immediately that the youngster's death was the result of a bungled carjacking, 
inspired by the gold and chrome Dayton rims on his cousin's 1982 Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Jajuan begged to go for a ride in his cousin Landry Wright's 
car. When his stepfather Larry (Junior) Newell said it was too late in the 
evening, the young boy turned to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama, why can't I go?" cajoled the sixth-grader, who wanted to be a truck 
driver when he grew up. "I want to listen to the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Since school hadn't started, Helen Allen relented and let her only child climb 
into Wright's car. At 10:20 p.m. on Central Avenue, two gunmen approached the 
car, one on each side, and ordered Jajuan and Wright to get out. Wright hit the 
accelerator and the gunmen opened fire. Wright was wounded in the shoulder. 
Jajuan, struck by a bullet in the head, slumped in a puddle of blood. He was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Several callers to the police explained the carjackers wanted the rims -- not 
the boy, not the car, Razanskas said. No one provided enough information to 
enable police to capture the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about the Daytons," said Allen, 31. "I wasn't thinking about 
nobody killing each other over Daytons."

RETIREMENT VILLAGE WON'T ESCAPE AERIAL CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day-old skirmish over whether to exempt Leisure Village from next week's 
aerial assault on the Medfly ended Friday when state officials confirmed that 
the retirement community will remain in the spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Leisure Village residents, Ventura County officials had asked 
the state whether it was necessary to bathe the east Camarillo community in the 
sticky combination of malathion and corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure Village residents worry that aerial application of the pesticide will 
harm elderly people with skin and lung ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said Friday there would be no exemption for Leisure 
Village. When helicopters go up Wednesday night to do battle with the Medfly in 
a 16-square-mile eradication zone, the 3,500-member retirement community will 
not be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now feel comfortable that they know all the facts about this area and that 
this decision was not made in a vacuum," said County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, 
who asked that state officials explain their rationale for including Leisure 
Village. "(The infestation) is spreading and we need to get on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision angered some in the retirement community, who say their concerns 
are being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to protect the investment of growers," said 80-year-old Harry 
Becker, a 16-year Leisure Village resident. "They don't give a damn about the 
health of the people here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, members of the California Conservation Corps went door-to-door in 
the gated community, delivering official notification of the aerial treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Leisure Village's board of directors met Friday to finalize 
a meeting scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday to discuss health concerns and other 
issues with state and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That anxiety elbowed its way to the forefront Thursday as state and county 
officials unveiled the strategy for killing off the fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rosin, who lives with his ailing mother in Leisure Village, urged 
officials at a news conference Thursday to put the brakes on the eradication 
program until the health concerns were addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when county officials agreed to look into the matter, Rosin said he 
held out no hope that Leisure Village would be exempted from aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have no idea whether this is necessary," Rosin said Friday. "This is 
being done because growers want it done. It's a state administration that is 
running roughshod over everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Carla Agar, spokeswoman for the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said there are good reasons for Leisure Village being included in 
the eradication zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on past experience, state agricultural officials determined that 
Leisure Village is close enough to the citrus orchard where the Medflies have 
been found that it needs to sprayed, Agar said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said the retirement community has back-yard fruit in which 
the Medfly can lay eggs. And she emphasized that health risks are minimal if 
people take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some at Leisure Village support the eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should be done to protect this industry," said Moe Kadish, 80. "We 
have so much at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 And in other areas of the city, civic leaders and homeowners say there is 
little choice but to spray the area to kill off the fruit-ravaging pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that we wouldn't have to spray, but I have to go with the people 
who are paid to do this, and they say spray," Mayor Ken Gose said. "They're the 
experts. They know more about it than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bill Torrence, president of the Ventura County League of Homeowners and 
a Camarillo Springs resident: "This whole county is in this together. We've got 
a problem here with this fruit fly, and we better eradicate it and we better 
eradicate it damn soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some Leisure Village residents are extremely worried about the aerial 
assault and its effects on those whose health is fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Rosin, the 84-year-old mother of Alan Rosin, said she already needs to 
use an inhaler every three to four hours to ease her asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't breathe already," she said. "The last thing I need is malathion 
dropped on top of me."

CHOPPER COMPANIES PREPARE FOR SPRAYING OF MALATHION 
</P>

 Even before Camarillo residents learned that their back yards would be dusted 
with pesticide, a private helicopter company in the San Joaquin Valley was 
making preparations for the military-style operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a two-year contract with the state Department of Food and Agriculture, 
San Joaquin Helicopters dispatched Bell 204 Hueys earlier this week to survey 
the rolling hills of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather permitting, the pesticide runs begin Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying in formation, three red-and-white helicopters will spray a mixture of 
malathion and corn syrup bait over Camarillo starting at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The flights will take off from the Camarillo Airport, where the helicopters 
will have been loaded in secured areas with 90 gallons of the malathion 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Such operations will take place 10 to 12 times during the next six months at 
two-week intervals to kill any Medflies that emerge after surviving earlier 
sprayings as eggs or larvae. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Delano-based company, California's latest air attack against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s, San Joaquin's pilots and equipment have played a 
central role in the effort to wipe out the pernicious pest. Most recently, they 
were hired in February to spray an 18-square-mile area over Corona in Riverside 
County. Before that, the company carried out eradication efforts over portions 
of Los Angeles County in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both of those operations sparked fierce opposition from residents -- 
including death threats to the Cooperative Medfly Project workers -- San 
Joaquin officials said they expect little hostility in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Ventura County seem to be a whole lot more understanding about 
why spraying is necessary," company owner Jim Josephson said. "I think that's 
because there is so much agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters are used instead of planes because they can drop pesticides more 
precisely in a small area, and because they are safer for flying at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some growers throughout the 86-square-mile quarantined area are 
expected to begin hiring their own pilots for malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules of the quarantine, farmers who want to sell their unpicked 
fruit that is a host to the Medfly must pay to have their crops sprayed with 
malathion four times within a 30-day period. Then the crop must be inspected 
before it can be shipped from the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some growers with unpicked fruit inside the quarantine area, but 
outside the 16-square-mile eradication zone, expect to treat their orchards 
with the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the furor that malathion spraying has caused in populated areas, 
growers routinely hire helicopter crews to dust local vegetable crops, and 
sometimes fruit orchards, with the malathion. The pesticide is commonly used to 
control grasshoppers, boll weevils and mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done on a regular basis, depending on the pest levels," said Rob 
Scherzinger, a pilot for Aspen Helicopters Inc. of Oxnard, the largest local 
crop-dusting company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Medflies were first discovered near Camarillo, dozens of growers have 
contacted Aspen Helicopters to get information about aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no pesticide runs are scheduled yet, Scherzinger said several avocado 
growers have plans to spray their unpicked trees with the series of four 
treatments. "Everybody's kind of taking a wait and see attitude now, but I 
guarantee by Tuesday or Wednesday we're going to be smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherzinger said the spraying will cost growers $10 to $12 an acre for a 
malathion treatment, a price that is cheaper than other crop-dusting because of 
the low-concentration of pesticide that is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rule of the state-imposed quarantine, farmland that falls within the 
16-square-mile eradication zone will be sprayed by San Joaquin's helicopters. 
And growers with unpicked fruit will only have to pay for an additional two or 
three treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 In both urban and agricultural areas, the same concentration of pesticide will 
be sprayed. For every acre of land, 1.2 ounces of malathion will be dispersed, 
said Larry Hawkins, spokesman for the Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, the sprayings differ according to land-use. Flights over 
orchards and farm fields will be done at low altitudes during the daytime. In 
contrast, the urban spraying will be done at nighttime at altitudes of 300 to 
700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, flights over orchards are more precise, while urban spraying is intended 
to scatter the pesticide over broad swaths of houses, parks, schools and 
businesses.

GOVERNOR DECLARES A STATE OF EMERGENCY; MEDFLIES: HIS DECLARATION CITES 
'EXTREME PERIL' TO AGRICULTURE. IT WAS NEEDED BEFORE MALATHION SPRAYING COULD 
BEGIN OVER POPULATED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the Medfly infestation in eastern Camarillo widened, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Friday declared a state of emergency in Ventura County that cited conditions of 
"extreme peril to the agriculture industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's declaration came one day after aerial malathion spraying was ordered 
over a 16-square-mile area of fields and residences in eastern Camarillo and 
Somis to prevent the spread of the county's first Mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of the region -- containing a population of 29,000 -- begins 
at 9 p.m. Wednesday barring bad weather, and will continue every two weeks for 
about six months. Wilson's emergency order was needed before helicopters could 
begin an air assault over any populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going into the air because the potential for loss of crops in Ventura 
County is so great and the number of people employed in agriculture there so 
many," Wilson spokeswoman Kristine Berman said. "We could also face an embargo 
from Japan or domestically." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the aerial spraying of residential areas -- which required the 
governor's approval -- some growers in the spray zone and the wider 
86-square-mile quarantine area imposed earlier this week were proceeding with 
plans of their own for low-level aerial malathion spraying limited strictly to 
fields and orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aerial spraying of malathion over agricultural areas receives little 
attention in the absence of Medfly infestations, it is a relatively routine 
practice. As long as the spraying is confined to fields, no special approval by 
the governor is required. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial spraying zone announced Thursday is limited to eastern Camarillo 
and a stretch of unincorporated county land around Somis. But the larger 
quarantine area extends into parts of Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. Growers in 
those areas with fruit that is a host for Medflies will have to pay for 
low-level aerial spraying of malathion on their fields if they want to ship 
their produce outside the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 In justifying the need for the aerial spraying, county Agriculture 
Commissioner Earl McPhail estimated that up to 22,000 people work in the 
agriculture industry in the county and up to $439 million in crops could be at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Ventura County emergency declaration Tuesday, Sheriff Larry Carpenter 
asked the governor to seek a federal declaration from President Clinton. But 
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the governor, said Friday that Wilson had decided 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we acted so quickly, we expect to knock this pest down so quickly 
that costs will be minimal and we won't need a federal emergency declaration," 
Walsh said. At this point, no disaster funds are considered available to 
growers, but assessments of damages will continue through the quarantine 
period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from Japan, which buys about one-third of the county's 
$216-million lemon crop and substantial quantities of oranges and avocados, 
will arrive in California Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They will tour the Cooperative Medfly Project facilities in Los Angeles 
County, where a team of state and federal agriculture officials oversees the 
state's Medfly eradication programs, before coming to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation is expected to arrive in Camarillo on Wednesday, said Rex 
Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be looking for our level of diligence in controlling the 
infestation, how organized we are and how well we can track the fruit from the 
packinghouse through the Port of Hueneme to exclude exposure to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Japanese will not accept any fruit from within the 86-square-mile 
quarantine area, growers and state and local officials fear Japan may place an 
embargo on the entire county, or possibly the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot depends on what happens next week when the Japanese tour the area," 
Laird said. But he said the potential for financial disaster with the Medfly 
infestation is great. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my 14 years in the county, through frost and flood and drought, I 
can't think of anything worse for potential across-the-board losses in the 
county than this." 
</P>
<P>
 The new finds confirmed Friday brought the total Medfly count to three 
egg-carrying females and 60 males. All males were found within a quarter-mile 
of the site where the first two females were found last week, in the center of 
a grove on the grounds of St. John's Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent female fly found was more than a mile from the original site, 
still within the grove and away from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Los Angeles County began its program of releasing sterile males to mate 
with fertile female Medflies four years ago, the sterile flies have been 
routinely found in Ventura County along major routes and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those finds, Laird said he always expected that any Medfly 
infestation would be found along a major highway or route, and not in the 
center of an orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought it would be through a commuter car as opposed to what 
appears to be an importation of a host material from an infested area," he 
said. "It's off the beaten path and appears to be connected with the seminary." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Agriculture Henry Voss, who announced the spraying program 
Thursday, said the spraying area boundaries would be expanded if a wild Medfly 
were found within half a mile of the spraying perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 But state agriculture officials said Friday there is no plan now to expand the 
spraying area because the find was still within 1 1/2 miles of the core area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boundaries stay as they were outlined," said Carla Agar, a spokeswoman 
for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Camarillo on Friday, 150 members of the California Conservation 
Corps fanned out to distribute pamphlets to those whose residences would be 
sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams of youths handed out about 15,000 leaflets in Spanish and English to 
every residence and business in the area, said Tony Haro, an entomologist with 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Zook , who has a 3-year-old daughter, stood on the front stoop of her 
Somis home with her husband Eric and quickly read over the information handed 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little concerned because of our daughter," she said. "My husband runs a 
landscaping business and uses malathion so he's not as worried. But I'll take 
precautions -- make sure the dog is inside and bring the swing set in." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks down the street, Gail Mier, 58, looked over the leaflet she had 
been handed. Her house is next to an agricultural field. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about people with allergies?" she asked. "My grandson has allergies and 
it gets to where he can't breath sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although growers in Ventura County, along with back-yard gardeners, have 
routinely used malathion for years in the county, the aerial spraying program 
will mark the first time it will be widely distributed over people's yards and 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 The pesticide will be mixed with corn syrup bait to attract the flies to eat 
the substance, which is lethal to the insects. 
</P>
<P>
 The three helicopters that will take off from Camarillo Airport will carry on 
each spraying operation a total of 90 gallons of pesticide to distribute over 
the 16-square-mile area, or about 1.2 ounces per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quantities are considered extremely small by state health 
officials, they could still be enough to be harmful to sensitive people, Dr. 
George Rutherford of the state Department of Health Services said. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged people to use common sense, keeping small children, the ill and the 
elderly out of the pesticide spray and washing off any skin that comes into 
contact with the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also suggest that shallow fish ponds or wading pools be covered 
during the applications and that lawn furniture and playground equipment be 
washed off before they are used.

VENTURA WEIGHS $315,000 TO GET THE WORD OUT 
</P>

 A year and a half after axing staff positions and slashing budgets citywide, 
the Ventura City Council Monday will consider adding two expenditures: $100,000 
to launch a new public relations office and $215,000 to install 
state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment in council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly support it," said Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures. "We need to 
greatly improve our communication to the public." The public relations effort 
-- which is officially called the Citizen Awareness Program -- will help City 
Hall burnish its image in the community, Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 But one critic questioned why the city was considering spending so much on 
marketing and video cameras when many city divisions are strapped for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, this is really not the time for local government to be spending 
money on something that is not absolutely essential to the public," said Mike 
Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers' Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 But Saliba added that communications services, like the public relations 
effort, are sometimes worth the money because they serve the public's need to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 That is precisely what officials hope they will accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Measures explained, city officials mostly rely on the media to broadcast 
municipal services and accomplishments to residents. Hopefully, she said, a 
marketing director would propose new opportunities for spreading the city's 
messages while organizing the current mishmash of press releases. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the high-tech video system would beam a slicker image of 
council meetings into living rooms every Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Three remote cameras burrowed into the chamber's walls and one monitor to the 
right of the council dais would record the proceedings from all possible 
angles, operating on an automated, voice-activated system. Currently, the 
council meeting is recorded on one video monitor, which an operator swings from 
speaker to speaker throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements also include replacing the 21-year-old sound system, which 
periodically breaks down in mid-meeting, leaving puzzled television viewers 
staring at a silent screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The money the city will spend on the equipment and the PR campaign, however, 
could pay to reconstitute the Police Department's traffic unit, which has lost 
one-third of its original nine officers due to budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 It could also be a big help to the Finance Department, where Mike Solomon and 
a co-worker struggle with the work once assigned to five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are backing up, to the point where you just get numb to it," said 
Solomon, the city's budget and risk manager, surveying stacks of unfiled 
documents around his desk. "You just do what you can and keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000 for public relations would come out of the city's recreation fund 
and would be spread over two years. The bulk of the money -- up to $36,000 each 
year -- would pay a coordinator to oversee the entire effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides issuing bulletins to the media, the coordinator would be responsible 
for devising new ways to reach residents through such avenues as the public 
access cable channel and, possibly, a city newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a step in the right direction," said Mayor Tom Buford. "We're making 
sure that the city, as an organization, provides people with information about 
what we're doing."

 A Fillmore man suffered serious bullet wounds and another was arrested in 
connection with a drive-by shooting that began with an earlier argument in 
Fillmore, sheriff's deputies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Lopez, 20, suffered several bullet wounds to the neck and abdomen while 
in front of his house in the 300 block of Del Valle Drive about 9:30 p.m. 
Thursday, Sheriff's Detective Raul Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, given descriptions of the gunman, arrested 18-year-old Reynaldo 
Villagomez about an hour later at his house in the 900 block of 3rd Street, not 
far from the site of the shooting, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Lopez, along with his brother and two men, had been standing in front 
of his house when a motorist in a dark-gray older Toyota pulled up. The two 
brothers approached the Toyota, words were exchanged, and the motorist fired a 
small-caliber handgun toward them. The bullets struck Lopez, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being driven to a relative's house on nearby Sespe Avenue, Lopez was 
taken to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, where a nursing supervisor said he was 
in serious condition after undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagomez was booked at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion of assault with 
a deadly weapon, Sgt. Jeff Matson said. Bail was $25,000 and Villagomez is to 
be arraigned Tuesday, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives had not determined whether the Thursday night shooting was 
gang-related, he said. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DEFENSE IN CRASH CASE CITES HEALTH PROBLEM 
</P>

<P>
 A Camarillo businessman crashed into eight cars and injured two people while 
driving drunk, but maintains he is innocent of any crime because he was 
unconscious due to a combination of medical problems, his attorney told jurors 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Myron George Harrison, 53, is charged in Ventura County Municipal Court with 
13 misdemeanors stemming from the March 26 incident, including drunk driving 
causing injury, hit-and-run, ignoring a police vehicle's lights and sirens, and 
resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses estimated Harrison's car reached speeds of 100 m.p.h. as he drove 
from Santa Paula to downtown Ventura, Deputy Dist. Atty. David Lehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's conduct is undisputed, but defense attorney Louis Samonsky said his 
client does not remember what happened because he was experiencing a 
hypoglycemic blackout that was aggravated by a hypothyroid condition and a 
25-year-old bout with encephalitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unconscious, under the law, means not voluntarily doing what you're charged 
with doing," Samonsky said in his opening statement. "Why did he drive and why 
did he cause all of these crashes? Because he was unconscious and did not do 
one single criminal act in a voluntary fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison left Santa Paula about 7:40 p.m. and sped down California 126. While 
on the highway, Harrison knocked two cars off the road, then made a U-turn 
through oleander bushes in the center divider and struck two more cars, Lehr 
said. Police arrested him in downtown Ventura, where he sideswiped four more 
cars, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the drivers hit by Harrison were injured, Lehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's blood-alcohol level 1 1/2 hours later was 0.19%, which is more than 
twice the legal limit for driving, the prosecutor said. Samonsky said Harrison 
had seven mixed drinks that day but did no driving until he was in the blackout 
stage. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SMALL QUAKE SHAKES COASTAL REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small earthquake deep under Emma Wood State Beach shook the coastal area 
overnight, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.8 magnitude quake, which struck at 11:58 p.m. Thursday, was centered 
about two miles northwest of Ventura and about four miles beneath the sand and 
surf, seismologist Egill Hauksson of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was unrelated to the thousands of aftershocks of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake and was a routine release of the local tension that 
builds whenever the oceanic and continental crustal plates bind along the San 
Andreas Fault, Hauksson said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pacific Plate creeps about two inches a year in a northwesterly

 He said the San Andreas Fault, where the two meet, borders much of northern 
Ventura County, making the area seismically active.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; JUDGE WON'T DISMISS MAN'S FRAUD CASE 
</P>

<P>
 A judge on Friday refused to dismiss a workers' compensation fraud case 
against a Camarillo sales executive, who charged that prosecutors seized a 
computer disk spelling out his defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although investigators did take a disk containing confidential correspondence 
between defendant Alan Griffis and his attorney, Superior Court Judge Charles 
R. McGrath said he was "just not convinced that the D.A. investigators actually 
saw privileged material." 
</P>
<P>
 After McGrath's ruling, Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda A. Schmidt said the disk has 
been turned over to the court and she has no intention of trying to look at it. 
"We don't need it," she said. "We have plenty of evidence to prove the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis, 41, was the first Ventura County defendant to be charged with 
workers' compensation fraud. Prosecutors say he illegally collected nearly 
$7,000 in benefits while misrepresenting his neck, back and shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other defendants who were charged with workers' compensation fraud after 
Griffis have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis, who is contesting the charges against him, is scheduled for 
arraignment in Superior Court on Oct. 19. McGrath ordered the prosecutor to 
prepare a new listing of charges before that time and be more specific about 
what Griffis' illegal activities were. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath made that order after defense attorney George C. Eskin complained that 
the charges were not specific enough. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTHER IN BATTERY CASE MISSES HEARING

<P>
 An Oxnard woman accused of dropping her infant daughter over a six-foot fence 
did not show up for a scheduled court hearing Friday, but the judge agreed to 
give her another chance before issuing an arrest warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Aretha Marcell Chester, 23, is scheduled for trial Oct. 17 on charges of child 
endangerment and battery.Superior Court Judge Joe D. Hadden said he will issue 
a warrant for Chester's arrest if she does not appear in court that day, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester's attorney, Jorge Alvarado, said he believes his client made an honest 
mistake by failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a mix-up on the dates," Alvarado said. "At this point I 
don't think you can say she's failing to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said Chester has been in contact with his investigator in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester was arrested after an incident on July 31 that witnesses said began 
with an argument between the woman and a group of men at Sierra Linda Park in 
Oxnard. When the men jumped over a chain-link fence, Chester dangled the 
3-month-old infant over the fence and released the girl, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall fractured the baby's skull, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester was in jail in lieu of $10,000 bail until Hadden, over prosecution 
objections, released her on her own recognizance last month, Fox said. The 
defendant has made one court appearance since then, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chester failed to appear in court Friday, Hadden ordered a $25,000 
warrant held until the Oct. 17 trial date. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SHOPPING CENTER NEAR AIRPORT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Ventura County Transportation Commission on Friday approved 
plans for a shopping center near Oxnard Airport, despite worries that the 
project would expose airplane passengers and ground-dwelling citizens to 
unnecessary risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal from Marketplace Properties would build a shopping center 
featuring an Albertson's supermarket at 5th Street and Ventura Road.Two of the 
five commissioners voted against the Albertson's proposal, and others voiced 
concerns about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landing an airplane is not an exact science," said Commissioner Frank 
Schillo. "I think there could be a potential for a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who voted against the project, predicted the "San Diego-izing" of the 
area surrounding Oxnard Airport, worrying that the area would become so 
built-up that the airport would become unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Smith said he opposed the land-use but voted for the 
project, saying that the commission's role was simply to check that the 
buildings planned did not violate height restrictions previously imposed by the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission unanimously voted down a request by the same developer to 
rezone another parcel of land near the airport designated for office buildings 
to general commercial use. It found that general commercial use of the land, at 
2nd Street and Ventura Road, is inconsistent with its designation as an "inner 
safety zone" under the airport's comprehensive land use plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Agency has found that the Albertson's project does not 
pose a safety hazard. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: MOORPARK; PANEL MAY DISCUSS BID TO BUILD COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Parks and Harbor Commission is tentatively scheduled to 
discuss a bid to build two 18-hole golf courses at Happy Camp Canyon Regional 
Park near Moorpark at its Oct. 19 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The public golf courses would be built on the lower 700 acres of the park 
where a Western-style theme park had once been planned.The upper 3,000 acres 
would remain a wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the lease agreement with the county, the owners of the golf courses 
would either make an annual lease payment to the county or pay a percentage of 
their receipts, which could amount to as much as $250,000 a year, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the money would be used to help pay for maintenance of the trails 
on the upper 3,000 acres of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The county solicited proposals in July from golf course designers to develop 
the area, but received just one bid, from local developer Ralph Mahan, who 
first proposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahan's proposal does not meet the terms laid out by the county's 
Department of Recreation Services, said Robert Amore, lease manager for the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only tentatively scheduled the item because we're still negotiating the 
terms of Mahan's bid," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Amore declined to comment on the differences between the terms laid out by the 
county and Mahan's proposal until the terms have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The original terms would have required that the developer pay a $25,000 
lease-purchase option for the two-year environmental review and permitting 
process.  
</P>
<P>
 If a new agreement is reached and the commission approves its terms, the 
proposal would go before the Board of Supervisors on Nov. 8, Amore said. SCOTT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: NEWBURY PARK; SWEET-TOOTHED THIEF BREAKS INTO VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While residents at the Las Casitas condominium slept, an auto burglar with a 
sweet tooth and a knack for removing the window of a car without a sound 
managed to break into four vehicles, sheriff's deputies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime late Thursday or early Friday, a thief removed the back windows of 
the vehicles parked at the Newbury Park development and then removed the 
stereos or compact-disc units in the dashboards, Sheriff's Sgt. Kitty Hoberg 
said 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the cars, only candy bars were taken.The vehicles, including two 
pickup trucks, were parked in carports bordering an alley that runs between 
Paseo Esmeralda and Paseo La Perla, Hoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car owners later found their back windows, intact and unbroken, beside 
their vehicles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we go from looking for kids who like candy bars to specialists who know 
how to remove windows," the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglaries come a week after sheriff's deputies arrested three suspects in 
connection with 13 auto burglaries in the Moorpark area. On Sept. 30, deputies 
arrested a 19-year-old man and two juveniles on suspicion of vehicle burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoberg said detectives feel the three were involved with 13 auto burglaries, 
in which cellular phones were removed from unlocked cars and then offered for 
sale the next day at school. "It's one of the biggest problems we have in 
(Thousand Oaks)," she said. "The crimes are happening more frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the latest burglaries, Hoberg added: "Obviously, these people are very 
proficient. . . . They may be involved in the window removal or stereo 
business." GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PLAN WOULD ADD 4 THERAPISTS AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four mental health therapists would be added to local schools under a plan to 
expand a partnership between Ventura County and its school districts to be 
considered Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, approved two years ago by county supervisors, seeks to keep 
emotionally disturbed children in the classroom instead of in costly home-based 
school programs, county Mental Health Director Randall Feltman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra psychiatrists are needed because the number of emotionally disturbed 
schoolchildren has more than doubled in the past six years, Feltman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the county served 150 emotionally disturbed children in 
special-education classes at various campuses. State law requires that a public 
education be available to all special-education students. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the number of such children climbed to 241 by 1992, county schools 
officials began looking for ways to limit the number of special-education 
children being taught at home, Feltman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the number of emotionally disturbed children in special-education 
classes has jumped from 241 to 321, he said. "I don't think we have more 
emotionally disturbed kids," Feltman said. "The main thing is that this 
legislation is becoming better known." 
</P>
<P>
 Costs for the $170,000 expansion will be shared by the school districts and 
Ventura County, which will be eligible for reimbursements for its portion from 
state Medi-Cal funds. JEFF McDONALD

HEALTH STUDY OF ROCKWELL WORKERS CRITICIZED; SIMI VALLEY: SOME SAY RESEARCH ON 
CHEMICALS AND RADIATION EXPOSURE IS UNDERMINED BY MISSING RECORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents who live near Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory 
on Friday questioned the worth of an ongoing health study examining the effects 
of chemicals and radiation exposure on Rockwell workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the advisory committee appointed to monitor the mortality 
study, Santa Susana Knolls resident Marie Mason said she felt scientists will 
be forced to rely too heavily on educated guesses about exposures because 
decades worth of records from the research facility are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live at the end of that road with my children," Mason said. "I'm supposed 
to rely on their good guesses? I'm not comfortable relying on their guesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the mortality study is to determine whether there was an unusual 
number of deaths among Rockwell employees over the years, and if so, to link 
those deaths to possible chemical or radiation exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy commissioned the $840,000 study of the company's 
Rocketdyne Division in 1991, and a team of scientists from UCLA began gathering 
research last fall. Final results are not expected for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory panel is composed of residents, government officials and 
independent scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA scientists acknowledged they are encountering an unusual number of 
difficulties in gathering information on past Rockwell employees and their 
activities on the 2,700-acre site southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of study is actually the most difficult kind to do," said John 
Froines, one of the study's principal investigators. "Lots of times you can go 
into a factory and see where all the exposures might occur. Here it's a crazy 
quilt of exposures, practices and changing technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said they have released all the records they have on 
radiation and chemical exposures to the UCLA team. But very little in the way 
of records exists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The innuendo is that we haven't turned things over to them," said John Rozas, 
director of health and safety at Rockwell. "But we've searched everything and 
given them everything likely to yield results. I can't invent records." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas said records probably did exist at one time, but accident reports and 
other health and safety monitoring data probably were destroyed after a few 
years because there were no federal requirements to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep tax records for seven years," panel member Sheldon Plotkin 
said. "You don't have to keep accident reports?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Beate Ritz, assistant researcher for the UCLA team, said she can work 
without the accident reports. What worries her, she said, is that very little 
information is available about who worked where. Location codes for workers 
should provide clues about what chemicals they were exposed to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have 26 location codes," Ritz said. "But there are what, 300-plus 
buildings up there?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said she will have to rely on job titles for employee records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the UCLA team, research on worker records at Rockwell's Canoga 
and De Soto facilities in the San Fernando Valley is scheduled to begin next 
week. Those records are crucial to the study because so many workers moved 
between those sites and the Santa Susana testing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rozas said Rockwell may not allow researchers in, because those facilities 
were not included in the original DOE proposal for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Mason stood up to tell the panel she has serious reservations about 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have very little to work with," she said, referring to the UCLA 
team. "Everybody is guessing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Froines said he has confidence in the results of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way," he said. "I think we'll come out with a good finding. 
It won't be perfect. But I think we'll be able to determine if there was excess 
mortality." 
</P>
<P>
 Money problems are also plaguing the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA team is asking for another $110,000 to finish the project. Scientists 
have already gathered death certificates for 3,402 vested employees who worked 
for Rockwell for more than 10 years, but expect to be tracking down up to 4,000 
death certificates for non-vested employees, far more than they initially 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas said Rockwell recently asked for $230,000 from the DOE to cover costs of 
employee time spent helping the researchers. The request was denied at the 
state level.

PROPOSITION 183: SENSE OUT OF NONSENSE; MEASURE WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID 
WASTEFUL BACK-TO-BACK ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County was forced to hold a special election last April on whether 
to recall state Sen. David A. Roberti, a Van Nuys Democrat, from his 20th 
District seat in the San Fernando Valley; this happened just two months before 
the regularly scheduled June primary election. If that makes no sense to you, 
then the good sense of Proposition 183 will be evident. 
</P>
<P>
 The enemies of Roberti did not launch the recall move against him because he 
had violated a law, abused the public trust or was unable to perform his 
duties. Rather, the election was brought about by a vocal few who targeted the 
senator because he had the courage to express strong views on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recall voting, Roberti won easily -- but Los Angeles County taxpayers 
lost big; nearly $1 million in public money had to be laid out for the special 
election. All this just weeks before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 183, a proposed state constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8 
ballot, couldn't prevent stupid elections or unnecessary recalls, but if 
approved -- and it should be -- it could save tons of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 This well-thought-out measure could prevent the counterproductive scheduling 
of elections back to back, as was the case earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 183 authorizes a recall election to be held as late as four months 
after certification. Now a recall election for a state office requires a vote 
to be scheduled between 60 and 80 days after a recall petition is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that the constitutional amendment would allow politicians to 
avoid recalls. Absurd. Under Proposition 183 the governor would be free to 
schedule a recall as early as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, with a much more liberal time span for setting a recall vote, the 
governor would have the option of combining a recall with an upcoming primary 
or fall election. That could mean higher voter turnouts and potentially big 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reasons, Proposition 183 deserves a "yes" vote.

IRAQ'S AT IT AGAIN: WILL IT NEVER CHANGE?; NEED FOR U.N. CAUTION IN ARMS 
MONITORING IS REAFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iraq's latest exercise in military posturing and provocation along its border 
with Kuwait comes, surely by no coincidence, just as its diplomatic efforts at 
the United Nations to have the economic sanctions against it lifted are nearing 
a climax. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two weeks Iraq's deputy prime minister, the smooth, voluble and 
perennial Tarik Aziz, has been waging what some drolly describe as a "charm 
offensive" aimed at generating support for ending the sanctions, which were 
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month the Security Council is scheduled to hear from Rolf Ekeus, 
who heads the U.N. commission that is supposed to make sure Iraq no longer 
builds or is hiding nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or missiles to 
deliver them. Ekeus has overseen the construction of an elaborate monitoring 
system designed to detect Iraqi cheating. That system is to be tested for six 
months. If it's found to work, and Iraq is found to be in compliance with U.N. 
resolutions, the Security Council will be asked to lift the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago we wrote that, under the right conditions, lifting the sanctions 
would be in order. The key condition, of course, is close monitoring of the 
kind that the Ekeus commission has planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, we cited the need for Iraq to give up its spurious territorial 
claim to Kuwait and the need for it to accept permanent international 
monitoring of its imports so that it can't secretly reacquire a threatening 
weapons capability. These conditions continue to be urgent. Now, however, fresh 
doubts have been raised about how effectively the whole of Iraq can be 
monitored by technical means. These put the sanctions issue in a new light. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent speech CIA Director R. James Woolsey accused Iraq of "accelerating 
construction of deep underground shelters and tunnels to produce and store 
weapons of mass destruction." A few days ago a CIA spokesman expressed concern 
that Iraq "is still hiding Scud missiles, chemical munitions and its entire 
biological weapons warfare program," presumably in beneath-ground sites that 
couldn't be reached by conventional bombing. These weapons and the Scuds were 
all supposed to have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA's concerns about on-going Iraqi duplicity raise the most serious 
questions, serious enough, certainly, so that the evidence on which they are 
based should be put before the Security Council before it begins to debate 
lifting the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's troop movements near Kuwait may be prelude to military action or they 
may be nothing more than a clumsy attempt to try to convince the world that it 
still is capable of using a military option if the sanctions aren't lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, as President Clinton warned Friday, Iraq shouldn't again miscalculate 
by misreading U.S. resolve. As an earnest of that resolve he has put some U.S. 
forces on alert and ordered naval strength in the Persian Gulf increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the question of whether Iraq has been able to elude U.N. monitoring 
of its unconventional weapons programs becomes increasingly compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 If the CIA's findings are right, then lifting the sanctions would of course be 
unthinkable. The immediate need, then, is to lay all the evidence that points 
to Iraqi cheating before the Security Council, so that other key U.N. members 
can draw the proper conclusions.

NURTURING THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA; MANDELA'S U.S. TRIP STIRS STILL MORE ECONOMIC 
HELP FOR THE FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, triumphant in his first trip to the United States since being 
elected South Africa's first black president, is getting American help -- 
through both donations and business investment -- for his nascent democracy. 
That's gratifying and significant.  
</P>
<P>
 During Mandela's visit to Washington this week President Clinton promised $50 
million, part of a federal Southern Africa Development Fund, on top of a 
previously announced $600-million foreign aid package for fiscal 1994 through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of that $600 million is earmarked for business development, job 
creation, housing, health care, education, electrification, the restoration of 
an independent judiciary and training for disadvantaged owners of small 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. assistance also includes funds to train marginalized youths who live 
in the poor, black townships. These angry and desperate youngsters want a 
better life now. If they take to the streets in violence they will threaten the 
stability of the new South Africa. Their patience must be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. businesses are increasingly interested in investing in South Africa's new 
market, which potentially has 41.6 million customers. Two companies announced 
plans recently to market products in South Africa -- Duracell International 
Inc., the battery manufacturer, and Subway Corp., the sandwich maker. PepsiCo, 
Chrysler, General Motors and other large companies already are investing there. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce their risk, many firms are obtaining insurance, information and 
financing from the federally funded Overseas Private Investment Corp., which 
supports private American investment in Russia and other developing countries 
in addition to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's invitation to invest in South Africa should put to rest fears that a 
victorious African National Congress would espouse communism or socialism. The 
new president is clearly a capitalist intent on reaping something much more 
substantive than standing ovations. He seeks foreign investment as he continues 
to craft a non-racial, democratic, peaceful and, perhaps, prosperous future for 
the new South Africa.

TRANSPORTATION WORKERS' PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On behalf of the approximately 4,500 bus and train operators on the Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, I wish to take strong 
exception to the commentary by Wendell Cox ("The People's Problem Isn't Rail 
vs. Buses," Sept. 23), which not only distorts the facts concerning the salary 
paid to our members, but also indicated that there is a public benefit from 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 The author denigrated and belittled the service our members provide to the 
people of Los Angeles County. Public transit is a vital public service and 
nowhere in this country is it as physically and emotionally demanding as it is 
here on the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt was made to belittle our members vis-a-vis teachers, by saying that 
teachers, "who must earn a college degree," are paid less than our members. The 
demands and work time of the two professions are totally different. Ironically, 
however, the actual starting wage rates are amazingly similar. Both teachers 
and bus drivers start out in the high $20,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the similarity stops there. Top-rated bus drivers can only be assured 
of a guaranteed $38,000 per year without overtime, no matter how many years of 
service they have, while teachers can get into the $50,000 range. Also, most 
people don't realize that because of the two peak-hour service periods, there 
is something unique in the transit industry called "spread time," whereby an 
employee has a break of several hours in his or her work day, without pay. 
While there is no requirement for the employee to stay at his or her home 
division, reality provides limitations as to what can or can't be done, so most 
simply choose or find it easier to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, an employee might leave his home and not return for 12 or more hours and 
still be paid for eight hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as privatization is concerned, the so-called savings resulting from 
lower wages and benefits are almost always overstated.

REPUBLICANS' 10-POINT CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Column One, "Gingrich: At Long Last, Power," Oct. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 The article makes one very important error. Republicans promise to bring their 
10 items of legislation to a vote within the first 100 days of the new 
Congress. They do not promise to enact any one of the legislative items. For 
the first time in decades, each of the 10 items will be completely open to 
discussion on the House floor, subject to amendment and argument, in full view 
of C-Span's audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP wants to demonstrate that good laws, supported by a large majority of 
voters, can result from congressional openness, in stark contrast to the way 
Democrats have abused power for 40 years in arrogant disregard to the American 
citizenry. House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has stated clearly that if 
Republicans gain the House majority, and if they do not introduce these 10 
items within the first 100 days, the electorate is invited to throw them out.

 Thank you for bringing us David S. Broder ("GOP's 'Let's Make a Deal' Is Short 
on Real Rewards," Commentary, Sept. 28), which is short on facts. If the 
Republicans have actually made public a list of things they promise to do, then 
to the thinking voter it is important news. I wanted to hear about it. But not 
to be, not in The Times. In less than a full sentence, we are told that the 
Republicans propose a "balanced budget amendment, a variety of tax cuts, 
welfare reform, tort reform and term limits." These words are the only facts 
offered to describe the GOP proposal, while Broder's other words tell us why 
it's a "snake-oil approach," and how the Republicans use "high-tech 
demagoguery." Broder goes on to pejoratively describe the GOP in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, there's more! I still wanted to know exactly what was included in this 
10-point proposal. I must have missed it when I read Section A. Alas, there it 
was, buried just inside the last page, misleadingly headlined "Republicans Vow 
Conservative Change." The article begins by telling us that the "10-point 
platform, which Democrats denounced as unworkable and a fraud on the public, 
promises action on a balanced budget amendment, a presidential line-item veto, 
massive family tax cuts, and other popular issues." What other popular issues? 
What was the "10-point platform"? 
</P>
<P>
 This article clearly belongs in the Op-Ed section next to Broder's; it had no 
business being reported as "news."

 I see Gingrich and his "doom gloomers" are at it again. Their new agenda 
starts when they get a majority in the House and Senate. Why don't they start 
now? The Democrats have been accused of being the big spenders; look what the 
new GOP agenda proposes -- new tax cuts, bigger defense spending to fight an 
imaginary superpower and a big budget deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 Just when the Democrats have got the deficit under control, here come Gingrich 
and his cronies to get us back to the Reagan years of fiscal irresponsibility. 
I hope the American people see through this fallacy and vote accordingly.

MILLER'S LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It must be made clear that Miller Brewing Co. emphatically supports water 
conservation and recycling projects. We have been members of the Southland 
community for over 20 years and understand fully that we need to prepare for 
droughts such as the one we experienced in the early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 What we filed a lawsuit (Sept. 14) against is the current design of the 
project as proposed by the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water District. 
Specifically, the lack of proven technological safeguards that can help (not 
guarantee) minimize the possibility of an environmental catastrophe. For over 
two years, Miller has made specific recommendations to improve the project, but 
the water purveyors have responded by saying that those safeguards are too 
expensive and would not make the project cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that Miller Brewing is being portrayed as a company that 
would like to stop the project to protect its own self-serving interests. In 
fact, all or most of the companies that use water in their process or products 
that are in the affected area are concerned about their future. Miller Brewing 
is the focal point because we were willing to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not Miller Brewing Co. The issue is the health and safety of over 
1 million residents of the San Gabriel Valley. While the valley can survive 
without Miller Brewing, it can't survive without clean drinking water.

PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are writing in response to articles by proponents of Prop. 187 that have 
been included in your recent Commentary series. As director of and 
commissioners for the Commission for Sex Equity of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, we are appalled by the mean-spirited and reactionary nature of 
arguments in favor of the measure. The commission was formed specifically to 
increase access and opportunity for girls and women in the schools. Given the 
fact that at least 40% of our student population are immigrants and the vast 
majority of recent immigrants have been women and children, the effects of 
Prop. 187 concern us greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Prop. 187: 
</P>
<P>
 * Denies prenatal care for undocumented women. 
</P>
<P>
 * Denies immunizations for undocumented children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Denies access to legal abortion, family planning, HIV testing and 
prevention, and breast cancer screening for immigrant women. 
</P>
<P>
 * Could deny rape crisis assistance and access to battered women's shelters to 
immigrant women. 
</P>
<P>
 This punitive, ill-conceived measure is even more ominous because it would 
apply to those who are suspected of being undocumented, in essence, all people 
who look or sound "foreign" (read Asians and Latinos). 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that Prop. 187 is not about improving the future of Californians. 
It is about criminalizing the voiceless and most vulnerable among us, our 
school-aged children. Even the highest ranking law enforcement official for the 
country, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, implores the public to focus our efforts 
on educating and protecting our children who are here. Instead, Prop. 187 will 
create a huge, ill-educated and unhealthy underclass. How will this measure 
allow us to regain our strength as a state? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, California is at an important crossroads. Unfortunately, proponents of 
187 are taking the path of divisiveness. Before all of us is the real challenge 
to strive toward a more just and compassionate society and not one that pits 
one group against the other during hard times.

MALATHION'S THREAT TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS IS NEGLIGIBLE, OFFICIALS SAY; HEALTH: 
ALL ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE PESTICIDE. BUT THE AMOUNT USED IS CALLED TOO SMALL 
TO BE DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER and JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pesticide malathion, which will be sprinkled over Camarillo and Somis 
neighborhoods beginning Wednesday to combat a Medfly infestation, kills the 
pest by attacking its nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals with nervous systems -- including humans and pets as well as many 
insects -- are susceptible to the pesticide's effects, if the substance is 
breathed, eaten or absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way all those organophosphates work," said Albert Heier, a 
spokesman for the Pesticides Division of the U. S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the amount that will be mixed with the sugary fly bait is so small -- only 
1.2 ounces per acre -- that health effects are expected to be negligible for 
healthy people, state officials said. Nevertheless, it is a substance designed 
to be toxic to the Medfly and other pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a pesticide made that is intended for people to be covered with 
it," Heier said. "They are made to kill insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other organophosphates, like parathion, malathion is broken down much 
more quickly in mammals than it is in insects. "So it is much more toxic to 
insects than to people," said Phil Phillips, an entomologist with the UC 
agriculture extension office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion inhibits the enzyme cholinesterase, which is essential to proper 
communication between nerve cells and between the nerves and muscles. Without 
it, the nerves fire continuously, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of sends the system into a frenzy, with the nerves telling the 
muscles, 'Move, move, move,' " Phillips said. "The system gets overloaded and 
everything shuts down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the malathion can be broken down quickly by humans, it is still quite 
toxic to fish, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies submitted to the EPA do not show any evidence that the pesticide has 
caused birth defects, and early studies showed no evidence that the substance 
causes cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials still await the results of a new study on carcinogenic 
effects of malaoxon, a product that emerges when malathion breaks down. Results 
of that study should be made public within a few months, said EPA spokesman 
Dave Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on malathion have shown that it may cause allergic reactions in some 
people, and that each subsequent exposure could produce a stronger skin 
reaction, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County, where the pesticide was sprayed by air, a small number of 
residents experienced skin rashes, allergic reactions and asthma after the 
applications, said Dr. Bradley Gilbert, Riverside County public health officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "you would have to lick an entire football field of malathion" 
to get sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials advise the very young, the elderly and the ill to stay out of 
the pesticide spray and minimize contact with recently sprayed areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said some problems may be inevitable when malathion is sprayed in the 
16-square-mile eradication zone, with an estimated population of 29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you spray over a huge area and expose a lot of people, you're almost 
guaranteed through bad luck of something freaky happening . . . like a baby 
crawling through a just-sprayed area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is a Times staff writer and Fields is a correspondent. Aerial Spraying 
WHERE: A 16-square-mile area of eastern Camarillo roughly bounded by California 
118 to the north and the Ventura Freeway to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN: Beginning at 9 p.m. Wednesday and continuing three to four hours, and 
recurring once every two weeks for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT: The pesticide malathion mixed with corn syrup to attract Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: Stay out of the spray, especially the ill, very young and 
elderly. Cover shallow ponds and wading pools. Wash lawn furniture and 
playground equipment before using. Cover vehicles to prevent damage to paint.

UNION DECLARES IMPASSE WITH COUNTY OVER PAY, MAY STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A union representing about 3,600 Ventura County public employees has declared 
an impasse with county negotiators and is considering a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Service Employees International Union, which is seeking 
a 4% pay raise for county employees, said Friday that negotiations with 
personnel administrators have broken down.The union's contract expired in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken the attitude to everyone employed by the county that they are 
lucky to have jobs and have no room to complain," said Barry Hammitt, executive 
director of SEIU Local 998. "Either we'll mediate it or we'll go on strike or 
get more involved in local politics than we have been and elect some 
supervisors that take our considerations seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has also gone through difficult negotiations with firefighters and 
with nurses at Ventura County Medical Center this year. The county imposed a 
pay-and-benefits package on the nurses in April, but later returned to talks 
with the California Nurses Assn. and reached an agreement last month. The 
380-member Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn. has been without a 
contract since July. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Personnel Director Ed McLean, the county's primary labor negotiator, 
was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammitt said the workers feel they are not appreciated by county leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the position getting articulated to us (by county workers) is that 
prior to this time, there had been an acceptance that the county was trying to 
do what was right," Hammitt said. "The attitude of the county employees is 
starting to drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives will meet Tuesday to discuss possible alternatives, 
Hammitt said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

THANKING TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was touched by Barry Smolin's recent commentary ("Society Demeans 
Teachers").I have taught Junior Achievement at public schools in Irvine for the 
past three years and I can attest that teaching is demanding work and deserving 
of everyone's respect. I suggest that anyone with school-age children should 
send a thank you note to school. Your kid may just get a job someday because of 
something that his or her teacher said in class.

JOHNSON NOT EXPECTED TO START FOR USC; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK'S SPRAINED 
ANKLE HASN'T HEALED, WHICH COMES AS A SURPRISE TO BACKUP OTTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rob Johnson probably will miss his first quarterback start for USC in 29 games 
today when the Trojans play Oregon State, Coach John Robinson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 20-minute practice at the University of Oregon in Eugene, 45 miles 
from here, Robinson said he didn't believe the right ankle Johnson sprained in 
last Saturday's 22-7 loss to Oregon had healed sufficiently for Johnson to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there's a real change overnight, we'll probably start Brad (Otton), 
Robinson said. "That's my intention right now. Rob wants to go, but I don't 
think he's ready.' 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, a 6-foot-6 sophomore transfer from Weber State who finished up for 
Johnson last Saturday, seemed surprised.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought all week he'd be ready, but it's probably more serious than anyone 
thought," Otton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton completed seven of 15 passes for 79 yards last Saturday, and took most 
of the practice snaps this week as Robinson rested Johnson in hopes that the 
sprain, high on the outside of the ankle, would heal.  
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson seemed to favor the heavily taped ankle as he threw Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little sore this morning, from yesterday's practice," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is when I plant, and when I go side-to-side -- that's the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 The ankle is Johnson's second injury this season. He played despite a sore 
lower back for two games after the Washington game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was held out of two practices then, and said at the time it was the first 
practice he ever had missed, not only at USC but in four varsity sports at El 
Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson became the first post-World War II true freshman to start at 
quarterback for USC in 1991 and has started the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton might get plenty of opportunity to show his passing wares in today's 
matchup at Parker Stadium, which brings together the best and worst rushing 
teams in the Pacific 10.  
</P>
<P>
 In almost any other season, there would be no need to ask which is which.  
</P>
<P>
 But in 1994, Oregon State really is the conference rushing leader, at 272 
yards per game . . . and USC is 10th and last, at 119 yards a game.  
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible? 
</P>
<P>
 As Eugene Register-Guard writer Bob Rodman put it:  
</P>
<P>
 "Three things you thought you'd never see: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Madonna as a nun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Eugene as a manufacturing site for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "USC as the worst rushing team in the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State uses the triple-option offense, which contorts its offensive 
stats as much as it does opponents' defenses. USC's passing yardage is almost 
five times Oregon State's.  
</P>
<P>
 As USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey put it, "The problem with the 
wishbone is, even after the ball is snapped, you still don't know where the 
ball is going." 
</P>
<P>
 In modern college football, wishbone week is a defensive coordinator's longest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just 15 years ago, you'd see a wishbone team two, three times a year," 
Lindsey said. "Now, you see one maybe once a season. And the problem is, it's 
very hard to simulate in practice. You just can't show it to your defense as 
well as they need to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey has reason for concern. His defense also ranks last in the Pac-10, 
giving up 434.5 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers are led by three runners who have accumulated 752 yards in four 
games: quarterback Don Shanklin, averaging 7.4 yards per carry; J.J. Young at 
5.6, and J.D. Stewart at 4.7. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arizona last Saturday, Oregon State rushed for 185 yards, the most given up 
by the Wildcats since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a 5-10, 192-pound senior from South Pasadena, is the most dangerous of 
Coach Jerry Pettibone's backs. He is fast, has had five touchdown runs of more 
than 40 yards in his college career, and had a 68-yard scoring run in Oregon 
State's opener at Arizona State.  
</P>
<P>
 For all of that, however, the Beavers have a 1-3 record, having beaten only 
Wyoming. They have lost to Arizona State, Fresno State and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, as it was a year ago, is in a win-every-other-game mode. The Trojans beat 
Washington in the opener, lost at Penn State, beat Baylor and then lost a 
stunner to Oregon last week, 22-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishbone preparation and Johnson's status have been the twin concerns of USC's 
practices all week.  
</P>
<P>
 A year ago in the Coliseum, USC stopped the Beavers' wishbone with little 
trouble. In a 34-9 victory, the Trojans gave up 223 yards rushing, but shut 
down Oregon State's pass offense completely. The Beavers were zero for five 
passing.  
</P>
<P>
 USC today seeks to avoid being the first Trojan team since 1957 to lose to 
both Oregon schools in the same season. Results of recent years indicate they 
will not. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has not only beaten Oregon State 20 consecutive times -- its longest 
Pac-10 winning streak -- but it hasn't scored fewer than 33 points in the last 
11 of those games. In the five between 1985 and 1990, USC didn't score fewer 
than 41 points. USC TROJANS TODAY'S GAME

NHL MIGHT FACE NOV. 1 START; HOCKEY: A STILL-UNFINISHED PROPOSAL BY PLAYERS' 
ASSOCIATION IS DUE MONDAY AND MUST BE ACCEPTED BY OWNERS IF THE SEASON IS TO 
BEGIN OCT. 15. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The start of the NHL season will probably be delayed again, until Nov. 1 or 
later, unless a still-unfinished proposal by the players' association is 
accepted by the league's Board of Governors on Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan isn't submitted Monday -- a spokesman for the NHLPA said Friday 
only that it "probably will be" -- or if a proposal is made and the league 
rejects it, the governors are expected to push the start of the season back 
from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting real tight for Oct. 15," said Jack Ferreira, general 
manager of the Mighty Ducks. "What I want to know is, why is it taking until 
Monday if they want to make a deal? That's the big question." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, has been working on a plan 
since Wednesday, when he rejected two NHL proposals that featured a 3% levy on 
the gate receipts of the top 16 revenue-making clubs and a gradual levy on 
payrolls to generate financial support for small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow, whose negotiating tactics and unwillingness to compromise were 
criticized by several management negotiators, objected to the plans on the 
grounds that they would restrict players' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's last proposal included flat levies of 5.5% on the top 16 clubs' 
gate receipts and payrolls. The NHL has said that wouldn't generate enough 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Other thorny issues, such as arbitration and free agency, must also be 
resolved as part of a new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are complicated matters," Goodenow said in explaining the lapse between 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a full schedule remains possible with a Nov. 1 start. Cliff Fletcher, 
general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, told the Toronto Sun the 168 
postponed games could be added onto the end of the schedule. The playoffs would 
be condensed by playing on some back-to-back days instead of on alternate days 
and would conclude in early July. The seventh game of the Stanley Cup finals 
last season was June 14, latest in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal, if we can reach a suitable agreement, is to play an 84-game 
season," said Joe Cohen, the Kings' majority owner and chairman. "It must be an 
agreement everyone could live with. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Starting Nov. 1) hasn't been discussed with me. I talked to someone in 
Montreal, where they make the schedule, because I wanted to know next season's 
starting date so I could book exhibition games. He told me he'd like to know 
when this season is going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 After being told by Goodenow that he hadn't completed the union's proposal 
Friday, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman updated league governors by conference 
call. He told them to gather Tuesday in New York, where they will "decide on an 
appropriate course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other factors endangering an Oct. 15 start are the need to reassemble 
players and to get them back into playing condition. Players ceased working out 
Sept. 30, after Bettman announced he would not allow the season to start 
without a new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's be realistic. Players have to skate for three or four days before you 
could even consider playing," Cohen said, "and some teams have to travel. We're 
fortunate because the 15th is a home game for us, but the team we're playing is 
from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a possibility, still. How good a possibility? I'll tell you Tuesday."

EX-MCNALL ASSOCIATE IS CHARGED; HOCKEY: CHIEF OF HORSE OPERATIONS IS EXPECTED 
TO PLEAD GUILTY TO WIRE FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 C. David Rossen, the executive who ran Bruce McNall's thoroughbred horse 
operations, will plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in connection with the 
ongoing federal investigation into the King president's banking practices, 
according to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossen, 39, was charged Friday by federal prosecutors of defrauding the French 
bank Credit Lyonnais by creating false documents, inventory lists and invoices 
surrounding $10 million in loans. The scheme, prosecutors allege, was designed 
to lull the bank into believing McNall had sufficient collateral to support 
previous loans and to induce it to grant new loans. In one case, phony 
appraisals were obtained by a sham company whose purported owner and appraiser 
was McNall's personal chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rossen's attorney, Robert L. Corbin: "He is accepting responsibility for 
his actions and he is cooperating with the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossen becomes the third former McNall business associate in the last two 
months to have been formally charged. As many as a dozen are known to be 
negotiating plea agreements, and McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four 
counts stemming from the bank fraud investigation, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one count filed against Rossen is the smallest case filed by prosecutors 
against former McNall executives. Responding to the charge filed against 
Rossen, McNall's criminal defense attorney Tom Pollack said: "I am pleased to 
see the government acting with restraint in their charges against Mr. Rossen." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossen's role in the alleged criminal activity began in December, 1987, and 
continued to about April, 1994. But Corbin, Rossen's attorney, said that while 
Rossen admitted he provided inaccurate information about collateral to McNall's 
banks, he was only a minor player in McNall's empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really wasn't part of the inner circle of people who were actively 
involved with Mr. McNall's financial affairs," Corbin said. "The fact that Mr. 
Rossen's charges are limited to a single count reflects the fact that he was 
the lowest-level employee who has been charged or is under active 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin added that Rossen was led to believe that McNall -- who is now in 
personal bankruptcy proceedings -- could pay his bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. McNall projected great wealth and success to the people with whom he came 
into contact, including Mr. Rossen," Corbin said. "Like many of the people with 
whom Mr. McNall came into contact, Mr. Rossen believed him to be a dynamic 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious to the world now that Mr. McNall was not as wealthy as he 
appeared to be, and he was not on as solid a financial footing as everyone who 
knew him -- including his employees, investors and lenders -- believed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossen is scheduled for a court appearance on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The court papers filed Friday portrayed an operation in which elaborate 
deceptions were used to obtain loans. In 1989, Rossen and others created two 
sham thoroughbred horse companies, one of them being Nassar Equine Appraisal 
and Management Company, federal officials alleged. The purported appraiser and 
owner of the company was McNall's personal chauffeur, who was not qualified to 
make thoroughbred horse appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the company produced sham appraisal reports for Credit Lyonnais' Dutch 
unit that misrepresented the value and percentage of ownership of the horses 
purportedly owned by McNall's Summa Stable, Inc., in order to show the company 
had enough horses to adequately collateralize the $10-million bank loan. But 
the horses listed in the appraisal report were not owned by the stable, had 
been pledged as collateral to other lenders or were inflated in value. 
</P>
<P>
 The other sham company, which also had no legitimate assets and performed no 
legitimate services, was Minerva International Sales Corp. In another alleged 
scheme, Rossen and others informed Credit Lyonnais in February, 1993, that a 
$2-million payment would be made on a $10-million loan by the sale of six 
thoroughbred horses to Minerva. In fact, Minerva was created and owned by 
McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than four months later, Rossen represented to Credit Lyonnais that 
Minerva did not purchase the six horses from Summa. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the government alleged that Rossen and others informed Credit 
Lyonnais that 26 thoroughbred horses pledged as collateral for a $10-million 
loan had declined in value and had been sold for about $220,000 and said those 
funds were used for feeding and care. But the horses were not sold because they 
were not fully owned by Summa, had been pledged as collateral to other lenders 
and were inflated in value.

CHANGING THE CALL; TO THE FRUSTRATION OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS, STANFORD'S LEON 
VICKERS TRADES A POSSIBLE NFL CAREER FOR ROLE WITH A CONTROVERSIAL CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Leon Vickers couldn't have been a better high school football player. As a 
linebacker at Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos in 1992, he was all-league, 
all-county, all-state and All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Vickers took his honors and his rock-solid, six-foot, 210-pound 
frame to Stanford, where he started one game at outside linebacker as a 
freshman; by spring practice, he had moved himself into a full-time starting 
position at safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Cardinal prepared this week for today's game at Arizona State, 
trying to shake itself out of a 1-2-1 start, Vickers was far removed from the 
Palo Alto campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers is back home, working at a factory that makes screws for helicopters 
and airplanes. He is not attending school, instead giving much of his time and 
energy to a Garden Grove church he says will prepare him properly for a life 
beyond this one. But his decision to give up a promising football career, not 
to mention a valuable scholarship to one of the nation's finest universities, 
has baffled family, friends and former coaches, teammates and educators, and 
they wonder if he's being unduly influenced by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers, 19, says it's a decision he made on his own, guided by the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watch Stanford on TV, sometimes I wish that could be me," he said. 
"But I know I'm doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually will, many tell him. Bill Walsh, the Stanford coach who led the 
San Francisco 49ers to three Super Bowl victories in the 1980s, tried during 
the summer to persuade Vickers to return, even asking some of his former 49er 
players to make a pitch. But phone calls, visits and letters from across the 
country seem to have only strengthened Vickers' commitment to the Church of 
Christ, whose followers believe in strict interpretation of the Bible and form 
what they say is part of a growing, nationwide network of autonomous 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at what's going to benefit me spiritually," Vickers said this 
week. "They're (family and friends) looking at what's going to benefit me 
materially." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Byrd, Vickers' best friend at Rancho Alamitos, left a starting running 
back spot at Columbia and transferred to Stanford this year on advice from 
Vickers. Now, Byrd is a third-string back trying to earn what Vickers gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a deal," Byrd said from Palo Alto. "It's definitely a precious thing 
to have a scholarship here. I told him, 'I would die to be in your shoes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers said Byrd, like the rest of his friends and family, doesn't 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thrown away what a lot of kids want," Vickers said. "But I think I'm 
walking into what a lot of kids need and don't realize it. The church is 
looking beyond this life." 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers' exasperated mother, Nancy, isn't looking beyond, however. She still 
has hopes of reaching Leon and getting him back into college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never willing to give up," she said. "I may take a break now and then 
because it's so strenuous. But I'll get him back. I know God will give me my 
son back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said she began to lose her son during his senior year of high 
school, when he began attending classes at the Church of Christ. At the time, 
her husband, James, was in the Persian Gulf War, and Leon was being heavily 
recruited by Stanford and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiters were all over him," she said. "There was a lot of pressure then, 
and that's when he went to his first Bible study." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon attended the class with a school friend and was hooked immediately. "I 
just went," he said, "and the things I heard, there was no denying them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said her son has always been more religious than the rest of the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been seeking the Lord in some way," she said. "He's always gone 
to Bible study." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Vickers said she realized this was more than that when Leon came 
home for the winter holidays during his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Christmas, he told me he wasn't celebrating Christmas or Easter or any 
of the holidays," she said. "It started to hit home then." 
</P>
<P>
 Once her son was away from home and the church, Nancy Vickers says, she 
figured he would be able to concentrate on football and school. But she didn't 
realize the Church of Christ also had a congregation in Vallejo, some 90 
minutes from Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really backfired on me," she said. "Once he got up there, they snatched 
him from me." 
</P>
<P>
 During spring practice, Vickers began asking Walsh if he could leave workouts 
early. The coach allowed Vickers to leave one practice per week 45 minutes 
ahead of schedule but wouldn't agree to three early days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started realizing how much of the Bible I do need," Vickers said. "It takes 
work to go to heaven. The more Scripture I can put into my mind, the more 
filthiness I can get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, Walsh and Vickers negotiated how much practice time Vickers 
would be able to miss this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Walsh was understanding," Nancy Vickers said. "He said he'd give Leon 
two nights a week. The man has bent over backward for Leon." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vickers didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My priorities are learning about God," he said. "It was a shame, because I 
love to play football. In the church, once you add something on, you can't take 
it off. I didn't want to give half of myself to God." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vickers said he was playing better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be starting at strong safety this year," he said. "I had an awesome 
spring. It was going to be good. Just like in high school, it took me a year of 
adjustment. But in spring ball, it just clicked. I was a man out there. I know 
I could have played pro ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Vickers said his mind only occasionally wanders back to the football 
field. He quotes Ecclesiastes 12:13: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'To fear God and keep his commandments. This is the whole duty of man.' 
That's just what we're all about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, say the Church of Christ is all about something else. Priscilla 
Coates, chairwoman of the Los Angeles affiliate of Cult Awareness, which 
describes itself as a national preventive education organization, says the 
Church of Christ is "not a safe group." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any group that teaches a program of manipulation or undue influence and makes 
you believe your past life is all evil is a dangerous group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers, who said he spends about 20 hours a week involved in church-related 
activities with about 35 others, denies it is dangerous or that the Church of 
Christ could be called a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing like that," he said. "We're real big on book, chapter and verse. 
The things we're doing are supported by Scripture. None of our practices are 
bizarre or strange. We sing songs and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers attended one class with Leon and said, "I didn't care for what I 
heard." Since her son became involved, she has researched the Church of 
Christ's practices and hasn't liked what she has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same principles the Nazis used on the people of Germany," she said. 
"What Hitler did with his people, that's what they've done to my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Said James Vickers, who attended the same class: "They talked about the Bible 
and tore every other religion apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Smith, a Church of Christ member who teaches Bible classes to the Garden 
Grove congregation, said she can relate to the Vickerses' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand, but this man did not make this decision coming to one Bible 
class," she said. "We're not averse to education, but he had to make a choice, 
and God is at the top of the list. To me, he's an awfully inspiring kid. 
Believe me, he'd probably still be at Stanford if there wasn't a conflict with 
what he wanted to do with his evenings." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who said she is a former Catholic, dismisses those who label her church 
a cult. She says the Church of Christ is not affiliated with the controversial 
Boston Church of Christ Movement, a sect that uses "disciplining methods" in 
which each baptized member is subject to a "discipliner" who gives advice on 
spiritual problems and daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith says her church has no group leader or headquarters. She said each 
church is autonomous, with congregations across the country. (The Garden Grove 
church also is not connected to the more mainstream Churches of Christ or 
United Church of Christ.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers defines his church as "the only one that teaches baptism for remission 
of sins. That baptism is necessary for salvation. Where the Scripture speaks, 
we speak. Where the Scripture's silent, we're silent." 
</P>
<P>
 But Coates sees a common thread in such movements. "The sad thing is the 
increasing isolation from family and friends and the increasing dependence on 
the group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers said she rarely sees Leon anymore, but at least she does see 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got control, and there's not much we can do," she said. "The only 
good thing is he is in my home. Once he leaves, then I'll really worry." 
</P>
<P>
 And she says her husband already feels as if the oldest of his three children 
is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurt him deeply," she said. "He says, 'I've got two more children to 
deal with, I can't worry about Leon anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James Vickers, retired from the Air Force and working as a security guard, 
still attends every Stanford home game. Nancy hasn't gone to any of them. "My 
stomach can't handle it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has somewhat accepted his son's new life, James said he remains 
"bitter" toward the Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that any church that could come between a kid and his education has to 
be undermining," he said. "But who knows? This may be for him. I don't think 
so. I told him he's making a mistake and that he could have both (college and 
the church), but he doesn't see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he moved his family to Garden Grove from Florida specifically to 
enhance Leon's football and academic careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big shock to the whole family . . . a lot of hopes were on him," he 
said. "We did a lot of sacrificing getting him to Rancho Alamitos. We had heard 
they had a good football program and that it was a good school." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Vickers' sons is David, a Rancho Alamitos freshman who appears to 
be as athletically gifted as his older brother. He has already run for more 
than 500 yards and has returned three interceptions, a punt and a kickoff for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 David chose to wear No. 2 instead of the No. 20 Leon wore for the Vaqueros and 
James also wore during his high school days. 
</P>
<P>
 "David's dealt with this now, but he didn't want to be compared to his 
brother," said Nancy Vickers, whose daughter, Detra, is a Rancho Alamitos 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Case, the Rancho Alamitos head coach who was the Vaqueros' defensive 
coordinator during Leon Vickers' career, said Vickers still comes by the school 
and lifts weights. Case said he is "still in great shape and cut like he always 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 After trying to persuade Vickers several times this summer to return to 
Stanford, Case said he has become too frustrated with the situation and now has 
a hard time talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion was he'd be more useful to the church if he led a productive life 
and graduated from Stanford," Case said. "He had a chance to get out of the 
middle class. Having a bachelor's degree from Stanford would be more valuable 
than your average state school." 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers said he intends to return to college next semester at Golden West 
College. After he earns his associate of arts degree there, Vickers said, he 
will go to Long Beach State and major in liberal arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see it," she said. "When he first joined, they said he'd still 
be able to play pro football. He's supposed to be taking a class now. All that 
college talk is just a ploy to appease the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 And the talk about after college? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get just a job," Leon said. "My goals have changed from wanting to 
make millions to wanting to provide for myself. I'll take any job, as long as 
it doesn't conflict with my Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Miller, Vickers' coach at Rancho Alamitos, believes Vickers is selling 
himself short. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every aspect of his life, he's been an overachiever," said Miller, who has 
also done extensive research on the Church of Christ. "I had him in algebra 
class, and he'd be camped at my door at 7 in the morning asking questions about 
the homework. I told him, 'God gave you a great hand, you have to play the hand 
you're dealt.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him for four hours one day. I just didn't want him to wake up one 
day and say to me, 'Coach, what the hell did I do? Why didn't somebody say 
something?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, as has Vickers, said an NFL career was definitely realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't walk into the Pac-10 (Conference) as a true freshman and start," 
Miller said. "If Bill Walsh says he can play, what scout isn't going to listen 
to him? I'd bet Bill Walsh would still take him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Several attempts were made to reach Walsh, but he did not return phone calls. 
James Vickers said he spoke with Walsh three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walsh told me the door is still open for Leon," James Vickers said. "He said 
Leon is still welcome back if he can get himself together." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd said his teammates still ask about Vickers, but not as much as they used 
to. He said he has moved on with his life, even if his friend won't come with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my backbone," Byrd said. "He was always there for me. He told me I 
could play at this level, and he didn't lie. I tried to be there for him, and 
he wouldn't listen to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know why I'm feeling sorry for him. As long as it's something he 
wants to do, I guess it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Vickers says she still hopes this will all prove to have been a bad 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leon dated this girl through high school who we didn't think was really right 
for him," she said. "One day, he finally woke up and said, 'Wow, what was I 
doing?' I have a funny feeling the same thing will happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leon Vickers says the change is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to explain my beliefs to people, and I know it's not easy," he said. "I 
can understand where they're coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought like that a year ago."CHURCHES OF CHRI

TIME FOR BRUINS TO BEAR DOWN; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ANOTHER LOSS TO CAL WOULD BE 
FIFTH IN A ROW FOR UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Smalley expects a filibuster today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal and Washington, I think they're the teams that talk the most," said 
Smalley, a UCLA inside linebacker who is no stranger to taunting a downed 
running back. "They're always in your ear, a cocky team." 
</P>
<P>
 California has plenty to talk about and reason to be cocky. A victory today 
would give the Bears five in a row over UCLA, something no Pacific 10 team has 
done in 60 years. "I've never beaten Cal, and I'm starting to think about them 
almost as much as SC," said Smalley, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Wayne Cook agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be with my children 10 years from now, watching television 
and they see Cal and say, 'Did you play against them?' " he said. "And I would 
say, 'Yes,' and then they would want to know how I did. I don't want to have to 
say I never beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 That streak doesn't bother UCLA Coach Terry Donahue as much as the one the 
Bruins are on now. They have lost three games in a row, and today's is pivotal 
if a respectable season is to be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Cal uses the streak in recruiting against UCLA. "When we beat them 18 
times in a row, we used that too," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one way to stop it and that's to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal, 2-2 overall and 1-0 in the Pacific 10, and UCLA (2-3, 0-2) are teams 
going in different directions. The Bears played their first two games, losses 
to San Diego State and Hawaii, with many of their starters on the sidelines 
because of various ailments. Victories over Arizona State and San Jose State 
came when some players returned and when some young players picked up the slack 
for the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Six UCLA starters will sit out today because of injuries. Young players are 
going to have to step up for the Bruins to win. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't? 
</P>
<P>
 "You like to think that nobody is going to quit, but this is a big, big game 
for us," Donahue said. "We need some big plays. We need to make something 
happen. We need to win a game, just to win." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA hasn't since the second game of the season, a lackluster 17-10 victory 
over Southern Methodist. Since then there have been losses by 28 points to 
Nebraska, 21 to Washington State and 27 to Washington. But against Washington, 
the Bruins played better than at any time since the season-opening 25-23 
victory over Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt good about our effort and tempo and enthusiasm," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some real positive things Saturday, despite the fact that we 
didn't win the game. We've got to carry over from that, and we've got to fix 
some things like the fourth-down play, like giving up a 79-yard run. Fix things 
like missing field goals." 
</P>
<P>
 All of those things were broken against Washington. UCLA kicker Bjorn Merten 
missed three first-half field-goal attempts, but the Bruins were behind by only 
20-10 before breaking down offensively on a fourth-down play on the Huskies' 
nine-yard line. Napoleon Kaufman had a 79-yard run during a career-best 
227-yard day. 
</P>
<P>
 Those things linger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard when you're down," Smalley said. "You're not thinking about 
the upcoming game. You're thinking about what happened last week instead of 
letting that game get out of the way because there's nothing you can do about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal is having no such trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're feeling a little bit better about ourselves," Bear Coach Keith 
Gilbertson said. "Early, we suffered so many losses with what happened to us 
during the summer, and then the guys we lost during training camp, that we were 
really struggling the first couple of weeks just to put a complete team on the 
field. We've gotten some guys back and gotten in shape and have been fortunate 
enough to win a couple of games, so I think our self-esteem is a little 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's problems had started when linebacker Paul Joyner was seriously injured 
in a car wreck during the summer. Other players fell victim to injuries during 
preseason practice, and the Bears had scored only 38 points in their first 11 
quarters. Then two fourth-quarter touchdown drives beat Arizona State, and a 
55-0 victory over San Jose State a week ago was a real self-esteem booster. 
</P>
<P>
 They are led by quarterback Dave Barr, who has completed 86 of 132 passes for 
981 yards and four touchdowns. His favorite targets are Na'il Benjamin with 20 
catches and Iheanyi Uwaezuoke with 18. Tyrone Edwards has taken over the 
starting tailback job from Reynard Rutherford, but both play extensively. UCLA

MORNING BRIEFING: IT WAS HARDLY THE FEEL-GOOD GAME OF SEASON

<P>
 They're still mourning the Philadelphia Eagles' 40-8 wipeout of their beloved 
San Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park last Sunday. It's not a pretty thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle was in no mood to be consoled by 
defensive end Charles Mann, who told him the 49ers could turn the defeat into a 
positive experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nevius: "Pardon me, Charles. I think you'll find if you will check your 
ticket that you have wandered into the wrong movie. This was not a 
life-affirming experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was disaster. This was standing on the edge of mediocrity and finding 
that someone has buttered the rink. This was ground zero, rock-bottom calamity, 
with no hope on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Of the three stadiums that have played host to a World Series and 
a Super Bowl, which one is not located in California? 
</P>
<P>
 Name game: Oliver McCall? Michael Moorer? 
</P>
<P>
 "The names are hard to remember, both of them," Rock Newman, Riddick Bowe's 
manager, told the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, McCall is the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, 
Moorer the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. champion. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL quiz: If you are in a mood to reminisce about the NFL in its 75th 
anniversary year, here's something for you. There is only one city that has 
been represented in every NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Chicago. The Cardinals played there from 1920-1959 before moving to St. 
Louis, and the Bears moved there after spending the 1920 season as the Decatur 
(Ill.) Staleys. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not suit him: Cleveland Brown quarterback Vinny Testaverde is 
repaying his offensive linemen by giving each a new suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Testaverde isn't sure about what suit center Steve Everett will choose, 
mainly because his normal locker room attire includes combat fatigues or torn 
jeans, a ragged T-shirt or no shirt at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Testaverde: "It might be a waste of $1,000, but at least he can say he 
has one." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, not exactly: In his book, "Seeing Red," about Red Auerbach, Dan 
Shaughnessy related a story about how fellow Boston Globe sportswriter Jackie 
MacMullan met the crusty Boston Celtic executive. 
</P>
<P>
 MacMullan was covering a college basketball game and Auerbach was sitting next 
to her on press row. During a timeout, Auerbach asked her what she thought and 
MacMullan went into great detail about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he said, 'No, what do you think of the cheerleaders? Aren't you the 
cheerleading coach?' "

OATES MADE HIS POINT, BUT READERS ARE READY WITH THEIR REBUTTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was the sports editor on vacation when Bob Oates turned in his Point of View 
column, "Soccer Can't Make it Here," (Oct. 2), or perhaps just in awe, as I am, 
of Oates' arrogance? Or perhaps you just needed some letters to the editor? 
</P>
<P>
 It must be a wonderful thing to be Bob Oates. To delude oneself into believing 
that one's own opinions represent those of everyone around him, this is the 
essence of ignorance being bliss. What a pompous, bombastic fog of rhetoric is 
puffed by Oates' pseudo-intellectual pronouncements on American values and the 
values of a sport that -- I hesitate to make assumptions in the manner that 
Oates does -- he has never played. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hopes, fears, plans, failures and successes of the upcoming Major 
League Soccer deserve to be analyzed, Oates fails to put forth a single 
pertinent point. Oates' argument -- in a broad sense of the word -- is full of 
more holes than the cheese hats worn by Swiss fans.

 After reading Bob Oates' article, I have come to the conclusion that he is a 
wonderful satirical writer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if his comments about the sport and his suggestions to improve it are 
serious (regardless of whether soccer makes it here), I believe there must be a 
couple of billion soccer fans worldwide who would consider him a prime 
candidate for an insane asylum.

 After reading Bob Oates' comments about soccer, I think I understand why golf 
is such a great imported sport: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Lots of scoring, especially my game. 
</P>
<P>
 2. No goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Limited number of hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Golf cart racing, but only on public courses. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Golf cart can carry a six-pack of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there is a downside to golf. It's too traditional. They just don't 
change the rules enough. Can you imagine how the scoring would be if they made 
the ball bigger or the cup smaller? Wow! Or maybe each green could have a moat. 
Or if your caddie was allowed 10 "gotchas."

 This guy Oates might be onto something.

 When I read Bob Oates' hilarious suggestion that soccer muster up the courage 
to abolish the goalkeeper, I fell on the floor laughing at the inane absurdity 
of the suggestion. It then occurred to me that perhaps The Times should muster 
up the courage to abolish Bob Oates.

 In a country where sports fans are spoon-fed instant gratification scoring, 
exaggerated point systems and twilight zone time frames, soccer may well remain 
just a foreign sport. If so, oh well. A sport this popular does not need 
acceptance in the United States to continue to grow, and it certainly does not 
need a prattling bore like Oates to rearrange its rules.

 It's time to allow Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest to solve the

existence just like any other business that can't show a profit.

 With all the talk about greedy players and owners, the reality of today's 
professional sports is being overlooked: The ordinary, everyday working person 
can no longer afford what sports is taking out of his or her pocket.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean only the high costs of parking, tickets, food and drinks, but 
also what sports costs us in our everyday lives. A box of cereal costs more 
than $4, a good portion of which goes to an athlete for his endorsement. The 
same high costs are built into running shoes, clothing, hats, soft drinks and 
practically every other item of our daily existence. The networks pay millions 
of dollars to broadcast sporting events, and recoup the money from sponsors, 
who, in turn, raise their prices to us to recover those costs.

 The players and owners are fighting among themselves over how to divide what 
they are taking out of our pockets. Maybe someone should tell them that the 
pocket is pretty much empty.

 Nice story by Gene Wojciechowski on Steve McNair (Oct. 2), but you just don't 
get it about the Heisman.It was designed for big plays in big games, not for 
big plays in defenseless leagues. It's not about race or about live TV.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; THE BOTTOM LINE STILL IS WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the week, the Raiders have talked about regaining their winning 
attitude. Linebacker Winston Moss said the team needed to play with the same 
physical urgency as last season, and wide receiver Tim Brown talked about being 
more focused mentally as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, the Raiders realize that they need to bounce back Sunday at 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't respond to what some of the players have said. . . . Everyone has an 
opinion," Coach Art Shell said. "It takes different people different ways to 
prepare to play. There are certain things that you have to do in order to be 
ready to play. Whatever that is for that individual, you have to do it. If that 
calls for you to cuss somebody out, you do it. The idea is to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The leading tacklers for the Raiders usually have been linebackers, but safety 
Eddie Anderson is their top tackler this season. In four games, Anderson has 23 
tackles, including 19 solos and two sacks. Second on the team is another 
safety, Derrick Hoskins, who has 15, including 10 solos. . . . The Raiders are 
27th in the NFL in scoring defense (31 points per game). Only Denver is worse 
at 34. New England leads the league in yards per game (419.8), passing yards 
per game (342.2) and first downs per game (24). 
</P>
<P>
 During the bye week break, the players got Shell to change the team's daily 
routine. The Raiders now practice at 1 p.m., an hour earlier, and hold position 
meetings at 3:45, rather than after lunch and before practice. . . . A capacity 
crowd of 60,000 is expected Sunday at Foxboro Stadium. LONNIE WHITE

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; OLDEST PLAYER, 95, REMEMBERS WHEN IT WAS A GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oldest living NFL player is telling another story. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is about driving to Tampa Stadium to be honored before an NFL 
exhibition game. First field he had stepped on in more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed," says Arda Bowser, 95, a linebacker for the Canton Bulldogs, 
one of the charter NFL teams, in 1922. "They put me on the 50-yard line, I put 
my feet on that grass, so soft I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I looked up and it seemed like the stands and the skyboxes went right 
into the clouds. It was all so mammoth. I had no idea. It was quite a shocking 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest living NFL player pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems to me people in this country have become pretty lopsided about sports," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The more Arda Bowser talks, the more it makes one wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Not about what happened in the NFL in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 About what has happened since. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in charge of pro football's 75th anniversary celebration this year 
-- the pro game began in earnest in 1919, two years before the NFL was formed 
-- hope that fellows like Bowser can lend insight into the birth of a sport 
that has since done everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 But the oldest living player makes one wonder, where did it all go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike baseball, which has always seemed to attract large crowds and fanatical 
interest, pro football truly used to be a game. 
</P>
<P>
 A weekend game. 
</P>
<P>
 A nice hobby, as long as it didn't interfere with the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 On halftimes in Arda Bowser's days, he would participate in kicking contests 
against Jim Thorpe. They would stand back to back at midfield, with Bowser 
placekicking in one direction and Thorpe drop-kicking in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, football commissioners use halftimes to make announcements about 
coercing debt-ridden cities like Los Angeles into building new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arda Bowser's day, it was understood that you didn't play during the week 
because you had to spend time with your family. In some places you didn't play 
on Sunday because of church. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a coach like Barry Switzer of the Dallas Cowboys is criticized for 
leaving his team on the eve of a game to watch his son in a college game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at what has happened to football today," Bowser said from his home 
in Winter Park, Fla. "Amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser, at 6-feet-3 and 210 pounds, replaced Thorpe as a fullback and 
linebacker for eventual champion Canton in 1922. His salary was $250 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser moved to the Akron Indians in 1923, played well against Thorpe in a big 
game, and his future looked bright. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next year, when he was transferred to Pittsburgh by the trucking 
company that employed him as a salesman, he had to make a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it was against the law to play football on Sundays in Pennsylvania, 
Bowser asked his boss if he could miss work to play for a local team on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked me straight in the face and said, 'Bowser, did you come down here 
from Cleveland to play football or sell trucks?' " Bowser recalled. "I 
naturally told them I came to work and make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser never played in the NFL again. His only contact with football was 
through local semipro teams, for whom he played under an assumed name. 
</P>
<P>
 A weekend game. A hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised five children, who knew very little about his athletic past. He 
instead steered them toward music, education and the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father never once threw a football with me," said Bob Bowser, a teacher 
from Irvine. "He wanted me to be a pianist." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser never showed his children mementos, because he never saved any. Today 
he has a Canton Bulldog jacket, but only because some memorabilia nut recently 
uncovered it and gave it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody ever asked me about football, I would be civil with them but . . . 
it wasn't a big deal," Bowser said. 
</P>
<P>
 He still relishes the memories of playing a full 60 minutes of every game, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bowser's day, if they left a game because of an injury, they couldn't 
return in that half. 
</P>
<P>
 And he still relishes the memory of trying to stop Thorpe, 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd pull his knees up, try to get you to tackle him high, then push you in 
the face," Bowser said. "You had to get him in the belly. There were times I 
would get him in the belly." 
</P>
<P>
 It was such fun then, Bowser remembers. He occasionally watches games on 
television these days, and notices how few players look as if they are having 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't watch a lot, because every game pretty much looks like the same set 
thing," Bowser said. 
</P>
<P>
 More people attend one NFL game then saw Arda Bowser play during his entire 
career. More money is bet on that game than Arda Bowser made in his entire 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ensuing week, people will analyze that game more than anybody ever 
talked about the Canton Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser isn't so sure this is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is asked what he would tell youngsters who want to be football players 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell them to take up golf," he said. "Golf is something you can do 
forever. Golf is a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest living NFL player is telling another story. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is about walking off the field at Tampa Stadium after being honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people came up to me and wanted me to sign things," he said. "I 
wasn't used to that. I had never really seen that." 
</P>
<P>
 What Arda Bowser is trying to say is that on that day, he signed more 
autographs than in his previous 95 years combined. 
</P>
<P>
 And he still isn't quite sure why. HOT HOMEMADE STATISTICS 
</P>
<P>
 ARIZONA -- The Cardinals have scored all of five touchdowns this season -- or 
as many as Buddy Ryan's old team in Philadelphia scored last week. They die 
this week in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA -- Jeff George threw six touchdown passes in the Falcons' first two 
games but only three in their three games since. We still like the NFC West's 
other first-place quarterback a tad better. 
</P>
<P>
 BUFFALO -- Only two of 66 NFL games this season haven't had a touchdown pass. 
The Bills' Jim Kelly was involved in one of them -- against the New York Jets. 
Kelly has thrown for 200 yards once in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO -- The Bears have trailed in four of five games, yet have won three. 
More proof that Dave Wannstedt is one of the top five coaches around. 
</P>
<P>
 CINCINNATI -- The worst player in the game? Our vote goes to running back 
Harold Green, who will make about $1.35 million this year. He is averaging 2.4 
yards a carry and, at his current pace, will finish with 173 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEVELAND -- In the Browns' 300 minutes of game action, they have trailed for 
only 40:22. Of course, their four victories have been over opponents with a 
combined record of 5-14. 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS -- Could it be that Troy Aikman is getting tired of Michael Irvin's 
constant complaints that he is not seeing enough balls? Irvin caught 139 yards' 
worth of passes in his first game, and only 131 yards' worth in the last three 
games combined. 
</P>
<P>
 DENVER -- Only once in four games has John Elway thrown more touchdown passes 
than interceptions. Perhaps we should stop blaming only Wade Phillips for this 
Rocky Mountain nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT -- Scott Mitchell threw three touchdown passes in the Lions' opener . 
. . and two in their four games since. A free-agent bust. 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN BAY -- Not all of the Packers' problems involve Brett Favre or a running 
back. Only one wide receiver -- Sterling Sharpe -- has caught any of Favre's 
eight touchdown passes. This is in direct contrast to the improving team that 
beat them last week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NEW ENGLAND -- Drew Bledsoe has found three wide receivers for touchdown 
passes. Individually, Michael Timpson, Vincent Brisby and Ray Crittenden don't 
scare anybody. But collectively, they could take the Patriots to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA -- In two of their four games, the Eagles have had leads of 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON -- Home of the garbage receiver of the year, Haywood Jeffires. He has 
made all three of his touchdown receptions in the final six minutes of games in 
which his team trailed by at least 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 INDIANAPOLIS -- Roosevelt Potts, a 258-pound fullback, has caught as many 
touchdown passes as wide receiver Sean Dawkins, the 1993 first-round pick from 
Cal. One each. 
</P>
<P>
 PITTSBURGH -- Bam Morris, the Steelers' backup running back, has scored as 
many touchdowns rushing as the Bills' Thurman Thomas. Two each. 
</P>
<P>
 KANSAS CITY -- In four games, the Chiefs have given up one touchdown rushing, 
on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 RAIDERS -- In games that Jeff Hostetler has failed to pass for 400 yards, they 
are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
 RAMS -- They are one of only two teams that has yet to score at least 20 
points in a game. The other is the Cardinals. But they have an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 MIAMI -- In five games, the Dolphins have had three leading rushers. Two of 
them have been named Bernie Parmalee and Irving Spikes. As soon as Cleveland 
Gary gets in shape, this number will increase to four. 
</P>
<P>
 MINNESOTA -- The Vikings' starting defensive line of John Randle, Roy Barker, 
Henry Thomas and James Harris has combined for 10 sacks, more than the entire 
defensive units of 13 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW ORLEANS -- The Saints have not given up a touchdown rushing in their last 
283 minutes of action . . . or since the 17th minute of the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK GIANTS -- Another reason Dan Reeves is the best active coach: He has 
gone 3-1 with eight players catching passes and eight players running with the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK JETS -- Another reason funny Coach Pete Carroll had better toughen up 
quick: In five games, the Jets have fumbled seven times (losing three) and 
thrown seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 TAMPA BAY -- Craig Erickson continues to start, even though he has completed 
only 17 of his last 41 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO -- Natrone Means has rushed for one touchdown in each of the 
Chargers' four games, but never from more than three yards out. He is averaging 
1.5 yards a touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO -- The 49ers have started at 3-2 or worse in three of Coach 
George Siefert's six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE -- One of only six teams that have led in every game. Others are the 
Chargers, Bills, Browns, Cowboys and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- The Redskins have given up nine touchdowns rushing in four 
games, a pace that would equal the pro record of 36 in one season, by the 
Oakland Raiders in 1961. They have given up touchdowns rushing to Emmitt Smith, 
Chris Warren and Dave Meggett . . . and also to Brad Muster, Craig Heyward and 
Lincoln Coleman. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * REGIS, WE ASSUME, WILL MARCH IN THE HALFTIME SHOW: One of the more amazing 
streaks in the NFL involved the national anthem singer at the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the Super Bowl in Miami after the 1987 season, the pregame 
tradition has featured Billy Joel, followed by Aaron Neville, Whitney Houston, 
Harry Connick Jr. and Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement earlier this week confirmed that in January in Miami, that 
incredible talent streak will be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 No offense, but why on this green earth would the league give the job to 
Kathie Lee Gifford? 
</P>
<P>
 The game is being televised by ABC? Oh, we see. 
</P>
<P>
 * BAY AREA FALLOUT: The impolite yanking of battered Steve Young in the middle 
of a drive in the third quarter of the San Francisco 49ers' 40-8 loss to the 
Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday means two things. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Coach George Seifert, who later apologized for the timing of the move, will 
be fired if he doesn't lead the team to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. hates worse than losing is employees 
who fail to give the perception that they are in control. For much of this 
season, Seifert has flunked on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Young will never gain even one-tenth of the respect accorded Joe Montana. 
And he has finally realized it. That's why he was so angry upon being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 As our Northern California expert, Times columnist Pete King, reminds us, 
almost exactly five years ago, Montana was trailing the Eagles by 11 points in 
the fourth quarter and was in the process of being sacked eight times. But he 
stayed in the game and completed 11 of 12 passes for four touchdowns, leading 
the 49ers to a 38-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach? Seifert, who said, "(Montana's) coolness under pressure was the 
difference in a hell of a game between two fine football teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT WOULD A NOTEBOOK BE WITHOUT BARRY SWITZER? Here's how badly Switzer and 
the Dallas Cowboys were fooled in their recent attempted signing of running 
back Cleveland Gary, who ended up in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cowboys called Gary at his Dallas hotel on the morning he was 
supposed to sign, they discovered he had checked out. Switzer opened his news 
conference that day by saying, "Has anybody seen Cleveland Gary? I'm serious. 
We don't know where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE UNHAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH: There were better places to watch last 
Sunday's game between the Rams and Atlanta Falcons than from Box 138A in 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the seats in the luxury box were occupied by Dave and Judy George, who 
watched their son, Jeff, suffer a concussion while playing quarterback for the 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the box was Jennifer Maddox, who watched her husband, Tommy, throw two 
interceptions after being summoned to quarterback the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting between them was agent Leigh Steinberg, who was watching his clients 
fall apart on the luxury box TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was beaten up and replaced. Dave Brown of the New York Giants was 
throwing interceptions. Warren Moon of the Minnesota Vikings was getting 
whipped by Buddy Ryan's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * NICE GOING, GEORGIA: The son of the oldest living NFL player has given up 
his Ram season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bowser, an Irvine teacher and son of 95-year-old Arda Bowser, no longer 
attends games of a sport that once featured his father and Jim Thorpe on the 
same field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to give up the Ram tickets because I couldn't get anybody to go with 
me," Bowser said. "Even when I gave them away, that person wouldn't show up."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER SAYS HE IS READY TO START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller said his right shoulder is fit and he is ready to 
start Sunday's game at Green Bay, but Coach Chuck Knox refused to rule out 
injured Chris Chandler as a possible starter or backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said that Miller probably will start against the Packers. But he added 
that if Chandler's sprained left ankle showed enough improvement, he could 
start Chandler or make him the backup over Tommy Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say right now that Chris Miller would be the starter," Knox said. 
"'We'll have to see how he (Chandler) is doing and make a decision on whether 
he's ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 How would Miller respond if Knox started Chandler? "That's Chuck's call," 
Miller said. "I've prepared the best I have this week, and we still have some 
preparation left."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's rushing offense ranks 26th in the league. Ram tailback Jerome 
Bettis has out-rushed the Packers, 507 yards to 364. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams are concerned about Packer running backs Edgar Bennett, Reggie 
Cobb and rookie LeShon Johnson for another reason -- their receiving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre's screen passes to his running backs have 
become the team's staple this season and also have taken some of the heat off 
wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Packers are the best screen team I've seen in all my years in the NFL," 
Ram assistant head coach Joe Vitt said. "They do a great job with their backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett leads all NFL running backs in receptions with 33 for 220 yards. Cobb 
has 14 catches for 134 yards, and Johnson has eight catches for 150 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strong safety Marquez Pope wasn't aware that the Rams' public-relations staff 
has nicknamed him "the Pounding Pontiff" in press releases. Pope, never shy 
about a big hit or speaking his mind, came up with his own nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the Cleanup Man," he said. "I come in and clean it up out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have lost their last three games at Lambeau Field, last winning, 
34-7, in the 1988 season opener. The Packers have outscored them, 64-19, in 
their last two regular-season meetings. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; COWBOYS' SMITH FIT FOR CARDINALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith's hamstring has healed enough that he will start at running back 
for the Dallas Cowboys against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-time NFL rushing champion suffered the injury during the first half 
of the Cowboys' 34-7 victory over Washington last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Switzer said that Smith will start against the Cardinals, and that 
pleased Arizona linebacker Seth Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to play, and I want him to play and be at full strength, because 
when we win the game it's going to be like, 'Oh, you guys won, but Emmitt was 
at half speed,' " Joyner said. "I don't want to hear any of that. I want him to 
be hitting on all cylinders." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had said earlier in the week that's what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to run at full speed or I'm not going to give it a try," he 
said. "I have to have my wheels in good shape for me to play."

THIS DON WAS ABSOLUTELY DANDY 38 YEARS AGO; BASEBALL: LARSEN RECALLS 1956 AND 
THE ONLY PERFECT GAME IN WORLD SERIES HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HOWIE STALWICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is retired now, living the good life in his beautiful lakefront home with 
wife Corrine and memories that will last forever. Not only for him, but for 
generation after generation of American sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Larsen was a rather ordinary pitcher during his 14 years in the major 
leagues. He lost more games than he won, bounced around from team to team and 
league to league and finally ended his career in the minor leagues in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 But 38 years ago, on Oct. 8, 1956, a glorious fall day in New York, Larsen 
mastered the game like no one before or since. Pitching for the New York 
Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers, in a subway series matching two of the 
storied teams in baseball, Larsen pitched the only perfect game in World Series 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven up, 27 down. No runs, no hits, no walks, no balks, no errors, no 
hit batsmen, no catcher's interference, nothin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wonder why it happened to me," said Larsen, a smile lighting a 
battle-worn face that turned 65 in August. "Or if it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say it was one of the greatest games (ever pitched). Well, I 
wouldn't dispute that, but I would have to see it myself as a player or fan to 
give you an opinion on that, because I never saw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three days earlier, he had taken a seat in the clubhouse after having 
been yanked in the second inning of Game 2, unable to hold on to a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a . . . job," muttered Larsen, still steamed 38 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen's problem in Game 2, and throughout much of his career, was control. In 
Game 5, however, the ball was a magnet in Larsen's hand, and Yogi Berra's 
catcher's mitt was a steel trap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had as good of stuff many times and didn't last the first inning," Larsen 
said. "I just had better control. I'd never had such good control. I threw the 
ball most times pretty close to where Yogi wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen said he had no inkling that history was in the making when he made the 
short walk from the Bronx hotel where he lived to Yankee Stadium the morning of 
the game. In fact, it was only after arriving at the ballpark that Manager 
Casey Stengel told him he was starting. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was warming up -- in front of the dugout, sans mound, as was the 
custom in those days -- Larsen sensed nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know until the battle starts," he said. "You never know. Not till 
it counts." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 10,000 empty seats that Monday afternoon when Larsen took the mound 
opposite Sal (the Barber) Maglie. More than 64,000 spectators and millions of 
television viewers observed a sensational pitching duel in which Maglie pitched 
a five-hitter and lost, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "An error, I could have walked somebody, and any one of those guys could have 
hit a home run and the game would have been tied up," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Larsen needed nothing more than Mickey Mantle's fourth-inning 
homer. Not to mention Mantle's running backhand catch in left-center of a long 
drive by Gil Hodges in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a home run in most other parks," said Larsen, who also 
recalled a near home run by Sandy Amoros that barely sailed foul down the 
right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey wasn't the greatest fielder, but he had the speed to outrun most of 
the balls that hung up in the air," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-4, 225-pound right-hander, Larsen relied on his usual mix of 
fastballs and sliders, with an occasional slow curve. He struck out seven and 
said he never felt nervous -- except in the dugout in the later innings, when 
teammates observed the time-honored tradition of not speaking to a pitcher 
throwing a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen does not recall ever throwing another no-hitter, never mind a perfect 
game, even as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen threw his perfect game -- one of only 12 produced in hundreds of 
thousands of major league games since 1876 -- shortly after adopting the 
no-windup delivery that became his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little confusing for hitters, because they hadn't seen that kind of 
delivery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen generally discusses the perfect game in modest terms -- "Everyone's 
entitled to a good day before they die." But he takes great pride in having 
turned in his superb performance against one of baseball's great teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Hodges, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Don Drysdale, Pee Wee Reese, Don 
Newcombe, Jackie Robinson, Clem Labine, Carl Furillo, Sal Maglie, Junior 
Gilliam. . . . The Dodgers were awesome, even though they hit only .195 as a 
team while losing the '56 Series in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Larsen's Yankees weren't too shabby, either. Mantle, Berra, Whitey 
Ford, Bob Turley, Moose Skowron, Elston Howard, Gil McDougald, Billy Martin, 
Hank Bauer and Enos Slaughter helped lead the Bronx Bombers to their sixth 
World Series championship in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, who won a career-high 11 games -- against five losses -- during the 
1956 regular season, spent three more years in New York before going to the old 
Kansas City Athletics in the infamous Roger Maris trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Infamous? Well, Marvelous Marv Throneberry was one of the other players New 
York gave up to acquire Maris, who was a year away from his record 61-homer 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Larsen was involved in another famous trade, the unprecedented 
18-player deal between New York and Baltimore. That deal was made after Larsen 
had suffered through a 3-21 season in 1954, with the first Oriole team -- the 
transplanted St. Louis Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 His 21 losses that season led the American league -- the only time Larsen ever 
led a professional league in any major category. He was 81-91 lifetime, with a 
3.78 earned-run-average -- including a respectable 4.37 for those horrible '54 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he never achieved stardom, Larsen shrugged and said, "I don't know. 
That'd be tough to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go out and try to do the best you can. Sometimes, the results aren't 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But on one special day, the results were magnificent. Nearly four decades 
later, Larsen still receives autograph requests, almost daily, by mail. A San 
Diego native, he moved to Coeur d'Alene, Ida., a year ago, after retiring from 
a sales job with a paper company near San Jose. He moved into his custom-built 
home on Hayden Lake, about 40 miles east of Spokane, Wash., last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen keeps a low profile these days, save for the occasional card show or 
autograph session. He smiles an easy smile when asked why he holds no 
resentment for being remembered by most people for just one day in a long, 
often successful career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's easy," he says. "They forget all the mistakes I made."

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: TROJANS ARE SITTING TARGETS THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 After USC's disastrous 7-22 drubbing by Oregon, quarterback Rob Johnson was so 
rattled he said he'd been taken out of the game early because "Coach told me he 
didn't want me to be a sitting Duck." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Johnson would have been a sitting Trojan. Or was Coach Robinson 
afraid that Johnson would defect to the Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, the future looks grim for Troy, collectively ranked at No. 7 with 
the rest of the Pac 10. Think of it this way: Oregon previously lost by 20 to 
Hawaii, which lost by 15 to Fresno State, which lost by 21 to Washington State. 
Thus, the Trojans figure to be 71-point underdogs against Washington State 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, meanwhile, was crunched, 10-29, by former Bottom Ten power Michigan 
State. There's a bright spot, though. Because the Badgers are so obviously 
mediocre, their fans won't have to worry about coming out to the Rose Bowl 
again and having Southland tour operators hoodwink them with false promises of 
tickets. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Trespasser of the Week: Utah State Coach Charlie Weatherbie was twice 
penalized for running onto the field to argue with officials in a 6-34 loss to 
BYU. THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles led 5-0 late in its game. Chicago led another opponent, 7-6, 
halfway through the game. Elsewhere, Seattle had a 5-3 lead at one point. This 
wasn't baseball, though. It was NFL football at its low-scoring worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously it's time for the league to make some real changes to pep up the 
offenses. It's only a matter of time before the NFL takes the big step and 
requires defensive linemen to say to themselves, "One alligator, two alligator, 
three alligator," before rushing the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram reliever Tommy Maddox, the one-time child quarterback for Denver, was the 
losing hurler in the 8-5 loss to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ram offense didn't catch fire, 35 cars parked near the Anaheim 
Stadium lot did. They were scorched in a blaze that was caused when some fans 
left a barbecue smoldering after a pregame celebration.

LONG BEACH POLY HOLDS ON, 27-24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the big plays and key turning points, Long Beach Poly High won not 
with a bang, but a whimper Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A wobbly fourth-down pass from Anaheim Esperanza quarterback Chris Stretch 
slipped out of the hands of Ryan Wilkins, leaving Poly with a 27-24 victory at 
Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, who had to chase the Jackrabbits from the game's first play, got 
as far as the Poly 30 in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (3-2), ranked eighth in The Times' poll, had closed from deficits of 
21-7 and 27-16. In the end, though, they were one big play short. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly, ranked No. 4 by The Times, went ahead at the start. Stretch's first pass 
was tipped by Bruce Carter and intercepted by Jerry Sprewell, who returned it 
15 yards for a touchdown. It was one of many big plays by the Jackrabbit 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch, who was averaging more than 200 yards passing per game coming in, was 
11 of 26 for 92 yards. He was also sacked four times, twice by linebacker 
Vanrick Francis. Stretch also fumbled a snap, which was recovered by Sprewell, 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Tyler scored touchdowns of two, six and eight yards for the Jackrabbits. 
The two-yard run came after Tyler returned a kickoff 79 yards to the Aztec four 
in the first quarter. Poly (5-0) led by 21-7 at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs stayed close with opportunities provided by Poly quarterback Robert 
Toler. Kareem Clark scooped up a Toler fumble and went 59 yards for a touchdown 
in the first quarter. Anton Hector intercepted a Toler pass and returned it 58 
yards in the third quarter to set up a one-yard touchdown run by Darhin 
Footman. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman led a fourth-quarter drive that ended in a four-yard touchdown run by 
Stretch. Stretch ran for the two-point conversion to make the score 27-24.

TRACY STARTS QUICKLY; LAGUNA SECA: HE NEEDS ONLY TO FINISH FIFTH TO CLINCH 
THIRD IN STANDINGS BEHIND PENSKE TEAMMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Paul Tracy can finish fifth or better in Sunday's Bank of America 300 Indy 
car race at Laguna Seca Raceway, he will give Roger Penske's team a 
one-two-three finish in the PPG Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr. and Emerson Fittipaldi, Tracy's Penske teammates, have already 
clinched first and second. Tracy is 12 points ahead of Michael Andretti for 
third place and 10 points for a fifth-place finish would put Andretti out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy took a major step in that direction Friday by posting a track-record lap 
of 113.768 m.p.h. in his Ilmor-powered Penske. This gave the young Canadian 
driver the provisional pole for Sunday's 84-lap race over the 11-turn hillside 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Another qualifying session is scheduled today with the field based on times 
posted either day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to win the race, I want to win every race I drive, but my main 
priority Sunday will be to secure third place in the standings," Tracy said. 
"The way the car ran today, very well balanced, I think I can squeeze more 
speed out of it (today). I only had one clear lap (during qualifying)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy's lap broke the year-old record of 112.296 set in another Penske car by 
Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wins the pole, Tracy will collect a $25,000 bonus from Marlboro for 
winning the most poles. At the moment, he, Unser and Nigel Mansell each have 
three poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Canadian, Jacques Villeneuve, had the second-fastest lap of 112.244, 
barely ahead of Mansell's 112.146 and Robby Gordon's 112.030. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to win the pole as a fitting end to my Indy car career," Mansell 
said. "I won the pole and the race in Australia the first time I drove in an 
Indy car race. It would be nice to win the pole for my last one too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, defending PPG Cup champion, announced last month that he was 
returning to Formula One, of which he won the world championship in 1992, after 
Sunday's season finale. He will drive in the final three Formula One races this 
year in Spain, Japan and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Rahal might have had the day's most exciting lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I went up the backstraight toward the corkscrew, a fox ran straight across 
the track in front of me," Rahal said. "I had to make a quick move to dodge the 
fox or I would have had fox stew in the radiators. I've seen a lot of deer this 
week on golf courses, but I never thought I would need my hunting license this 
weekend on the race track." 
</P>
<P>
 Rahal, perhaps unnerved by the incident, qualified 14th at 110.353 m.p.h.

SPENCER PLAYS AGENT, RE-SIGNS WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elmore Spencer, the Clippers' seven-foot backup center, doesn't believe in 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the agent process is grossly overrated," Spencer said."I just felt I 
didn't need a mouthpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer negotiated his own contract extension, signing a $5-million, 
three-year deal as training camp opened Friday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who was in the final year of his contract after starting 63 of the 
final 68 games last season after center Stanley Roberts suffered a 
season-ending Achilles' tendon injury, averaged a career-high 8.9 points, 5.5 
rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 With Roberts overweight and out of shape at the beginning of camp, Spencer 
could play a key role for the team again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elmore did a very good job for us last year and there's no reason he 
shouldn't be a better player this year with the experience he got last year," 
General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "Seven-footers are hard to find, and with 
Stanley's situation, it's a key that we have Elmore." 
</P>
<P>
 California forward Lamond Murray and Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski, the 
Clippers' first-round draft picks, remain unsigned, although the Clippers say 
they're progressing in negotiations. CHRIS BAKER

THOROUGHBRED RACING; BREEDERS' CUP MIGHT PRICE ITSELF OUT OF BEST FIELDS 
</P>

<P>
 When Hollywood Park ran the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup in July, a Breeders' 
Cup official looked at the five-horse field and said: "What is this, 
Supplementary City?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Slew Of Damascus, the winner of the race, and The Wicked 
North, the 3-5 shot who finished fourth. Neither has been nominated to the 
Breeders' Cup, that $10-million day of races at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5, but 
this year Slew Of Damascus and The Wicked North are only the tip of the 
iceberg.  
</P>
<P>
 In almost every division, the specter of ineligible horses hangs heavy over 
the Breeders' Cup, which after 10 years of dodging most of the bullets will run 
its races this time with some of the best horses left in their barns. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with Holy Bull, the probable horse of the year, and work down from 
there. Unless their owners pay supplementary fees that range from $120,000 to 
$360,000, Best Pal, Paseana, Pistols And Roses, Cherokee Run and Montreal Red 
won't be at Churchill Downs either. Best Pal has earned $5 million, more than 
anyone except Alysheba and John Henry; Paseana is the winner of the 1992 
Breeders' Cup Distaff and a double Eclipse Award winner; Cherokee Run is one of 
the favorites for the Breeders' Cup Sprint; and if Montreal Red wins today's 
Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park, he will become the future-book favorite for 
next year's Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of some of these horses might reach for their checkbooks, but John 
Mabee, who races Best Pal with his wife, Betty, will not be among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cal Cup (a $250,000 race at Santa Anita on Oct. 29) wants Best Pal, and 
that's where we're going to run him," Mabee said. "If the supplementary 
($360,000 to make Best Pal eligible for the $3-million Classic) wasn't that 
excessive, we might have gone for the Breeders' Cup. But that's too much to pay 
for a 6-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mabees have been paying and paying since Best Pal was 2, because the 
resilient gelding wasn't made lifetime eligible for the Breeders' Cup with a 
$500 payment the year he was foaled. In 1990, after buying into the Breeders' 
Cup for $120,000, Best Pal's owners got back $10,000 when their horse ran sixth 
in the Juvenile. Last year, when the Breeders' Cup Classic was run at Santa 
Anita, the Mabees supplemented Best Pal for $360,000. He finished 10th and 
earned nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying these supplementary fees has been ironic, because John Mabee, the 
chairman of Del Mar, was one of the founding directors of the Breeders' Cup and 
helped draft the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stood up for the high supplementary fees in the past," he said Friday, 
"but I think it's time that this be reviewed. Even if they review it, they 
still might not make a change, but at least they should look at it. Maybe they 
ought to consider something like 6% instead of what they have now." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Breeders' Cup's inception, the rules have allowed a horse to be 
supplemented for 12% of the total purse of the race, providing that the horse's 
sire was nominated to the Breeders' Cup program. If neither the horse nor the 
sire has been nominated, the supplementary is 20% of the purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney and Jenny Craig, who have twice paid $200,000 for Paseana to run in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff, resulting in purses of $720,000 for first- and 
second-place finishes, asked Ted Bassett, president of the Breeders' Cup, to 
review the supplementary rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bassett said that the board didn't want to make a change," said Ron McAnally, 
who trains Paseana. "Why should they? They won't change the rule as long as the 
people keep paying the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Best Pal and Paseana, other standouts supplemented into the Breeders' 
Cup have included Bertrando, Bayakoa, Estrapade, Pebbles, Tasso, Vanlandingham 
and Spend A Buck. Wild Again wouldn't have won the first Breeders' Cup Classic, 
at Hollywood Park in 1984, if his owners hadn't paid a supplemental fee of 
$360,000 to see their 31-1 shot run. 
</P>
<P>
 If for no other reason than Holy Bull, the Breeders' Cup directors need to 
overhaul their tough-as-nails supplementary policy. Perhaps a one-time 
supplementary payment ought to count for a horse's lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull wasn't nominated for the Breeders' Cup because his owner-trainer, 
Jimmy Croll, made a mistake. Croll thought that he paid the $500 fee for the 
gray colt, but a year later he opened his desk drawer and saw that he had 
nominated the wrong horse. Now Croll believes that he's holding a pat hand, one 
that doesn't need to be improved by a $360,000 gamble in the Breeders' Cup. He 
says that Holy Bull has done enough to be voted horse of the year, and not many 
in the game see any holes in his logic. In other words, the Breeders' Cup needs 
Holy Bull more than Holy Bull needs the Breeders' Cup. If this isn't enough to 
get the winds of change stirring, nothing will. Horse Racing Notes

 Valid Wager, second to Evansville Slew in the Arlington-Washington Futurity, 
wasn't supplemented, at a cost of $10,000, for Sunday's $200,000 Norfolk Stakes 
at Santa Anita. The 1 1/16-mile Norfolk drew a lackluster field of nine

 Movados, fourth in the wagering, upset favored Jumping Tac Flash in the 
$80,000 California Derby on Friday night, winning his second start and his 
first major stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
 Movados is owned by Legacy Ranch and trained by Brian Koriner, the same team 
that took Daily Triple to victory in the Governor's Cup Derby in September. 
</P>

 Glenn Robinson failed to show Friday as the Milwaukee Bucks opened training 
camp amid concerns the top pick in the NBA draft will sit out the season unless 
he signs the first $100-million contract in professional sports.

 "As you know, he's got enough money through endorsements to last him five 
years if he wants," said Robinson's agent, Charles Tucker. 
</P>

 Mike Dunleavy, the Bucks' coach and vice president of basketball operations, 
remained confident Robinson would join the team but said a holdout of any

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: IN A MARKETING BLITZ TO SIGN UP STUDENTS 
AS CUSTOMERS, CREDIT COMPANIES ARE GIVING NEW MEANING TO ...; GETTING CARDED

 Connie Bedell calls her 22-year-old twins "double trouble" because Michelle 
and Diana share everything -- good and bad. So it wasn't without some 
apprehension that she sent them away to college four years ago with warnings 
about drinking, smoking and going to wild parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraternity boys coming to the door with credit card sign-up sheets didn't 
factor into Bedell's worries. But that proved to be the financial undoing of 
her daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years and $8,000 in debt later, Connie and Michelle Bedell testified at 
recent congressional hearings about the dangers of the increasingly aggressive 
push to get students to take credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 After roughly five years of blanketing college campuses with student credit 
card applications, issuers are under the gun. Legislators and parents are 
charging that their offers of easy credit are deceptive, abusive and leading to 
the financial ruin of thousands of young Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Horror stories abound. 
</P>
<P>
 One Loyola Marymount student charged $25,000 on seven credit cards before he 
turned 19. He's now working 30 hours a week to make the $560 in minimum monthly 
payments. A Texas Tech student who ran up $17,000 in debt by his junior year 
dropped out of college and filed for bankruptcy. A college-age couple from 
Charlotte, N.C., ran up $15,000 in debts before graduation, according to Rep. 
Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), who held legislative hearings on the subject in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy, the push for the student market is actually heating 
up rather than cooling. Credit card companies say they love the student market 
for two reasons: Students pay their bills as responsibly as adults, and, 
equally important, they tend to remain loyal to their first credit card 
company. The issuer who wins their business first may be gaining customers for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result: Credit offers are being sent to younger and younger students. 
Indeed, high-schoolers -- many too young to sign a binding contract -- are 
getting blitzed with offers. And while issuers are aiming the pitch at people 
who have no previous credit experience, they acknowledge that they're not 
taking steps to send educational materials with solicitations. Credit card 
companies publish helpful credit education materials, but they don't 
automatically provide these booklets to young customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they say is: 'It's so easy to use. Just sign your name,' " says Elissa 
Burrall, an 18-year-old UCLA freshman who has received at least three 
pre-approved card applications during the past year. Burrall, a recent La 
Canada High School graduate, says she started getting credit solicitations soon 
after she completed college placement exams during her sophomore year of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the heat has been turned up on the student market," 
says Robert McKinley, president of Ram Research, a Frederick, Md., publisher of 
credit card newsletters. McKinley's high school-age son has also been contacted 
for pre-approved cards, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that while companies are reaching for increasingly 
unsophisticated consumers, the terms of credit card contracts are becoming more 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 More issuers now "tier" rates, offering low rates for good risks and higher 
rates if your payments come late or you go over your limit. There are special 
-- usually higher -- rates for cash advances. And a plethora of fees are 
triggered when borrowers get in trouble. Required minimum payments have also 
fallen -- a selling point. What the issuers don't explain: A 20-year-old who 
makes only the minimum payment could be paying off a $5,000 debt until age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Students aren't stupid, but it takes a doctorate to keep track of all the 
caveats with these new cards, legislators maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "This marketing blitz is having a devastating impact on the lives of many 
students and their families," Kennedy said. "Without adequately knowing the 
risks of credit, students have gotten hooked on plastic and are racking up huge 
debts that will plague them for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents believe their kids should have credit cards while away at 
college. But those of indebted youths often maintain that the 
credit-cards-for-kids campaign is actually a sham. In fact, the companies are 
lending money to students knowing that their parents are likely to pick up the 
tab, Bedell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they market to people who have no income?" she fumes. "They say it is 
because the kids are good risks and they always pay the money back. I say, no, 
they don't pay it back. Mom and Dad pay it back because we know what is going 
to happen with our kids over the next seven years, when they're trying to get a 
job and a house and a car. Because we love our children so much, we don't want 
their credit ruined. So we pay off their cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card issuers acknowledge that some kids have problems. But so do some 
adults. There's no reason to withhold credit from a group that's largely 
responsible because a handful can't pay their bills, says Susan Weeks, a 
spokeswoman for Citibank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 However, issuers admit that nearly all the credit-issuing standards that 
relate to adults are waived when it comes to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, you need to have a steady job, a history of paying your bills or a 
co-signer -- a good credit risk willing to pay your bills if you default -- 
before you're offered credit, industry experts note. But many students are told 
they qualify if they're attending an accredited college and have a minimum 
number of units. They don't need a job. They don't need a trust fund. They 
don't need a co-signer. They don't need to show that they're willing or able to 
pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 No other group is treated as favorably, says Ruth Susswein, executive director 
of Bankcard Holders of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy is pushing for improved credit education and additional disclosure 
when youths are offered cards. Bedell thinks parents should have to co-sign 
before their children, without jobs or assets, are allowed more than a few 
hundred dollars' worth of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, legislation requiring such reform is a long way off and may, in fact, 
never happen. As a result, many experts urge parents to discuss finances with 
their children early. It's almost certain that they'll be offered credit cards 
at school, so the more they know, the better they'll be prepared to handle 
credit card decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It might even be wise to help your kids secure credit cards before they go to 
college, says Robin Leonard, author of "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to 
Cope With Your Debts." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they already have a card -- particularly a lower-rate card -- they won't 
be so easily seduced by the marketing on campus," Leonard says. 
</P>
<P>
 SH Credit Card Tips 
</P>
<P>
 What should students -- or anyone else -- take note of when considering a 
credit card?  
</P>
<P>
 * Risk-tiered rates: Issuers may offer fairly low interest rates -- 16% or 
less -- to good risks but have higher rates for people with poor or nonexistent 
credit histories. A student might start high and be told that he or she can 
graduate to a lower-rate card after establishing a credit history and never 
missing a payment.  
</P>
<P>
 * Use-tiered rates: Typical credit card terms allow for one rate on purchases 
and another on cash advances. Advances often have a higher rate and no grace 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late payments: Generally $10 to $15, plus the possibility of higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minimum payments: Paying off a balance by paying the minimum each month 
could take decades. In some cases, it could take 20 years to pay off a $5,000 
debt.

45.76-point loss. Gainers overall led losers 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was a moderate 284.2 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.74 points to 455.10, and the 
Nasdaq composite index added 5.77 points to 749.96. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline prices also jumped amid fears that another conflict between the 
oil-rich Persian Gulf nations would tighten the world's fuel supplies. But 
curiously, the price of crude oil itself, which initially soared on the 
reports, pulled back in later trading and finished nearly unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market's gain added to the day's muddled course because it followed 
a relatively strong September employment report from the Labor Department, 
analysts said. Investors had aggressively sold stocks earlier in the week on 
grounds that the economy's brisk expansion might prompt the Federal Reserve 
Board to raise interest rates in order to curb higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, transportation stocks -- which are often vulnerable to any hint 
of higher fuel prices -- posted widespread gains, and the Dow Jones 
transportation average gained 6.28 points to 1,444.78. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very odd day," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at 
Salomon Bros. "If you're worried about some problem in the Middle East, you 
would expect stocks to sell off." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Persian Gulf concerns bolstered the U.S. dollar against most major 
currencies as foreign exchange traders sought the greenback's safety, and the 
dollar's strength in turn bolstered stock and bond prices, Shulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar climbed to 100.67 Japanese yen in late New York trading, up from 
99.86 yen on Thursday and its first close above 100 yen since Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, meanwhile, fell to 7.90% 
from 7.96% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks moved higher after the opening bell, following the Labor Department's 
report that the U.S. jobless rate fell to 5.9% last month from 6.1% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, while signaling continued economic strength, did not convince the 
markets that the Fed would immediately hike lending rates -- as it already has 
five times this year -- to fight inflation. The report also says that average 
hourly earnings, a widely watched gauge of inflation, rose a moderate 3 cents 
to $11.16. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the market commonly does, it overreacted" earlier this week when prices 
slumped in anticipation that a rate hike was imminent, said Rich Weiss, chief 
investment officer for Sanwa Bank's trust division in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the (employment) news actually came out, the removal of the uncertainty 
was viewed as a positive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the market was buffeted by the Middle East developments. Iraq 
indirectly confirmed there had been military movements but denied that it 
planned to re-invade Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the U.S. State Department accused Iraq of threatening Kuwait with 
a buildup, and President Clinton dispatched an aircraft carrier to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of developments sent fuel prices higher. The price of 
high-grade light, sweet crude for November delivery at one point jumped 45 
cents a barrel, but it ended the day with only a penny gain, at $18.26 on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline and heating oil prices kept their gains, however. Unleaded gasoline 
for November delivery surged 0.56 cent to 47.52 cents a gallon, and November 
heating oil rose 0.19 cent to 50.43 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil stocks followed suit. Atlantic Richfield jumped 2 5/8 to 100 1/4, Texaco 
rose 1 1/8 to 61 1/8 and Exxon added 1 1/2 to 58 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense stocks rose broadly after the Iraqi news. McDonnell Douglas rose 1 
5/8 to 118 7/8, Lockheed gained 1 3/8 to 69 1/4 and Northrop Grumman rose 5/8 
to 46 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the Dow Jones industrials, IBM rose 2 3/8 to 71 1/8 and AT&T gained 
3/8 to 52, but General Electric fell 1/4 to 46 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * In foreign trading, London's FTSE 100 index rose 14.3 points to 2,998.7, 
while the DAX index in Frankfurt slipped 0.44 point to 1,960.59. Tokyo's Nikkei 
average climbed 89.52 points to 19,744.75. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 
12.88 points to 2,649.79. Iraq Scare Boosts Oil Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices surged to eight-week highs on Friday on news of Iraqi troop 
movements near Kuwait, but by the close of trading crude futures were up just 1 
cent from Thursday. Major oil stocks, however, kept most of their gains for the 
day. 03,10,15,25 Stock 1994 high-low Friday close and change Amoco $61.25-50.83

CALPERS REPORT CARD RAPS SOME KNUCKLES; SHAREHOLDERS: PENSION FUND ISSUES 
GRADES TO TOP CORPORATIONS AFTER ASKING ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR BOARDS 
OF DIRECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Walt Disney, Wal-Mart Stores, MCI Communications -- go stand in the corner! 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Employees Retirement System -- the nation's largest 
public pension fund -- released a report card Friday ranking 200 of America's 
largest corporations on their responses to a survey on one of CalPERS' pet 
issues: "corporate governance," or the power and independence of corporate 
boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by a 28-point policy statement General Motors Corp. adopted last 
spring to boost the clout and involvement of its board, CalPERS mailed a letter 
in May to the chairmen and -women of the 200 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter asked whether their companies had undergone similar soul-searching, 
and the report cards issued Friday outline the survey's results. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst grade -- F -- went to Disney, Wal-Mart, MCI and 38 others that 
failed to respond. Slightly better F+ marks went to 15 companies that CalPERS 
said "at least sent a letter, but (it was) essentially a 'brushoff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, CalPERS was more interested in whether companies were analyzing the 
issues than whether they might have reached sensible conclusions. "The thought 
process is the key," said Richard Koppes, CalPERS general counsel. "We wanted 
to know, are the lights on?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lights were on at 15 companies; they were awarded A+ grades for "excellent 
responses." CalPERS said it granted top marks to firms that submitted 
comprehensive lists of guidelines, similar to GM's, and demonstrated that their 
boards were involved in developing the rules. Bonus points went to responses 
that were signed by the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the A+ winners were AirTouch Communications, Chevron, Exxon, First 
Interstate Bancorp, IBM and Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 31 firms -- including Amgen, Pacific Gas & Electric and Wells Fargo -- 
received A's for providing excellent guidelines, but not necessarily with board 
input. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS said it was pleased that 36% of the companies received either A+ or A 
grades, but added that it was especially impressed that more than 79% responded 
to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might consider it arrogant of CalPERS to hand out Fs to busy captains of 
industry because they didn't drop everything and send a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bit, Koppes said in a telephone interview. "We own almost 1% of every 
one of these companies," he said. "The fact that they didn't even respond says 
something about what they think of their shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 With its $80-billion pension fund, CalPERS is more gorilla than gadfly. It has 
frequently used its financial clout to pressure and embarrass companies into 
being more responsive to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 But some companies found the grading process unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to pick a fight with CalPERS, but we feel a tiny bit 
blindsided," said Kenneth S. Stewart, corporate secretary of SCEcorp, the 
Rosemead-based parent of Southern California Edison, which received an F for 
not replying. 
</P>
<P>
 SCEcorp is working out its own set of corporate governance guidelines, Stewart 
said. But at the time of the survey, "we weren't ready to give them a fully 
articulated response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm speechless that we didn't respond," a spokeswoman for Disney said. She 
said she would try to get a fuller explanation but had not come up with one as 
of late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 AMR, the Dallas-based parent of American Airlines, thought its F+ grade was 
undeserved, spokesman Al Marucci said. "We have an active board that is closely 
involved in all activities of American Airlines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At F-rated Oracle Systems in Redwood Shores, Calif., general counsel Raymond 
L. Ocampo Jr. said the company did not receive the original letter and began 
formulating a response when a follow-up arrived from CalPERS in late August. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, he said, CalPERS has failed to return Oracle's phone calls. 
"We're a little miffed," Ocampo said. Report Card 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Employees Retirement System handed out ratings Friday to 
200 of the nation's largest public companies, based on the firms' 
responsiveness to shareholders and other issues of corporate governance. More 
firms got Fs, for failing to respond or dismissing the inquiry, than A's, for 
developing governance guidelines.

 USAir Securities Fall After Union Talks Fail: The airline's stock and bond 
prices dipped in a sign that investors are growing more skeptical about its 
future after pilots broke off talks aimed at saving the company millions of 
dollars annually. The pilots ended the talks after the carrier said it plans to 
stop flying its biggest airplanes, which means pilots who fly big jets will 
have to take lower-paying assignments on smaller aircraft.USAir is seeking to 
cut its expenses by $1 billion a year. The pilots' share of the cuts amounts to 
$150 million, and the union and the company have disagreed over what the pilots 
should get in return for the concessions. USAir's stock lost 37.5 cents to 
close at $4.375. Its top bond issue fell $4.75 to $77.125 per $100 in face 
amount.

 Higher Farm Subsidies Seen: As crop prices drop in anticipation of a 
record-breaking harvest this fall, the U.S. Agriculture Department is bracing 
to dole out large amounts to farmers to soften the sting of lower prices. 
Government economists said payments to farmers could jump by $2 billion from 
earlier estimates, as prices drift below levels mandated by the farm bill and 
more producers take out government loans to offset low prices.Total farm 
program outlays this fiscal year could hit $12 billion, a senior Agriculture 
Department economist said, up from an earlier projection of $10 billion. Direct 
payments to farmers will probably account for almost $8 billion of the total. 
Payments to corn farmers alone could jump about $550 million, the economist 
estimated.

 Congress OKs Reform of Bankruptcy Law: Congress on Friday passed and sent to 
President Clinton the first major reform of federal bankruptcy laws in 16 
years.The Senate completed action on the bill early Friday after the House of 
Representatives passed it Wednesday. The bill would streamline Bankruptcy Court 
procedures and balance the rights of debtors and creditors, according to its 
chief sponsor, Sen. Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat. "The bankruptcy reform 
act is a good and thoughtful piece of legislation that is designed to ensure 
equity and fairness in our nation's bankruptcy laws," Heflin said in a 
statement. He said it was needed because a 152% increase in filings since 1986 
is clogging the courts.

 Hot Summer Trims Japan's August Surplus: Though the government said the 
country's high-profile current account surplus dropped, economists said the 
shrinkage was within expectations, and they cited an unusually hot summer as 
the primary factor behind it.The August current account surplus narrowed to 
$6.16 billion from $7.31 billion a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said. 
Economists had forecast a surplus of about $6.8 billion. "The summer 
electricity demand was high as it was unusually hot, and this led to an 
increase in crude oil imports, pushing up imports as a whole," said Dai 
Hakozaki, economist at the Sanwa Research Institute. A ministry official also 
said electric companies' demand for crude oil created a surge in imports.

 Alpha Microsystems Posts Quarterly Loss: The Santa Ana information technology 
products and services company reported a loss of $582,000, or 9 cents a share, 
for its latest quarter. That contrasted with a profit of $89,000, or 3 cents a 
share, for the comparable period last year.The company attributed part of the 
loss to costs associated with a new product line. Sales for the company's 
second quarter, which ended Aug. 28, were up 2% to $9.8 million from $9.6 
million. For its first half, the company posted a loss of $731,000, or 11 cents 
a share, contrasted with a profit of $119,000, or 4 cents a share, for the same 
period a year earlier. Six-month sales rose 4%, to $19.8 million from $19.1 
million.

NEW DISNEY COMPANY TO FINANCE FRENCH FILMS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move that could score critical points with the French government, Walt 
Disney Co. said Friday that it is creating a company within its Miramax Films 
unit to promote the distribution of French films in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, which will also increase cartoon production in Paris, is providing 
about $6 million in start-up funds for the company. It will invest $20 to $30 
million more each year in European co-productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney denied that the announcement was linked to recent U.S.-French cultural 
tensions or designed as a public relations move to help its ailing Euro Disney 
theme park outside Paris. Nonetheless, Hollywood executives said the move could 
help blunt French hostility toward Hollywood and curb efforts to limit the 
number of American movies and TV shows available in France. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes less than a year after the U.S. entertainment industry 
was excluded from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Saying that 
American products overwhelm the French market, French officials have called for 
limiting American audiovisual imports. 
</P>
<P>
 The French film industry, which ranks fourth in the world, is declining in 
almost every market abroad, according to a July report by France's National 
Cinematography Center.

 In addition to financing about five movies a year, the new Miramax subsidiary 
-- headed Miramax Vice President Agnes Mentre -- will dub some movies into 
English and release classic French films in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "French cinema has entertained and enlightened filmgoers for 100 years now. 
Our impulse is to broaden that in America," Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company, tentatively called Miramax Zoe, will provide support to 
money-strapped French directors and allow U.S. side to provide advice early in 
the filmmaking process, Miramax co-President Harvey Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Disney financing, Miramax will acquire films at the script stage," he 
said. "In past investments there has never been any input or suggestions on 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediate plans are to release a subtitled version of Patrice Chereau's "La 
Reine Margot" (Queen Margot) starring Isabelle Adjani.

 Disney Wants to Resume Talks to Buy All of NBC: Negotiations between Walt 
Disney Co. and NBC's parent, General Electric Co., stalled after a $5-billion 
offer from Disney was rejected as too low, people close to the talks said, 
according to Bloomberg Business News.Previously, the sticking point was not 
only the price, but also whether Stamford, Conn.-based GE was willing to sell 
all of NBC. "I'll tell you one thing, if (Disney goes) in, it's not going to be 
for a minority stake," a Disney executive said. The price tag for NBC would be 
in the range of $5.5 billion to $6 billion, analysts said.

 IBM, Apple Close to Agreement on Common Hardware Standard: The two computer 
companies could be selling the machines within two years, an industry source 
said.The firms have been trying to work out a standard for computers using the 
PowerPC microprocessor that would allow them to run software for both Apple 
Inc.'s operating system and Microsoft Corp.'s industry-dominating Windows. An 
executive familiar with the talks said on condition of anonymity that IBM and 
Apple "are extremely close to defining a common platform" that would let the 
companies sell such computers in about two years. Developing the standard could 
persuade software developers to write more programs for both the Apple and IBM 
operating systems.

PEOPLE: DAVID J. AUGER RESIGNS AS PUBLISHER OF THE DAILY NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Daily News of Los Angeles said David J. Auger has resigned from his 
position as publisher of the newspaper to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave has done an excellent job at the Daily News, and we are sorry to see him 
go," said Larry T. Beasley, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Beasley, who was hired by the paper in August, said he will assume the duties 
of publisher "at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 Auger, 38, had been publisher of the Woodland Hills-based newspaper since 
August, 1989. He previously served as vice president of marketing for Cooke 
CableVision Inc., a cable TV company then operated by multimillionaire Jack 
Kent Cooke, who also owns the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 Auger also worked for 10 years in the cable division of Warner Communications 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation, which takes effect Oct. 21, follows other recent departures 
from the Daily News. Editor Robert W. Burdick resigned last month to become 
managing editor at the Rocky Mountain News in Denver. In August, James Lacher 
left his position as executive vice president of the Daily News to take another 
job in the Cooke empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke, who owns the Washington Redskins football team, the Chrysler Building 
in New York and other interests, put the Daily News up for sale earlier this 
year. GREG MILLER

U.S. PREPARES TO PAY BILLIONS TO OFFSET FALLING PRICES FOR CROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As crop prices drop in anticipation of a record-breaking harvest this fall, 
the U.S. Agriculture Department is bracing to dole out large amounts to farmers 
to soften the sting of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Government economists said Friday that payments to farmers could jump by $2 
billion from earlier estimates, as prices drift below levels mandated by the 
farm bill and more producers take out government loans to offset low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Total farm program outlays this fiscal year could hit $12 billion, a senior 
Agriculture Department economist said, up from an earlier projection of $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to corn farmers alone could jump about $550 million to more than $3 
billion, the economist estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the projected $12 billion in payments is a far cry from the record level 
of $26 billion distributed by the government in 1986 for commodity programs. "A 
$12-billion level would not be an alarming level," the economist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn and soybean prices have been sinking all summer as near-perfect weather 
has caused production estimates to rise steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean prices hit contract lows this week at the Chicago Board of Trade in 
anticipation of a record crop. At about $5.30 a bushel for November futures, 
they were down almost a whopping 25% from peak levels hit June 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn prices have also taken a tumble as traders have reacted to huge crop 
estimates -- as high as 10.1 billion bushels -- by private forecasters. 
December corn contracts are selling for about $2.15 a bushel, down more than 
20% from the peak in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The government releases new crop production estimates Wednesday, and analysts 
expect even higher corn and soybean crop projections. But how much further the 
higher estimates would drag prices down may be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corn prices are at their low point," a government analyst said. "The market 
has pretty well figured out the size of the crop by now, so I wouldn't 
anticipate too much more downward pressure even if we revise the crop up 
sharply." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "There appears to be come continued weakness on soybeans."

CONGRESS OKS REFORM OF BANKRUPTCY LAW; LEGISLATION: BILL SENT TO PRESIDENT 
MARKS THE FIRST MAJOR REVISION IN 16 YEARS. IT WOULD STREAMLINE COURT 
PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress on Friday passed and sent to President Clinton the first major reform 
of federal bankruptcy laws in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate completed action on the bill early Friday after the House of 
Representatives passed it Wednesday. The bill would streamline Bankruptcy Court 
procedures and balance the rights of debtors and creditors, according to its 
chief sponsor, Sen. Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bankruptcy reform act is a good and thoughtful piece of legislation that 
is designed to ensure equity and fairness in our nation's bankruptcy laws," 
Heflin said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was needed because a 152% increase in filings since 1986 is 
clogging the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would encourage judges to have individuals file for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13, which provides for a court-supervised, timely repayment plan and 
allows debtors to keep their houses and cars, rather than Chapter 7, which 
forces individuals to liquidate their property. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also allow creditors to immediately appeal court orders extending the 
deadline for debtor companies to file reorganization plans under Chapter 11. 
Creditors have complained that many companies abuse the extensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require airlines filing for bankruptcy to honor lease and sales 
contracts while reorganizing. 
</P>
<P>
 It establishes a national bankruptcy commission to make recommendations on 
whether further reforms are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said the bill also sets standards to determine 
whether fees charged by lawyers, accountants and others in bankruptcy cases are 
appropriate and strengthens the government's ability to prosecute bankruptcy 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill has considerably reduced credit risk to lenders and therefore will 
benefit the overall economy by making credit more widely available at a lower 
cost," said Philip Corwin, director of operations and retail banking for the 
American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a perfect bill from a consumer perspective, but there are enough 
things in there for consumers and lenders (that) it won't create a serious 
change," said Gary Klein, a staff attorney at the Boston office of the National 
Consumer Law Center. "It's not going to change the balance of power 
significantly."

MUSICAL CZAR OF ST. PETERSBURG; MUSIC: VALERY GERGIEV IS RETURNING THE RUSSIAN 
CITY TO ITS FORMER ARTISTIC GLORY. HE WILL BRING THE KIROV ORCHESTRA TO COSTA 
MESA ON MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget for a moment that he seems to fit the bill of the dark, brooding 
Russian. Forget for a moment notions about the sound of Russian orchestras 
being somewhat gruff. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember instead that as artistic director of St. Petersburg's "Stars of the 
White Nights Festival"; of the Kirov Opera, which hasn't seen such glory days 
since the czars, and of the Kirov Orchestra, which plays Sunday in Los Angeles 
and Monday in Costa Mesa, Valery Gergiev single-handedly has turned around the 
musical fortunes of his beloved city. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think of him as the white knight of the White Nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I love my city, but also I am trying to do something," the 41-year-old 
said on the phone from San Francisco between rehearsals of Prokofiev's "The 
Fiery Angel." "Not just declare that I love it, but do something to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fiery Angel," a co-production of the San Francisco Opera and Kirov Opera 
soloists, is typical of Gergiev's efforts on behalf of St. Petersburg, not so 
long ago known as Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I conduct the Met or New York Philharmonic or Chicago Symphony, but 
in fact I do it very selectively," he said. "If the Kirov is in Japan, it is 
for major projects, same with Covent Garden. I always want to see a theme for 
my appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of the traditional cliche of things, one Tchaikovsky and one 
Mussorgsky, I try to offer something as interesting and as new as possible. The 
festivals we do are challenging, very, very challenging. But they attract 
attention; the impact is strong and memorable, so people will see the 
appearance as something visible for the Kirov." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Sunday, he will lead the orchestra in a 
suite from Rimsky-Korsakov's "Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh," 
Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 with Viktor Tretyakov as soloist and 
Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite in its 1910 version. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's program, sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society at the 
Performing Arts Center, includes the prelude to Wagner's "Parsifal," 
Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 5 in G with soloist Alexander Toradze and 
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 8 in C Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Prokofiev Fifth, the Shostakovich Eighth -- these are not everyday 
pieces," Gergiev noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Toradze defected in 1983 and lives in South Bend, Ind. With Russia in 
seemingly perpetual crisis, it is interesting that the Kirov musicians under 
Gergiev aren't rushing to join Toradze in what certainly must be an easier 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, many musicians have left Russia; many singers have left," Gergiev said. 
"So far, unlike many other institutions, the Kirov has not lost many artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I try to make our musical life together an exciting and 
interesting situation, not boring and depressive. Second, we manage to attract 
international attention. We participate in so many international festivals; we 
tour, we make many audiovisual projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our life is not so uninteresting; it is not so depressive. We look at 
ourselves as one of the truly interesting orchestras of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which may sound like self-serving hype, but it's true. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in the Mariinsky Theatre, the orchestra was founded in the 18th Century 
under Peter the Great. In its golden age, the theater saw world premieres of 
Borodin's "Prince Igor," Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," Tchaikovsky's "Swan 
Lake," "Nutcracker" and "Sleeping Beauty," even Verdi's La forza del destino. 
Wagner, Berlioz, Mahler and Schoenberg guest-conducted the orchestra, as did 
Hans von Bulow, Willem Mengelberg and Bruno Walter. 
</P>
<P>
 With any number of festivals featuring new opera productions -- the Mussorgsky 
cycle of five operas at the Edinburgh Festival in 1991, for instance -- and 
symphonic concerts focusing on individual Russian composers -- the complete 
Shostakovich symphonies at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam -- the Kirov theater 
is experiencing renewed international acclaim under Gergiev. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it -- he may be one of the truly interesting conductors of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 At 23, he won the Herbert von Karajan Conductors Competition in Berlin. He was 
named artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre in 1988. In 1992, he led the 
Kirov Opera in its U.S. debut and last season made his Metropolitan debut in a 
new production of Verdi's "Otello" with Placido Domingo. In 1993 he founded 
Finland's Mikkeli International Festival, inaugurated an annual Royal 
Philharmonic/Kirov series in London's Royal Albert Hall and was voted conductor 
of the year by the jury of the International Classical Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev took stock of his life and the challenges facing him now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are 25, you are learning. When you are 35, you want something. When 
you are 40, you are not any more a young conductor, and you rethink many 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first period of my music directorship of the Kirov is over. People don't 
(ask) anymore, how do we manage to keep this institution alive. Now we must 
make it stable and serious, with planning and precision, and this is not easy. 
This is a serious, serious thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means restructuring, and also sending a strong impulse to other 
institutions so they can look to the Kirov (as an example). They can't sit and 
wait until this crisis or that crisis is over, because it can be a very long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ensemble and opera house must become stable despite any problems outside 
the theater or in the country, whether there is low support or no support from 
the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev records exclusively for Philips Classics; Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 
2 with the Kirov Orchestra has been released in conjunction with the current 
U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Now about that Russian sound. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It means nothing," he said. "If we play the Shostakovich Eighth and 
Rachmaninoff Second, it is not the same sound we use for the two symphonies. 
Shostakovich is more intense and psychological; Rachmaninoff is melodic, 
luxurious, a very special flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 But he capitulated on the subject. "The low strings do make for interesting 
combinations, (as do) the timpani, bassoon, tuba and bass trombone. When people 
speak of dark, I can't describe in fact what I am doing. I do look at these 
sections with special attention when I work, and this is something interesting. 
But that doesn't mean that I don't work with the violins!" 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is known above all as a champion of Russian music, Gergiev by no 
means feels limited to that repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be my destiny that people think only of Russian operas when they 
think of me. I do (Russian opera) because it's natural for me. But I heard 30 
years ago quite fantastic performances of Wagner and Brahms and Bruckner and 
Berlioz. I belong to a respected tradition of performing these masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Russia, we are nearly born listening to the concerts of these great 
masters -- much more than Tchaikovsky." 
</P>
<P>

CAROLCO PIRATE FILM NAVIGATES FINANCIAL REEFS; MOVIES: IMPRESARIO MARIO KASSAR 
HAS RISEN FROM THE ASHES BEFORE, BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS WONDER IF HIS TROUBLED 
'CUTTHROAT ISLAND' WILL EVER SEE THE BIG SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bringing "Cutthroat Island" to the big screen may be the toughest feat yet 
attempted by impresario Mario Kassar, a cinematic Houdini who has made his 
reputation escaping from tight spots. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, director Renny Harlin and female lead Geena Davis headed 
to Malta for the Oct. 31 shoot on the assumption that the Carolco Pictures' 
chief will, once again, pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco, a high-profile independent production company founded in 1976 by 
Kassar and his former partner, Andy Vajna, is teetering on the brink of 
extinction and is badly in need of a massive cash infusion. Trading has been 
halted since Wednesday after stock plummeted to a 52-week low. 
</P>
<P>
 Having sunk $15 million of its paltry reserves into "Cutthroat" 
pre-production, Carolco is now negotiating with distribution partner MGM to 
sell off Paul Verhoeven's soon-to-shoot "Showgirls." It hopes to raise an 
additional $20 million to keep "Cutthroat" alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of "Cutthroat," which is budgeted at $75 million, is critical to 
Carolco both practically and psychologically. "The company will take a big hit 
if the movie shuts down," notes one industry analyst. "Besides, this is the 
film that tells the Hollywood community Carolco is back." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents filed by Carolco this week with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the necessary production loans for the pirate adventure 
are not expected until late this year. The documents stated that unless Carolco 
can sell the rights to "Showgirls," finalize the foreign pre-sales contracts 
crucial to getting the loans, and obtain a completion bond guaranteeing against 
budget overruns, "Cutthroat Island" has no chance of staying afloat and the 
company itself could go under. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie tells the story of a black-hearted pirate, a dashing gambler and a 
feisty maiden set on the 1650s high seas. Sources close to the film suggest 
that at least the latter two elements characterize the production itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassar, for starters, is an inveterate gambler. In the early days of Carolco, 
he and Vajna sold international rights to films before betting big on "First 
Blood," the first of the successful "Rambo" trilogy that put the company on the 
map. Doling out double-digit salaries to A-list talent, they almost 
single-handedly raised the cost of filmmaking in Hollywood. Still, the payoff 
was there. Carolco's "Terminator 2" took in $490 million worldwide to become 
the highest-grossing movie of 1991. The following year, the company's 
controversial thriller "Basic Instinct" achieved the same distinction, with a 
$353-million worldwide gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive overhead, a penchant for the high life and poor business decisions, 
however, ultimately took a toll. With the exception of the 1993 hit 
"Cliffhanger," the company was in virtual exile for two years until its foreign 
partners -- Japan's Pioneer, France's Canal Plus and Credit Lyonnais and 
Italy's RCS -- kicked in $112.5 million last October. That provided, however, 
only a temporary lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassar first approached Michael Douglas about doing "Cutthroat Island" at the 
1992 Cannes Film Festival, but the actor turned him down. Later, however, tired 
of portraying what he calls "the Prince of Darkness" in such films as "Wall 
Street" and "Falling Down," he decided to sign on. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the "feisty maiden" -- Geena Davis -- who was both the female lead and 
future wife of Renny Harlin. While Douglas was hoping "Cutthroat" would be a 
cross between "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Romancing the Stone," Davis was 
reportedly envisioning a female pirate movie along the lines of "Mistress of 
the Seas" -- in which she was to have starred until Columbia pulled the plug 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Davis' ongoing push for more screen time -- not to mention the 
fact she was married to the director -- created a no-win situation for Douglas, 
who dropped out in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geena is very smart and opinionated -- known for delivering voluminous notes 
on a script," says a producer. "Harlin is stubborn and headstrong. That doesn't 
leave much room for an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Douglas insists. Though Davis (who is said to be getting upward of $5 
million for the role) partly drew on her characterization in "Mistress of the 
Seas," she never tried to make the movie her own, he says. And Harlin, aware of 
the complexities of directing his wife, reassured Douglas he'd make him 
comfortable and secure. 
</P>

 "The balance between the male and female parts never changed," says Douglas. 
"It just took longer to develop my character. I have no problem with strong 
female protagonists . . . they're present in most of my films. The issue was 
that there was only a week or so between wrapping (Barry Levinson's) 
'Disclosure,' in which I appear in every scene, and the start of the 
'Cutthroat' shoot. I did 'War of the Roses' six days after 'Black Rain' and 
really got burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors ranging from Daniel Day-Lewis to Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes turned 
the part down before Matthew Modine ("And the Band Played On") came aboard. 
Though the actor's $1.5-million salary -- considerably less than the $12 
million Douglas was to have commanded -- helped the bottom line, industry 
analysts suggest that casting him makes foreign sales more difficult. 
International distributors who initially picked up the movie on the basis of 
Douglas' name are now being offered an actor who's virtually unknown overseas. 
And no Geena Davis film has taken off abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're banking on the fact that small stars become big stars -- sometimes 
overnight," says one executive, referring to Modine. "Look at Keanu Reeves in 
'Speed.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The big question is whether the loans will come in soon enough -- and be 
sizable enough -- to carry a film this big. Especially since Harlin -- in the 
face of complicated special effects and uncooperative weather -- went $23 
million over budget on "Die Hard 2." A line producer on "Cutthroat" has already 
been fired and sources say that Harlin -- as a producer as well as the director 
-- may be hard to rein in. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly revived MGM is taking a wait-and-see approach, hoping the film will 
be a "tent pole" around which next summer's slate can be built. A source 
insists that the studio put up a percentage of "Cutthroat's" production budget, 
but others close to MGM say its sole commitment is to advertising and prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics -- and there are many -- doubt that "Cutthroat" will be made. No 
completion bond company, they say, will insure against budgetary overage on a 
project tainted with an "air of trouble." And it remains to be seen how long 
the equity partners will hang in.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kassar has held a house of cards together that a gust of wind should have 
blown apart," says entertainment lawyer David Colden. "But, it's been 18 months 
since Carolco's last blockbuster and the company's overhead is sky high. Their 
partners may just say, 'Enough of this bloodletting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kassar's defenders caution not to count the man out. A consummate 
showman with an insatiable appetite for risk as well as excess, Kassar has 
risen from the ashes time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone like Mario takes chances and gets into trouble, the 
Establishment takes pot-shots," Douglas observes. "But independent producers 
are an endangered species. It's not in the interest of the industry to lose 
them."

THEATER REVIEW; THE USUAL, UNUSUAL CIRQUE; STRANGE BEINGS AND A SURREAL 
SETTING, BUT THERE'S LESS DERRING-DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cirque du Soleil is back in town with its new show, "Alegria," under the big 
top at Santa Monica Pier. AT&T is producing, and, since the company makes its 
way rather prominently into the show's introduction, I thought I'd stick it in 
my introduction, as well. The opening-night crowd on Thursday was half 
expecting a raffle for free phones by the time the show finally started. 
</P>
<P>
 The postmodern, Montreal-based circus first stormed L.A. in 1987 with its new 
blend of acrobatics, contortionists, hip percussive music, strange costumes and 
plumes, sophisticated lighting, absence of elephant manure. On its raked, 
double spherical stage (a nod to the circus rings of old, perhaps) and 
generally surreal setting, performers display the distinctive Cirque attitude 
-- they look like aliens who refuse to tell you whether they're benign or 
hostile but who expect to be admired nonetheless. They create another, parallel 
universe that is peopled by, well, weird circus performers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's version contains less derring-do than previous Cirques, although 
there is a tumbling act where men in gold mesh seem to traverse the entire 
stage horizontally, and a trapeze act featuring men in aviator caps who perform 
at the tippy top of the big top (these acts became known among my co-watchers 
as the "golden bounders" and the "prancing eunuchs"). 
</P>
<P>
 If "Alegria" has a theme, it looks to be ethereal children. (The creators, 
director Franco Dragone and artistic director Gilles Ste-Croix, said in the San 
Francisco Chronicle that the show was inspired by the recent upheavals in the 
former Soviet Union and South Africa and is about the inevitable replacement of 
the elders by the young. But you wouldn't know that if I hadn't told you.) 
There are some fascinating acts that might make you wonder about the child 
labor laws in Mongolia and China.  
</P>
<P>
 One act features a tiny, smiling doll who maneuvers her way across a portable 
tightrope that is being held up by a slightly older, totally unsmiling child 
who intently balances a long pole on her shoulder. They look like China's 
version of Louise and Baby June from "Gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny contortionists from Mongolia, Ulziibayar Chimed and Nomin 
Tseveendorj, look like twins but aren't. In another era they would have been 
introduced as "the wonders of the Orient!" and they are quite remarkable, if 
eerily placid, as they wave their limbs around their heads like spider legs. As 
they explore the mysterious shapes that the human body can take, a sad clown on 
stilts wearing a Rembrandt hat and coat looks on, somehow thickening the 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alegria" features the addition of songster Francesca Gagnon, who looks like a 
cross between Madonna and Connie Stevens in sparkly Martian ears. She manages 
to be quite chic in a corset, cage skirt and white hair that looks as if birds 
put it together out of twigs and spaghetti. Even if you understand French, you 
can never make out a word she's singing, except "Alegria," which you hear over 
and over again. Her doppelganger/backup singer Isabelle Corradi is dressed 
similarly but all in black and is never allowed to get too close to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Cirque has never recovered from the loss of the incredible 
clown David Shiner, who went on to appear with Bill Irwin in "Fool Moon." But 
there are a couple of good routines by Russian clown Slava Polunin, who has a 
touching affair with a coat and hat on a coatrack. He also gets blown mightily 
across the stage, a la Buster Keaton in "Steamboat Bill Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other acts -- a Fabio manque aerialist who performs with a huge 
silver cube, a flabby strong man, a flame thrower/eater -- left this viewer 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Racoux, the master of ceremonies, is a hunchbacked, pot-bellied bird 
man who cares for his flock, what I like to call the corps du Soleil, with 
interesting ambivalence. Their weird masks and scraggly hair and their strange 
relation to the performers are mesmerizing in their own, impenetrable way. 
That's the way of the Cirque du Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Alegria," Santa Monica Pier, Tuesday-Thursday, 8 p.m., Friday, 6 and 9:30 
p.m., Saturday, 4:30 and 8:30 p.m., Sunday, 1 and 5 p.m. Indefinitely.

MOVIE REVIEW; PLENTY OF EXPLOSIONS, BUT FEW FIREWORKS IN 'THE SPECIALIST'; 
PETER RAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Specialist" could have used one. Slovenly, incoherent, hootable, this 
Sylvester Stallone action thriller is definitely a no yo. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone plays explosives expert Ray Quick, a former CIA operative who is 
enticed out of his shadowy confines by May Munro (Sharon Stone), a woman he has 
met only by telephone. As a young girl in Miami, May witnessed the murder of 
her parents at the hands of the criminal Leon family. Now she seeks pay-back. 
Insinuating herself into the Leon compound, and into the bed of the family's 
half-crazed heir apparent Tomas (Eric Roberts), May works with Ray to blow the 
perpetrators sky high. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were all there was to "The Specialist," which was directed by Luis 
Llosa and scripted by Alexandra Seros, it would be sub-routine -- at best. Its 
only redemption is the world-class scenery chewing of James Woods as Ned Trent, 
Ray's ex-CIA bomb buddy and now his mortal enemy, and Rod Steiger, playing the 
Leon of all Leons. These actors know instinctively how to play up cornball 
villainy. They put on a hell of a show -- it's the only way they can keep their 
self-respect amid all the explosions. (Everything else but the bombs in this 
movie fails to detonate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone is also trying to "deepen" his role. He attempts this by looking 
sodden and slugged for most of the film. Ray Quick seems eerily out of it for 
someone who is supposedly a micro-electronic explosives specialist. Is it 
possible all those booms have knocked out his hearing? If so, he's lucky -- he 
doesn't have to hear all the bad dialogue. (During foreplay -- this is after 
they finally meet face to face -- May tells Ray, "I always know you focus your 
detonator.") 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone in his recent films seems to have regressed to the Paleolithic Era -- 
but he's a sensitive caveman. He's also buffed, and, in case we didn't notice, 
he displays his pecs at every opportunity. In his love scenes with Stone, the 
emphasis is all on him: It's like watching a Soloflex commercial with little 
bits of Stone -- or, more likely, her body double -- peeking through the 
musculature. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone once again misjudges her talents. Cast as a predator in "Basic 
Instinct," she was deliciously tart. But as "Sliver" so amply demonstrated, 
Stone loses her edge when cast as a victim, and essentially that's what she's 
playing here too. She's not even allowed a chance to explore May's 
victimization. What does May think about sleeping with the man who murdered her 
parents? Apparently, it's not so hot but, hey, sometimes you gotta do these 
things, no? 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Stallone's lunkiness and Stone's glaceed blankness, Woods seems 
to be having a high old time acting vehement. Nobody can do ferrety sleazoids 
better than Woods. He's perfectly cast as a demolition expert because, in 
general, he always acts like there's a bomb about to go off underneath him. 
He's turned the hotfoot into an acting style, and his line deliveries are as 
charged as a string of firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Steiger, he appears to be delighting himself with his ornate Cuban 
accent. His crime lord is a courtly asp who can turn murderous in a blink. By 
contrast, Eric Roberts seems to be taking the whole thing much too seriously. 
He's made the mistake of trying to preserve his actor's integrity by reaching 
for depth. In "The Specialist," that's tantamount to high-platform diving into 
an empty pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, that describes the entire movie. 
</P>
<P>

guidelines: It includes lots of explosions and dismemberments and some frontal 
nudity. 'The Specialist'

THEATER REVIEW; 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY' ENCORE IS A CRITICAL SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some critics make words sing. Gerard Alessandrini, who has an enviable ear for 
the foibles of Broadway, sings his zingers, or rather his four-person cast does 
in "Forbidden Broadway '94," now in a marvelously funny production at The 
Theatre in Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forbidden Broadway" began in New York in 1982 when Alessandrini wrote, 
directed and starred in a small-cast revue poking fun at shows and stars by 
setting new, wickedly on-target lyrics to familiar melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 As he continued to update his spoofs, the show took on a life of its own. 
"Forbidden Broadway '94," completing a national tour, features such fresh 
targets as "The Who's Tommy," "Sunset Boulevard" and "Beauty and the Beast," as 
well as such old standbys as Carol Channing in the inevitable "Hello, Dolly!" 
revival, singing "Dolly Is a Girl's Best Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fast and funny evening. And it can make you regard Broadway as an 
emperor without clothes. Maybe all you do need to pull off another "Joseph and 
the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" revival is a modestly talented hunk, as in 
"Any Hunk Will Do" (Alessandrini's spin on "Any Dream Will Do"). 
</P>
<P>
 Cheers for sticking up for the Broadway stars who never get to reprise their 
roles in the movies, as in "Don't Cry for Me, Barbra Streisand." And thanks for 
pointing out in "I Know I've Seen This Show Before" (a jab at the "Guys and 
Dolls" revival, among others) that there should be more to Broadway's musical 
future than yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is smoothly and slickly produced, with a versatile, funny cast of 
gifted singers. Their range astonishes. David Benoit sends up hulking producer 
Cameron Mackintosh hawking "My Souvenir Things," a light-footed Michael 
Crawford in "Put on Your Phony Voice" (you will never hear the Phantom the same 
way afterward, I promise), an intense Mandy Patinkin in a wicked "Somewhat 
Overindulgent" and a smug Stephen Sondheim in "Into the Words." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Pedi, with her big eyes and large, expressive mouth, also does 
everything well, from "Evita" to Chita Rivera to Ethel Merman. Ultimately, 
though, it's her Liza One-Note parody of Minnelli that is devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Susanne Blakeslee does a perfect Channing ("Once Is swell, Carol/Twice Is 
hell, Carol"), Julie Andrews ("I Couldn't Hit the Note"), an aging Annie ('I'm 
Thirty Years Old, Tomorrow") and Streisand (in "Back to Broadway," but isn't it 
time to parody Streisand's recent tour?). Brian Noonan, a veteran of "Cats," 
not only parodies "Cats" but offers up a bare-midriffed Joseph, a less than 
sober Robert Goulet and a high-on-platform-heels Tommy Tune. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musical director and on-stage pianist Brad Ellis keeps the show moving 
flawlessly. Bradley Kaye's set -- a simple, glittery background with just the 
right touches of whimsy -- works well. Teresa Vuoso's wigs meld magnificently 
with Alvin Colt and Erika Dyson's costumes to create just the right 
impersonation effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Alessandrini and company's sting is softened somewhat by their obvious love of 
musicals and their longing for how Broadway should and could be. Some may feel 
that they deflect the blows unnecessarily, but it keeps the evening light. And, 
if you respect Alessandrini for nothing else, you have to give him credit for 
having the guts to rhyme Louganis and heinous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, like the producers he mocks, Alessandrini is making a fortune off 
Broadway's sacred cows. But, hey, what are sacred cows for if not for milking? 
Drink up and enjoy.

CAPISTRANO ARTS SERIES NEEDS FUNDS; FINANCES: THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE REGIONAL 
LIBRARY'S MULTICULTURAL PROGRAM SAYS IT'S $20,000 SHORT FOR NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When withdrawal of county funding threatened to end the San Juan Capistrano 
Regional Library's Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts Series in 
midseason, supporters rallied enough cash donations to save the popular 
program. Now the season is ending, and library administrator Jose Aponte says 
that if the series is to continue next year "once again we are faced with 
having to raise $20,000 to $25,000 to replace what we lost when county library 
budgets were cut." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, a direct-mail campaign has netted $6,215. "Most of that is in $10 and 
$25 contributions," says Aponte, "which tells me the community really wants to 
keep the show going." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the series -- which has included performances by bluesman John 
Hammond and other folk, jazz and classical musicians from around the world -- 
was given $10,000 in matching funds by local philanthropist Frances 
Bass-Dudley. "The outlook for getting her support once again is hopeful," 
Aponte says. "But she is a civic-minded individual who believes that, in order 
to have a sense of value, people have to reciprocate. None of what we already 
have raised will count toward the matching fund if she decides to back us for 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The season ends Oct. 29 with a performance by Bateke Bateke, an African jazz 
band. Tonight, Huayucaltia, an Andean folk and jazz group, will play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next season's tentative lineup includes Tarika Sammy, a musician from 
Madagascar; Cephas and Wiggins, a southeastern U.S. blues duo; Correo Aereo, a 
jazz group from Venezuela and Argentina; Native American singer and flutist 
Robert Tree Cody; Celtic fiddler Kevin Burke, and the Battlefield Band from 
Scotland. The San Francisco Mime Troupe also may perform. Admission to the 
shows, held in the library courtyard, is in the $5 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Aponte hopes to include readings and visual arts displays, which don't usually 
generate significant ticket sales and have to be underwritten by additional 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want the series to continue, but the most important goal is 
education," he says. "By bringing all these artists from various cultures to 
perform and celebrate life, we are helping to mend our lost sense of community. 
That's the most valuable thing that takes place here." 
</P>
<P>
 * Huayucaltia plays Latin jazz and Andean folk music tonight at 7 and 9 at the 
San Juan Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan 
Capistrano. $4. (714) 493-1752.

DANCE REVIEW; A PROMISE THAT WENT UNFULFILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started so well. Brooding in amber light on a dark stage, Emilio 
Hernandez, the tall, dark and virtuosic force of Teatro de Danza Espanola, 
erupted in a fit of elegantly forceful moods, stopping and starting as if 
electrically charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In silence, his feet became a racing heart, then fluttering birds, or a 
sudden, fierce rain falling on a plain made of putty. Heels only, toes only, 
the tip of one toe delicately drumming its own solo -- how could anyone create 
such rapture in heavy boots? 
</P>
<P>
 That was early on in Thursday night's program at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. Soon enough, the question was, how could the Madrid-based company 
-- with such well-trained dancers, two driving guitars (Vicente Cortes and 
Enrique Bermudez) and singers (Tony Maya and Francisco (Morito) Suero) -- 
become, well, not so exciting? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of boredom sneaking into episodes of percussive flamenco feet and 
super-charged postures of desire seems particularly oxymoronic. But not 
impossible, when the narrative of the company's "Romeo and Juliet"-style 
dance-drama, "Luna de Sangre" ("Blood Moon") unfolded slowly, went on forever 
and depended too much on well-lit frozen vignettes, dramatic as they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographer and company founder Luis (Luisillo) Davila rarely departed from 
repeated, familiar steps and symmetrical line patterns to tell his story, 
failing to create the kind of movement language that could elaborate the lead 
characters (Hernandez and Maria Vivo). 
</P>
<P>
 With all the potential of fiery flamenco pairings, Vivo and Hernandez did not 
ignite a spark. Although each has a style that organizes opposing tensions well 
in their own bodies, the thread of tense desire that should connect them was 
missing. Endless passing in the night and introspective soliloquies do not a 
balcony scene make. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding the evening was "Cafe del Puerto" (the Harbor Cafe), consisting of 
the familiar format of seated performers clapping and taking turns in the 
spotlight. In general, Davila has given the most dynamic choreography to the 
men, although the women got a chance to shine briefly in a gestural standoff as 
opposing factions in "Luna."

 Redford Pulls Out of Race: Oscar-winning actor-director Robert Redford has 
dropped out of Castle Rock Entertainment's "An American President" because of 
"creative differences" with director Rob Reiner. The story concerns a widowed 
President who regains his sense of decency and compassion after he falls in 
love. Redford, though, may continue with the project as the film's producer. 
Michael Douglas is now a leading candidate for the role.

 Hasselhoff, P.I.: David Hasselhoff, star of the hit syndicated series 
"Baywatch," is set to star in a new series beginning in September. Hasselhoff's 
launching a spinoff called "Baywatch Nights," in which his lifeguard and single 
dad character, Lt. Mitch Buchannon, moonlights as a private eye. But don't 
expect bikinis and the glossy music interludes that are "Baywatch" trademarks. 
Producers say "Baywatch Nights" will explore "a world rife with glamour and 
money, hot music and steamy sensuality." Most of the action will occur at 
night, since both Buchannon and Hasselhoff will be keeping their day jobs.

 The Band Up and Struck: The 95 musicians of the Minnesota Orchestra in 
Minneapolis went on strike Friday in a contract dispute, canceling performances 
for the coming week. The musicians' contract expired Sept. 30, and efforts to 
write a new multiyear pact failed to produce an agreement after a week of 
negotiations. The cancellation, beginning with a performance that had been 
scheduled Friday night, affected two concerts with singer Tony Bennett and one 
with violinist Kyung Wha Chung. The association said negotiations will 
continue. POP/ROCK

TV PUTS SQUEEZE ON REPORTING OF ITS OWN 'O.J.' WORKSHOP; MEDIA: THE BLACKOUT 
WAS IMPOSED 'TO STIMULATE A FREE EXCHANGE OF OPINIONS ON A CONTROVERSIAL 
SUBJECT,' THE ACADEMY OF TELEVISION ARTS & SCIENCES SAYS.

 Finally, an O.J. Simpson story that television doesn't want you to see. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when networks and local stations are concerned about Judge Lance A. 
Ito's threat to pull the plug on the camera in his courtroom during Simpson's 
double-murder trial, local television officials are imposing a blackout on 
reporting about their own discussion today of how they have covered the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-hour session, titled "A Los Angeles Television News Workshop on O.J. 
. . . The Trial," will feature a panel of about a dozen news directors, 
reporters and producers discussing their coverage with "comprehensive 
introspection, self-analysis and self-criticism," according to a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is being sponsored by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. 
Representatives from all the major local TV news outlets, including two 
Spanish-language stations, are scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the seminar at the academy in North Hollywood is open to members 
of the media, event organizers have instituted a news blackout of the 
discussion. "To stimulate a free exchange of opinions on a controversial 
subject, all participants have agreed to a news blackout of their findings," 
the academy explained in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the restriction, after the media have come under attack for 
excessive coverage of the Simpson case and Ito has expressed anger at continual 
news leaks that could jeopardize Simpson's chances for a fair trial, was not 
lost on industry observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they should invite Judge Ito to see if he can get some tips on handling 
the news media," quipped Joseph Benti, a former news anchor for KCBS-TV Channel 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 Benti, who is retired, continued: "This just points out the hypocrisy of the 
news media. They are supposed to serve the interests of the public, but the 
public is the last to know how the media operates, what the bottom line is. I 
understand how all trade groups have seminars, but in this case, the media is 
loath to let the public in on how it really works." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray Weissman, a spokesman for the TV academy, said: "Yes, we agree there is 
an irony, but this is not a case of the people versus the media, where it is 
necessary to have open coverage. The academy actually would have wanted open 
coverage, but the panelists were brought in by the producers with the 
understanding that this is an off-the-record introspection." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissman said that when media interest in covering the seminar grew, the 
producers went back to the panelists and asked if they would agree to have it 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the panelists felt that it would be too confining," he said. "They wanted 
to let their hair down and just talk. They didn't want to feel they would be 
getting into news bites."

ICE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT TO BE LEFT OUT IN COLD; CLUBS: A PROMOTER IS TRYING TO 
TURN THE FULLERTON SITE INTO A REGULAR VENUE FOR BANDS, WITH STEADY DRAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another attempt is underway to establish the Ice House in Fullerton as a 
regular venue for bands on the local grass-roots scene and the indie-rock 
touring circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Lluy, a 21-year-old anthropology major at Fullerton College, is the 
latest promoter to try to find a steady draw and regular bookings for the 
cavernous old brick building at 112 E. Walnut Ave., which, despite a few 
well-attended shows, has had a fitful and very sporadic history as a rock venue 
over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed a lot," said Lluy (pronounced yoo-ee ) , who calls his 
fledgling promotion company Culture Shock. "We put in a (permanent) stage, so 
the place is organized more like a venue. Before, it was a temporary stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Lluy, who is also a partner in the new Koo's Arts Cafe in Santa Ana, began 
promoting concerts at the Ice House in July, averaging about one a week. He 
also has been overseeing shows brought to the Ice House by other independent 
promoters. Last weekend, a sold-out crowd of 700 people turned up to hear the 
punk band Face to Face. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally built up a reputation after two months," Lluy said. "At first, it 
was really shaky. All the agents are calling us now, and we're getting the 
touring bands that come through here." 
</P>
<P>
 A stepped-up schedule of bookings includes Dirt, with Final Warning and Final 
Conflict, on Monday; Lagwagon, with Strungout, Oct. 16; Big Drill Car, with the 
Goops, Bottom 12 and Lidsville, Oct. 17; Fluf, with Triggerman, the Nuckle 
Brothers and 100 Watt Haloes, Oct. 21; ska bands Hepcat, Jump With Joey, 
Hoodlum Empire, the Tantra Monsters and Pocket Lent, Oct. 28; Into Another and 
Stanford Prison Experiment, Nov. 4; Down by Law, with Gameface and Black Train 
Jack, Nov. 16 and Voodoo Glow Skulls, Dec. 3. Also planned is a Thursday night 
series of Latin rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lluy said plans call for an expansion of the Ice House's parking, which has 
been one of the venue's weak points. His ambition, he said, is to make Culture 
Shock the new, grass-roots alternative to what he labeled the "corporate level" 
approach of Goldenvoice (ironically, Goldenvoice long was synonymous with 
grass-roots, punk and alternative rock promotion in Southern California; the 
surprising commercial triumph of alternative rock, starting in the late 1980s 
with Jane's Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and climaxing with Nirvana, 
now makes it possible for Goldenvoice, which has reaped the rewards of being in 
on the ground floor of the alternative movement, to be perceived as 
"corporate"). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be the main all-ages club in Orange County," predicted Lluy, 
whose avocation as a rock drummer has been put on hold. "We have 40,000 college 
students within a 15-mile radius. There's no reason clubs should go under if 
they're done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Advance tickets for the Ice House shows are available at Bionic Records stores 
in Cypress, Fullerton and Huntington Beach, at Vinyl Solution in Huntington 
Beach, and at Zed Records in Long Beach. Shows start at 8 p.m.; prices range 
from $6 to $9. Taped information: (714) 740-3052. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Another grass-roots promoter is gearing up to compete for the same all-ages, 
punk and alternative rock audience as the Ice House, with a weekly concert 
series at the recently opened Club Remixx in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Kurtain (as in "behind the Orange Curtain"), the Thursday night 
series will debut Oct. 27 at the 500-capacity Remixx at 612 N. Eckhoff St. (the 
club features recorded dance music on other nights). The Kurtain's opening 
night headliner is Battery Acid, an offshoot of Mary's Danish fronted by 
Gretchen Seager. Also on the bill: Primitive Painters, Psychic Rain and Her Own 
Hands, three bands from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great club, what I've been looking for for the longest time," said 
Kevin Knight, whose Orange Curtain Productions is behind the series. Knight, 
who previously promoted at Caffe Nove in Anaheim, points to a bigger stage and 
a built-in sound and lighting system as Remixx's advantages in what could be a 
competition with the Ice House for bookings and concert-goers. The Oct. 27 show 
starts at 8:30 p.m.; tickets are $5. Information: (714) 630-6128.

DANCE REVIEW; DANZA TROUPE'S PROMISE UNFULFILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It all started so well. Brooding in amber light on a dark stage, Emilio 
Hernandez, the tall, dark and virtuosic force of Teatro de Danza Espanola, 
erupted in a fit of elegantly forceful moods, stopping and starting as if 
electrically charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In silence, his feet became a racing heart, then fluttering birds, or a 
sudden, fierce rain falling on a plain made of putty. Heels only, toes only, 
the tip of one toe delicately drumming its own solo -- how could anyone create 
such rapture in heavy boots? 
</P>
<P>
 That was early on in Thursday night's program at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. Soon enough, the question was: How could the Madrid-based company 
-- with such well-trained dancers, two driving guitars (Vicente Cortes and 
Enrique Bermudez) and singers (Tony Maya and Francisco (Morito) Suero) -- 
become, well, not so exciting? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of boredom sneaking into episodes of percussive flamenco feet and 
super-charged postures of desire seems particularly oxymoronic. But not 
impossible, when the narrative of the company's "Romeo and Juliet"-style 
dance-drama, "Luna de Sangre" ("Blood Moon") unfolded slowly, went on forever 
and depended too much on well-lit frozen vignettes, dramatic as they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Choreographer and company founder Luis (Luisillo) Davila rarely departed from 
repeated, familiar steps and symmetrical line patterns to tell his story, 
failing to create the kind of movement language that could elaborate the lead 
characters (Hernandez and Maria Vivo). 
</P>
<P>
 With all the potential of fiery flamenco pairings, Vivo and Hernandez did not 
ignite a spark. Although each has a style that organizes opposing tensions well 
in their own bodies, the thread of tense desire that should connect them was 
missing. Endless passing in the night and introspective soliloquies do not a 
balcony scene make. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding the evening was "Cafe del Puerto" (the Harbor Cafe), consisting of 
the familiar format of seated performers clapping and taking turns in the 
spotlight. In general, Davila has given the most dynamic choreography to the 
men, although the women got a chance to shine briefly in a gestural standoff as 
opposing factions in "Luna."JENNIFER FISHER

JAZZ REVIEW; SLOW TAKEOFF FOR SAX MAN TURRENTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was pretty much business as usual for Stanley Turrentine at the Ambassador 
Auditorium Thursday night. That's not necessarily all bad. The veteran tenor 
saxophonist is a mainstream stylist whose music is energized by crowd-pleasing, 
blues-based improvisations. When he is good, he can be a very exciting 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly half the program had passed before Turrentine finally unveiled the 
platform-stalking, upfront, declamatory musical preaching that is his signature 
stock in trade. Typically, he did so most effectively when he was playing the 
blues, especially during an exhilarating, if too-short, rendering of his 
foot-tapping hit "Sugar." He also generated some lovely, harmonically 
fascinating moments in several ballad improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, by the time Turrentine got his playing fully up to speed, the 
concert was nearly over. Somewhat unstructured from the beginning, it simply 
came to a sudden halt, without encore and without a promised second vocal 
feature from drummer Grady Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the amount of additional talent on the stage -- Sir Roland Hanna on 
piano, James Newton on flute and Ron Carter on bass -- the proceedings might 
have gone better. Hanna produced a lush reading of "Prelude to a Kiss," and 
Tate sang "It Might as Well Be Spring" with a seasoned mellowness that recalled 
the best of Billy Eckstine. But the gifted Carter had little more to do than 
stand in the background, emerging occasionally for brief solos. And Newton's 
riffing, vocalized flute choruses -- appropriate, perhaps, in response to 
Turrentine -- nonetheless failed to display his far-ranging skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, this excellent collection of players, despite their familiarity 
with one another, never quite came together as a group. The well-oiled, 
interlocking ensemble grooving that typified Turrentine's brightest work of the 
'60s and '70s was present only in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 So, call it another day at the office. Workmanlike, for sure. But it could 
have been a real musical holiday. DON HECKMAN

 Rick Du Brow's commentary on Latino roles in television is right on the mark 
("Latino Roles Still 'Mired in Stereotypes,' " Oct. 1). So is Jesse Jackson's 
crusade to get the networks and advertisers to stop pretending that no one else 
exists except whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry has yet to explain why, for all its cultural and 
ethnic diversity, L.A. has some of the most one-sided, boring and ethnically 
embarrassing programming yet. Look at the weekly lineup and you'd swear that 
the only communities around to broadcast to are West L.A., San Marino and, say, 
upper Glendale. In fact, current TV commercials have come a long way and even 
at times seem more realistic than the programming. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the problem here? Are the "old boys" still using outdated methods like 
taboos, marketing research firms and those ratings boxes to set standards in 
filmmaking? Will someone please tell me why Hollywood is still terrified of 
things like love scenes done by people of color? 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in L.A. most of my life, and I figured that by 1994 I could finally 
enjoy films and television that, at the very least, respected people of color. 
Obviously, this hasn't happened very much.

 I have been fascinated by the recent round of kvetching about lack of 
representation of various minorities on television. I am a member of another 
minority that until April, 1977, was all but invisible. I am disabled, and we 
are 43 million strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Whom do we see as role models on TV? Chris Burke was there, until he became an 
adult. Marlee Matlin as a lawyer, with dishy Mark Harmon as her sign-language 
interpreter, was unbelievable, at least to network execs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young person, at least I had Ironside, who would solve crimes from his 
wheelchair using his intelligence -- and running the legs off his assistants. 
But "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman" embraced the American 
mythos that disability was something that needed fixing. 
</P>
<P>
 So where are the disabled people on TV? "M.A.N.T.I.S.," a black genius who 
became a super-hero after a gunshot wound? Except he gets to escape his 
paralysis by donning an "exoskeleton." Almost as good as new.

<P>
 It's not about pity or understanding, it's about rights.

 Happy to be as I am.

COUNTING KPCC'S MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "KPCC-FM Staff Criticizes the Handling of Accounting Error" (Sept. 
29) and the missing $100,000, General Manager Rod Foster's comment that "it's 
not extraordinary at all to have some stuff just not get counted on the 
expenditure side, especially on informal books" is an amazing statement! 
</P>
<P>
 It's extraordinary that KPCC would have such a manager.There is no such thing 
as "informal books." And Foster and Pasadena City College President Jack 
Scott's conclusion that they did not know how the bookkeeping error occurred is 
another out-of-space response. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how many other "informal books" are maintained at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 As the controller of a large Southern California nonprofit corporation, if I 
or my staff "lost" $100,000, believe me, within 24 hours we would know where it 
was and what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the president of Pasadena City College and the manager of KPCC have a 
legal responsibility to account for every cent that they are responsible for, 
and "informal books" are not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent performance of these two is not acceptable either.

<P>
 Has anyone noticed how alike "Tucker" and "Ed Wood" are? Both are stories of 
failure made bearable by the boundless optimism of its lead character.Both are 
loving re-creations of a period in our history when dreams were still possible. 
Both have a meeting with an icon of its protagonist -- Howard Hughes in 
"Tucker" and Orson Welles in "Ed Wood." And both had a transcendent supporting 
performance by Martin Landau as a lost man who at the end of his life found a 
family and someone to believe in him.

BUTLER'S COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when I had lost all hope for the Los Angeles Times, along comes the 
Calendar Q&A with Dan Butler and his wry comments on being a gay man playing a 
straight character on TV ("Butler's Out to Reorient the Take on Gay, Straight 
Roles," Oct. 4). Great! Funny! Finally, a fresh perspective on our culture (or 
lack thereof).

A LIFE WITH AUTISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your review of "The Innocent" ("Autistic Boy's Skill Fingers the 
Killers," Sept. 24): 
</P>
<P>
 I am the aunt of a 7-year-old autistic child, and must strongly object to the 
statement, "Under the protective custody of (Kelsey) Grammer . . . the 
youngster gradually emerges from his private hell."This "youngster," Gregory, 
never intrinsically changes from his level of high-functioning (seemingly 
retarded) autism. 
</P>
<P>
 Autism is a biogenic and neurological syndrome. It is a severely 
incapacitating lifelong developmental disability that occurs in about 15 out of 
10,000 births. 
</P>
<P>
 A program of behavioral modification at an early age has proven to have the 
best results. For more information, please contact: The Autism Research Center, 
4182 Adams Ave., San Diego, Calif. 92116.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TOM JONES AT HOUSE OF BLUES: STILL LEADING WITH THE HIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Tony Bennett's recent pop resurgence proved the enduring attraction of a 
cool hip quality, Tom Jones' nascent revival rests on the eternal appeal of hot 
hips. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was plenty of pelvic action at the House of Blues on Thursday -- in 
the boisterous audience as well as on stage -- when Jones performed to launch 
his new album, "The Lead and How to Swing It."Although it was the sexy 
gyrations that drew the most squeals (and underwear tossed by fans), Jones 
showed that 30 years after he first hit the pop charts, he's got more going for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The album -- with songs crafted by a range of producers, including New Jack 
R&B star Teddy Riley, English modernist Flood and retro-master Jeff Lynne -- is 
too-self-conscious and inconsistent in its effort to make Jones seem current, 
but the show was simply terrific entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, looking truly thrilled to be there and, even after all these years, 
genuinely amused by the underthings, downplayed the Vegas shtick he's 
associated with and stuck to the music and his dynamic stage persona. His 
versatile band and still-strong tenor slid smoothly among new material such as 
his version of Yaz's electro-pop "Move Out" and his own '60s signatures, "It's 
Not Unusual" and "What's New Pussycat?" 
</P>
<P>
 But when he turned up the pelvic action for encores of Lenny Kravitz's "Are 
You Gonna Go My Way" (to be featured in the upcoming Jerky Boys movie) and 
Prince's "Kiss," the number that put Jones back in the Top 40 a few years back, 
it was pure pandemonium. And that was hot and cool. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP BEAT: FIBBERS GIVE THE LIE TO GROUPTHINK; ALL THE WHINING ASIDE, THERE'S A 
RENAISSANCE IN L.A. ROCK CLUBS, AND THIS LOW-FI COUNTRY QUINTET IS LEADING THE 
CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complaining about the L.A. music scene has been a favorite pastime of 
club-going locals for a decade, ever since the punk-rock and new-wave boom 
faded. The entire scene is dead or the clubs are too expensive or the bands all 
suck. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the whining is valid (e.g., the part about overpricing), a 
wealth of bands has emerged recently to spark a renewed vitality in the city's 
rock clubs. Extra Fancy, PopDefect and Glue are some of the key names, but 
leading the charge are the Geraldine Fibbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In its nine-month existence, the quintet, which plays Sunday at Al's Bar, has 
built a substantial underground following. It became the object of a 
major-label bidding war that ended this week when the band decided to sign with 
Virgin Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone always complains there's no good bands in L.A. now," says Carla 
Bozulich, singer and guitarist of the low-fi country band during an interview 
at her Echo Park duplex. "I've been going to clubs for a long time, and there's 
currently a really good scene. But it's hard to appreciate because this is 
L.A., and you can never have too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Bozulich's previous band, the industrial/erotic dance trio Ethyl Meatplow, was 
a master of over-the-top entertainment. Its heavy beat and titillating stage 
antics were a far stretch from the subtle, spare, down-and-out appeal of the 
Fibbers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ethyl Meatplow was an overwhelming sensory attack and also a really good 
release for anger and sexual tension," says Bozulich, 28. "It was like throwing 
a controlled tantrum every night. Ethyl Meatplow was so out there that when I 
got on stage, I would literally shift into another personality, so I never felt 
stage fright or shyness. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it lacked for me the elements of this band. Now it's all a little harder 
and more real. The words and feeling are really important, so it's like I'm 
having an intimate conversation with the audience. It's kind of scary."  
</P>
<P>
 Bozulich, who grew up in San Pedro, started the Fibbers during the last days 
of Ethyl Meatplow at the beginning of this year. The other members are 
guitarist Daniel Keenan, drummer Kevin Fitzgerald, violinist Julie F and 
bassist Bill Tutton.  
</P>
<P>
 Swinging from extreme to extreme is something Bozulich feels has kept her 
alive as an artist and that makes the Fibbers' sound alluring. She's even come 
up with an oxymoronic catch phrase for its sound. "I call it psycho-pacifier 
music. It reflects pain and mental distress, but at the same time it feels 
soothing and good. A complete piece of art or music should have contradiction. 
Taking something very beautiful and something very ugly and having them work 
together. That's what I consider my best stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 Rent Party: The Fibbers' Sunday show at Al's is a benefit for Millie's 
restaurant in Silver Lake. The eatery, which is having problems paying the 
rent, is a popular hangout for arty types and musicians, many of whom are in 
the bands that will play Sunday. The show will run from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. and 
will feature such bands as the Ringling Sisters, Possum Dixon and Tutti Troppo, 
and there will be food from Millie's. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Geraldine Fibbers and company play Sunday at Al's Bar, 305 S. Hewitt 
St., downtown, 3 p.m. $8. (213) 687-3558 .

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; WEEN: MAKING FUN OF ONE AND ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On its records, such as the new "Chocolate and Cheese," the quintessential 
slacker duo Ween strikes a shaky balance between its fertile musical 
imagination and its contempt for the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean and Gene Ween have such facility with the elements of pop and such an 
experimental spirit that they can be alternately buoyant and creepy, charming 
and offensive.It's all superficial and manipulative, but it can be great, 
seductive fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The new CD itself is also adorned with a middle-finger salute, which is pretty 
much the story of Ween on stage. At the Viper Room on Thursday, the two pals 
from Pennsylvania were encouraged to indulge their mocking side by an audience 
that flashed devil-horn hand signs during metal tunes and lifted lighters on 
the ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Ween needs encouragement. Undisciplined and self-absorbed, they made 
fun of hard-rock, light pop, lounge pop, ethnic music and even their own 
performance. Like smart-guy misfits lashing at the world, they delighted in how 
naughty they could be, offering a faux Mexican ballad and a bright little 
jingle with the periodic refrain of "AIDS . . . HIV." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign that they believe in anything but their own cleverness. 
After the buoyancy fades, the taste they leave is unpleasantly bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ween plays tonight at Jabberjaw, 3711 Pico Blvd., 9 p.m. $8. (213) 732-3463, 
and Sunday at McCabe's, 3101 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, 7 p.m. $10. (310)

EXHIBIT ON SILENT FILM'S SHIPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Silent film pioneer Nell Shipman is being remembered at an exhibit at the 
Doctors' House Victorian Museum in Glendale on Sundays through Oct 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The maverick filmmaker starred in, wrote, directed and produced many early 
movies from 1912 to 1924.Her film "Something New" (1920) will be shown 
continuously, and memorabilia including family photos, movie stills, posters 
and other items will be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipman was a strong, self-willed heroine both on and off screen. She was 
noted for her forward-thinking attitude regarding the humane treatment of the 
many animals that appeared in her films. She once lived in the structure that 
houses the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Silent Screen & My Talking Heart," Shipman's autobiography, was published 
recently. The exhibit, sponsored by the Glendale Historical Society, will run 
from 2 to 4 p.m. The Doctors' House Museum is located in Brand Park, 1601 W. 
Mountain St., Glendale.

FAMILY; VIDEOS SHOW INQUISITIVE KIDS HOW SOME THINGS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "How does it work?" is a question that nails every parent at some time or 
other. If it's applied to large, big-wheeled machinery or power tools, some 
recent videos can help fill in any blanks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Railroaders," Big Kids Productions' latest release in its "What Do You Want 
to Be When You Grow Up?" series, is an entertaining, detailed look at trains -- 
how they work and what they do -- for ages 3 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the live-action video, three young children are offered the train ride of 
their dreams. Jacob checks out the steam engine, Armando's choice is a freight 
train where he watches hopper cars load and unload their cargo and Allison is 
given the royal treatment on an Amtrak passenger train. Old-time film footage, 
a little historical perspective and musical renditions of "Casey Jones," "John 
Henry" and other traditional railroad songs round out the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 All the actors speak their lines with an overly upbeat, Barney-like 
cheerfulness, but when Engineer Bill says, "pretty neat, huh?" even adults will 
find it hard not to agree. 30 min. $15.95. (800) 477-7811. 
</P>
<P>
 For train fanatics of any age, look for "Up 3985 Over Cajon," from railroading 
video specialist Pentrex. The lengthy film follows the route of the largest 
operating steam engine in the world with no-nonsense narration, no 
entertainment frills for kids and no music -- just the sight and sound of the 
big train as it winds its way through the Cajon pass from Ontario to Barstow. 
75 min. $29.95. (800) 950-9333. 
</P>
<P>
 In Will Schreiner's "Garbage Day," from ChildVision Educational Films, a 
little boy and his dad go on a trash-collecting odyssey led by Gus, the garbage 
man. It begins at the truck depot in the wee hours of the morning and ends at 
the landfills and recycling centers where an eye-opening number of tons of 
waste are processed and dumped each day. 
</P>
<P>
 An assortment of trucks with manual and automatic machinery handle everything 
from the usual neighborhood leavings to the biggest industrial dumpsters. Cans, 
paper, plastic and glass are sorted at a recycling center; vast mountains of 
garbage are unloaded, flattened and buried in a landfill that later "we'll turn 
into a park." 
</P>
<P>
 The video can satisfy inquiring young minds' desire to know about garbage 
trucks and then parents can use it as a springboard for a discussion on 
environmental responsibility. 30 min. $14.95. (800) 488-1913. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Can Build," from CanToo! Tapes for ages 2 to 8, follows the progress of a 
back-yard playhouse, from design through construction. Mom, dad, big sister and 
little brother shop for materials at the hardware store, then hammer, saw and 
paint, showing children that even they can participate in a complicated task. 
And, parents can see how involving children in a family project can empower 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Live action is combined with nifty computer animation segments showing the 
step-by-step construction. As a how-it's-done and a how-to primer, it's 
terrific. The only drawback: When they see the finished product, young viewers 
may yearn for their own dream playhouse, but not all back yards or budgets are 
big enough, nor are all parents quite so adept and well-supplied with power 
tools to make that dream come true. 25 min. $19.95. (800) 945-1002. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture This: Photographs by children living in a homeless shelter will be on 
exhibit in "My World: A Child's View of Homelessness," at the Los Angeles 
Children's Museum through October. The photos were taken by children ages 4 to 
15 as part of Photo Outreach, a pilot program working with the Trudy and Norman 
Louis Valley Shelter, an L.A. Family Housing Corporation shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum hours are Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 
per person; children under age 2 are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 687-8800. 
</P>
<P>
 Music, Maestro, Please: The fourth season of "Children's Concerts in Historic 
Sites" will be presented by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College, 
beginning Oct. 29 with music by the Diaz Trio, feathered "fast-dancing" by 
Navajo dancer Eric RunningPath, Native American folk tales told by Marjorie 
Moran and a visit to the museum's "Apache Tribes, Past and Present" exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Single tickets are $10 per child, $18 per adult. 
</P>
<P>
 For reservations, discounted ticket packages and series subscription 
information, call: (310) 440-1351.

NEW TV SEASON HAS SURPRISES, TRENDS; PROGRAMMING: THIS YEAR IS PROVING TO BE 
FIERCELY COMPETITIVE. FOX SHOWS WEAKNESS AS DARK-HORSE NBC BUILDS STRENGTH -- 
AND DRAMAS HOLD VIEWERS' INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They've come out swinging this TV season, with the first few weeks marked by 
unusually high-powered competition behind the scenes and on screen. And 
significant viewing patterns are emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: Dramas are on the upswing again -- thus far. There now are strong drama 
series every weekday at 10 p.m.: "Northern Exposure" on Mondays, "NYPD Blue" on 
Tuesdays, "Law & Order" on Wednesdays, "ER" on Thursdays and "Picket Fences" on 
Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 What's eye-opening here is that two of these dramas are picking up steam, 
while the other is a newcomer. The new drama is NBC's "ER," which was a Top 10 
entry in its first two weeks and turned in another strong performance Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law & Order," an underappreciated, superb series, has ranked in the Top 20. 
"Picket Fences," two-time Emmy winner as best drama series, sharply improved 
its once-abysmal ratings as the season got under way, ranking a solid 37th last 
week with a 22% audience share. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramas, in fact, now are solid seven days a week in late prime time. On 
Saturdays, the veteran 10 p.m. entries "Sisters," "The Commish" and "Walker, 
Texas Ranger" all get respectable ratings. And Sundays, starting at 9 p.m., 
there are the weekly movies on CBS, NBC and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Other successful drama series include "Beverly Hills, 90210," "Murder, She 
Wrote," "The Cosby Mysteries," "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," "The X-Files" and 
the new "Due South." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another new drama, the promising "Chicago Hope," got KO'd by "ER" in their 
publicized battle of medical series and quickly was switched to a different 
time slot -- opposite, alas, the red-hot "Seinfeld," which is TV's top show 
with advertisers, getting an estimated $390,000 for a 30-second commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: ABC this week switched three of its 10 p.m. newsmagazines that compete 
with the resurgent dramas to new days, effective in January. For many viewers, 
this signifies a welcome retreat and realignment for the often-tabloid-style, 
less expensive newsmagazines, which displaced many dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC magazine "Turning Point," getting creamed by "Law & Order," will move 
to Mondays. "PrimeTime Live," getting walloped by "ER" -- and with a weak 
lead-in from the new "McKenna" already yanked -- switches to Wednesdays, where 
ABC obviously thinks it will do better against "Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 A third ABC newsmagazine, "Day One," previously planned for Mondays in 
January, instead will try to be the stopper against "ER" -- hoping that the 
medical series will cool off a bit by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, by the way, that old reliable, "Matlock," with Andy Griffith, will replace 
"McKenna" starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: Fox's grand plan to use its $1.58-billion acquisition of National 
Football League games to establish a powerhouse Sunday prime-time lineup has 
fallen flat. The series that was to benefit from the football lead-in, "Fortune 
Hunter," has already been dropped after disastrous ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, "The Simpsons," formerly a potent Thursday contender, was 
switched back to Sundays -- following "Fortune Hunter" -- and plummeted in the 
ratings as the season began. Another new Fox Sunday show, "Wild Oats," was also 
yanked. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox's year-to-year ratings are up slightly, Sandy Grushow, president 
of the Fox Entertainment Group, was fired. The Sunday failure, after the 
enormous Fox investment in professional football, is regarded by sources as one 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important is the belief that Grushow wanted to maintain Fox's 
well-established image as a youthful program maverick, while Fox owner Rupert 
Murdoch preferred going more mainstream in his battle for parity with ABC, CBS 
and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow's replacement, John Matoian, a Fox executive who, in his quiet way, 
was a prime force in CBS' rise to the top -- turning out enormously successful 
Sunday and Tuesday night movies -- definitely is more of a mainstream 
programmer. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the rebellious Fox TV image nurtured by the network's original 
boss and guru, Barry Diller, now appears to be on the way out. The new -- like 
the old -- Fox is often tasteless in programming targeted at its young male 
audience, but Diller knew how to keep things popping, and sometimes, as with 
"The Simpsons" and "The Tracey Ullman Show," the results were redeemingly 
brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 When Diller saw ABC's weird but often wonderful "Twin Peaks," he wondered why 
it wasn't on Fox. There apparently won't be much more of that kind of thinking 
at his old network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One slight triumph for Fox thus far: "60 Minutes," beneficiary of the NFL 
lead-in when the games were on CBS -- and TV's No. 2 program last season -- is 
still a Top 10 show but seems less an 800-pound gorilla in the ratings. Its 34% 
audience share in 1993-94 slipped a bit to 30% and 29% the first two weeks of 
this season as the series came in eighth and then seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: It only takes one or two big hits to turn even the lowliest network 
around, and NBC hopes that is the case -- with "Frasier" last season and "ER" 
this fall. Suddenly, the third-place network of recent years has gotten off to 
a surprisingly strong ratings start against heavily favored ABC and actually 
led the pack as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The key strategy was moving "Frasier" against ABC's "Home Improvement," using 
the NBC hit as the anchor to build a competitive Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 And although full ratings for this week are still to come, NBC's lineup 
actually defeated ABC this past Tuesday, with "Frasier" getting its highest 
rating thus far against "Home Improvement," TV's No. 1 show. "Home Improvement" 
had 31% of the audience and "Frasier" 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it's still hard to imagine NBC winning the season. Will "ER" 
maintain its momentum? Can you really beat an ABC lineup that has "Home 
Improvement," "NYPD Blue," "Grace Under Fire," "Roseanne" and "Ellen," as well 
as the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not. But it's been an unexpectedly fast and furious start of the season. 
And, in the matter of the dramas, something is blowing in the wind.

TV REVIEW; SPIRITED 'RECTOR'S WIFE' TRIES TO BREAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most hallowed aspect of "The Rector's Wife" is Lindsay Duncan as a 
spirited woman stifled by a bad marriage to a troubled, rigid clergyman and the 
confining dictates of the village parish that he heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The first installment of PBS' three-part "Masterpiece Theatre" soap opera 
finds Anna Bouverie (Duncan) at a crossroads after the failure of her husband, 
Peter (Jonathan Coy), to win promotion to archdeacon. Hoping to alleviate a 
money pinch and shed the drabness of domesticity, she's about to horrify 
narrow-minded parishioners and her stodgy husband by doing the unthinkable: 
taking a job stacking groceries at a local supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapped in a life that, as she puts it, "doesn't allow for impulses," Anna is 
also a sexual affair waiting to happen, the potential collaborators being a 
wealthy village newcomer (Miles Anderson) and the handsome younger brother 
(Stephen Dillane) of the man (Ronald Pickup) who did get the archdeacon job. 
</P>
<P>
 This Hugh Whitemore adaptation of Joanna Trollope's novel of the same title is 
at its best during tiffs between the rebellious Anna and prim local churchwomen 
who resent her independence, something that "Masterpiece Theatre" host Russell 
Baker likens to conflicts between Hillary Rodham Clinton and her critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan's appealingly measured Anna and Coy's inwardly seething Peter are an 
interesting pair. Yet the other males in her life are stock characters and, 
even more lethal, "The Rector's Wife" is 2 1/2 hours of moderately appealing 
story stretched across 3 1/2 hours. Episode 3 begins with a tragedy that erases 
virtually all conflict, making the meandering hour that follows as thin as a 
communal wafer. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Rector's Wife" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8:30 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. It also airs at 8 
p.m. Tuesday on KOCE-TV Channel 50.

GARDENING; LEAVE IT TO NANDINA -- COLORS TO FALL FOR ALL WINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fall brings joy to gardeners who relish the season for planting or 
rejuvenating a garden. It can also brings nostalgia for the vibrant red, ocher 
or yellow leaves now dropping from trees in colder parts of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 But local color buffs need look only to Nandina domestica for exciting foliage 
pigmentation right in their own back yards. Commonly called "Heavenly Bamboo," 
Nandina is not a true bamboo (it belongs to the barberry family), but fans may 
term the dazzling red or magenta leaf colors divine.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's one of the Top 10 garden plants," said Lloyd Tanaka, owner of 
Tanaka Nursery in Yorba Linda. "It's a striking accent plant, not fussy about 
its growing conditions, and is easy to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 Native to China and Japan, Nandina grows widely there and is a cherished plant 
in Chinese and Japanese gardens. Plantings and landscape materials in both 
countries are valued for their beauty and symbolism. To the Japanese, Nandina 
symbolizes clear air and the gift of purification. Although that symbol is 
appropriate for Southern California, local designers value Nandina for its 
practical uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina domestica can grow up to eight feet. The airy, graceful shrub 
resembles bamboo because of its lightly branched, cane-like stems and delicate 
foliage. Small white flowers are produced in summer, but the delicate-looking 
shrub is chiefly valued for its brilliant foliage and scarlet berries that 
remain on until April. The shrub is frequently used in mass plantings for 
vibrant splashes of fall and winter color. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina's popularity is increasing, and hybridizers are responding by 
introducing new varieties. Several grow especially well in this climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina domestica 'Nana Purpurea,' is commonly called "Dwarf Sacred Bamboo." 
This compact, dense shrub grows only to a mounded form about one foot high and 
two feet wide. Its foliage has a reddish purple tinge in winter. It is useful 
in rock plantings or containers as well as mass border plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another relatively new variety, 'Harbor Dwarf,' is low-growing, spreads freely 
from rhizomes and can be used as a colorful ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 'Moon Bay' and 'Gulf Stream' are two compact varieties introduced seven years 
ago. Both grow to three feet and have vivid fall foliage but lack flowers and 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina is a plant that not only tolerates frost but even turns a more intense 
shade when temperatures drop below freezing.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Nandina can tolerate partial shade, the coloration is more pronounced 
in full sun. Versatile in any growing condition, Nandina responds better when 
given abundant water and some fertilizer during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more lush and full with ample water, but the leaf coloration is more 
intense in dryer conditions," Tanaka explained. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls it a "do-nothing plant" because it's one of those valuable garden 
additions that requires little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestica and 'Nana Purpurea' both produce flowers in large panicles of very 
small, star-shaped, fragrant white flowers in summer. But the real show begins 
in fall, when foliage starts to turn color. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina is in its glory now. Intense leaf coloration remains through January 
or February, depending on temperatures. The varieties that form berries retain 
them until April, when they shrivel and become insignificant. Foliage in spring 
and summer turns green. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most shrubs, Nandina requires only light pruning for shaping, and the 
compact varieties that are slow growing need even less. "Domestica" is an 
upright grower, useful as an accent planting and dense enough for background 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good vertical accent plant that adds color without demanding a 
lot of maintenance," said landscape architect Kathryn Rue of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 She also noted that the easygoing plants aren't temperamental if they're 
shifted around in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I need to move a Nandina just a matter of a few feet to improve the 
overall design," she said. "These plants that may have been planted years ago 
transplant very well. In nine out 10 cases they don't suffer from shock, and 
the few that do recover very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Rue suggests thinning canes and trimming to restrain growth to just two or 
three feet if the plant is used in a small space. She also recommends 
backlighting to create dramatic visual effects in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rustling of Nandina in a breeze or wind also brings a pleasant sound to 
the garden. Because the leaves are relatively small, the leaves that drop or 
blow in the wind aren't a messy nuisance and are quick to decompose. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina can be grown in tubs or containers, outdoors and indoors, as long as 
plants receive plenty of light and aren't exposed to warm, dry air currents. 
</P>
<P>
 A bonus for people who live in wilder areas is that deer and insects show 
little interest in the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the plant can become chlorotic in alkaline soil. A supplemental 
dose of iron easily clears up the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nandina is available in most nurseries and garden centers in one or 
five-gallon containers.

IN THE CALIFORNIA MOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year was 1941, and Brayton Laguna was the biggest manufacturer of gift and 
art pottery in the world, employing more than 150 people who worked night and 
day at a five-acre site between the Pacific Coast Highway and Glenneyre. And 
this was just the largest, not the only, pottery company in South Orange County 
during the heyday of California pottery making from the mid 1930s to about 
1950. During that time, thousands of people were employed to make California 
ceramics, many of them in Orange County. Although the factories have long since 
closed, the works produced there have become a favorite of collectors, who 
appreciate anew both the workmanship and the stories the pieces tell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime pottery was created during the '30s and '40s," said Devin T. Frick, 
curator of an exhibit at the Anaheim Museum that features the works of Brayton 
Laguna and other ceramic artists. "California pottery can be considered one of 
the best-kept secrets in American ceramics." 
</P>
<P>
 Brayton Laguna Pottery was the first Southern California ceramic company to be 
established and was long a leader in the field. The business closed in 1967, 
and today the buildings house the Laguna Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brayton did a dinnerware line, but they're better known for their figures," 
Frick said. "In those days people bought ceramic groupings of animals or 
children that told a story. The figures went in the children's rooms or in the 
living room in a display cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
 Brayton Laguna was started by Durlin E. Brayton, a California native who 
attended the Chicago Art Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1926 he bought a parcel of land along what is now South Coast Highway, 
built a home and set up a painting and sculpting shop. After borrowing $300 
from his father to buy a kiln, he started producing brightly colored bowls, 
plates and vases and put them on the fence in front of his house to attract 
buyers. Many believe that his line of simple earthenware dishes in sets of 
mixed colors produced in the late 1920s was probably the first of its kind in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Durlin Brayton was a pioneer and innovator in ceramics and specialized in 
glazes, achieving a full range of vibrant hues and finishes," Frick said. "They 
even produced a leadless glaze which maintained paint and slip colors well." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this reputation, Brayton Laguna was the first pottery company 
licensed by Walt Disney Studios to produce ceramic likenesses of their 
characters. Among the Disney pieces the company produced from 1938 to 1940 were 
the figures Ferdinand the Bull, Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, California pottery companies expanded greatly because of 
the lack of imports from Japan, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick said, "Since there was no European and Asian trade, the demand for 
dinnerware and gift-ware increased, so for the local manufacturers the war was 
their boom time." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the war, retail outlets selling Brayton Laguna pottery were in 
every major American city and many foreign countries. During this time, Laguna 
Beach was a major ceramics center, with around 65 separate pottery companies -- 
among them Kay Kinney, Freeman & Leidy, Martha Newman and Yerbysmith Ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was doing research for this exhibition, I found newspaper clippings 
written by people living in Laguna complaining about the constant noise from 
all the pottery kilns going night and day," Frick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the local potters were women who worked in their own companies and 
those of others. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most successful Orange County pottery designers was Kay Finch of 
Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Finch started her ceramics business as a hobby. It continued to grow, though, 
and in 1941 she and her husband, Braden Finch, moved to Corona del Mar and 
built a studio and retail showroom at 3901 E. Pacific Coast Highway (next door 
to what is now the Five Crowns Restaurant). 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Finch was the artist and her husband was the businessman. Together they 
created a successful company that had more than 65 employees, from mold makers 
to painters. Each ceramic piece was designed by Finch, but the production was 
done by others -- all by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Finch is noted for her colorful figures of people and animals -- especially 
dogs. In fact, she was a dog lover who raised and bred Yorkshire terriers and 
later Afghan hounds and was internationally known as a dog show judge. Finch 
died June 21, 1993, at age 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ceramics are of a more delicate design than Brayton's and are composed of 
Kentucky and Tennessee clay mixed with California talc. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to Jack Chipman, author of Collector's Encyclopedia of 
California Pottery (Collector Books, $24.95), it was the availability of talc 
(a mineral mined in abundance in the California desert that was a primary 
ingredient in much of the pottery) along with availability of natural gas and 
fuel oil that helped make Orange County a center for pottery production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of World War II, inexpensive imports began to arrive, first from 
Japan and then from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 These could be made so cheaply that the California potters could not compete, 
although they did try during the 1950s. Much of this later pottery is still 
around and tends to be darker in color and not as pretty or intricate as that 
done during the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death of Durlin Brayton in 1952, his company lost its creative 
energy, although it continued to produce ceramics for the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these Orange County companies no longer exist, their works live on in 
houses and collections throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality pieces by Brayton, Finch and other potters from the era are sought by 
collectors and becoming more difficult to find. Prices range from less than $50 
to several hundred dollars or more.  
</P>
<P>
 During their prime, the ceramic figures by Brayton and Finch were sold in fine 
department stores throughout the country, and the stamp "Made in California" 
was highly prized.  
</P>
<P>
 These Orange County designers left their mark on American pottery design 
through both their artistry and their glaze innovations. Even West Virginia's 
"Fiesta" ware had its design beginnings in Brayton Laguna pottery, according to 
Chipman. 
</P>
<P>
 "California with its eclectic people and personality was able to achieve what 
few other regions of the country could," Frick said. "With the lure of 
Hollywood and near ideal weather conditions, the state produced colorful 
ceramics to promote happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these pottery people were back-yard hobbyists with talent and drive. 
Even during the hardest time, California and its artists had an outstanding 
effect on the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "California Kilns," an exhibit at the Anaheim Museum featuring the works of 
Durlin Brayton and Kay Finch from Orange County and of Los Angeles-based Vernon 
Potteries and Sascha Brastoff, continues through Nov. 23.  
</P>
<P>

Thursday and Friday, noon to 4 p.m. Saturday. Suggestion donation, $1.50. Call

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; GOOD SEAL WILL KEEP DRY ROT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Q. We have French doors that lead to our patio, and we've found that the wood 
threshold under the doors has become spongy. I suspect it's deteriorating from 
water coming from a nearby sprinkler head. Any ideas on this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 T.C., Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 A. Any time wood has that spongy feel to it, it's a sign of dry rot, says Pete 
Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. Dry rot is usually found in wood that's 
exposed to moisture. It's caused by a fungus that eats away the fibers, and 
it's difficult to kill. People often associate it with termites, which like to 
enter the wood when it's soft and spongy. You could fill in the eaten-away 
portions with a wood filler, but it's not going to look very good. The best 
solution is to replace the affected wood and make sure it's correctly sealed to 
keep out moisture in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a 12-year-old condo with those ugly, faux marble countertops in the 
bathrooms. I'd much prefer tile. Is it possible to tile over these tops rather 
than remove them? 
</P>
<P>
 L.I., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. It can be done, depending on the type of counter you have, says Gloria 
Richey of Tile Importers in Anaheim. If the edges are straight and don't have a 
lip, you should be able to apply the tile directly. The surface just needs to 
be cleaned and scratched to give the mastic some adhesion. If your sink is a 
part of the countertop and can't be removed, you may not want to tile over it, 
because you'll be stuck with an ugly sink alongside your new tile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. No matter what we do to our wrought-iron fence, it continually rusts. Every 
three months it begins to look shabby and in need of paint. Any suggestions on 
how to make it look better? 
</P>
<P>
 R.S., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A. Get some good wire brushes and brush away any scaling paint and rust, 
especially around joints where the welds are, which are where much of the rust 
starts, says Charlie Kaczorowski of Tustin Paint Mart. You might get a break in 
the top coat at a joint, allowing moisture to get in there, and you have a rust 
problem. After it's perfectly clean, apply a rust converter, available at most 
paint stores. This retards the oxidation process that creates the rust. Then 
apply a good rust-preventative primer over the metal and, afterward, an 
oil-based enamel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Our bedroom is close to the air intake for our furnace/air conditioner. 
When either unit is turned on, the noise is extremely loud -- it's enough to 
wake us from a deep sleep. What can be done to quiet this? 
</P>
<P>
 P.Y., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unfortunately, some units are designed without regard to how loud the air 
intake is, says furnace repairman Gary Matson of Santa Ana. You may be one of 
the unlucky homeowners to have one of those. Lots of noise from the intake 
could also be caused by a clogged or improperly installed filter. Be sure to 
check your filter regularly to make sure it's not dirty. If you're running both 
an air conditioner and a furnace through it, replace it twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We recently moved to a home near the ocean, and in just three months I've 
noticed that metals stored in the garage are starting to get specks of rust. 
What is the best way to save things such as tools, lawn mower, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you're used to storing your tools on a Pegboard, you may have to get 
some new habits, says Frank Eckert of Arrow Hardware in Orange. Exposing them 
to the salty air adds to your rust problems. You may need to keep them tucked 
away in a storage closet. Also, be sure to clean metal tools after they're 
used. Use a rag with a little light machine oil to rub them down and give them 
some protection.

GARDENING; PRESERVING PRODUCE: IT'S CUT AND DRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The ancient rite of preserving the garden harvest still is widely practiced 
today. The subject always seems to provoke debate about what produce should be 
canned, dried or frozen. In some kitchens, the discussion is even more basic: 
Should we preserve garden-fresh vegetables in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 20 years of using all available methods of preserving garden 
harvests, I have some pretty definite opinions about what works and what 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though finding fresh herbs year-round is easier today than it once was, 
there is good reason to preserve herbs. Most dry well if properly stored, 
retaining their pungency for many weeks. And drying herbs is about the most 
painless method of preserving fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden herbs that dry well include basil, thyme, cilantro, oregano, rosemary, 
sage, marjoram, savory, dill and tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
 This list may surprise those who have sampled store-bought herbs whose 
essential oils -- and flavors -- largely have dissipated before they reach the 
consumer. The flavors of home-grown herbs will remain intact for about six 
months if leaves are left whole and dried correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 Herbs for drying are best picked before flowers mature and divert the plant's 
flavor and vigor to seed production. Clip off any flower heads and begin 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The best method for drying is to cut off individual leaves, spread them out on 
a tray or screen and put them aside for about a week. Herbs can be dried in 
bunches, but it will take longer, and they will be more inclined to moldiness. 
Quick drying is one way to ensure the quality -- and therefore the longevity -- 
of the dried herb. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take about a week before the foliage becomes papery, indicating it is 
fully dry. After the leaves have dried, put them in sealed plastic bags and 
store them in a cupboard away from a direct heat source. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving vegetables can be more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 I have given up trying to save the surfeit of string beans I harvest each 
year: My family won't eat them canned or frozen. Shell beans, including pinto, 
kidney and navy beans and the misnamed black-eyed peas, also are quite 
marvelous -- and to some may be a revelation -- when eaten fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 But these varieties are among the most familiar to us in their dried form, 
perhaps because they lend themselves so readily to drying. Preserving them is 
worthwhile if there are too many in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to leave them on the vine to dry. The plants eventually dry up too. The 
entire plant can be pulled, the dried seedpods that contain the shell beans 
removed and the remaining plant debris added to the compost pile. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean plants, like so much garden debris, are rich in nutrients that will serve 
the soil well. 
</P>
<P>
 The beans then are removed from the shell. They can be stored in jars by 
variety or in combinations -- most require very similar cooking methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller varieties of hot peppers are readily dried by hanging them from the 
ceiling indoors. I either tie their stems together with string or run a thin 
wire through them.  
</P>
<P>
 The tiniest varieties, such as Thai hot pepper, can be dried right on the 
plant: Just pull the entire bush at the end of the growing season and hang it 
by the root from a rafter. In about a month, the pepper can be plucked from the 
dried plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to preserve fresh hot peppers is to put them to work: Add them, 
freshly picked, to a jar of vinegar or oil, where they will impart their 
pungency, resulting in hot sauce or hot oil. The oil or vinegar also preserves 
the peppers for later use. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes can be dried in the oven, made into sauce, canned whole or chopped. 
After I have exhausted my family's tolerance for tomato soup, tomato salad and 
stuffed tomatoes, I use all of these methods to preserve what's left. 
</P>
<P>
 Drying preserves the most with the least amount of labor. The traditional 
method in predictably hot and dry Mediterranean climates -- sun-drying outdoors 
-- is one option.  
</P>
<P>
 To oven dry, slice the tomatoes and lay them on a length of tightly woven 
cheesecloth stretched over a couple of oven racks. Set an electric oven on 
warm; with a gas oven, the pilot light will do the drying. 
</P>
<P>
 If tomatoes are sliced in rounds, each one-quarter- to one-half-inch thick, it 
will take three days of constant heat until they are dry enough to store. 
Thicker slices could require as much as a week of heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dried tomatoes traditionally are stored in olive oil but will be fine if kept 
in plastic zip bags. Used in thin soups or stews, they don't even need to be 
reconstituted. 
</P>
<P>
 If used in thick sauces, they should be soaked in warm water for a couple of 
hours: Use the soaking liquid as well as the tomatoes in the sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Dried tomatoes should not be reconstituted until they are ready to be used or 
they will lose flavor and might spoil.

ROOFING; ASPHALT SHINGLES, DURABLE TILES TOP LIST OF MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today there's a wide choice of roofing materials. While all are durable, each 
has its own advantages and trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at two popular choices: cementatious roof tiles and asphalt 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cementatious roof tiles offer traditional looks combined with the benefit of 
modern materials. These products are made from cellulose fiber-reinforced 
portland cement or concrete. They are available in red, black, white, green and 
gray, and can be molded to look like wood shingles, barrel-shaped tiles or 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong suit of cementatious roofing tiles is their durability. Because 
they are a masonry material, they resist weathering, insects and fire. Their 
nearly impenetrable surface also resists the formation of fungus, and because 
they are heavy, they resist wind uplift. 
</P>
<P>
 Asphalt shingles are the most common roofing material, and they come in two 
broad categories -- organic-based and fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic base means that the shingles are made of a cellulose mat saturated 
with asphalt and covered with mineral granules. Fiberglass shingles have a mat 
of woven glass fiber saturated with asphalt and covered with mineral granules. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic shingles have a Class C fire rating while fiberglass shingles have a 
Class A rating. 
</P>
<P>
 An important difference between the two types of shingles is that organic 
types are more flexible in cold weather than fiberglass types.  
</P>
<P>
 The two most common types of asphalt shingle are three-tab (also called a 
strip shingle) and architectural (also called a laminate shingle). 
</P>
<P>
 A three-tab shingle is a rectangular mat with two slots cut in its front edge. 
The slots provide stress relief as the shingle expands and contracts with the 
weather. An architectural shingle has a heavy base mat and another mat or 
sections of mat applied on top of it. Aside from making the shingle heavier and 
more durable, this construction gives the roof shadow lines and character like 
a tile or wood roof. 
</P>
<P>
 A standard three-tab shingle can be organic- or fiberglass-based. Most 
architectural shingles have a fiberglass mat, although some are organic. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there are regional and specialized forms of asphalt roofing, such as 
a highly wind-resistant shingle called a T-lock. This is a slotted T-shaped 
shingle that locks to the shingle below and the one above.

ROOFING; COVERING THE BASICS: PRODUCTS, RATINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people give little thought to their roof until one of two events occur: 
It starts to leak or it looks so shabby it needs to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, this is how it should be. There's enough to maintain in a home 
without worrying about your roof. 
</P>
<P>
 In another sense, it overlooks the fact that a roof can go a long way toward 
improving or changing your house's appearance, and this has never been more 
true than today. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more roofing materials than ever -- you don't have to settle for 
standard black shingles. You have your choice of color, texture and, of course, 
price. Furthermore, there's no reason your roof can't be worry-free. Today's 
roofing products combine durability with good looks. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so we've settled the fact that you need a new roof. With a little 
research, you can install an asphalt shingle roof yourself. On the other hand, 
it's hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of roofs require professional installation, so you may have to 
hire someone. Picking a contractor is as important as choosing the right 
roofing. Here's a few words of advice: 
</P>
<P>
 Ask for as many references as you can get. Check that the contractor has a 
license -- not just a business license but a license for the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask to see insurance and bonding certificates. Review the contract carefully. 
Any home improvement contract should be specific. It should cover when the work 
will start and when it will be completed (depending on weather), the complete 
cost (including the disposal of roofing debris), and the type and color of 
roofing should be specified in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the word "square" will probably come up in the contract or in 
your discussions. A square is 100 square feet of roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the contractor if the existing roofing needs to be torn off because some 
communities allow no more than two layers of shingles on a roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Also ask if the deck or portions of it need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, ask about the roofing's fire rating (Class A is most resistant to 
flame spread, Class B is next, followed by Class C). Some communities permit 
only Class A and B roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 All this makes the process sound more complex than it is. It all boils down to 
this: If you are going to go to the expense and endure the mess of having your 
house re-roofed, you want the job done right. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of mess, make it clear that the job site be as clean after the job as 
before it. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes using a magnetic sweep or dragging a magnetic bar over the 
driveway to catch roofing nails. 
</P>

KITCHENS; TOO MANY COOKS CAN'T BE SPOILED IF APPLIANCES ARE TWO PLENTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

 "It is not that Americans are too lazy to walk to the refrigerator or stove," 
Jim Krengel says. "It is that we have become something of a nation of impatient 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Make these hotfoots cool their heels in the kitchen, and the idea of doubling 
up on major appliances begins to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens with two wall ovens and a second sink have been fairly common for 
years, but now there is the two-dishwasher or two-refrigerator kitchen. In a 
recent survey by Maytag, about 20% of the respondents said they had put in two 
dishwashers or refrigerators. About 15% have two microwave ovens. The survey by 
the appliance manufacturer questioned 470 households with recently remodeled 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Family living arrangements are fueling the trend, says Krengel, design 
director of the Maytag Kitchen Center in Newton, Iowa. Use of space in the home 
is changing, with a large open area that functions for cooking, dining and 
entertaining increasingly replacing the traditional separate kitchen, dining 
room and living room. 
</P>
<P>
 In such open spaces, there is room for an auxiliary cooking area. Good news 
since the survey shows that in nearly 25% of households, two or more people 
regularly cook together and find a second cooktop and sink convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical is a kitchen created recently by kitchen designer Nancy Mullan of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a family in which the husband and wife cook together, we installed a 
cooktop and a second sink in an island," she says. "The controls for the 
burners are at one end of the island so they are accessible to both cooks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullan often gets requests for a microwave and an under-cabinet refrigerator 
for snacks and ice in the entertaining area. But, she says, the dishwasher is 
the most frequently requested double. This second dishwasher most generally is 
installed near the cooking area or near where table settings are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to families with multiple cooks or those who entertain a lot, 
families with special needs double up on some appliances: the sportsman who 
wants a freezer for the bounty of hunting and fishing trips or the Orthodox 
Jewish family whose dietary laws require separating milk and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done kosher kitchens with two of every appliance that touches food or 
dishes, and some families even put in a tiny Pullman kitchen for Passover. 
These people are an appliance maker's dream," Mullan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Location is key to a second appliance's usefulness. Krengel says to save steps 
in cleaning up it's generally best if the second dishwasher is near the table 
or the cabinets where dishes and flatware are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs two cooktops? A family that makes good use of specialized burners, 
such as a wok, barbecue unit, deep fat fryer (also used as a steamer), a grill 
or a griddle. Two cooktops can keep both happy if one cook strongly favors 
electric burners and another likes to cook with gas. 
</P>
<P>
 A small refrigerator near the table where meals are taken can save schlepping 
salad dressings, butter, cold drinks and condiments. For efficiency alone, a 
second refrigerator should rank higher than it does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most refrigerators are too crammed already. And because the refrigerator is 
so large, it is often located somewhat out of the way," Krengel says, noting 
that minifridges range from about 15 inches to 48 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
 While double appliances are costly, Krengel says you don't have to order 
top-of-the-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he says, in a new kitchen "by adding a second appliance, you may be 
eliminating a storage cabinet and lowering cabinet costs."

ANTIQUES; COLLECTORS TAKE TURN TOWARD THE WHIMSICAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Country-style auctions have been changing. Where once they offered fine cherry 
and maple chests, drop-leaf tables, sturdy rockers and hooked rugs, today they 
are more apt to sell Fiesta ware, kerosene lamps and architectural bygones such 
as hitching posts and old gates. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer of the traditional furnishings because people have been 
selling them off for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new generation of 'antiques' we'll have to get used to," said 
author and lecturer George Michael of Merrimack, N.H., host and producer of the 
PBS series "Antiques and Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the choicest antiques are in museums or owned by affluent collectors, 
although an occasional early 19th-Century American cabinet or four-poster turns 
up at a country auction. He added that prices for top-notch antiques have been 
going up and up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discriminating collectors are not daunted by economic conditions," said Tom 
Porter, president of Garth's Auctions Inc. in Delaware, Ohio. "In a sale (some) 
months ago, we had a California Indian basket, a rare piece that we dared to 
estimate might fetch $6,000. It sold for $35,000." 
</P>
<P>
 A new generation of buyers with a different lifestyle accounts for some of the 
changes. Eat-and-run kitchen meals, for example, have made dining room 
furniture almost obsolete. One auctioneer said old maple or cherry dining 
tables with matching sets of six or eight chairs -- all in fine condition -- 
are selling far below their value. 
</P>
<P>
 What are amateur buyers and dealers bidding on as investments or collectibles? 
</P>
<P>
 "China, glass, pottery from the 1920s to as late as the early 1950s -- the 
things our parents had and we didn't like -- are now considered beautiful and 
trendy," said Ron Seifert, an auctioneer in Hoosick, N.Y.

FLOWERS; ARRANGEMENTS NEED LOTS OF WATER TO CUT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a little care, cut flowers will retain their freshness indoors for days, 
in some cases even weeks. The secret to long-lasting and beautiful cut flowers 
can be summed up in one word: water. 
</P>
<P>
 Put cut stems in water quickly. Once in water, flowers need special care to 
get that water into their stems. 
</P>
<P>
 When picking flowers from your garden, snip them before breakfast, while 
plants are swollen with water. Exceptions are zinnias and gladiolus, which have 
hollow stems. Early in the morning these hollow stems are filled with water 
that might cause the cut flowers to rot. Such plants are best cut before 
supper, in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut stems cleanly with a sharp knife or scissors. Sawing the stems with a dull 
knife plugs the cut cells with debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than cutting squarely across the base of the stem, make a slanting cut 
to provide more avenues for water uptake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes water uptake is prevented by little air bubbles that collect at the 
bases of flower stems as they are plunged in water. Simply recut the stems 
while they are under water or put the stems in warm water for a few minutes. 
Recutting the stems every few days renews the freshness of most cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all flowers need that careful cutting with a sharp knife. Chrysanthemums 
and stocks keep best if the bases of their stems are lightly bashed with a rock 
or a hammer before they are put into water. 
</P>
<P>
 Severe treatment is also prescribed for plants that, when cut, bleed a milky 
sap that clogs the stems. For these, which include poppy, butterfly weed and 
heliotrope, pass the cut ends quickly through a flame or briefly immerse them 
in boiling water to stop the flow of sap before you arrange the flowers in a 
vase. 
</P>
<P>
 Once stems have been cut and are in water, bacteria are liable to plug up 
stems. Ward off the bacteria with starvation. Start with a clean vase and give 
your cut flowers an occasional fresh change of water. Never put sugar, as is 
sometimes suggested, into the water for cut flowers or you will be catering a 
bacterial banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom of the cut flower now has been taken care of so that water can 
enter the stems; next, reduce water loss from the tops of the plants. Cut off 
any leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaves transpire great amounts of water, and bacteria will gobble up and 
multiply on any leaves that flop into the water. The tiny pores through which 
plants lose water open in response to light, so keep vases of flowers out of 
direct sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmth and wind also speed water loss, so keep vases of flowers away from 
open, sunny windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Which flowers are best for cutting? The list is long: flat-topped umbels of 
yellow and pink yarrow; spikes of delphinium, larkspur, snapdragon and 
foxglove; round heads of marigold, zinnia and calendula, and delicate, 
crepe-petaled poppies. Daisies keep for two weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not overlook wildflowers. Fragrant white Queen Anne's lace, blue chicory, 
orange butterfly weed, wild daisies and black-eyed Susans bloom along roadsides 
and in fields. Sprays of yellow goldenrod, wrongly blamed for allergies, are 
also blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting flowers from your garden is like having your cake and eating it. When 
its flowers are removed, a plant no longer has to devote energy to making 
seeds. So the more you cut its flowers, the more a plant will continue its 
colorful show of blossoms.

THE FORCE IS WITH HIM; CITY'S FIRST VIETNAMESE FIREFIGHTER IS WELCOMED ADDITION 
</P>

 Son Nguyen knew fighting fires wasn't easy, but was it supposed to be like 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Propane tanks exploded around him. Twisted, burning metal flew through the 
air. Flames as tall as buildings raced down the hill. Helpless, he crawled 
under a firetruck to seek cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing much we could do," said Nguyen, recalling the time he spent 
last year helping to defend El Morro Beach Mobile Home Park as an Orange County 
volunteer firefighter during the devastating Laguna Beach fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience could have forced him to reconsider his boyhood dream of 
becoming a firefighter, as his parents hoped he would. Instead, Nguyen said, 
his ambition burned even deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Nguyen, 23, has fulfilled his dream. Last month he joined the Garden 
Grove Fire Department, becoming the first Vietnamese American on the 94-member 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Nguyen, five other firefighters, including three Latinos, were 
hired following a recruitment campaign in the city's minority communities. More 
Orange County cities are recruiting bilingual police officers and firefighters, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the right thing to do," said Garden Grove Battalion Chief Keith Osborn. 
"It makes our job easier. It allows us to react to emergencies quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Orange County communities are becoming more diverse, Osborn said, 
firefighters who speak a second language are becoming more essential, 
particularly during medical emergencies, which make up about 75% of the calls 
to most fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we made an educated guess" on those occasions when firefighters 
had to deal with a patient who didn't speak English, Osborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the patient has his hands on his chest, is he having a heart attack? 
We need to talk to him. We need to know his medical history real quick," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey of the county's 15 fire departments, Nguyen appears to 
be their only full-time firefighter of Vietnamese descent. Westminster and 
Fountain Valley, which have fairly large Vietnamese populations, do not yet 
have Vietnamese American firefighters, although city officials said efforts are 
being made to recruit members from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department said that 13 Asian 
Americans, including one woman, are among the county's 693 firefighters, but he 
could not provide the ethnic breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the county, which provides fire services to 18 cities and 
unincorporated areas, has not lowered its hiring standards in trying to create 
a more diverse work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect them to be more educated and provide greater performance," he said. 
"We want the employee to feel that they have earned the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Vietnamese community, the second largest ethnic group in Garden 
Grove, applauded Nguyen's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good step the city has taken," said Mai Cong, president of the 
Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a nonprofit group. "This will 
benefit those who have difficulty speaking English, especially the older 
Vietnamese." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 15,000 Vietnamese Americans in Garden Grove, according to 
the 1990 Census. Latinos are the largest ethnic group, at more than 32,000, 
while the city's population of 143,000 is still predominantly white. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Kessler, a former Garden Grove police chief, said there are no set 
goals on the number of minority police officers and firefighters to be hired by 
the city because this would be akin to setting a quota, which would violate the 
city's hiring policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But bilingual applicants for public safety positions have the edge over those 
who speak only one language, Kessler said. Still, of the Fire Department's 94 
firefighters, just 16 are minorities. There are 13 Latinos, one African 
American, one Asian American and one Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Police Department's 161-member force are six Asian Americans, six 
African Americans and 17 Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to recruit in the minority communities," Kessler said. 
"Part of that is cultural, because Asian parents believe their children have 
better opportunities in other fields." 
</P>
<P>
 This was true in Nguyen's case -- initially. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and his family arrived in the United States from Vietnam in 1975 when 
he was 3 years old. He still speaks fluent Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Duoc, 59, and mother, Duyen, 47, at first opposed his becoming a 
firefighter. They wanted him to pursue a college education and find a 
"suitable" career. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nguyen, whose dream of being a firefighter began in junior high school 
after he watched paramedics attend to his mother several times at their 
Huntington Beach home, said he persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Ocean View High School in 1989, he became a volunteer 
firefighter with Fountain Valley and the county. He then enrolled in the fire 
technology program at Rancho Santiago College, where he earned a certificate in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed a three-month course at the Orange County Firefighters Training 
Academy in Huntington Beach and was certified as an emergency medical 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he began his search for a full-time job, applying in various Southland 
cities, as well as in Oregon and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is a full-time firefighter, his next goal is to be a paramedic, 
where he feels his bilingual skills are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little extra that he can give the community," said Fire Capt. Dave 
Barlag, who heads the three-man crew Nguyen has been assigned to. "He has done 
real well, his skills are really good, he has a good attitude and (is) real 
ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
 Barlag said Nguyen's skills and knowledge of the job will be evaluated after 
six months. Another evaluation will be made at the end of his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Osborn, the battalion chief, said that about 20% of new firefighters do not 
make it to their second year. There are various reasons for dropping out, he 
said, but the most common are pressure from family because of the irregular 
schedule and lack of a commitment to constantly improve.  
</P>
<P>
 After the second year, however, very few leave until they retire, Osborn said. 
The key is attitude, he added, because to be a firefighter takes lifetime 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie firefighters earn about $2,500 a month, and pay can rise to $3,300 a 
month for firefighters who are paramedics as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to be here," said Nguyen, adding that his parents are now proud 
to say he is a firefighter. "This is something that I have always wanted. I'm 
happy that I can help break the language barrier with the Vietnamese 
community."

FIRE SUSPECT'S LIES MAY WORK TO HIS ADVANTAGE; COURT: DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS TWO 
ARSON CHARGES IN FULLERTON CASE SHOULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE JOSE SOTO MARTINEZ 
LACKS CREDIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The credibility of arson suspect Jose Soto Martinez has been so undermined by 
his own lies that his entire confession should be thrown out and at least two 
of the three remaining arson charges against him should be dropped, his defense 
attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the district attorney was forced to dismiss the most 
serious charge against Martinez -- that he set last year's Laguna Beach 
firestorm -- after discovering that his confession to that blaze was a twisted 
fantasy. Deputy Public Defender Frank Ospino says his client's comments 
regarding three Fullerton fires set Sept. 16 are probably just as erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen how unreliable his statements have been, yet how believable," 
Ospino said. "Only his statements tie him to two of the three Fullerton fires." 
</P>
<P>
 At the third fire, Martinez, 26, was captured by bystanders who said they 
spotted him near some smoldering brush. No witnesses saw Martinez igniting the 
fire, but he was caught with a cigarette lighter in hand, fire officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief court hearing, Ospino called upon the district attorney to drop 
at least two of the three Fullerton arson charges. At Friday's hearing, 
Fullerton Municipal Judge Stephen J. Sundvold scheduled hearing dates to 
determine Martinez's bail, to consider motions for discovery and to hold a 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Fell, citing the pending trial, declined to discuss 
the Fullerton case or any evidence against Martinez besides his challenged 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, whose true name is Jaime Saille Higuera, is being held without bail 
in the Orange County Jail. If convicted of the three arson charges against him, 
Martinez faces a maximum prison term of 19 years, 8 months, compared to the 
30-year sentence he faced with the Laguna charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If his defense attorney succeeds in getting two of the three remaining charges 
dismissed, the punishment he faces could be more than cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys agree that Martinez is mentally disturbed, 
but they differ on what, and how much to believe of Martinez's statements after 
he was arrested. Both sides acknowledge that Martinez's credibility and his 
statements will be central issues in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he said is questionable and suspect," Ospino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it will cause a substantial problem for the prosecution," added 
Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Many law enforcement officials are still perplexed over how they could have 
fallen for Martinez's bogus story. Some even speculate that Martinez would have 
been convicted easily on the strength of that conviction had it not been for 
his mother informing investigators that her son was actually in a Mexican 
prison when the Oct. 27, 1993, fire was started. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire damaged or destroyed more than 440 structures and caused $528 million 
in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Martinez's confession was debunked, questions have been raised regarding 
the thoroughness of the investigation, including whether investigators prodded 
Martinez into the Laguna confession and coached him on where and how the fire 
was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley said Friday that he is still convinced 
that Martinez had something to do with the Laguna fire, although he has backed 
off initial pronouncements he would bet six months' salary on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had never said that," McKinley said. "But I was so positive because 
of the evidence. I have never been so baffled by something in my life. I have a 
lot of time in police work and have been around a lot of heavyweight things and 
I've never seen the evidence in a case that was so overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 One major piece of corroborating evidence that law enforcement officials have 
repeatedly cited in explaining why Martinez's confession was so convincing was 
his ability to take fire investigators to the point where the fire was started. 
Originally, they said that only two people knew the precise spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they acknowledge that the flash point for the fire, which is visible 
from one of the most heavily traveled roads in the county, was marked with 
yellow crime-scene tape for "a number of days" after the fire. Furthermore, 
several weeks after the fire, investigators went to the site and handed out 
flyers to passing motorists, asking if any had observed any suspicious activity 
at that spot around the time of the fire. McKinley said Martinez led Fullerton 
police investigators to within 10 feet of the fire's origin after initially 
walking across the spot and standing on a small bluff nearby, claiming it to be 
the point of ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County fire investigators watching from a distance radioed ahead to 
Fullerton police and said Martinez was not standing near the spot where the 
fire started. Fullerton officers were used because Martinez despises 
firefighters, fire officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He admitted, 'Yes, this is where I watched it from,' and then took them to 
the spot," McKinley explained. "It has come across wrongly that he said, 
'Here's the spot' and then changed his mind again and again. He was hesitant at 
first, which only reinforced in my mind the point that he knew where the spot 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley said that investigators did get Martinez "to focus on" the Laguna 
fire by first mentioning the blaze but did not coerce him into admitting to 
setting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very, very reticent about talking," McKinley said. "He said he had set 
some big fires. The investigators had a hard time having him focus on the 
Laguna Beach fire. They finally said Laguna. He said he didn't want to talk 
about that one. Later on, they got him to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez talked of fires almost as if he owned them, McKinley said. 
Investigators mentioned the Malibu fire and he wouldn't claim it. But he said 
the Green River and Laguna blazes were "his fires." 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief said Martinez "profiles a pyromaniac perfectly" because when 
he talks of setting them, "his eyes just glow." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Martinez apparently has a credibility problem, McKinley said it might 
be difficult to link him to all three Fullerton fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to go to court on that one," he said. "I'm sure the public 
defender will jump on that" credibility gap. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley said he was happy with the overall performance of his department, 
although he acknowledged that one of his detectives erred by not finding 
Martinez in the city jail at the time his mother came by the station to file a 
missing-person report before the Laguna charge was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detective is feeling very, very badly," McKinley said. "We got a 
26-year-old who's a two-time convicted felon and his mother is worried about 
his absence after a day. That case doesn't go to the top of the pile because we 
have a triage case-load system here." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley also said that Martinez's mother should not have been turned away 
when she first tried to file the report the day after her son was arrested. 
Someone at the front desk told the mother, Teresa Campos, to come back in 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley, who earlier said that the 72-hour wait was appropriate, clarified 
his position Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take missing-persons reports right away," he said. "Apparently, the mother 
was told to come back. But it is up to us to get that information in the 
computer right away."

TEEN TO STAND TRIAL AS ADULT IN MURDER CASE; COURTS: PROSECUTORS DEBATE LODGING 
A HATE-CRIME CHARGE AGAINST THE WHITE 17-YEAR-OLD FROM LAGUNA NIGUEL IN THE 
SLAYING OF A BLACK HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Laguna Niguel youth will be tried as an adult for murder in the shooting 
death of a 44-year-old black man because of the gravity of the crime and 
because the killing may have been racially motivated, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man needlessly lost his life and there appears to be some racial 
overtones," said Orange County Superior Court Judge Frank F. Fasel, who 
presides in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanazaki agreed with the ruling, contending that Robert 
Wofford, 17, who is white, may have targeted Vernon Windell Flournoy of 
Huntington Beach because he was black. Prosecutors are trying to decide whether 
to lodge an additional charge of a hate crime against the teen-ager, Tanazaki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kennedy, 19, of Huntington Beach is also charged in the killing. The 
shooting happened in mid-September during a scuffle outside the Seabridge 
Villas apartment complex, where Flournoy lived and Kennedy was staying briefly, 
on Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Wofford and Kennedy argued with Flournoy, then traded blows with 
him before the older man was shot. Flournoy stumbled into a McDonald's 
restaurant where he collapsed in front of horrified workers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are investigating whether Wofford is a skinhead, has associated 
with hate groups, or has shown a pattern of racial abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Patrick McNeal said the teen-ager was not the gunman. 
McNeal said he believes Wofford did fight with Flournoy, but said his client 
was not the one who pulled the trigger.  
</P>
<P>
 McNeal also said his client is not a skinhead, although he acknowledged that 
the teen-ager did associate with skinheads while living in Huntington Beach 
with his grandmother. But several months ago, Wofford moved in with his father 
in Laguna Niguel, partly to get away from bad influences, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to him, to his family and to some of his friends. . . . He tried 
to break away from those persons," McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that during the past two years Wofford has had 12 other 
run-ins with police because of fistfights in public and in school and for 
disturbing the peace. He has been arrested several times and convicted once, 
Tanazaki said. He declined to give further details because Wofford was a 
juvenile at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy, a husband and father, worked as a refrigeration mechanic at Matson 
Navigation, a shipping company on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 His relatives said that although he was normally a quiet man, he couldn't 
abide rude racial remarks and would have stood up to anyone who gave him 
trouble. The killing prompted the Huntington Beach City Council to dedicate a 
session to Flournoy's memory and to call for a moment of silence.  
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of Orange County minority leaders have also pushed local law 
enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute the case as a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling Friday to try Wofford as an adult means that if convicted, 
Wofford could receive a possible sentence of 25 years to life in prison for the 
murder. If he is further convicted of a hate crime, he could get life in prison 
without the possibility of parole or the death penalty, Tanazaki said. Wofford 
turns 18 next month. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeal said he welcomed the judge's decision to move the case from Juvenile 
Court because it gives Wofford rights to a more involved trial process in adult 
court.  
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager will have the right to a preliminary hearing, which could result 
in a lessening of charges, and can request a jury trial, McNeal said. In 
Juvenile Court, the case would have been decided by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very optimistic that as more items are investigated, his role, if any, 
will become more clear," McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanazaki said prosecutors also will make a decision soon about whether to try 
Wofford and Kennedy together. Wofford's arraignment is Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Kennedy was affiliated with white supremacists. His alleged role in 
the shooting also is being investigated as a possible hate crime. Kennedy was 
scheduled to enter a plea in the case Friday, but the arraignment was postponed 
until Oct. 21.

AS O.J. MASKS SELL BIG, SOME JUST CAN'T DISGUISE DISGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it bad taste or just plain gross, but one of the hottest-selling 
Halloween items in the country is a mask bearing the likeness of murder suspect 
O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragztop-Vintage, a costume shop on Commonwealth Avenue here, received its 
first shipment earlier this week and promptly sold out, said store manager 
Victor Pahl, who noted Friday that a fresh order of the vinyl masks -- which go 
for $20 each -- is again selling fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, a seasonal costume shop called The Halloween Warehouse has 
back-ordered another brand of Simpson masks, of which owner Bill Harold expects 
to sell more than 100 priced at $49 each. Harold said "the O.J. mask" is a big 
seller throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the attempt by merchants here and elsewhere to capitalize on a pair of the 
country's most notorious homicides goes beyond even the mask, which alone is 
enough to offend sociologists and others who see the trend as a disturbing 
aspect of American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reminds me of people cheering O.J. from the overpasses during his 
infamous Friday night drive," said Gordon Clanton, a sociologist at San Diego 
State University. "As society becomes less and less clear about right and 
wrong, people are more swept up into entertainment generally. And these days, 
people live through entertainment in a powerful way." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the Simpson case as entertainment appears to be turning up in a 
full line of Halloween gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Step In Time, a costume shop in Laguna Niguel, is planning to rent 
black-and-white prison shirts with Simpson's No. 32 -- the football great's 
jersey number -- emblazoned on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had calls about blond 'Nicole wigs' (a reference to Simpson's ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson), dark makeup, Afro wigs, big butcher knives and, of 
course, the O.J. mask," said Dena Teeter, the manager of Step In Time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even trick-or-treaters overseas appear to be clamoring for the O.J. line. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman came in this week wanting to send a bunch of this stuff to Japan, 
because all her Japanese friends wanted it," Teeter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ragztop in Fullerton, like stores throughout the country, is also selling 
jerseys similar to the kind Simpson wore with the USC Trojans and the Buffalo 
Bills -- only these are splattered with fake blood, and for legal reasons bear 
No. 69 instead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teeter at Step In Time said her store goes even further than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody with blond hair wants to do Nicole, we're also selling prosthetic 
slit throats," Teeter said, noting that such items were available in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold, the San Diego outfitter, said blond "Nicole wigs" are "hot sellers" in 
tandem with the O.J. mask, and that both are being bought by adult couples to 
wear at Halloween parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rental Boutique in Santa Ana is selling a facsimile of Simpson's USC 
jersey, bearing not only fake blood but also a Hertz Rent-a-Car agreement 
printed on the shirt. Simpson formerly worked as a celebrity spokesman for 
Hertz in its TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also ordered plenty of Afro wigs," Vicki Gaon, the store manager, said. 
"And we're selling blond wigs as well. In my opinion, it's all in really bad 
taste, but I had to get in on it because everyone else is." 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants agree with the first part of Gaon's statement -- it's in such 
bad taste that they vehemently refuse to take part, profits be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Costumes Galore, a costume shop in Orange, and who asked not 
to be quoted by name, said her store had received "tons of calls about O.J. 
paraphernalia, but we thought it was just too tacky. In fact, we think it's in 
awfully poor taste." 
</P>
<P>
 But still other merchants admit to being envious. They tried to get the O.J. 
mask and couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had plenty of customers who were interested, so we inquired to see if they 
were available," said Astrid Hickey, the owner of Astrid's Costume Attic in 
Buena Park. "Do you know where we can get them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pahl, who sells the Simpson mask at Ragztop, said that only men appear 
interested. He sold one to a man in his late 50s but most of the others to men 
in their early 20s. He wasn't sure of the exact number sold but said "more than 
a dozen, and we just got them in. Besides, it's still very early in the 
Halloween season. We expect to completely sell out, meaning dozens more." 
</P>
<P>
 One manufacturer of the masks is Cesar Inc. of New York City. Susann Eaton, 
the president of the company, said that she had not originally intended the 
mask to be sold as O.J. Simpson's likeness, "although I'm now aware that 
thousands of them are being sold as exactly that -- but that's the seller's 
choice, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a mask of a generic African-American male," Eaton said. "We know that 
thousands of these are selling as O.J., but we never intended it to be O.J. 
What are you going to do? People are funny. When something is in the news, they 
go a little bit crazy. They can use the mask for what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton noted that "plenty of other companies" -- which she declined to name -- 
are manufacturing Simpson masks and selling them as exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 Clanton, the San Diego State sociologist, said the trend of making money off 
the Simpson case may be evidence of deeper, darker, more disturbing truths 
about American culture, truths that should concern citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Events like this tend to bring out the worst in us -- that which is marginal 
in all of us," Clanton said. "In this case, there's a kind of general erosion 
of morality, of ethics. As social life becomes increasingly less substantive, 
then entertainment steps in to fill the space.  
</P>
<P>
 "The general erosion of morality contributes to a further blurring of the line 
between entertainment and reality and between entertainment and moral 
reflection, which we don't do much of anymore. The closest we get to it is to 
talk about whether O.J. did it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Clanton said, those offended by the selling of such 
merchandise "run the risk of going too far, because it's the nature of 
Halloween. Halloween is an odd holiday to have kept, but its social usefulness 
is in there somewhere, to provide an outlet for the dark, the scary, the 
macabre -- and even that in the popular culture that is difficult to grasp and 
understand, like the O.J. case." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard McGrane, a sociologist at Chapman University in Orange, agreed with 
Clanton's assessment, saying the wearing of such costumes is a non-threatening 
way to explore "the mind-boggling tragedy of it all, the Jekyll and Hyde 
aspects of it. . . . And besides, we're just inundated with it in the media. In 
some sense, it's the perfect weirdly psychological taboo place to role-play for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it is for the people buying it," McGrane said. "For the people 
selling it, well, it's something else entirely. They had a lucky hit and now 
they're out to make as much as they possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Sauer, the owner of Ragztop in Fullerton, said she considered not 
carrying the Simpson line but opted for commerce rather than caution. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pahl, her partner, put it, "We have Bill Clinton masks, too, you know, but 
haven't sold a one of those. We also have Bush, Nixon and JFK, but O.J. 
outsells all of them put together, and then some. It's the hottest thing going, 
man. It may make the difference in us having a successful Halloween."

CITYSCAPES / PAUL LIEBERMAN: 'WE WANTED THE PICTURE TO LOOK LIKE A 
CROSS-SECTION OF LOS ANGELES, NOT A DOWNTOWN CORPORATE OUTING.'; FROM CORPORATE 
INTO COOL: ARTIST GETS A LESSON IN L.A. STYLE

 This was one picture that was supposed to be worth not merely a thousand 
words, but $135,000 -- the estimated yearly price of a "luxury suite" at a new 
sports arena proposed for Downtown Los Angeles. The picture -- an artist's 
conceptual drawing, actually -- was commissioned by the developers to show the 
city's fat cats the spiffy private club that would be at their disposal if they 
leased one of the 162 suites that will ring the arena along the Harbor Freeway, 
if it comes to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the drawing came back from the artist, the developers couldn't help 
but have a good laugh. "We said to ourselves, 'What's wrong with this picture?' 
" recalled John H. Semcken III, the marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was not "The Club" itself, as depicted in the drawing. As ordered, 
it was the epitome of glitz, with a cavernous bar and glass walls overlooking 
the Downtown skyline on one side, the basketball court -- or hockey rink -- on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people. The PEOPLE! That was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, you see, was this guy from Chicago, Gilbert Gorski, an 
architectural illustrator renowned for his renderings of everything from 
high-rises to stadiums. When it came time to paint in the bodies in that club, 
Gorski thought naturally of his own experience as a hockey fan in the Windy 
City, where the business elite fill the high-end seats and where, he explained 
later, with a touch of apology, "people get dressed up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You'll see women wearing minks, furs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorski knew enough not to put minks in sunny and animal-friendly Southern 
California. So he sketched the few women in his crowd with the tailored shirts 
and blouses befitting the business set. Around them, in greater abundance, were 
shorthaired white gents in suits and ties. A few in bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gorski shipped the drawing West, figuring his clients would appreciate 
the "nuances of the architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "We sent it back," Semcken said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's no secret that image is at the heart of sales -- and municipal identity. 
Los Angeles has played with a few over the decades, from Raymond Chandler noir 
to surfer land to would-be ethnic melting pot. But the image with legs, as they 
say, is Hollywood hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that has not stopped poor old Downtown L.A. (where gents actually do 
wear ties to work) from fighting for its own image in recent years, and the 
Establishment there has touted one in particular: Business Capital of the 
Pacific Rim. But that pitch has not quite hit the image strike zone, as Semcken 
and his partners learned while struggling to develop a $1-billion international 
office complex on their property along the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking at it any longer as hey, this is the capital of the Pacific 
Rim," he confided the other day. "It's been that for five years and we still 
don't have anything built. That's why we changed the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby office complex, hello sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's why we don't want people to think, 'This is Downtown.' We want 
them to think, 'This is L.A.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Artist's Conception II arrived promptly in the return mail from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Gorski had sketched in more people. The scene was busier now -- 
it looked like a true crowd. And a different crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 On the floor of "The Club" this time were funky dudes in beards and ponytails 
and open shirts. And blondes with cleavage. And black guys. And no bow ties -- 
except on the waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the original one may have conveyed the wrong message," Semcken said. 
"I'm not saying we don't want corporate people, but basically we wanted the 
picture to look like a cross-section of Los Angeles, not a Downtown corporate 
outing." 
</P>
<P>
 Arena proposals are hot in Downtown L.A. these days. The one on the Harbor 
Freeway is among several competing to lure the local pro basketball and hockey 
teams -- the Clippers, Kings and Lakers -- with promises of state-of-the art 
$200-million sports palaces. In each case, the developers speak of the need to 
bring Downtown to life after dark, in the process injecting more dollars into 
its hotels, restaurants and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 That means keeping some of the huge Downtown work force from fleeing by 6 p.m. 
-- but also convincing other parts of L.A. that the city's hub just might be a 
destination for entertainment other than the symphony or opera. Attracting the 
"outsiders" is especially important when it comes to filling the features that 
have become the financial mainstays of modern sports facilities, those luxury 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
 You can only fill so many of the glassed-in boxes from Downtown corporate 
headquarters and law firms. As everyone knows, the epitome of free-spending in 
L.A. is found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I asked (Gorski) to put some Hollywood character in there, like you see at 
basketball games here," Semcken said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I can see what I can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You have to look closely to see him among the miniature figures, but he's 
there, unmistakably, in Artist's Conception II. In the bar, in the front row, a 
bit right of center: this 50-plus fellow with a high forehead capped by a 
widow's peak, the rest of his black hair slicked back over his collar; and on 
his miniature face -- though it may take a magnifying glass to see it -- an 
evil grin straight out of "The Shining." 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't be L.A.'s No. 1 basketball fan, one Jack Nicholson, now could it?

LEGISLATORS SEEK DETAILED EXPLANATION OF UCLA QUAKE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprised state legislators asked UCLA officials Friday to provide a "very, 
very detailed" accounting of how damage estimates from the January earthquake 
have risen to $630 million, eclipsing even the toll at quake-shattered Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised damage estimate at the Westwood campus, made public two weeks ago, 
is nearly 30 times previous calculations of $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a flag from UCLA that suggested the original numbers . . . 
(were) way out of kilter," said Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los 
Angeles). "So I was frankly stunned at such a disparity." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA architect Charles Oakley, appearing at CSUN before the Assembly Committee 
on Higher Education, told Archie-Hudson that the new figures are based on 
recent engineering studies that have detected widespread damage and the need 
for major structural upgrades in the university's massive medical and health 
sciences complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting and rebuilding the 9,100-room complex would cost $500 million, 
officials say. Other repairs, including $38 million worth at historic Royce 
Hall, push the total to $630 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum far outstrips the expected quake toll at other colleges -- most 
notably CSUN, where the temblor cut a swath of destruction that will cost $350 
million to fix. A collapsed parking structure on the east side of the 
Northridge campus remains a vivid monument to the quake's destruction.  
</P>
<P>
 Damage at the UCLA medical complex, which remains open, is not so visible, 
Oakley said. But he said thorough inspections have revealed the extent of the 
problems at the site, where officials say at least seven buildings should 
receive immediate attention because they provide essential services. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff (R-Moreno Valley) told Oakley that a 
comprehensive account of how and when the damage was detected, and why the 
process has taken several months, will be vital if the university hopes to win 
disaster-relief funds from federal and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an enormous amount of money," Woodruff said. "Our window of 
opportunity to capture the attention of Congress and the (state) Legislature is 
going to close." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oakley said the first inkling that actual damage might exceed initial 
projections came as long ago as March, no public mention of a new estimate was 
made until two weeks ago, in an oral report by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young to 
the UC Board of Regents. In addition to the $630 million, Young also favored 
spending another $500 million to upgrade the medical complex, for a total of 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials expect to have a more exact price tag next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she did not directly question the validity of the revised figures, 
Archie-Hudson repeatedly asked Oakley why no warning was given or interim 
reports issued to legislators, who learned of the increased estimate "in the 
newspapers." She said such information could have provided valuable ammunition 
in the battle to pass Proposition 1A, the $2-billion earthquake-repair bond 
measure soundly defeated at the polls in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley said an aggregate figure has been hard to come by because engineers 
compiled separate reports for different parts of the university, including the 
medical complex, which includes more than a dozen buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, UCLA has received $1.5 million in federal and state aid for its 
recovery effort.

A LESSON IN LIFE; YOUTH-AT-RISK PROGRAM HELPS GET TRUANTS BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Catherine MacWillie is every misbehaving teen-ager's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, see those bangs," MacWillie says, pointing to 13-year-old Janet's 
steel-claw-like gang hairdo. "That's bad.  
</P>
<P>
 "See the shirt and the makeup under her eyes," she lectures, ordering the girl 
to stand up. "That's bad, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her T-shirt's too big. Her bangs should not be rolled. And she shouldn't wear 
those eyeliners."  
</P>
<P>
 MacWillie turns directly to the culprit, who has been yelling at her mother, 
running away from home and ditching school to hang out with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet, you've been bad," MacWillie tells her. "I'm going to assign you 100 
hours of community service." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, sitting in a detective's cell-like interview room in the LAPD's 
Northeast Division police station, Officer MacWillie drops the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you still don't behave, I'm going to send you away from home. Home is a 
privilege. You're going to have to earn it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Janet was lucky. She got to stay home. A week later, MacWillie told 
Jose, 14, who ditched most of eighth grade last year, to go straight to Options 
House, a local shelter, or she would put him in jail for truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 MacWillie's actions may sound harsh, but parents and school administrators 
throughout the area call her a savior. Her Youth-at-Risk program, which she 
created and runs out of the Northeast station, tackles truancy with the 
combined power of parents, school and police. She cruises the patchwork of 
neighborhoods that make up the Northeast Division -- Highland Park, Silver 
Lake, Los Feliz, Eagle Rock, Glassell Park -- talking to parents and teachers 
and always on the lookout for children out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitty Dustin, vice principal at Eagle Rock Junior and Senior High School, says 
today's parents do not know what to do if their children defy them. That is 
where MacWillie "draws the line." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cathy's into direct action," Dustin said. "She takes the phone away. She 
takes away their $200 sneakers and gives them $2.99 sneakers. She helps kids 
understand about choices. With good choices, the consequences are positive. 
With bad choices, the consequences are negative." 
</P>
<P>
 In just two years, MacWillie has made her innovative, bootstrap approach a 
household name in the Northeast area, touching about 600 youths in 30 schools.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her Northeast station colleagues admire her for her dedication to the 
youngsters, but even more for rejecting what they term the Band-Aid approach to 
law enforcement and, instead, attacking the source of juvenile crime on the 
family level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cathy's program is on the cutting edge of law enforcement," Lt. Raul Vega 
said. "She looks at the cause of the problems and reaches far beyond what law 
enforcement normally does." 
</P>
<P>
 While society decries the loss of traditional family values, supporters say, 
MacWillie's program tries hard to find them again.  
</P>
<P>
 Her reputation for success is apparent. Parents and teachers call her 24 hours 
a day. She and her team of 20 volunteers respond like a hospital emergency room 
staff. On any given day she is interviewing new cases, monitoring old ones, 
accepting walk-ins, taking phone calls from frantic parents, making referrals 
to counseling services, and soliciting community service and improvement reward 
possibilities from the business community.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are 300,000 youths on the streets every day in the LAPD (area) alone," 
she said. "The more children miss school, the more chances they have to join 
gangs. Everybody follows the same pattern. They miss school, run away from 
home, join gangs, do drugs and commit crimes."  
</P>
<P>
 One of the rewards for girls who show improvement is a make-over at a Beverly 
Hills hair salon, one of the many businesses that donate things to help 
MacWillie's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls go in looking like gang members and come out looking like the 
Catholic schoolgirls from the corner," MacWillie said. "If you change the way 
they look, you go half way to changing the way they feel and the way they 
think."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some question whether there is a way to straighten out youths without taking 
on their fashion identity. Staff members at El Centro del Pueblo, an Echo Park 
community center that also works with problem youths, say they do not care how 
youths dress. They say they concentrate on instilling pride and self-worth. Yet 
they agree that MacWillie's overall program is humane, constructive and 
desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not work for everyone; some parents refuse MacWillie's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria's mother wants her out of the program. She is giving her permission to 
marry an older boy who police suspect has gang ties. "She's 16, pregnant and 
has no credits after ninth grade," MacWillie said with disappointment. "She'll 
be lucky if she becomes a housewife." 
</P>
<P>
 But MacWillie is inspired by the young lives that have changed for the better. 
Ruthie McDaniel, 18, says she was a runaway, but with MacWillie's help she 
graduated from high school and is working as a waitress. "I told my mom if it 
wasn't for Officer MacWillie I'd be in jail or I'd be six feet under," McDaniel 
said. "I started going back to school. She gave me back my self-esteem." 
George, 15, is another success story.  
</P>
<P>
 MacWillie said the boy appeared to change after spending three weeks at a 
local shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to feel angry," the youth told MacWillie. "But this place took that 
anger out. I need to go to school if I really want to be something when I grow 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 MacWillie refuses to take all the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We help parents work with the school, and the school to work with the police. 
Everyone -- the child, the parent, the police and the school -- works together 
in a circle. So you no longer have the parent saying, 'Police, what are you 
doing to correct the problem?' . . . it's everybody working together to solve 
the problem."

CITY OKS DEMOTION, RAISE FOR POLICE AIDE; GOVERNMENT: DEAL BETWEEN CHIEF 
WILLIAMS AND ASSISTANT CHIEF PARKS IS AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO AVOID A LAWSUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an agreement likely to stoke controversy surrounding the top brass at the 
Los Angeles Police Department, the City Council on Friday approved a deal that 
will give Assistant Police Chief Bernard Parks a $15,000 raise while he is 
demoted. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual bargain was struck in an apparent attempt to avoid a threatened 
lawsuit by Parks that could have proved costly to the city and could have cast 
the Police Department in a harsh glare at a time when it is being 
second-guessed in any number of areas, including its handling of the O.J. 
Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, a 29-year veteran, was earning about $128,000 a year as an assistant 
chief. Under the deal approved Friday, his annual salary will increase to about 
$143,000, but he will assume the duties of a deputy chief. The demotion is 
effective Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams, who initiated the agreement, defended the raise and 
the demotion, saying an accommodation was necessary to move the department 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe a lawsuit would rip this organization inside-out, and it is more 
important to put this issue to rest," Williams said during a news conference at 
Parker Center, the Downtown police headquarters. "The Police Department is 
being blasted for many things, including the O.J. Simpson case, and the last 
thing we need is another reason to attack us." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also said the dispute was becoming increasingly politicized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were camps in City Hall, camps within the LAPD, camps in Sacramento and 
Washington, D.C.," he said. "It was not good for the community or the 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 But he sought to downplay suggestions that he was pressured into an agreement 
he opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in City Hall or in any other office told the chief what to do or 
pulled strings," he said. "If that had happened, I wouldn't be standing here as 
police chief." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was reached in mediation sessions between Parks and Williams, 
who in September had announced that he had lost confidence in his 
second-in-command and would demote him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Williams had come under heavy criticism for his handling of the 
demotion and was being pressured by several City Council members to reach some 
accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief initially resisted, insisting that he would not knuckle under to 
"political tampering." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, according to city officials, subsequently decided that such an 
agreement might end what had become an increasingly bitter dispute that was 
ballooning beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was uncertain whether Parks and the chief would be able to lay aside 
their rancor and work together. Parks was out of town and could not be reached 
for comment. Williams said Parks would work out of the chief's office, but the 
chief would not specify duties. 
</P>
<P>
 One council member said the agreement may provoke resentment in the department 
and hamper other department officials who want to make personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone knows that all you have to do is bring a lawsuit to get what you 
want, then that's what everyone will do," said Councilman Joel Wachs, who with 
Councilwoman Laura Chick voted against the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs added: "If there are deep-seated, underlying problems that gave rise to 
this, they will not go away and this will not solve the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But council President John Ferraro said a settlement was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't view it as a bribe, it's a settlement," he said. "If he had filed a 
lawsuit, it would have been very difficult to defend, and I feel confident he 
would have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' attorney Skip Miller said his client is pleased that the dispute was 
solved "amicably and is looking forward to getting back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he wants is to go about his business as an officer of the Police 
Department," Miller said. "He was not looking for any confrontation or lawsuit. 
He's a team player and a highly respected officer."

BOXER IS ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGE; CRIME: POLICE SAY FORMER AMATEUR HEAVYWEIGHT 
CHAMPION JOHN BRAY WAS FOUND WITH SEVEN POUNDS OF MARIJUANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 John Bray, a former national amateur heavyweight boxing champion, was arrested 
here Friday on suspicion of possessing a seven-pound bag of marijuana, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray, 24, was taken into custody around 4:30 p.m. outside a gas station at 
Winnetka Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, where he allegedly had confessed to 
firing a gun in the parking lot of a nearby hotel just moments earlier, Officer 
Carole Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray was sweating profusely when police questioned him at the scene, and when 
officers later returned to the parking lot they discovered a blue bag 
containing the marijuana, Hughes said. Bray was booked on suspicion of 
possession of marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray told police that he had recently signed on with boxing promoter Don King 
and that he had a fight scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the national amateur title in 1991, Bray turned professional in 
1992 and moved to Florida, where he trained at the Miami gym of well-known ring 
trainer Angelo Dundee, who has trained such fighting greats as Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray told the Times in a 1991 interview that he had spent the previous two 
years as an apprentice private investigator in Los Angeles. The same year, 
Bray, a graduate of Van Nuys High School, accidentally shot himself in the 
mouth with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in a Van Nuys automotive shop owned by a friend. Bray 
had purchased the 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun on his 21st birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 As he was cleaning the gun, he held the slide action open and looked down the 
barrel, according to police. The slide action slipped from his hand and as it 
snapped shut, Bray flinched and pulled the trigger. The gun, which Bray said he 
was certain was unloaded, went off. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Bray, who is of Anglo and Latino heritage, was the favorite to 
represent the United States in the Barcelona Olympics and in an interview that 
year, he described racism on the U.S. boxing team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't even a subtle thing," Bray said in the interview. "It's right there 
for anyone to see. The team is filled with resentment and racism, and I'm just 
sick of it. I get racist stuff all day when I train with my own team. From the 
other fighters, even from the coaches of the team. I'm the only white guy on 
the team and all I hear all day long is 'Hey, honky. Hey, white boy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad, but that's the way it is. . . . You can only ignore it for so long. 
I've kept this to myself for a few years. That's long enough," he said.

SIMPSON ATTORNEYS ASK FOR POLICE HAIR SAMPLES; TRIAL: REQUEST MADE OF 
DETECTIVES ANGERS OFFICERS. DEFENSE HOPES TO SHOW EVIDENCE WAS MISHANDLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to bolster their argument that police officers may have mishandled or 
planted evidence in the O.J. Simpson murder case, Simpson's attorneys have 
asked four detectives to supply hair samples so they can compare them to a hair 
from a bloody glove found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources close to the case, the request infuriated the officers, 
particularly when they learned that prosecutors had not objected to it. The 
defense has previously sought and been granted photographs of the shoes that 
officers wore on the night of the murders in order to compare them to bloody 
shoe prints leading away from the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both requests grow out of the Simpson team's efforts to establish that police 
officers investigating the murders botched the probe, compromising key 
scientific evidence. The defense attorneys have also suggested that one 
detective, Mark Fuhrman, may have planted a glove at Simpson's home, a 
suggestion that Fuhrman's attorney has vehemently denied and that police 
officials say would have been virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the latest attack on their investigation and by their belief that 
prosecutors failed to stand up for them, detectives took their complaint to the 
Los Angeles Police Protective League. One of them, Detective Ronald Phillips, 
went even further, consulting with attorney Darryl Mounger, a former police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions with Mounger and league representatives were held in private, 
but some details were relayed to Protective League delegates at a meeting this 
week. At that meeting, league Director Cliff Ruff briefed delegates on the 
defense request and the ensuing controversy, according to sources who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement sources, the detectives met Sept. 29 and 
grudgingly decided to comply with the defense request -- if only to prevent the 
Simpson team from later making an issue out of their refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, sources said, the four detectives -- Phillips, Fuhrman, Philip L. 
Vannatter and Tom Lange -- will supply hair samples so defense investigators 
can compare them with a single Caucasian hair found on a glove discovered lying 
near the feet of the two bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that the murderer wore that glove -- as well as a matching 
one found outside Simpson's Brentwood home two miles away. Analysis done so far 
on the hair suggests that it did not come from Simpson or from either victim, 
the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to comment on evidence in the case, Simpson attorney 
Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. confirmed Friday that defense lawyers are seeking hair 
samples from the four white detectives and added that they also hope to secure 
a sample from an African American officer who records show was among the police 
at the murder scene June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the case have said that a hair found on Goldman's body has 
been microscopically analyzed, and that investigators concluded that it came 
from a black person. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding could help link Simpson to the murder scene, but if the hair 
matched the police officer's, that could defuse its value as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a reasonable request," Cochran said of asking the policemen for hair 
samples. "That's why the district attorney's office went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Monica city attorney's office is considering whether to file 
misdemeanor theft charges against a clerk who removed Nicole Simpson's medical 
files from Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center and provided them to a curious 
relative of the clerk, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The files have been returned to the hospital after Santa Monica police 
detectives hunted them down at the Playa del Rey home of the relative, who 
"denied making copies of the files and indicated that his sole reason for 
wanting the files was curiosity's sake," a police spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Cortrite, chief deputy of the criminal division, also said her office 
will probably make a decision by the middle of next week about what charges, if 
any, will be brought against the clerk and her relative. Police declined to 
release the names because neither was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking at is the possibility of theft-related charges -- petty 
theft, embezzlement or receiving stolen property," Cortrite said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office subpoenaed the medical 
records for use in its double murder case against the football great but 
discovered that they were missing and asked Santa Monica police to investigate 
Sept. 27, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The empty file folder which contained Nicole Brown Simpson's medical records 
was found in a clerk's file cabinet by a hospital supervisor," the spokesman 
said. "The clerk was subsequently interviewed by detectives and admitted to 
taking the files." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the clerk brought officers to where her relative worked, 
and the family member immediately led police to his house, where the files were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Braun, a hospital spokesman, said late Friday that the medical center 
"does not tolerate any breach of patient confidentiality. In this, we contacted 
the police, cooperated fully with the investigation and immediately terminated 
the employee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every employee has a critical responsibility to protect patient 
confidentiality. We stress that to them when they are hired and throughout 
their period of employment," he said. "It is rarely a problem. However, if any 
employee does breach patient confidentiality, they are subject to severe 
disciplinary action, including termination." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said the files have been turned over to the district attorney's office, 
and the hospital has retained a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A man who was jailed because he refused to testify before a grand jury 
investigating O.J. Simpson's best friend, Al Cowlings, was ordered released 
Friday after his behavior was characterized as "illogical and irrational." 
</P>
<P>
 John Dunton, 32, was released from the infirmary building of the Men's Central 
Jail, where he had been held for a month, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had subpoenaed Dunton to testify before the grand jury after he 
reportedly gave the prosecutors secondhand information about the Simpson case. 
Dunton's lawyers have contended that their client never intended for his talks 
with prosecutors to be made public and that when he received a subpoena, he 
felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunton refused to testify before the grand jury, the lawyers said, because he 
feared retaliation from people other than Simpson or Cowlings. Dunton has not 
said from whom he feared such retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Zajec told Superior Court Judge 
J. Stephen Czuleger that his office had independently tried to corroborate the 
information Dunton provided and was unable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * A form was distributed to news organizations Friday asking members of the 
press to pledge not to broadcast an audio feed that Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito will allow to be used during the upcoming phase of jury selection. Any 
journalist who violated that pledge could be held in contempt, according to the 
form, which asks reporters to sign on behalf of their news organizations. Court 
representatives were not available to answer questions about the forms, which 
were distributed by officials of the Radio Television News Assn. and City News 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has attempted to rein in coverage of the case for weeks, threatening to 
pull the plug on television coverage altogether. And, responding to an article 
unrelated to the Simpson case, Ito on Sept. 30 sent a letter to the Los Angeles 
Daily Journal complaining about the use of anonymous sources, which he called 
the "legal world's equivalent of a drive-by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 That letter was distributed to his colleagues on the bench, and in an 
accompanying cover letter Ito advised that judges not grant interviews to the 
paper for its daily profiles until it agrees to stop using anonymous sources.

POLICE PROBE OF PLAY WILL BE SOUGHT; THEATER: PROSECUTOR WILL ASK DETECTIVES TO 
FIND OUT IF PROMOTER'S ADS FOR STAGING OF 'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' ARE TRUTHFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A city prosecutor said Friday she would ask police to check out a staging of 
"A Christmas Carol" at the Raymond Theatre in Pasadena whose producer has a 
history of consumer-fraud convictions, including a bogus theatrical promotion 
in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Ruth Kwan said that because of Kevin Von Feldt's record of 
aborted efforts and disappointed ticket buyers, "We will certainly closely 
scrutinize his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan, who heads the consumer protection division of the city attorney's 
office, said she would ask Los Angeles police detectives to determine whether 
Von Feldt's newspaper advertisements for the Nov. 15-20 show -- which tout such 
stars as Shirley Jones, Patrick McGoohan, Brian Keith and Michael Tucker -- 
have been truthful. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt has been advertising $20-$35 tickets for the holiday classic, though 
he has yet to secure a crucial Actors' Equity Assn. contract, the union's 
director said this week. Meanwhile, other sources said Friday he is using 
backdrops, props and a taped narration by Sir John Gielgud that he never fully 
paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 The eminent British actor is owed 40,000 pounds (about $60,000) for a tape 
recording made in 1992 for a Von Feldt production that failed before it could 
open at the Scottish Rite Temple in West Los Angeles, said Gielgud's New York 
attorney, J. Stephen Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper ads and promotional flyers for the Pasadena run of the play -- which 
is supposed to launch an eight-city tour -- have touted "narration by Sir John 
Gielgud" while omitting the fact that it is taped. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's used it to raise money, and he's certainly advertised in Sir John's 
name," said Sheppard. He said he did not know about the current effort, but did 
know that Von Feldt used Gielgud's tape without permission to promote a failed 
"Christmas Carol" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir John Gielgud is probably the single greatest English-speaking actor in 
the world, and he went to a recording studio in London and took whatever amount 
of time it took to read this narration, and he just wants to be paid," said 
Sheppard, adding that the tape lent the play "not only the extraordinary 
quality of his voice and talents as an actor but the cachet of having a 
narration by Sir John Gielgud." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Gielgud's claim, Von Feldt said Friday, "Well, that's in dispute." 
He refused to comment further or take more questions and hung up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Another creditor, meanwhile, said that under the terms of a judgment won 
against Von Feldt last year in Los Angeles Superior Court, the creditor is owed 
$50,000 for stage sets built in 1992. The same judgment awarded more than 
$200,000 to one of Von Feldt's backers on that production. 
</P>
<P>
 Set builder Marc Saget of Burbank also said he finally won possession of the 
sets after suing Von Feldt, and he questioned how "A Christmas Carol" could 
open in Pasadena next month without them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the sets in a storage area he's not privy to," Saget said, adding that 
Von Feldt also had no right to the painted backdrops he had shown a reporter at 
the Raymond Theatre this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt, 44, was convicted in 1991 of one count of untrue and misleading 
advertising after the city attorney's office accused him of promoting four 
Broadway hits at North Hollywood's fading El Portal Theatre without first 
securing contracts with Actors' Equity or his stars, some of whom complained 
about the use of their names. 
</P>
<P>
 He was placed on three years probation, fined more than $1,700 and ordered to 
pay restitution to ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he pleaded no contest to 10 counts of untrue and misleading 
advertising for two ticket-selling scams -- an airline with no planes and a 
movie promotion without films. He was sentenced to a year in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to produce his adaptation of "A Christmas Carol," part of which he 
wrote behind bars, failed in 1989, 1992 and 1993.

UCLA QUAKE SURPRISE; REBUILDING: STATE PANEL ASKS SCHOOL TO EXPLAIN HOW 
ESTIMATE FOR REPAIRS INCREASED FROM $22 MILLION TO $630 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprised state lawmakers Friday asked UCLA officials to provide a "very, very 
detailed" accounting of how damage estimates from the January temblor have 
risen to $630 million, eclipsing even the toll at earthquake-shattered Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised damage estimate at the Westwood campus, first made public two 
weeks ago, is nearly 30 times previous calculations of $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a flag from UCLA that suggested the original numbers . . . 
(were) way out of kilter," Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los 
Angeles) said. "So I was frankly stunned at such a disparity." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA architect Charles Oakley, appearing at CSUN before the Assembly committee 
on higher education, told Archie-Hudson that the new figures are based on 
recent engineering studies that have detected widespread damage and the need 
for "major structural upgrades" in the university's massive medical and health 
sciences complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting and rebuilding the 9,100-room complex would alone cost $500 
million, officials say. Other repairs, including $38 million worth at historic 
Royce Hall, push the total to $630 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum far outstrips the expected quake toll at other local higher-education 
institutions, most notably CSUN, where the temblor cut a swath of destruction 
that will cost $350 million to fix. A collapsed parking structure on the east 
side of campus there remains a vivid monument to the quake's fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage at the UCLA medical complex, which remains open, is not so visible, 
Oakley said. Only thorough inspections have uncovered the extent of the problem 
at the site, where officials say at least seven buildings should receive 
immediate attention because they provide essential services. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff (R-Moreno Valley) told Oakley that a 
comprehensive account of how and when the damage was detected, and why the 
process has taken several months, will be vital if the university hopes to win 
disaster-relief funds from federal and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an enormous amount of money," Woodruff said. "Our window of 
opportunity to capture the attention of Congress and the (state) Legislature is 
going to close." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Oakley said the first inkling that actual damage might exceed initial 
projections came as long ago as March, no public mention of a new estimate was 
made until two weeks ago, in an oral report by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young to 
the UC Board of Regents. In addition to the $630 million, Young favored 
spending another $500 million to upgrade the medical complex, for a total of 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to have a more exact price tag next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she did not directly question the validity of the revised figures, 
Archie-Hudson repeatedly asked Oakley why no warning was given or interim 
reports issued to lawmakers, who first learned of the increased estimate "in 
the newspapers." She said such information could have provided valuable 
ammunition in the battle to pass Proposition 1A, the $2-billion 
earthquake-repair bond measure soundly defeated at the polls in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pushed UCLA very, very hard on the question of its damage. . . . Why is it 
that this is suddenly such a surprise?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley said an aggregate figure has been hard to come by as engineers compiled 
separate reports for different parts of the university, including the medical 
complex, which boasts more than a dozen buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, UCLA has received $1.5 million in federal and state aid for its 
recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending Friday's hearing were officials from CSUN, Santa Monica College 
and Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson told the panel that her university's fall 
enrollment dropped by 10% from last year, with about 7% attributable to the 
earthquake. Although the campus recovery process is well under way, Wilson said 
she remains concerned whether California will continue to have the resources to 
supplement federal disaster funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has so far received about $143 million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-WIFE OF 
TV STAR OFFERS APOLOGY FOR ACCUSATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ex-wife of actor Richard Mulligan publicly apologized for lying in a 
supermarket tabloid article claiming she was battered by the "Empty Nest" TV 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statements were false, untrue and without foundation whatsoever," Serina 
Robinson said in a written apology to Mulligan. The apology was circulated to 
the media by Sandy Rice, Mulligan's publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup of the couple's nine-month marriage last year, Robinson 
claimed in National Enquirer articles that Mulligan was violent with her during 
destructive rages. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan filed a defamation suit against his ex-wife.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; LAW ALLOWS 
RESIDENTS TO DECIDE USE FOR BASE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro residents will be able to decide the future use of 27 acres of 
surplus Navy housing in their community under new legislation passed by 
Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law -- the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless 
Assistance Act of 1994 -- allows communities to decide how property associated 
with closing military bases should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 It blocks homeless organizations from opening shelters and programs on 
military bases by exempting the bases from the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless 
Assistance Act of 1987. Homeless organizations would no longer get first 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Pedro, outraged residents have been fighting federal approval given to 
South-Central Los Angeles-based Turner's Technical Institute Inc. to run a 
shelter for up to 880 people in the Navy housing on Taper Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's approval was revoked last month because the housing was found to be 
too close to aviation fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D.-Calif.), the new law will affect other 
California communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, 22 major bases have been slated for closure or realignment under 
the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. Applications by homeless groups 
to use the bases under the McKinney Act have been received for about 13 of the 
bases.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; WORKER DIES IN FALL FROM ROOF OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A construction worker apparently fell to his death Friday morning while 
repairing the chimney of a Studio City home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cisneros, 24, of Los Angeles had suffered what appeared to be severe neck 
injuries when he was discovered in the yard of a home in the 3700 block of 
Vantage Avenue, fire officials said.Police were investigating the death as an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor spotted Cisneros' body about 9:30 a.m. and dialed paramedics, said 
Detective Mark Aragon of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon said Cisneros was employed by an independent contractor and appeared to 
have been working alone when he fell. He had apparently been clearing debris 
from the roof of the house, which was having its chimney repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy has tentatively been scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rice, a spokesman for Cal/OSHA, the state's industrial-safety agency, 
said his agency plans to investigate the death to determine how it occurred and 
whether state laws or regulations were violated. JULIE TAMAKI

<P>
 The big top will rise above Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys today and 
the acrobats, elephants and clowns will come marching in. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Circus has come to town and will offer three performances today, the 
first beginning at 11 a.m., and another three performances Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is the fourth annual circus sponsored by the hospital, and a way of 
"saying thanks to the community," said Valley Presbyterian spokeswoman Janna 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by the L.A. Foundation of Circus Arts and the city's Cultural 
Affairs Department, the 90-minute shows will run at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the requisite old-fashioned circus performances, other events 
at the hospital -- 15107 Vanowen St. -- will include a circus clown workshop 
for children before each show, a classic car display and a bicycle safety 
course on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $4 per person, $2 for those over 55, and children under 2 get in 
free. Tickets can be purchased at the gate before each show or in advance from 
the hospital's first-floor gift shop. ERIC SLATER

<P>
 The environmental group TreePeople is holding its annual fund-raiser, "Evening 
Under the Harvest Moon," at its Coldwater Canyon Park headquarters tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Featured in the $250-a-person fund-raiser will be a 10-minute film by David 
Zucker and Marshall Herskovitz about the work of the organization.Zucker was a 
producer of "Naked Gun," "Airplane" and other comedy movies, and Herskovitz was 
a creator of the television series "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 The film was still being edited as of Friday, said TreePeople spokesman Joel 
Brokaw, who added that it included some "lightness" to the material. It is 
meant to give a broader view of what TreePeople is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just planting trees," Brokaw said, adding that they wanted to 
get across the message that people can do a lot to help in their own 
neighborhood. "What TreePeople is about is getting young people and adults 
involved in making that personal difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets may be purchased at the door or by calling (310) 393-5600. Parking is 
available at Harvard-Westlake High School with shuttle service to the event. ED

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AIRPORT INITIATIVE STIRS HEATED DEBATE

<P>
 With a month to go before election day, opponents and backers of a commercial 
airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station traded charges Friday during a 
forum taped at the KOCE-TV studios in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum on Measure A, a countywide initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot that 
seeks a General Plan amendment to build an airport at El Toro, was supposed to 
last a half hour. But the four panelists kept the heated exchange going after 
the cameras were turned off, accusing one another of distorting the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman and developer George Argyros and Garden Grove City Councilman Mark 
Leyes spoke in favor of Measure A. Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow and 
William Kogerman, co-chairman of Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, spoke 
against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros and Leyes said that converting El Toro into a commercial airport after 
the military pulls out at the end of the decade would create thousands of jobs 
and make Orange County more competitive in the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful opportunity. This is a chance to decide on the future," 
Argyros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow and Kogerman strongly disagreed, saying it would cost billions of tax 
dollars to build an air cargo facility at El Toro. Kogerman said passage of 
Measure A would "short-circuit" the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a county 
panel already working to craft a redevelopment plan for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "The viability of the whole issue has to be considered through the (county 
planning) process," Kogerman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Leyes countered that the planning authority is "biased" in favor of South 
County cities that oppose an airport because of noise, traffic and pollution 
concerns. He said Measure A gives all voters a chance to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be broadcast on KOCE-TV Oct. 26 at 6:30 p.m. and Oct. 27 at 10 
p.m. SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; $196,000 AWARDED, WILL HELP PLAN WAYS TO FIGHT 
GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim and The Cambodian Family, a nonprofit social service 
organization in Santa Ana, were awarded a total of $196,000 in federal grants 
to plan methods of fighting gangs and youth violence, the Department of Health 
and Human Services announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were among just 21 recipients across the U.S. that shared $2 million 
in federal money handed out to cities, schools and community groups by HHS 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to identify the developmental needs of children ages 9 
to 12 who are vulnerable to becoming gang members and to develop a five-year 
plan of action to help the children and their families resist gang involvement, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambodian Family, which was formed in 1982 to help residents of Santa 
Ana's crime-plagued Minnie Street neighborhood, will receive $100,000. The 
Anaheim city government will receive more than $96,000 and will focus its 
efforts on the following neighborhoods: Jeffrey/Lynne, Avon/Dakota, Guinida 
Lane and Haster/Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Swaim, superintendent of Community Services for Anaheim, said Friday the 
city's plan will go beyond gang sweeps and neighborhood rehabilitation. 
Instead, it will focus on trying to prevent kids from becoming involved in 
gangs in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to spend a few resources up front on prevention rather than 
spending money after the fact to arrest and incarcerate these kids," Swaim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In developing the plan, city staff -- who will be hired with the grant money 
-- will spend part of the next year in the neighborhoods to receive advice at 
public forums from residents, apartment owners, school staff, religious leaders 
and officials of nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaim said the research will focus on children with low self-esteem, peer 
pressure and problems in the home -- all "risk factors" that lead to gang 
involvement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help parents and families really protect their kids and rid them 
of some of these risk factors," Swaim said. "We think this really could be the 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambodian Family will take a similar approach in the Minnie Street 
neighborhood, where about 12,000 low-income people live in overcrowded 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to change the community so the kids can grow up in a safe and 
nonviolent way and have the opportunity to develop the positive sides of 
themselves," said Rifka Hirsch, the organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the plans are developed, they must be approved by the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services before they are funded. The groups could each receive 
as much as $750,000 annually for five years. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; STATE SAYS CHEERLEADER FEES ILLEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for the state Department of Education say that the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District broke the law by charging cheerleaders more than $1,000 
for uniforms, transportation and coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the mother of a former cheerleader, who is suing the district 
for requiring her daughter to pay to be on the squad, General Counsel Roger D. 
Wolfertz wrote that the fees were "not only incredibly stiff but totally 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Because extracurricular activities such as cheerleading are part of a school's 
educational program, he said, they must be offered to students for free under 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sympathetic with school districts trying to raise money, but the 
Supreme Court has spoken on this," Wolfertz said. "We have no way of changing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Newport-Mesa school district officials disputed that interpretation 
Friday, adding that they are well within their rights to charge fees. 
Furthermore, the state Department of Education has no jurisdiction in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That happens to be his opinion," said Spencer Covert, a Tustin attorney 
representing the district. "I don't agree that having a fund-raising process 
and encouraging the booster club and students to make a contribution is 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Covert said the district recently issued a handbook setting up new 
cheerleading guidelines that state no one should be denied a chance to join the 
squad because they are unable to pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed Sept. 8 in Orange County Superior Court, former cheerleader 
Heather Delaney alleges that the fees are sexually discriminatory because boys 
on athletic teams don't have to pay for their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that charge is groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are also a number of athletic programs offered for women where the 
district does pay for the uniforms," Covert said. "Also, we don't pay for 
football players' shoes or baseball mitts." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; OLDEST SCHOOL TO GET NEW CLASSROOM WING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City School District's oldest school will get a new start 
with about $3.7 million in improvements to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony will take place Monday at 3:30 p.m. for the new Mike 
Case Classroom Wing at the 60-year-old Ethel Dwyer Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32,000-square-foot wing will have 10 classrooms, including six science 
laboratories, a library and media center, a multipurpose room that seats 400 
students, and four food service lines to serve lunchtime meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Blonska, supervisor of construction for the district, said that the 
addition will enable the school to serve 300 more students. The school's 
enrollment currently is about 860. The addition also will accommodate the 
growing number of students who will come from new home construction in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Blonska said construction will take place during the school year with 
completion targeted for August.  
</P>
<P>
 The new wing is named after former science teacher Mike Case, who taught at 
the school for 30 years and retired in 1988. He died of cancer in April. DEBRA

 A shortage of flu vaccine has caused Saddleback Memorial Medical Center to 
postpone a flu clinic originally scheduled for today.A Saddleback spokeswoman 
said the county Health Care Agency was unable to provide the flu vaccine in 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of vaccine also prompted the Cypress Senior Citizens Center to postpone a 
flu shot clinic that was to take place on Thursday. The clinic will now be from 
9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Nov. 10.

 The Visiting Nurse Assn. of Orange County still has a sufficient supply of the

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; SOME NURSES OFFERED SEVERANCE AT ST. JUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first such action, St. Jude Medical Center is offering severance 
packages to dozens of nurses in its medical surgical units, the hospital 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees said the announcement came abruptly at a 7 a.m. staff meeting 
Thursday. The hospital's 52 licensed vocational nurses said they were told that 
they could either stay on as patient care technicians -- a lower job 
classification that pays less -- or accept the severance package and seek work 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was shocked," said Ruth Rundgren, a 22-year St. Jude employee who 
opted to take the package of one week's pay for each year of employment at the 
Fullerton hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring, which affects 52 nurses, mirrors changes at other 
health-care facilities across the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago there was a shortage of nurses in Southern California," said 
David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
"Today there is an oversupply." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the push by insurers to hold down medical costs, patients are 
spending less time in hospitals, Langness said, and that is reducing the need 
for health-care professionals in specialties such as nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization at St. Jude was not prompted by financial difficulty, said 
Doreen Dann, vice president of clinical services at St. Jude. The 
responsibilities of those leaving their jobs will be covered by increasing the 
hours of some of the hospital's registered nurses, she said. "We may even have 
to hire some registered nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by comparison to other hospitals in Orange County, St. Jude has had a 
high patient occupancy rate for the past year, with about 60% of its 347 beds 
filled. That compares to a countywide rate of 43.3%, according to the Hospital 
Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively high occupancy rates, however, do not make health-care facilities 
immune from the consolidation sweeping the industry, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even financially healthy hospitals are looking at their costs," said Marianne 
Harrison, a health care consultant with the Los Angeles accounting firm Coopers 
& Lybrand.HOPE HAMASHIGE

PROSECUTOR TO SEEK PROBE OF PLANNED 'CHRISTMAS CAROL'; ENTERTAINMENT: POLICE 
WILL BE ASKED TO DETERMINE IF ADS FOR STAR-STUDDED PASADENA PRODUCTION HAVE 
BEEN TRUTHFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 A Los Angeles city prosecutor said Friday that she will ask police to check 
out claims about a proposed Pasadena stage show by a man with a history of 
consumer fraud convictions, including one for promoting a bogus theatrical 
production in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Ruth Kwan said that because of Kevin Von Feldt's record of 
aborted efforts and disappointed ticket buyers, "We will certainly closely 
scrutinize his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan, who heads her office's consumer protection division, said she would ask 
Los Angeles police detectives to determine whether Von Feldt's newspaper ads 
for the Nov. 15-20 staging of "A Christmas Carol" at the Raymond Theater have 
been truthful. The ads tout stars Shirley Jones, Patrick McGoohan, Brian Keith 
and Michael Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt has been advertising $20 to $35 tickets for the holiday classic, 
although he has yet to secure a crucial Actors' Equity Assn. contract, the 
union's director said this week. Meanwhile, other sources said Friday that Von 
Feldt plans to use backdrops, props and a taped narration by Sir John Gielgud 
that he never fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 The eminent British actor is owed about $60,000 for a tape recording made in 
1992 for a Von Feldt production that failed before it could open at the 
Scottish Rite Temple in Los Angeles, said Gielgud's New York attorney, J. 
Stephen Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper ads and promotional flyers for the Pasadena run of the play -- which 
is supposed to launch an eight-city tour -- have touted "narration by Sir John 
Gielgud" while omitting the fact that it is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard said that he did not know about the current effort, but that Von 
Feldt used Gielgud's tape without permission to promote another failed 
"Christmas Carol" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the statement, Von Feldt said Friday, "Well, that's in dispute." 
He refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another creditor, meanwhile, said that under the terms of a judgment against 
Von Feldt last year in Los Angeles Superior Court, he is owed $50,000 for stage 
sets built in 1992. The same judgment awarded more than $200,000 to one of Von 
Feldt's backers on that production. 
</P>
<P>
 Set builder Marc Saget of Burbank said he finally won possession of the sets 
after suing Von Feldt, and he questioned how "A Christmas Carol" could open in 
Pasadena without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Feldt, 44, was convicted in 1991 of one count of untrue and misleading 
advertising after the Los Angeles city attorney's office accused him of 
promoting four Broadway hits at North Hollywood's fading El Portal Theatre 
without securing contracts with Actors' Equity or his stars. He received three 
years probation, was fined more than $1,700 and was ordered to pay restitution 
to ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he pleaded no contest to 10 counts of untrue and misleading 
advertising in two ticket-selling scams and was sentenced to a year in County 
Jail.

 The cleanest pet: We were chagrined to note that an article on fad products in 
Inc. magazine omitted the Hula-Hoop, which sent the hips of countless Americans 
into gyrations in 1958. Its creator, Wham-O of San Gabriel, sold 25 million 
hoops in three months.

<P>
 But the magazine did mention another California contribution, the Pet Rock, 
whose shelf life lasted from October, 1975, to February, 1976, during which

companion and why not? As creator Gary Dahl pointed out, it consumed no food, 
could be left alone on weekends and, of course, left no messes.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; GRANT TO CLINIC TO HELP INCREASE DENTAL SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the help of a First Interstate Bank grant, an additional 500 youngsters 
from low-income families will get dental services this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a $35,000 contribution to the Telfair PTA Health Center, a second 
dental chair has been added to the facility at Telfair Elementary School in 
Pacoima.There are now a total of three chairs in the PTSA clinic program, 
including one at an affiliated Canoga Park clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated money originally was to have gone toward a party for the 3,000 
volunteers that raised $60 million for the United Way of Greater Los Angeles. 
But when the January earthquake destroyed the San Fernando Dental Clinic and 
its equipment, the bank redirected the money to set up the chair at Telfair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima health center will now be able to offer 1,000 low-income youths 
enrolled in Los Angeles district schools low-cost or free dental care. Until 
recently, the clinic could only provide emergency dental care, said Rovert 
Taylor, manager of the district's health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the chairs, the money will go toward dental hygiene education 
for preschoolers and kindergarten students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to teach them preventive dental care. These are children who 
don't own a toothbrush," said Barbara Baker, president of the San Fernando 
Valley Dental Hygiene Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the programs Baker is offering is a course for parents on baby tooth 
decay. "Parents aren't supposed to put their babies to bed with a bottle of 
milk or sugar water," Baker said. She added that she has seen many cases of 
4-year-olds with rotten teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando branch of First Interstate will be raising additional funds 
to provide a television for the dental room at the clinic, according to manager 
Oscar Monteagudo. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MISSION MURAL DEDICATED AT MEDICAL CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 65-foot-long mural depicting the Carmel Mission was dedicated Friday by 
businessman Bert Boeckmann with a ceremonial assist from Daniel Ramos, the 
notorious ex-tagger known as Chaka before his recent conversion to a born-again 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful 12-foot-high mural that adorns the the side of Woodman Medical 
Clinic -- now renamed Carmel Mission Clinic -- is the work of Alfredo Diaz 
Flores. The project was supported by Boeckmann, owner-president of Galpin Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos and other youths unveiled the artwork by pulling a cover away from the 
mural located at 9068 Woodman Ave. south of Nordhoff Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores predicted that his depiction of the historic mission at Carmel will be 
safe from graffiti. "If it's a good piece of work, it will be respected," 
Flores said. Religious and historical murals are usually left alone by taggers 
in their own neighborhoods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Chaka," as Ramos is now sometimes called, had no role in painting, but he 
might help Flores in a future project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a chance to tutor Chaka and he gets good at it, there's no telling 
what might be accomplished," said Flores, 69, a retired grocer, pastor and 
veteran muralist. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeckmann, a prominent Republican and evangelical Christian member of Church 
on the Way, met Tuesday with the 22-year-old Ramos and his mentor, Pastor JoJo 
Sanchez of Lancaster. The ex-tagger enrolled in Youth Academy USA, Sanchez's 
isolated desert camp for errant young men, eight months ago and is being 
groomed for a ministry talking to inner-city youth and demonstrating a positive 
use of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "On future murals that Mr. Boeckmann may underwrite, he is very much 
considering having Chaka and youths from Youth Academy USA being involved in 
it," said Marybeth Baker, public relations director for Galpin. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mural is proposed for a wall at the Foothill Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, but approval must be obtained first from the city's 
Department of Cultural Affairs, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt strongly about making this a better place to live and work," 
said Boeckmann, who backed beautification projects as founder of Valley 
Cultural Foundation and as chairman of Operation Sparkle, which focused on 
graffiti and litter removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Marc Stretten of the Woodman Medical Clinic, who donated the paint and 
scaffolding used by Flores, said the finished product was "a touch of beauty to 
an underserved and neglected area." JOHN DART

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RECYCLING PROGRAM ACCEPTING MAGAZINES 
</P>

<P>
 Your old magazines may soon be coming back to you, in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation officials recently announced that residents 
citywide can now put out magazines alongside their yellow recycling bins for 
pickup.They ask that the magazines be tied into bundles or placed in a brown 
paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Sones, assistant director in charge of solid waste, said the 
participation rate so far has been high, even though the program has just 
gotten off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a flood right now," he said. "People have been saving their 
magazines and they finally have an outlet for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation workers began collecting magazines in the East Valley in 
mid-September and in the West Valley this week, according to Enrique Teves, 
spokesman for the bureau's recycling division. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine pickup is one more step in the bureau's efforts to expand its 
recycling program, Sones said. The city's goal is to recycle 15 million pounds 
of magazines per year, said Sones, who predicted that magazines will eventually 
make up 14% of the waste that is diverted from landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycled magazines are used in the manufacture of newspapers, cereal boxes and 
tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings us closer to our goal to recycle 50% (of our waste) by the year 
2000," Sones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Los Angeles recycles 17% of its waste. About 50% of city households 
recycle waste materials. KAY HWANGBO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; MECHANICAL 
BREAKDOWN BLAMED IN TRUCK CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Friday that a mechanical problem apparently caused a runaway truck 
to crash through a San Pedro home, leaving an elderly woman seriously injured 
when the vehicle pinned her against a stove. 
</P>
<P>
 Dora Myron, 70, of Rancho Palos Verdes was in guarded condition at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center in Torrance.She suffered a broken right leg, broken left ankle 
and chest injuries in Thursday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer Gary Robinson said no charges had been filed against the driver 
of the truck, Raul Garcia Munoz, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-ton flatbed truck carrying trash dumpsters was parked atop a hill 
when it began rolling about 2:30 p.m. Thursday, said Fire Department spokesman 
Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck rolled down a narrow residential street, jumped a curb, struck a 
light pole and knocked down a tree, carrying part of the trunk inside the 
wood-frame house.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DINNER TO BENEFIT SCHOOL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A parents' booster organization is planning a benefit dinner to raise money to 
modernize high-technology programs for schools in the Las Virgenes Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Technology Foundation hopes to raise $20,000 from the Oct. 20 
event at the Calabasas Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of a 'gap-funder,' if you want to call it that," said Adrian 
Stern, president of the nonprofit foundation. "We fill those gaps between the 
traditional state and federal funding sources." 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-a-plate dinner will honor Supt. Albert Marley, who is celebrating his 
10th anniversary with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward purchasing a variety of high-technology products that 
enhance learning.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about just computers here," said Donald Zimring, the 
district's assistant superintendent. "We're talking about CD-ROMs, on-line 
learning, such as Internet, interactive CDs, satellite learning, the use of 
cable in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscally strapped district, which has been forced to cut about $4 million 
from its budget over the last five years, has been hard pressed to keep up with 
today's constantly changing technology, said Zimring. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district has so many comparatively wealthy families, "we don't 
qualify for many of the programs that schools in the urban districts would 
qualify for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or reservations, call Stern at (818) 906-2230. FRANK MANNING

 Police said Friday they are searching for five armed men who tied up employees 
at a glass statue business and fled with about $1,500 and a Mercedes-Benz 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred Thursday evening at The Glass Dragon, a manufacturer of 
glass statues at 2199 N. Batavia St., Police Sgt. Bob Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers entered the business brandishing handguns, tied up the owner and 
two employees with duct tape, then escaped with the cash in a white Toyota 
pickup and the car, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims freed themselves and called police, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 The license plate number of the stolen Mercedes is 2XRM318. Anyone with 
information on the robbery or the whereabouts of the car is asked to call the

<P>
 About 50 people showed up Thursday at City Hall as officials unveiled 
conceptual proposals for the Historic Town Center, envisioned as the 
centerpiece of downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The five development options being considered range from a 28-room inn and 
4,500 square feet of retail space to a 92-room inn and 26,000 square feet of 
retail space. 
</P>
<P>
 People who filled out response forms at the workshop Thursday favored the 
largest option by a slight margin, followed by the second-largest plan of a 
46-room inn and 23,000 square feet of retail space, according to Tom Tomlinson, 
city planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 Another workshop was scheduled for Friday night, allowing more residents to 
review the proposals. City staff will consider suggestions and make changes if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson said the next workshop will be in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 Several public meetings have been conducted in the past 18 months involving 
the future of the city-owned site that straddles El Camino Real, south of 
Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, a proposed 125-room hotel and 70,000-square-foot retail 
complex for the site drew fierce opposition. Officials later discovered buried 
adobe foundations, which helped scuttle the project. JEFF BEAN

 Of the 5,398 home and business alarm calls answered by Newport Beach police in 
1993, just 31 of them turned out to be crimes, according to a city report.

 Under city law, property owners can be fined after the third false alarm. But 
city officials have discovered that many of those fines go unpaid.

<P>
 Glendale's annual celebration of its historic roots began this week with a 
carnival featuring more than 30 rides at Verdugo Park and will conclude next 
weekend with an evening parade through the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Days of Verdugo festival and community fair will continue through Oct. 16, 
featuring live bands, games, food from an assortment of local restaurants, 
bingo games and an arts and crafts show.Admission for adults is $2. Children 5 
and under admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th annual Days of Verdugo parade is scheduled for 6 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 
15. The parade will begin on Brand Boulevard at Harvard Street and continue 
north to Doran Street. Sponsored by the Glendale Junior Chamber of Commerce, 
the parade will feature local dignitaries and high school marching bands from 
across the Southland competing for trophies and a cash prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of Verdugo commemorates the settling of the Glendale area in 1784 by Jose 
Maria de Berdugo, a Spanish corporal. In time, the Berdugo (later spelled 
Verdugo) family came to own some 36 million acres of land that now includes 
Glendale, La Canada, La Crescenta, Montrose, Sunland, Burbank and adjacent 
communities. STEVE RYFLE

 A Westminster law office employee who says she was just following orders was 
sentenced Friday to 16 months in state prison, closing another chapter in what 
authorities have described as one of the state's largest auto insurance fraud 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Phuong Thi Bich (Nancy) Vo, 32, of Garden Grove, sobbed uncontrollably and 
nearly collapsed upon hearing her sentence, her attorney said. She was told to 
surrender to custody next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo was convicted in August of conspiracy, insurance fraud and attempted grand 
theft. Another office worker, Lam Hoang Luu, and the attorney who employed 
them, James Michael MacPhee, also were convicted in August but have not yet 
been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio are among more than 35 people arrested in January, 1993, in 
connection with what authorities described as four loosely allied fraud rings 
in Orange and San Diego counties that bilked insurance companies with phony 
auto accident claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam involved "victims" seeking payments for injuries they never suffered 
in accidents that never happened. Orange County investigators went undercover 
and claimed to be accident victims but made it clear to the trio that their 
claims were fraudulent, Chinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo and Lam had a partnership and received a percentage from the insurance 
claims proceeds, as did MacPhee, according to court testimony. Luu also denied 
any wrongdoing and MacPhee contended he was betrayed by his employees and was 
unaware of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for other law offices that are out there that are engaged in personal 
injury practices where fraudulent claims are being brought to these offices, 
they need to be very careful that they are only handling legitimate cases and 
they are not creating an environment where people are bringing fraudulent 
claims to them," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Chinn of the sentencing, 
"because they will be prosecuted if they are caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo faced a possible sentence of up to five years in state prison, Chinn said. 
Luu also faces a possible five-year sentence and MacPhee faces a sentence of up 
to six years in state prison, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought 16 months was appropriate given her level of involvement in this 
case," Chinn said of Vo. "Luu seemed to be more deeply involved and she would 
look to him for instructions on what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo's defense attorney said Friday he was disappointed with the sentence and 
had asked the court that Vo be placed on probation with an electronic bracelet 
monitor and sentenced to community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "She acknowledges that what she did was wrong and so be it. What we were 
disappointed in is that she got state prison," said attorney William Monroe. "I 
would say she is probably less sophisticated than the other people in the 
office. I think the testimony even at the time of trial was that she was not a 
decision maker. She simply did what she was told." LEE ROMNEY and RENE LYNCH

 Residents can see what the city's 1,800 merchants have to offer at the 
Business Expo '94 on today and Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The gathering of city businesses, an idea of the city Economic Development 
Commission and the local Chamber of Commerce, gives residents a chance to see 
what Mission Viejo has to offer without the expense and time of driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expo is the inaugural event in the city's promotional effort to inform 
residents about shopping in their own community. It will be at Mission Viejo 
Mall on today from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. On Sunday, the event will take place from 
noon to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is designed to give everyone in our city a true sense of 
community," said Ben Meharg, chairman of the commission. "We want to remind our 
neighbors that when they shop in their hometown, everybody wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their valuable tax dollars are returned to the city, and help improve the 
quality services Mission Viejo is known for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of the goods and services on display during the Expo include home 
improvement, health and beauty, auto repair, children's services and health 
care.

CITY SEEKS ACCOUNTING OF MARATHON'S FREE ADS; AUDIT: CONTROLLER WANTS TO 
DETERMINE IF GROUP HAS ADHERED TO CONTRACT TERMS. OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE MORE 
THAN MET THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

 Los Angeles City Controller Rick Tuttle said Friday that his office will 
launch an inquiry to determine whether the city receives adequate compensation 
from the operators of the Los Angeles Marathon, who recently admitted to 
illegally laundering campaign donations to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said a preliminary inquiry by his office had found inadequate records 
to determine whether Los Angeles Marathon Inc. is providing the $300,000 in 
free billboard advertising that it is required to give the city annually in 
exchange for the right to stage the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have decided that a thorough review of contract compliance should be 
undertaken by my staff to determine whether the city of Los Angeles is owed 
additional compensation and free advertising as specified in the contract" with 
the marathon firm, Tuttle said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Marathon President William Burke has sent a letter to the city 
saying that his firm has met its obligations to the city many times over. He 
valued free advertising the city has received over the last three years at 
nearly $2.2 million, well above the approximately $900,000 required by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke was responding to a letter from City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie 
that asked the marathon firm to explain apparent deficiencies in complying with 
a city contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comrie asked Burke to provide invoices detailing the advertising that the city 
has received. He has also asked Burke to assure that the city is not being 
required to buy advertising in order to get more advertising free -- as 
specifically prohibited in its contract with the city. Finally, Comrie 
questioned the marathon firm's claim that it had lived up to its obligations, 
in part, by placing ads for the city-owned Los Angeles Zoo on millions of milk 
cartons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not aware of any authorization to substitute milk carton advertising 
for the billboards," Comrie wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burke so far has not provided invoices detailing billboard advertising, but 
did forward invoices from the dairy that provided the milk carton ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrutiny of the marathon's operations has intensified greatly since Burke and 
one of his top assistants, George Beasley, signed a legal settlement last month 
acknowledging that the marathon illegally concealed that it was the true source 
of $73,000 in campaign donations to City Council members and others. The 
illegal donations came about the time that the council was extending the 
marathon's contract through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions raised by Comrie and Tuttle center around the marathon's arrangement 
for providing the city advertising. Through an intermediate firm, Patrick 
Media, the marathon has said it would provide roughly $300,000 a year in 
billboard space to advertise the Los Angeles Zoo, city recycling efforts and 
other city programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zoo Public Relations Director Lora LaMarca told The Times, and later 
Comrie's office, that the zoo has been asked to pay for advertising, in order 
to get a like amount of billboard space free. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, who could not be reached for comment, said in his letter to the city 
that "there has been no change in (Patrick Media's) philosophy relating to free 
billboard space utilization since the inception of this program." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Media officials also could not be reached for comment, but have 
previously said in a written statement that they have provided the city well 
above the minimum advertising required in the marathon contract.

BABY GIRL FOUND IN BOX IN SOUTH-CENTRAL LOT; CRIME: HOMELESS WOMAN IS CHARGED 
WITH ABANDONING PREMATURE INFANT WEIGHING LESS THAN 2 POUNDS.

 Police arrested a 33-year-old homeless mother of nine Friday on charges of 
abandoning a newborn girl -- weighing less than two pounds -- in a 
South-Central Los Angeles lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Sampson was arrested Friday when she came to the Southeast station 
after seeing news reports about the abandoned baby, Detective Connie Castruita 
said. Sampson's children live with relatives and she frequently stops by her 
mother's South-Central home, police say. Sampson will face child endangerment 
charges, for which she could spend from one to six years in jail if convicted, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pedestrian found the 1-pound, 9-ounce baby wrapped in a sheet inside a small 
cardboard box at 109th Street and Central Avenue about 1:30 a.m. Thursday. 
Police transported the girl to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, 
where she was connected to a respirator. Her doctor said Friday that she had a 
good chance of surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never read the mind of a mother who gives birth to a child . . . then 
leaves the baby in a shoe box and walks away," said Lili Ahmadi, a spokeswoman 
for the county Department of Children's Services. "As a mother, I can't 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's physician, Dr. Frans Walther, said the girl was born about two 
months premature. He said she had probably been born about 30 minutes before 
she was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Walther said test results on whether the mother had been using drugs during 
the pregnancy were not available.  
</P>
<P>
 Walther said other possible causes of the girl's tiny size, abnormal even for 
a premature baby, would be congenital defects or illness suffered by the 
mother.  
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to tell whether the girl will be handicapped, Walther said, 
but he gave her an 85%-90% chance of survival. "The baby looks quite sturdy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmadi urged other mothers who do not want to be burdened with babies to 
contact Children's Services, which she said could arrange for adoptions. "You 
don't have to leave your baby on the corner of the street," she said. "There is 
a better way."

IRA'S ADAMS CARRIES A MESSAGE OF PEACE, PLURALISM IN L.A. VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Over the years, Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams has been imprisoned, 
wounded and condemned as a terrorist thug -- considered so dangerous that the 
United States would not even let him set foot in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of that seemed forgotten Friday. In Los Angeles for the final stop of 
a two-week tour of the United States, Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the 
Irish Republican Army's political arm, was feted, applauded and photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 He charmed audiences with his wit and talk of peace in Northern Ireland, one 
of the world's long-smoldering trouble spots. He even signed autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a very important and crucial juncture in the history of the people 
of Ireland," Adams told a luncheon gathering of the Los Angeles World Affairs 
Council at the Century Plaza Hotel. "We haven't got peace, but we have a 
momentous opportunity for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' visit to America -- which included a meeting with State Department 
officials -- followed the IRA's Aug. 31 declaration of a cease-fire in its 
quarter-century guerrilla war against British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliciting support for the peace initiative and Irish independence, Adams drew 
parallels between Irish resistance and political struggles around the world, 
from the American civil rights movement to the fight against apartheid in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Ireland the first and last British colony, criticizing British 
leaders' insistence on three months of cease-fire before peace negotiations can 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's start talking," urged Adams, who is barred from visiting Britain and 
whose image and voice were until recently banned on British television and 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it works in the Middle East, why not in Ireland? If it works in South 
Africa, why not in Ireland? Are we Irish so stupid, are we so thick?" Adams 
asked to chuckles from his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated the conciliatory remarks he has made elsewhere on his U.S. trip, 
acknowledging "the hurt which republicans have inflicted" and calling the 
Protestants, his longtime enemies, "my people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding American themes of pluralism, he added: "The type of Ireland which we 
need is one which must reflect all the diversity of the Irish people." 
</P>
<P>
 At breakfast, Adams, who turned 46 this week, spoke to hundreds of 
enthusiastic Irish Americans who sought his autograph and gave him standing 
ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been overwhelmed by the warmth of the welcome," Adams said of his U.S. 
reception. "I hope to be back." 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; BROWNIES PLANT A GARDEN TO THANK SCHOOL 
</P>

 Call it earning Brownie points. 
</P>
<P>
 A troop of Brownies, left without a place to meet after the Northridge 
earthquake damaged their headquarters, this week showed their gratitude to 
their new, temporary home, Beckford Avenue Elementary School.The 13 girls, aged 
5 to 8, planted a flower garden Thursday at the campus, where they have held 
evening meetings since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were tired of all the destruction around us," said Troop Leader Fedelia 
Hennings. "We wanted to see something beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Hennings told the girls, who were eagerly waiting to get their brown and pink 
uniforms all muddy, that they are responsible for taking care of the flowers 
they planted at the gate of the Granada Hills school until June. The Brownies 
will take turns watering the plants, weeding the garden, clearing litter and 
replanting if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's written in flannel," Hennings said of their new responsibilities. (The 
Brownies' gardening duties have been permanently added to a cloth banner the 
troop uses.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hennings handed out pansies, impatiens and statice flowers to the girls to 
plant in the holes they dug. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to presenting the flowers, the Brownies collected aluminum cans to 
raise money for a plaque dedicating the garden from Troop 101 to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the school, to make it look nice," said Tracy Noda, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing her gardening techniques, Tracy said, "You have to plant the flower 
and make it stand up and water it and give it fertilizer." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Brownie, Katie Stoughton, 7, said, "I want to take care of them and 
help them grow because I like to make things pretty." MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PLAN SEEKS TO CURB MWD DEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to reduce Glendale's dependence on the Metropolitan Water District by 
irrigating public and private land with recycled waste water will be expanded 
to Brand Park, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of the project will require a $2-million extension of the city's 
reclaimed-water pipeline system. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline already provides water to Forest Lawn Memorial-Park and is 
expected to be hooked up to the Oakmont Country Club in north Glendale by 
January and to the city's Scholl Canyon landfill soon after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the cost of purchasing water from the MWD, we're looking at a 
savings to our customers of about $1 million a year," said Don Froelich, the 
city's water services administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will reap about $600,000 a year in income by selling 
reclaimed water to Pasadena and to the California Department of Transportation, 
which will use the water to irrigate landscaping along the Ventura Freeway, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline, which will substitute treated sewage and runoff water from the 
city's water reclamation plant for a handful of major water users, is one of 
several projects conceived in the late 1980s to increase the city's water 
resources. The city is also building a water treatment plant near Verdugo Park 
to tap water from an underground aquifer that now flows into the Los Angeles 
River and goes unused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is they're going to produce more water locally and not bring 
as much of the expensive MWD water in," said Jim Rez, who represents Glendale 
on the MWD board of directors. Currently, Glendale pays the MWD about $480 per 
acre-foot of water -- or 326,000 gallons, enough to supply two average-size 
families for a year -- he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the treatment plant is built and the reclaimed water pipeline network is 
finished, the city will reduce its dependence on the MWD from 90% of its water 
needs to about 60%, Rez said. "That's a significant savings and it will 
undoubtedly be a benefit to the users." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials would not say how much, if anything, residents and businesses 
can expect to save on their water bills. But Bernard Palk, the city's director 
of water and electrical services, said Glendale will be looking into selling 
reclaimed water to other cities and agencies -- a contract with Pasadena has 
already been signed and a hookup is in the works -- and those revenues could 
bring water bills down. 
</P>
<P>
 Palk said recent moves by the state Water Resources Control Board to cut water 
deliveries to Los Angeles from Mono Lake could make the recycled water a 
precious commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be much more competition for reclaimed water," Palk said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COWAN HEIGHTS; MAN HELD AFTER FBI SAYS HE FIRED AT AGENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Friday after 
he reportedly fired at a Santa Ana FBI agent on duty in Cowan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent was not hit, said Ron Twersky, FBI public affairs specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent arrived at Alex Thomas Pirro's house on Derby Drive about 10 a.m. to 
question him as part of an investigation, according to the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pirro refused to cooperate, the agent walked to his car. From the front 
door, Pirro fired one shot at the agent and then retreated inside his house, 
according to the Sheriff's Departmen. Pirro subsequently returned to the front 
door and surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI plans to charge Pirro on Tuesday with attempted homicide of a police 
officer, Twersky said. Pirro is being held without bail in the Orange County 
Jail. The FBI and the Orange County Sheriff's Department are investigating.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; VERDICTS SEALED UNTIL TUESDAY IN 2 KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated less than five hours Friday before reaching verdicts 
against a former ranch hand who contended he had amnesia when he shot and 
killed his sister-in-law and another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter ordered the verdicts 
sealed until Tuesday morning, when attorneys on the case will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Frederick Stanley, 58, of Westminster fled to Colorado after the July 
8, 1993, slayings of Joyce Stanley, 52, and Terry Vasquez, 41, at a Fountain 
Valley embroidery shop.  
</P>
<P>
 His flight launched a nationwide manhunt that led to his capture in a tiny 
town after he crashed his car and abandoned it by the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that Stanley blamed his sister-in-law for his 
estranged relationship with his daughter and also despised the fact that the 
women were his superiors at the embroidery shop, where he ran errands. The 
prosecutor says Stanley plotted the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense contends Stanley could not have premeditated the killings. His 
heart condition and other medical problems triggered a stroke before the 
shooting and subsequent amnesia, leaving him unaware of his actions when he 
opened fire on the women, his attorney asserts.

FEDERAL JURY CLEARS ANGELS IN LAWSUIT

 A federal jury today unanimously rejected all claims of a former California 
Angels employee who said she had been persecuted because of her Latina 
heritage, sexually harassed and fired when she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-man, three-woman jury, who took three days to deliberate, decided the 
woman was not credible, said juror Robert Wentzel of Tustin, who spoke outside 
the courtroom after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the majority of people, that was the most important point," Wentzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Sweeney, 54, of Orange had accused supervisors and colleagues in the 
baseball team's marketing department of making bigoted remarks and vulgar 
sexual comments and gestures toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 A former administrative assistant, Sweeney contended she was fired in 
November, 1992, after three years of employment because she took her complaints 
to the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wentzel said Sweeney's believability was badly damaged by testimony from a 
former supervisor who said she was fired from her job at UCI Medical Center for 
being a poor employee and for failing to get along with other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her supervisor there said she was causing trouble and it jibed with what 
employees at the California Angels were saying," Wentzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball team's attorney, Neil Andrus, had argued that Sweeney fabricated the 
complaints because she was unable to accept any criticism on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus said he was glad that the reputations of Angels employees had been 
restored by the verdict in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just sorry it took so much time and effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Colmenares, who had sought $250,000 in compensatory damages 
for Sweeney, said he was disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the jury's decision, I remain firmly convinced that atrocious acts 
did occur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, a tearful Sweeney called the verdict a "terrible 
injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 Colmenares declined to say whether he plans to appeal.

O.C. HOTELS BOOKING MORE ROOMS -- BUT AT LOWER RATES 
</P>

 Orange County hotels rented more rooms in August than during the same month 
last year, but they did so at a cost: Prices were lower, according to figures 
released Friday by PKF Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoteliers brought in more business by offering discounts that drew not only 
vacationers but more business travelers. Hotels around John Wayne Airport 
posted the highest occupancy rates, according to PKF, a Los Angeles research 
and consulting firm for the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, the occupancy rate -- the percent of a hotel's rooms that are 
rented -- rose to 78.9% from 77.4% for August of last year. The average room 
rate declined slightly to $77.25 from $77.42 over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The gain was biggest in the Anaheim area, the heart of the county's tourism 
industry, rising to 81.5% from 79.5% for the same month last year. The average 
room rate fell there as well, though, to $79.56 from $80.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill O'Connell, general manager of four Stovall Best Western motels near 
Disneyland, said that many tourists, apparently thinking that the area would be 
crowded with World Cup soccer fans, stayed away until the games ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the World Cup was over July 17, business started to get good," he 
said. "We're very optimistic. We think the balance of the year is going to be 
good and that next year will be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels around John Wayne Airport showed gains, too, with an occupancy rate of 
74.6% for August, up from 73.5% a year earlier. The average cost in that area 
rose too, to $70.84 a night from $69.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is largely business travelers, which is a positive sign" for the local 
economy, said Melissa Mills, a researcher for PKF. 
</P>
<P>
 South Orange County, primarily the beach resorts from Laguna Beach south, and 
northern Orange County reported little change in occupancy rates or room fees 
for August. Occupancy Rate Steady 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County hotels booked more guests in August than for the same month last 
year. Occupancy in the county's southern and northern portions remained about 
the same, while the Anaheim and John Wayne Airport areas showed modest gains.

PROBE OF GRAFFITI CLEANUP CONTRACT DEMANDED; BIDS: VALLEY COUNCILMAN SAYS 
NONPROFIT GROUP CHOSEN TO DO THE WORK IS INEXPERIENCED AND TOO EXPENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon has delayed the award of a 
lucrative graffiti cleanup contract and called for an investigation, saying the 
proposed contractor wants too much money and lacks experience. 
</P>
<P>
 City public works officials had recommended that a private nonprofit group 
called Neighborhood Pride be given a $500,000 contract for an experimental, 
six-month program to remove graffiti within 24 hours of the time it is reported 
in parts of the San Fernando Valley and the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Public Works was scheduled earlier this week to approve the 
recommendation, but indefinitely delayed any action after Alarcon voiced his 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released late Friday, Alarcon, who represents the northeast 
Valley, said he is concerned by the choice of Neighborhood Pride because the 
two-month-old group was the highest bidder for the portion of the program in 
his district, has no experience in graffiti removal and no community ties.  
</P>
<P>
 "I question how . . . Neighborhood Pride . . . could be recommended over 
community-based organizations and others who also submitted proposals and have 
records of over 20 years experience in grass-roots graffiti cleanups," Alarcon 
stated.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of Neighborhood Pride and city public works officials could not be 
reached for comment late Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman for Alarcon said he was told by public works officials that 
the group was selected because it is the only one that owns a special 
paint-matching machine that allows workers to cover over graffiti without 
leaving tell-tale patches.  
</P>
<P>
 However, officials knew that a landfill operator in Pacoima recently donated 
about $60,000 so the city could buy the same paint-matching machine for use by 
whoever gets the graffiti cleanup contract, Alarcon pointed out in his letter.  
</P>
<P>
 "I find it outrageous that . . . competing organizations were marked down in 
the selection process for the lack of this equipment," Alarcon said. "I ask the 
Public Works Commission to investigate this matter fully to determine any 
improprieties that may have occurred in the bid process." 
</P>
<P>
 Five organizations submitted bids for the "Zero Tolerance" graffiti program, 
entering separate bids for the three council districts where the work will take 
place. Neighborhood Pride bid $576,459 for the whole job, including $115,315 in 
Alarcon's district. By contrast, the lowest bidder in Alarcon's district was 
New Directions for Youth, a private, nonprofit group based in the Valley, which 
offered to do the job for $33,330.

HEALTH STUDY OF ROCKWELL WORKERS IS CRITICIZED BY RESIDENTS; SANTA SUSANA LAB: 
SOME SAY MISSING RECORDS UNDERMINES RESEARCH ON CHEMICALS, RADIATION EXPOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents who live near Rockwell's Santa Susana Field Laboratory 
on Friday questioned the worth of an ongoing health study examining the effects 
of chemicals and radiation exposure on Rockwell workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the advisory committee appointed to monitor the mortality 
study, Santa Susana Knolls resident Marie Mason said she felt scientists will 
be forced to rely too heavily on educated guesses about exposures because 
decades worth of records from the research facility are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live at the end of that road with my children," Mason said. "I'm supposed 
to rely on their good guesses? I'm not comfortable relying on their guesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the mortality study is to determine whether there were an unusual 
number of deaths among Rockwell employees over the years, and if so, to link 
those deaths to possible chemical or radiation exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy commissioned the $840,000 study of the company's 
Rocketdyne Division in 1991, and a team of scientists from UCLA began gathering 
research last fall. Final results are not expected for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory panel is composed of residents, government officials and 
independent scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA scientists acknowledged they are encountering an unusual number of 
difficulties in gathering information on past Rockwell employees and their 
activities on the 2,700-acre site southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of study is actually the most difficult kind to do," said John 
Froines, one of the study's principal investigators. "Lots of times you can go 
into a factory and see where all the exposures might occur. Here it's a crazy 
quilt of exposures, practices and changing technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said they have released all the records they have on 
radiation and chemical exposures to the UCLA team. But very little in the way 
of records exist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The innuendo is that we haven't turned things over to them," said John Rozas, 
director of health and safety at Rockwell. "But we've searched everything and 
given them everything likely to yield results. I can't invent records." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas said records probably did exist at one time, but accident reports and 
other health and safety monitoring data probably were destroyed after a few 
years because there were no federal requirements to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to keep tax records for seven years," panel member Sheldon Plotkin 
said. "You don't have to keep accident reports?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Beate Ritz, assistant researcher for the UCLA team, said she can work 
without the accident reports. What worries her, she said, is that very little 
information is available about who worked where. Location codes for workers 
should provide clues about what chemicals they were exposed to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have 26 location codes," Ritz said. "But there are what, 300-plus 
buildings up there?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said she will have to rely on job titles for employee records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the UCLA team, research on worker records at Rockwell's Canoga 
and De Soto facilities in the San Fernando Valley is scheduled to begin next 
week. Those records are crucial to the study because so many workers moved 
between those sites and the Santa Susana testing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rozas said Rockwell may not allow researchers in, because those facilities 
were not included in the original DOE proposal for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Mason stood up to tell the panel she has serious reservations about 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have very little to work with," she said, referring to the UCLA 
team. "Everybody is guessing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Froines said he has confidence in the results of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way," he said. "I think we'll come out with a good finding. 
It won't be perfect. But I think we'll be able to determine if there was excess 
mortality." 
</P>
<P>
 Money problems are also plaguing the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA team is asking for another $110,000 to finish the project. Scientists 
have already gathered death certificates for 3,402 vested employees who worked 
for Rockwell for more than 10 years, but expect to be tracking down up to 4,000 
death certificates for non-vested employees, far more than they initially 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozas said Rockwell recently asked for $230,000 from the DOE to cover costs of 
employee time spent helping the researchers. The request was denied at the 
state level.

ARCHITECT SEEKING OUT THE SACRED SYMBOLISM IN SECULAR STRUCTURES; SPIRITUALITY: 
AUTHOR ANTHONY LAWLOR, WHO HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ON FINDING THE INSPIRATIONAL IN 
EVERYDAY BUILDINGS, TAKES A TOUR OF DOWNTOWN L.A. ALONG THE WAY, HE FINDS CITY 
HALL, FREEWAY OVERPASSES AND OFFICE TOWERS UPLIFTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a muggy fall morning in Downtown Los Angeles and the people streaming 
up the steps of City Hall seemed preoccupied with such mundane business as 
zoning variances, traffic regulation and building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anthony Lawlor, who was driving south on Spring Street, was preoccupied 
with spirituality. "Notice how the basic rising form of City Hall is like a 
secular steeple," he said as the car turned onto Temple Street. "And at the top 
of the steps, the pillars and arches invite you in, to a spacious rotunda 
inscribed with zodiac signs. This is more than a city building. It can be very 
uplifting for people going to work there or just walking by." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor, an architect, was conducting a spiritual tour of Downtown Los Angeles, 
focusing not on churches, but on office buildings, pedestrian walkways and 
multilayered freeway interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 These structures, he says, are more than just functional. They can be 
nurturing reminders of the spiritual essence of life, helping to point out an 
individual's connectedness to all things -- mind to body, human beings to 
nature -- connections that have been severely split in the 20th Century, he 
says. "People today feel fragmented and isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A cathedral or synagogue or mosque is designed specifically to restore a sense 
of the sacred, he says, and people go there seeking personal wholeness. But 
such design secrets can also be found in many secular buildings, if one learns 
to stop and look for them. "These buildings are speaking to us," said Lawlor as 
the Downtown drive continued. "The City Hall, with its unifying elements, 
reminds us that we can be interconnected." 
</P>
<P>
 He was in Los Angeles to promote his new book, "The Temple in the House: 
Finding the Sacred in Everyday Architecture." He calls it a guide to enriching 
our lives through architecture. "I think we can perceive the buildings around 
us in ways I call sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind the physical, material world," he writes, "there is some force that 
animates our bodies. That life force -- whether we call it God, spirit or 
energy -- that's what I call the sacred." 
</P>
<P>
 His illustrated book combines religion, mythology, philosophy and 
architecture, from ancient times to the present, to present its theme of 
healing through architecture. Lawlor maintains that people ignore 
architecture's potential to unify mind, body and health to their own detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the moment we are born, to the moment we pass away, we are in some sort 
of building. Many people today feel numbed by modern life. If they can see 
these connecting threads, they can see their interconnected-ness with all 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a theme Lawlor has long been contemplating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up in Los Angeles, graduated from Hamilton High School and received 
his master of arts degree from UC Berkeley. "My family was culturally Jewish, 
but not religious," he says. "Perhaps that is why I've chosen this focus. As I 
began to travel around the world after college, I started to notice how 
buildings influenced me." 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal experience was his first visit to Chartres Cathedral in France when 
he was 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a great piece of architecture, but what I learned is why it's 
an architectural treasure," he said. From his first glimpse of the spires 
rising out of the medieval city, to the cathedral entrance, past the carvings 
of saints to the soaring arches of the interior and the light-flooded rose 
window, he recalls, "Everything pointed to a spiritual experience, taking your 
spirit upward. Going up to that doorway, I felt almost a hum of consciousness: 
There had been years and years of worship there. It sounds metaphysical, but I 
felt the expansion of my inner awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his thinking has been further shaped by such modern holistic 
architects as Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn ("He really saw the spirit in 
architecture") and Joseph Campbell's studies of the myth and symbols 
representing fundamental patterns of thinking. And most important, Lawlor said, 
"I've been practicing transcendental meditation for 23 years. It gave me direct 
experience of the depths of my own consciousness. So then I could make the 
connections between inner consciousness and outer form."  
</P>
<P>
 Sifting together all those influences, he began to look at the buildings 
around him in a different way. "Spiritual architecture is not solely the 
province of religious structures dedicated to particular rituals and 
occasions," he wrote. "It can be created where the physical surroundings are 
shaped to give our lives depth and meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 He devotes several chapters to illustrating how various thought patterns -- 
what Campbell calls "mythic archetypes" -- are revealed in specific 
architectural elements such as a steeple or a doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he says, the fundamental pattern in human thought, which is 
"desire, seek and find," happens thousands of times a day for everyone. "You 
can see this pattern clearly in a cathedral, represented by the portal, the 
central aisle and the altar," he says. "But it's also expressed in a 
supermarket or a department store." In each case, he says, an architectural 
principal molds a building into patterns that integrate mind and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 And such basic instincts as the aspiration for "more" in life can be seen not 
only in the pointed arches of a Gothic cathedral but also in the pitched gables 
of a Victorian house or the soaring silhouette of a Downtown high-rise. 
Recognizing these elements, he says, can be a renewing experience. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the thesis he was illustrating on his guided tour of the "public 
temples" of Downtown Los Angeles, in which he pointed out various buildings 
that met the test of "reference points for the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all were monumental. The little commercial kiosks flanking the Los Angeles 
Street entrance to City Hall East can be soothing to the spirit, he said, with 
their pagoda-style roofs recalling a Japanese temple. "I feel this has some 
effect on our philosophy. It is harmonizing. It takes our attention away from 
Earth's clutter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Public Library can be experienced as a "real temple to 
knowledge," with its double stairstep profile symbolizing a "world mountain, 
with diversity rising to unity." And at the Department of Water and Power, a 
sculpture that appears to be sailing on the surface of a shimmering pool is 
"very spiritual," he said, while the layered building itself with its stylized 
columns "looks like a stripped-down version of the Colosseum in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor, who has won many awards for his designs, left a large San Francisco 
firm to set up his own small practice in Fairfield, Iowa, because he wanted to 
work with people on an individual basis. "In my architectural practice and the 
design classes I teach," he says, "I find that many people want to extend the 
search for sacredness to their homes and workplaces.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our home can be just a place where we stop off, throw in some food and rest," 
he said. "Or we can create a little nurturing spot where all aspects of 
ourselves are addressed." His firm builds custom homes and commercial projects. 
"We just did a small office building with a central atrium fountain and garden. 
Those elements transform a box filled with little rooms to a community where 
people can hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 He started working on the book three years ago as an attempt to clarify his 
own direction. "I do have this spiritual interest, as well as architectural 
knowledge," he said. "There are lots of books on architecture and lots on 
various forms of spirituality, but I didn't see anything that combined the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
 His Los Angeles appearances included the "Cityscape" segment of KPCC FM's 
"Airtalk" with host Larry Mantle and design critic Sam Hall Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is important because it reminds architects they are creating spaces 
to meet the needs of people and not serve their own egos," Kaplan said. He 
agrees with Lawlor's thesis that contemporary architecture has become 
disconnected from its spiritual history. "The more people are aware of what 
architects should be doing to enhance their lives, the more demanding they can 
be," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Temple in the House," written for a general audience, is designed as an 
elegant "how-to" handbook. Each chapter ends with reader exercises for 
enlarging one's vision of everyday streets and buildings, and for designing 
various sacred places within one's own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor says his readers have no trouble "getting it." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we all share -- we live with buildings. Life can't be whole 
unless it encompasses mind, body and environment, and what I'm doing is giving 
people a language to understand the connections. Just by reading it, you are 
putting on glasses for seeing in a new way."

CITY TO BACK INVESTORS WHO WILL BUY, REPAIR BUILDINGS; RECOVERY: CHEAP LOANS 
FOR QUAKE WORK WILL BE LIMITED TO THOSE WHO SET ASIDE SOME UNITS FOR LOW-INCOME 
TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council created a loan program Friday for investors who 
want to buy and repair quake-damaged apartment buildings, after a protracted 
wrangle over whether the rebuilt structures should include low-income units. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, investors who take a zero-interest loan from the city must 
reserve 40% of the repaired units for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 If the investor wants to set aside only 20% for low-income tenants, the 
interest rate is 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members objected to the requirement, saying it may scare off 
some investors and slow the city's quake-recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this money was to help rebuild buildings," said Councilman Hal 
Bernson, whose district, which includes Northridge, was hit hardest by the Jan. 
17 temblor. "It was not intended for social engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky also questioned the requirement, saying low-income 
housing may not be appropriate in every reconstruction project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public-policy land-use issue as well as a political issue that needs 
to be reviewed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members supported the concept, saying the low-income 
requirements will provide more affordable housing in a city where dwellings are 
notoriously expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is good public policy," said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who 
added that the demand for inexpensive housing is high in Los Angeles. "You find 
anything that is affordable in the city and there are no vacancies." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Hernandez agreed. "The reality is, people cannot afford to 
live in the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans will be made from $330 million in local and federal housing repair 
funds managed by the city's Housing Department. The program will provide a 
maximum of $35,000 per unit. City housing officials could not estimate how many 
units it would benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 The $330-million pool is also funding zero- and low-interest quake loans to 
owners of damaged mobile homes, single-family homes, condominiums and apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the low-income units, tenants must earn less than 60% of the 
median household income in Los Angeles County, or about $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally designed, the program offered loans with 4% interest for 
investors who set aside 20% for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the council squabble, Gary Squier, the Housing Department's general 
manager, offered to lower the interest rate to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower interest rate appeased critics of the program, which was approved 
unanimously.

OBITUARIES; RALPH WIGGINS, 81, AERIAL ACROBAT AND PARACHUTIST

 Ralph Curtis Wiggins, an aircraft mechanic who spent his spare time high above 
the Earth as a parachutist and aerial acrobat at air shows, county fairs and in 
the movies, has died. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sunland resident for 50 years, Wiggins died at home Thursday of cancer, said 
his wife, Grace. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937 Wiggins, then 25, made his first parachute jump -- on a dare, his wife 
recalled. He spent Sundays at a Monrovia airport watching the facility's 
regular jumper and agreed to take the man's place one day when the jumper 
failed to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Later hired by Lockheed as a mechanic, Wiggins devoted many weekends to 
parachuting. On a jump in 1939, he met his future wife, who was also out for a 
sky-dive that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins became an accomplished parachutist and performed for many years at air 
shows and county fairs both as a sky-diver and later as an aerial acrobat. His 
hair-raising stunts would involve vintage airplanes, helicopters and hot-air 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 His skills eventually attracted Hollywood notice and he was tapped to provide 
the aerial stunt work for Billy Wilder's 1957 biography of Charles Lindbergh 
"The Spirit of St. Louis." He was later featured in a commercial for a hair 
preparation walking the wings of a biplane, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 60s, he performed his first plane-to-plane transfer for the 1975 movie 
"The Great Waldo Pepper," starring Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired from Lockheed in 1973 but continued parachuting, making his last 
jump in 1991 on his 79th birthday. His wife estimated that he completed more 
than 600 jumps in his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the old-timers of parachuting," she said Friday. "He was a good 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Wiggins is survived by a daughter, Patricia, of Santa 
Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Ferrara & Callahan Mortuary, 8727 
Fenwick St. in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Verdugo Hills 
Visiting Nurse Assn., 1101 E. Broadway, Suite 201, Glendale, 91205.

 Attorney Bryan Hance, executive director of the Center for Conflict Resolution 
in Los Angeles, remembers the day well. He received a call asking him to bring 
the Rev. Cecil Murray face to face with a group of skinheads whose members had 
been arrested for attempting to assassinate the pastor and blow up his First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, in December, 1993, was dramatic and emotional -- and made 
front-page headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such a high-profile event is rare among the 1,400 cases that the 
center mediates each year, the principle of mediation is the same: to dig 
beneath the surface of a conflict to reach understanding, agreement and, 
ideally, reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of his clients, Hance says, are simply looking for a better 
way to resolve civil disputes involving family members, business partners, 
landlords and tenants, and merchants and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in law school at Pepperdine, I saw the pain caused by the courts," 
Hance said. "Then I heard the center's former director speak at a Christian 
Legal Society meeting on campus. I knew working here would be a great way to 
incorporate my faith into my desire to help people." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded on principles of conciliation set forth in the New Testament, the 
center is loosely affiliated with a national association called the Christian 
Conciliation Service. Taking referrals from churches, law firms and businesses, 
the center provides 140 trained mediators who -- in 82% of the cases -- 
successfully help mutually consenting parties come to a voluntary agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who desire religiously oriented mediation, the center offers the 
Christian conciliation program, which incorporates prayer and Scripture. The 
center also contracts with Los Angeles County to provide completely secular 
mediation at the Van Nuys and Robertson courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the center's mediators are volunteers who pay for their own training. 
Clients in the Christian program pay on a sliding scale. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Donna Gould, a center volunteer who has received training with 
the Los Angeles city attorney's office and Harvard University, in addition to a 
four-day training course for the center at Pepperdine University Law School, 
"there are three great advantages to mediation (over the court). The first two 
are the tremendous savings in time and money," she said. "A complex divorce 
custody and property division can be worked out in three to six sessions, in 
contrast to up to perhaps three years in court, with up to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees. The third is confidentiality. Nothing 
said in mediation becomes public record." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even more significant, she said, is that "what we do can't be done in a 
courtroom. In mediation, the parties really listen to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, she said, "a dispute over money or child custody is just 
the tip of the iceberg -- feelings need to come out. I have seen cases where 
people come in in a rage, can barely stand to look at each other. By the end of 
mediation, it is not unusual for them to shake hands, even cry and embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes someone will offer an apology. A real healing takes place. Knowing 
that I've made a difference in people's lives, that a friendship has been 
preserved or another happy outcome occurred that couldn't have done so in the 
courtroom, is the greatest gratification work can give," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, senior minister of First A.M.E. Church, will deliver the keynote 
speech at the center's 10th anniversary celebration at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 16 at the 
Universal Hilton in Universal City. He sees the center as part of "our 
challenge to formulate a proactive agenda against hate." Tickets are $125. For

PARISHIONERS RELUCTANT TO ADMIT EATING ILLS TO CLERGY; NUTRITION: RELIGIOUS 
GROUPS NEED TO LIFT VEIL OF SECRECY AROUND FOOD ABUSE AND TREAT IT AS A SERIOUS 
SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUE, EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a graduate student, Mary Louise Bringle would go for days or weeks 
ingesting huge quantities of food, such as whole bags of cookies or half 
gallons of ice cream at a single sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, ridden with guilt, she would fast for an equal number of days on coffee 
and an occasional glass of diluted grapefruit juice. She suffered leg and 
stomach cramps from abusing laxatives and diuretics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in therapy with a pastoral counselor for five years, the theological 
student only mentioned her discomfort with food once. When the therapist 
responded that she was not fat, Bringle did not persist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secrecy seemed, after all, the proper setting for such disgusting practices," 
she revealed in the recent issue of the Journal of Pastoral Care. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Americans regularly thank God before meals, but food is more often a 
curse than a blessing to millions with eating disorders. Caught within a 
culture that glorifies physical perfection and centuries of religious teachings 
warning of temptations of the flesh, they feast or fast in private. 
</P>
<P>
 Although religious groups have begun to come to grips with the sexual 
revolution -- elevating the goodness of sexuality even as they painfully 
struggle with the ground rules -- food abuse remains the final taboo, some 
scholars and counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so trivialized food issues that it is much easier for people to talk 
about their sexual issues," said Bringle, now a professor of religious studies 
at St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not hidden. On an average day, an estimated 65 million 
Americans are dieting, including 50% to 80% of fourth-grade girls and nearly 
two-thirds of female high school students. As many as a third of female college 
students use laxatives, vomiting and diuretics to rid their bodies of unwanted 
food and weight, Bringle said in the journal article. 
</P>
<P>
 But that does not mean the issue is out in the open in sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Chernin, a Berkeley counselor who has written three books on eating 
disorders, says women will speak more easily to her about issues of incest and 
child abuse than food abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a greater shame and sense of taboo about it," she said. "Every one 
of them feels as if it is unique to them." 
</P>
<P>
 From a religious standpoint, the secrecy seems understandable. Since early 
times, there has been a tendency in Western Christianity to distrust the body 
as the locus of temptation, lust, pain and mortality, according to Bringle, 
author of "The God of Thinness: Gluttony and Other Weighty Matters." 
</P>
<P>
 "No wonder so many women among us feel deeply ashamed of our bodies; no wonder 
so many of us get caught up in vicious cycles of compulsive eating to swallow 
the shame, and compulsive dieting to do penance for the excesses of our fallen 
flesh," said Bringle, who speaks from the experience of someone who spent 30 
years as a compulsive eater, and six years as a full-fledged bulimic. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing religious groups need to do is lift the veil of secrecy around 
food abuse, and treat it as a serious spiritual and emotional issue rather than 
a problem of vanity, Bringle and Chernin say. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious leaders should then encourage women to follow the biblical 
injunction to glorify God in their body by learning to appreciate the many 
sizes and shapes of human bodies and enjoying food as a divine gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringle says one way some Christian dieting programs fall off the religious 
scale is by encouraging compulsive dieting to reach a cultural ideal that love 
and acceptance come from a model-like figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as much making a god of the belly -- the flat belly -- as it is to 
ingest tremendous amounts of food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its tortured history regarding elements of the body, Christian 
tradition offers a rich resource for a healthier attitude toward food, 
according to Bringle and Chernin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even John Calvin -- hardly the faith's most noted hedonist -- created a 
category of "legitimate enjoyment" of the blessings of the world, Bringle 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a December, 1993, Gallup Poll, slightly more than half of 
Americans always or frequently say grace or give thanks to God before meals. An 
additional 34% occasionally say grace before meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovering the profound theological meaning of grace by treating it as a 
shared celebration of God's gift of food rather than as a perfunctory exercise 
can go a long way toward treating the shame and guilt of eating disorders, 
which flourish in private, according to Chernin and Bringle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we started making our spiritual and religious celebrations around food . . 
. we would certainly have changed our idea of food as sinful and shameful to a 
celebration of a collective sense of the spirit of God," Chernin said.

 BOND RATING MAY SAVE ANAHEIM MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a change that could save taxpayers millions of dollars, Standard and Poor's 
has upgraded the city's General Obligation Bond rating, city officials 
announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim joins five other California cities in benefiting from the highest bond 
rating in the state.Anaheim's bond rating went from AA- to AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential interest savings to city taxpayers could be substantial, city 
officials said. For example, over a 30-year period, the interest cost savings 
on a $50-million bond issue rated AA instead of AA- could be $2.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this upgrade was accomplished in our current difficult 
financial environment is especially gratifying and is a resounding endorsement 
about the way we have managed our resources during this period," City Manager 
James D. Ruth said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CHALLENGER SAYS COUNCIL PUTS DEVELOPMENT 
BEFORE RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this predominantly residential community, a lone challenger is trying to 
wrest a City Council seat away from one of three incumbents in the Nov. 8 
election by portraying the present council as unconcerned with the adverse 
effects of commercial development on the city's residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three incumbents are campaigning to maintain the leadership that they 
say represents the interests of all citizens -- not just neighborhood residents 
-- as well as to keep the 37-year-old city a balanced, crime-free and 
economically thriving community with a strong sales-tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents include Mayor John Collins, a businessman; Guy Carrozzo, a 
retired school principal and one-term council member with 30 years of residence 
in the city; and former mayor and community volunteer Laurann Cook, who is 
seeking her third four-year term. Trying to unseat one of the incumbents is 
first-time candidate Gus Ayer, a past president and current board member of 
Green Valley Homeowners' Recreation Assn. -- the largest homeowners association 
in the city with 1,048 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The main issues that have surfaced in the campaign involve the quality of life 
in Fountain Valley, preservation of neighborhoods, balanced growth, strong 
programs against crime, gangs, graffiti and drugs, and maintaining the 
bedroom-community nature of this city of 55,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are not expected to spend more than $10,000 on their campaigns. 
Carrozzo will spend less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayer, 44, has criticized the city's efforts to bring more retail businesses to 
town at the expense of neighborhoods. He points to the added traffic, crime and 
pollution that invariably accompany increased commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says that the city has wasted money updating the city's General Plan 
-- a blueprint to guide the city's future development: "The city has spent 
hundreds of thousands on that and hasn't produced anything meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayer, a 14-year resident and businessman, is opposed to future street-widening 
projects on major thoroughfares such as Euclid and Brookhurst streets and Ellis 
and Garfield avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things that impact every neighborhood in the city," said Ayer, 
whose campaign message is "Yes to Neighborhoods," his pledge to protect them 
from adverse affects of commercial development. "My first priority is to 
protect and enhance residential neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, another first-term council member, started volunteering in the 
community when he moved here 20 years ago, which lead to his candidacy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A past president of the Fountain Valley Chamber of Commerce, Collins said he 
wants another four-year term so he can continue to use his public service and 
business experience to keep the city financially sound and a nice place to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Collins said the city has balanced its budget without raising 
taxes, enticed businesses that have generated more sales tax revenue, and has 
put six more police officers on the street by shifting four positions and 
adding two new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the city has spent $6 million in past four years to maintain 
streets and improve traffic flow. "Do we still have traffic problems? Yes. 
Where are they? They're at the (city's) border at both ends. We need to work 
with the county, state and federal governments to resolve these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining and enhancing the current level of public safety services are also 
among top priorities for current council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who is 45 and a 20-year resident, also said continued support of 
Neighborhood Watch and community policing programs that get residents involved 
in reducing crime are among solutions to combatting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to continue the tough stance on gangs -- that they won't be tolerated 
-- and we need to enhance anti-gang programs," said Cook, founder of the Child 
Abuse Resistance Education Program and the No to Drugs Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's priorities also include neighborhood preservation, maintaining a 
balanced budget and continuing open communications with residents about their 
local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo is the current mayor pro tem, which means that if voters return him 
to his seat, he will be next in line to become mayor. The council rotates 
members to the ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo, 62, was first elected in 1990 following his retirement after 30 
years with the Westminster School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have enjoyed it tremendously. I feel I have the time to give it the time it 
deserves," said Carrozzo, who refuses to accept campaign contributions from any 
source and plans to spend his own money for this election. 
</P>
<P>
 "By not accepting contributions, I can assure the public I'm totally committed 
to serving their needs and interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrozzo, a 30-year resident and active member of Holy Spirit Church, said he 
wants to maintain a small-town atmosphere for the city, promote a strong 
sales-tax revenue base and continue to provide quality services without raising 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carrozzo was elected to office four years ago, he promised his 
constituents he would not raise taxes -- and he's kept his word.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did my best to vote no. I look at a tax as something mandatory that 
everyone has to pay," Carrozzo said of his anti-tax voting record. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, a former public relations executive who has made serving on the council 
a full-time job, said term limits is not an issue in this year's council race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I serve at the will of the people. And if the citizens of Fountain Valley 
wish for me to continue serving them, it will show during the election," Cook 
said. "I haven't lost my enthusiasm to serve the citizens of Fountain Valley,

 In 1984, voters decided to limit council members to two four-year terms. But 
because Fountain Valley is a general-law city, term limits cannot be enforced 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayer said he strongly supports term limits. Carrozzo, who voted for term 
limits, said it's up to the voters to decide who they believe is the best 
person to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, like Cook, said that term limits are not an issue this election.

MOTIVE IN SLAYING REMAINS UNCLEAR; SHOOTING: VICTIM BENITA MIKAILIAN, 40, IS 
DESCRIBED AS A SUCCESSFUL, HARD-WORKING TRAVEL AGENT.

 Friends and business acquaintances remained shocked and mystified Friday at 
the fatal shooting of a 40-year-old travel agent, whose body was found in her 
North Brand Boulevard office Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew the victim, Benita Mikailian, said she frequently kept late 
hours at her agency, Benita's Travel Town, at 1110 N. Brand Boulevard.The 
business thrived, and Mikailian entertained a circle of well-heeled friends at 
her exclusive Park Towers condominium on Pioneer Drive, just blocks from her 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a serious businesswoman," said Joe Ayvazi, an agent with the Fred 
Sands Broadway Realtors office located downstairs from the travel agency. "It 
seemed like she had a really successful operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Department investigators were mum Friday on details of the 
homicide, but a resident at her building said they visited Mikailian's 
condominium and took photographs. She had lived in a first-floor unit of the 
18-story building for about four years, according to real estate records. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquaintances said she lived alone in the two-bedroom unit and could not 
recall mention of any relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikailian's body was discovered in her second-floor office by an employee 
reporting to work at 8:30 a.m. Thursday, according to police. They would not 
comment on a motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I heard, apparently nothing was stolen," said Ayvazi. "She had a 
gold Rolex watch on, and jewelry, but nothing was touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Mikailian probably was killed after 8 p.m. Wednesday. 
Employees at the real estate agency said she often worked until 9 or 10 p.m., 
but would lock the door of her office after 5 p.m.

STATE PANEL DELAYS RULING ON HUNTING IN COAL CANYON; ECOLOGY: HUNTERS, 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS TRADE SALVOS OVER OKING HUNTING IF THE AREA BECOMES AN 
ECOLOGICAL RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing impassioned testimony, the state Fish and Game Commission on 
Friday postponed a decision on whether to allow hunting in Coal Canyon once it 
has been declared an ecological reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunters are notorious for the amount of damage they do," Virginia Handley, an 
animal rights activist representing The Fund for Animals, told the 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Regehr, speaking for the California Bowmen Hunters and State Archery 
Assn. countered: "When I stalk an animal, I don't want to frighten it. The 
quietness and serenity of an area is paramount; we don't go stomping around." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting at Palm Springs' Riviera Resort provided the latest installment of 
an argument that began three months ago when the state Department of Fish and 
Game proposed that the rugged 952-acre area near the Riverside Freeway in the 
northeast portion of the county be classified as an ecological reserve. There 
is virtually no opposition to that proposal, but a clause allowing hunting has 
raised the ire of some environmentalists and the Orange County Harbors, Beaches 
and Parks Commission, which last week adopted a resolution in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting is not specifically prohibited in the state-owned canyon now, state 
officials said, but few hunters ever go there because it is relatively unknown 
and difficult to enter. Opponents argue that designating the area an ecological 
reserve open for hunting would bring in a swarm of hunters, attracted by its 
listing as a hunting area in Fish and Game publications. The only other public 
land open to hunters in Orange County is the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving several negative comments in August when the proposal was 
first made public, Fish and Game officials revised the proposal so that it 
would ban the use of pistols and most rifles, limiting hunters to bows and 
shotguns, which have a much shorter range. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department's intent," Terry Mansfield, a division chief for wildlife 
management, told the commissioners Friday, "is to provide hunting in a safe and 
orderly manner. We want hunting opportunities consistent with protecting our 
natural resources." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents raised a number of objections, among them that hunters might 
shoot such rare species as eagles and falcons, scare away would-be hikers or 
trample rare vegetation and disturb the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting needlessly exposes (vegetation) to another source of fires," said 
Connie Spenger, president of Friends of the Tecate Cypress, named for a rare 
tree found in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Regehr: "I don't know how those sensitive plants can tell the 
difference between a hunter and a tourist. Hunters try to preserve the habitat 
(too.)" 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the commissioners voted to follow Mansfield's suggestion that the 
matter be postponed until their next meeting, scheduled for Nov. 4 in Monterey, 
while staffers work on revising language in a proposal considered too 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it seem too restrictive," Mansfield said of the proposal as written. 
The intended revision, he said, would clarify the fact that hunters would be 
able to stalk deer as well as birds, rabbits and other small game as long as 
they limit themselves to bows and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to believe that the low level of hunting involved will in 
any way disrupt the environment," he said.

TRIAL TO START IN A YEAR FOR HUBER KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It probably will be a year -- if not longer -- before a handyman goes on trial 
on charges of sexually assaulting and murdering a young Newport Beach woman and 
then keeping her nude body in a freezer for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary set an Oct. 
2, 1995, trial date for John J. Famalaro to give attorneys sufficient time to 
prepare for what may be a death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, is accused of kidnaping, sexually assaulting and bludgeoning 
Denise Huber, 23, after her car broke down June 3, 1991, along a local freeway. 
A former Lake Forest resident, Famalaro was arrested in July after authorities 
found Huber's body in a freezer inside a stolen rental truck parked in his 
driveway in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say they especially need the time -- and may even ask for 
more -- to go through thousands of documents and other items seized from 
Famalaro's cluttered home. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia said he also anticipates tracking down 
400 to 500 people who may have known Famalaro in the past to begin building a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big job," Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also adding to the need for more preparation time, Gumlia said, is that 
complex DNA evidence will likely become an issue in the case because 
authorities say Huber was sexually assaulted. Gumlia said it is too early to 
discuss defense strategy but stressed that he does not plan to argue that Huber 
may have consented to sex by her assailant -- whoever that might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a small amount of semen found (on the body) and right now we are 
waiting for more information" about who the semen can be traced to, Gumlia 
said. "We are in no way suggesting that, if it was deposited that night (of the 
killing), that it was consensual." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer, a DNA expert at the Orange County district 
attorney's office, is joining Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans in 
prosecuting the case.

ENDANGERED MOUSE WON'T ENDANGER RESORT; DEVELOPMENT: THE DANA POINT HEADLANDS 
PROJECT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE FEDERALLY PROTECTED SPECIES, PLANNERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The placement of the Pacific pocket mouse on the federal endangered species 
list will have no major effect on a proposed $500-million resort at the Dana 
Point Headlands, a development spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fully anticipated the listing during the planning process to accommodate 
the permanent listing of the pocket mouse," said Jeffrey Adler, a spokesman for 
the two property owners, S. H. Sherman Co. of Newport Beach and the 
Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co.  
</P>
<P>
 About three dozen pocket mice, believed to be the last members of the species 
worldwide, have been detected on 3.75 acres on the headlands, a peninsula just 
north of Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put the mice on the endangered 
list. The rodents already had been placed there on an emergency basis last 
spring for a 240-day period that ended Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers' plans include three alternatives for the pocket mice, Adler 
said: They can be relocated on or off the site, or the project area can be 
moved to accommodate their current habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 With the mouse's placement on the endangered list, developers will not be 
allowed to proceed without first convincing the service that construction would 
not further endanger the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on the federal endangered species list means that the mouse is now 
protected," said Loren Hays, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman. "You 
cannot harm or harass them unless you have a prescribed permit. And you get a 
permit by applying through the Fish and Wildlife Service." 
</P>
<P>
 No permit application has been submitted, Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for a 400-room luxury hotel and 370 homes with sweeping ocean 
vistas on 121 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, property owners and the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy have met 
privately to discuss saving part of the headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials have told owners they would like to buy about nine acres 
of the most prominent, environmentally sensitive land at the tip of the 
peninsula, including the habitat of the endangered mice. In addition, the 
conservancy would want a five-year option to buy an additional 12 acres, which 
is now the proposed location of the hotel.  
</P>
<P>
 Approved in April by the City Council, the Headlands project has been the 
target of protests by residents who contend the development is too extensive 
and will destroy one of the county's last undeveloped coastal properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The approved plan is the subject of two heated citywide November ballot 
measures that could force the council to rescind its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the mouse is listed as endangered, money may be available through the 
federal Land and Water Acquisition Fund to preserve the headlands, said 
Jacqueline Cain, a conservancy director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got into this late in the game. The land is for sale and we believe that 
this is our last chance to come up with federal, state or county bonds to 
purchase the point for preservation," she said.

family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los 
Angeles Times.

$901,000 USC EMBEZZLEMENT CASE VOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A case against a former USC bookkeeper who allegedly embezzled nearly $1 
million was thrown out of Los Angeles Municipal Court on Thursday when the 
statute of limitations ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Crane, who officials at the USC Colburn School of Performing Arts say 
worked as business manager from May, 1988, to July, 1993, had been charged with 
taking $901,000 from donations, tuition and endowment funds gathered for the 
school.Crane had pleaded not guilty to charges of embezzlement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the school knew about the disappearance of 
funds since 1989, "but never followed up on it." Geragos blamed the school's 
"lax standards" for officials not realizing that the money was being taken from 
department accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution was unable to persuade a judge that the statute of limitations 
should not apply if a party is unaware of the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Mayman, executive director of the school, said her office was indeed 
unaware of irregularities. "There was absolutely no indication that anything 
was going wrong before 1993," she said in an interview.

FARBER: DORNAN WANTS TO CUT LATINO VOTE; POLITICS: LATINO ACTIVISTS BACK THE 
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE'S ASSERTION AGAINST CONGRESSMAN. THE INCUMBENT 
EMPHATICALLY DENIES THE ACCUSATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by Latino community leaders, Democratic congressional candidate Mike 
Farber contended on Friday that incumbent Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) is behind an effort to discourage Latinos from voting in the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber and the Latino leaders also accused Dornan of ignoring the needs of his 
46th Congressional District -- particularly the Latino community -- and called 
him an "embarrassment" to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference at his campaign headquarters in downtown Santa Ana, 
Farber charged that Dornan was trying to thwart Latino voter participation. As 
his only evidence, Farber offered the assertion that Dornan has "worked closely 
in the past" with Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who plans to place 
"poll watchers" at central Orange County voting precincts on Election Day to 
watch for possible voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats maintain that Conroy's plan is an effort to intimidate Latino voters 
since those precincts have large ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our belief that this is coming directly from Bob Dornan," Farber said, 
lobbing a political grenade at the eight-term incumbent "because he knows he's 
in trouble and he wants to dissuade the Latino population from participating 
in, really, what I think is one of the greatest honors of any American, and 
that's voting in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan roared back: "What's the evidence? There is none, absolutely none. 
Guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman issued a 10-point list of his accomplishments on behalf of 
minorities, ranging from participating 30 years ago in a civil rights march 
with the late Rev. Martin Luther King to obtaining federal funds for 
redevelopment, housing and anti-gang programs in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering of the Latino political leaders at Farber's headquarters was 
touted as the first time in 10 years that they have united behind one candidate 
to defeat Dornan. They included attorney Alfredo Amezcua, the president of the 
Hispanic Bar Assn. of Orange County; Amin David, president of Los Amigos of 
Orange County; Dorianne Garcia, Orange County Democratic Party chairwoman; 
Nativo Lopez, national co-director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional; Santa Ana 
Councilman Ted R. Moreno, and Stanton Mayor Sal Sapien. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, David and Lopez were backing the write-in candidacy of 
Democrat Robert J. Banuelos, who ran unsuccessfully against Dornan two years 
ago and then lost the June primary to Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released earlier this week, Banuelos said he was ending his 
short-lived write-in campaign because his higher priority is the defeat of 
Proposition 187, the immigration initiative. Banuelos' statement did not 
support Farber, nor did Banuelos attend Friday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber downplayed the lack of an endorsement from Banuelos and instead 
highlighted his hope for local Democratic Party unity after months of discord. 
</P>
<P>
 Banuelos' withdrawal from the race "will allow the united front to come 
together. I think Bob Banuelos is very supportive of the race; he just has his 
eyes on a much bigger target," Farber said, referring to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the support from David and Lopez, Farber said he pledged to 
help with voter registration and turnout, as well as a year-round citizenship 
drive in the 46th Congressional District, which is largely made up of 
immigrants. He estimated that while more than half of the district's population 
is Latino, only about one in five is registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the Latino leaders who stood at the podium agreed that Dornan 
has ignored the needs of the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dornan) does do damage because he brings intolerance and hate into our 
community, not just by his actions but by the people he associates with and the 
things he says about the people in the community," said Garcia, the Democratic 
chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan described most of those gathered as liberals who "do not have any clout 
in the county because the county is basically conservative." He conceded that 
Lopez's endorsement of Farber was "a shock" because he has worked with Lopez's 
immigrant-rights group in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent has been endorsed by the 200-member Latino Peace Officers Assn., 
the Hispanic Business Assn., and Anaheim City School District Board President 
Lou Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you, Bob Dornan is a supporter of law enforcement, he's a 
supporter of education, and he's a supporter of the Hispanic community," the 
school board president said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HOSPITAL CITED AFTER RADIATION INSPECTION; 
HEALTH: ERRORS IN HANDLING RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS POSED NO THREAT TO WORKERS OR 
PATIENTS, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High Desert Hospital has been cited by county inspectors for seven violations 
in the handling of radioactive materials, but health officials said none of the 
errors endangered patients or employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are violations that are going to have to be corrected," Kathleen 
Kaufman, director of Los Angeles County Radiation Management, said Friday. "But 
we didn't find anything that indicated there was a health or safety threat." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these are easily correctable," she added, "and most have been 
corrected already." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman said a letter outlining the violations was mailed to the 
county-operated hospital Thursday. Hospital officials said Friday they had not 
received the letter but were aware of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that by the time we get the letter, everything will already have 
been corrected," said Jerry M. Harris, associate administrator at the 170-bed 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A county health investigator visited the hospital last week to look into 
reports that hospital staff members did not follow proper safety procedures 
when they administered radioactive iodine to patients with thyroid disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector determined that the staff had been inadequately trained in the 
handling and disposal of these materials, according to Kaufman. One of the 
citations was issued because staff members did not follow proper procedures 
when they tested radiation levels in the patients' rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the inspector found a broken lock on a cabinet used to store 
radioactive vials and also discovered that a hospital patient had mixed waste 
materials carrying a small amount of radiation with non-radioactive medical 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the report is an incident in which a patient who had trouble 
swallowing capsules received radioactive iodine in a liquid form. The hospital 
was cited because it is licensed to administer the medicine only in the less 
hazardous capsule form. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital will have 15 days to respond with a plan to correct these 
problems, Kaufman said, but no fines were levied and the hospital's license to 
use radioactive materials is unlikely to be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to use this as a learning experience," Harris said. "We're always 
very concerned about the safety of patients and employees. Fortunately, this 
incident resulted in no harm to anyone. We're going to make certain it never 
happens again."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRUCK HIJACKED BY 2 PITCHESS ESCAPEES FOUND 
</P>

<P>
 A truck hijacked by two inmates who escaped from the Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho was found a few blocks from the East Los Angeles home of one of the 
prisoners Friday, but the two escapees remained at large, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Guerrero, 23, and Mario Garate, 19, escaped Tuesday night and later 
stole a truck from two college students parked outside a hotel near the Magic 
Mountain theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police found the abandoned truck Friday morning in the 1700 block 
of Workman Street in Lincoln Heights, just a few blocks away from Garate's 
home, Officer Susan Padron of the Los Angeles Police Department said. She said 
it had been stripped of its battery, tires and other parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a strong belief that he's within the area," Padron said of Garate. 
</P>
<P>
 Garate, who was serving time for spousal abuse, and Guerrero, who was jailed 
on a narcotics charge, escaped from a processing center in a minimum security 
area where about 200 other inmates were gathered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair managed to pass a razor wire fence between the processing center and 
the outside wall of the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said both men had been scheduled to be transferred to a 
higher-security facility because they had caused trouble among other inmates.

SAM'S CLUB WORKERS TURN DOWN TEAMSTERS; LABOR: THE UNION LOSES ITS BID TO CRACK 
DISCOUNT GIANT WAL-MART. WORKERS AT THE FULLERTON STORE VOTE 3 TO 1 AGAINST 
UNIONIZING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Workers at the Sam's Club here voted Friday against joining the Teamsters 
union, soundly defeating organized labor's first bid in Southern California to 
penetrate discount giant Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the food and merchandise warehouse voted 92 to 30 against 
Teamsters Local 952 in Orange. About 150 warehouse and clerical workers at the 
Fullerton store, a former Pace membership warehouse that Wal-Mart bought from K 
mart Corp. last year, were eligible to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a setback to the Southland labor movement. Unions including the 
Teamsters have long dominated the region's food and warehouse industry, but in 
recent years they have felt mounting pressure from large, non-union retailers 
like Wal-Mart, which are bidding for a greater share of the lucrative Southern 
California market. 
</P>
<P>
 For organized labor, a victory at the Fullerton Sam's Club would have been all 
the more significant because it would have given unions a toehold at the 
nation's largest retailer. The Arkansas-based company, which has had a 
contentious relationship with unions, owns more than 2,300 Wal-Marts and 430 
Sam's Club membership stores nationwide. None of those is under a union 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 employees and managers crowded into a small training room near the 
store's check-out stands to witness the ballot count. Union organizers stood 
with their arms crossed, shaking their heads slowly as one "no" vote after 
another was read by federal labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Local 952 expressed disappointment and some dismay over the 
outcome. The 12,000-member union, one of the largest in Orange County, had put 
considerable resources in a six-month campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, when the union filed for a union election, organizers said 
they had signature cards of support from a majority of the workers, some of 
whom complained that when Wal-Mart bought the store from K mart last year, the 
company reduced vacation, holiday and sick-pay benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past week, union members made a flurry of calls and house visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go forward," said Patrick Kelly, one of the union organizers. 
He blamed the loss on what he called an aggressive campaign by Wal-Mart. Kelly 
and workers said that the company, with the help of managers from Arkansas, had 
frequent meetings at the Fullerton store, passing out leaflets and playing 
videos portraying Teamsters' past connections to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping it would be closer," Kelly said of the vote. "It shows we need 
to intensify our efforts to organize these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 However, those who had voted against the union were jubilant, hugging each 
other and offering congratulations to the store's general manager, Hector 
Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 Makimba Fizer, a sales representative, marched through the aisles carrying a 
large red sign that read: "We won!" 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said he was pleased with the outcome. The company, he said, conducted 
a fair campaign to inform workers of their rights. "I felt all along that our 
partners liked our open-door policy of management. This just proves it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those closely watching developments at the Fullerton store was John 
Sperry, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 324 in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory at Sam's would have been an "important first step" in cracking the 
non-union food retailers, Sperry said. Local 324, representing 23,000 workers, 
is girding for a fight with non-union K mart, which is expected to open one of 
several new merchandise and food stores in Orange County next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be there the day they open," Sperry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Hackamack, an eight-year employee at the Fullerton store, said she 
voted for the union, believing that a contract could result in better 
health-care benefits and greater job security. "I thought we gave it our best 
shot."

<P>
 The two-day Palmdale Fall Festival, the city's largest annual community event, 
kicks off today with food booths, children's games, craft displays and musical 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 35,000 people are expected to attend the festivities, which will 
feature concerts by two classic rock groups -- The Turtles and America. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held at McAdam Park, 38115 30th St. East. Hours are 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m. today and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. General admission is $2, but 
children age 12 and younger and senior citizens 62 and older will be admitted 
free. Parking is also free. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-sponsored event will included 10 entertainment stages, 220 arts and 
crafts vendors, 20 fine artists and 30 food vendors. A farmers' market, 
offering locally grown "last-chance" peaches, will be set up on the grounds 
along with a petting zoo and a children's games area. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers were putting up 35,000 square feet of tents to shade visitors from 
the high-desert sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station will display their mobile 
command post at the festival and recruit participants for the local Volunteers 
Organized to Improve the Community Environment program. VOICE participants 
patrol Palmdale streets and report suspicious activity to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline bands will close out each day's activities. The Turtles will 
perform at 5 p.m. today. America takes the stage at 4 p.m. Sunday.

<P>
 Most people never get any closer to a police Special Weapons and Tactics team 
than what they see on their television sets, but residents will have a chance 
to see the city's SWAT team in action Sunday as part of a Safety Day 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT team exercise is one highlight of the event, which will also include 
displays of fire and rescue equipment and services, lifeguard and Sheriff's 
Harbor Patrol operations, and building department safety tips. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Laguna Beach fire a recent memory, building department officials hope 
that homeowners will turn out for a roofing fair to learn about ways to protect 
their homes with fire-resistant roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of roofing manufacturers and contractors will demonstrate 
roofing installations, while firefighters will supervise a demonstration of a 
roof fire and sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
 Building Department officials will provide information on earthquake-safe 
construction.  
</P>
<P>
 Displays throughout the 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. event will include the Newport Beach 
police helicopter, its K-9 team, fire and rescue equipment, and lifesaving 
techniques by the American Red Cross.  
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT demonstration and a firefighting demonstration will both take place 
at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking for the event is free.  
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the Building Department at 644-3275 or the Fire 
Department at 644-3106.HOLLY J. WAGNER

RELIGION / JOHN DART; JOURNAL DEFENDS TIES TO UNIVERSITY; JUDAISM: JEWISH 
SPECTATOR AFFILIATES WITH INSTITUTION TO ENSURE ITS FUTURE. BUT A PROMINENT 
AUTHOR SAYS IT RISKS BECOMING A 'HOUSE ORGAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 70-page Jewish quarterly that arrived in mailboxes this week was typically 
thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Articles declared, among other things, that spousal abuse is a 
larger-than-acknowledged Jewish problem, that too many rabbis suffer burnout 
over conflicting expectations and that two decades of women rabbis has not led 
to a "feminization" of the synagogue as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was also a surprise in the fall issue of Jewish Spectator, edited 
and published in Calabasas. After 58 years as an independent religious voice 
within North American Jewry, the journal has become affiliated with the 
University of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor-Publisher Robert Bleiweiss, 60, announced that the magazine will 
continue to be independent editorially and financially but has entered into a 
closer association with the university to ensure its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine's open, trans-Judaic policies will also continue, unchanged in 
any way," said Bleiweiss, referring to the journal's past lack of 
organizational ties. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the journal's best-known contributor, Jacob Neusner, who has written, 
edited or contributed to hundreds of books, said he was not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resigned as contributing editor because I regard myself as a nonpartisan 
among the Judaic religious movements in the country," Neusner said in a 
telephone interview. The author is distinguished research professor of 
religious studies at the University of South Florida, Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to serve in the administration of a journal that could turn 
into a house organ," said Neusner, who, like other contributors, has donated 
his work for the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old University of Judaism, a liberal arts and graduate school on 
Mulholland Drive in the Sepulveda Pass, offers beginning courses for rabbinical 
students who may complete their training at the Jewish Theological Seminary of 
America in New York to become ordained in the centrist Conservative branch of 
Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Neusner's statements, Rabbi Daniel H. Gordis, a University of 
Judaism administrator who went from contributing editor to managing editor with 
the fall issue, said the university is open to self-criticism and would not 
jeopardize the journal's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are firmly part of the Conservative movement," Gordis said. "At the same 
time, our institution is very much committed to nurturing the intellectual life 
of the Jewish community in its broadest dimensions. Our faculty, for instance, 
has included Reform, Orthodox and secular Jews and non-Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordis is the university's vice president for public affairs and community 
outreach as well as acting dean of the rabbinical school and assistant 
professor of philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Spectator affiliation awaits confirmation by the university's 
board, "but I'm absolutely convinced this is a deal that will happen," Gordis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the magazine's direction, Gordis pledged that the university will honor 
"the intellectual honesty and legacy of its founder, Trudie Weiss-Rosmarin." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss-Rosmarin began the magazine in New York five years after emigrating from 
her native Germany in 1931. She maintained that Jewish life, however strong it 
might be in secular and community expressions, needs a vibrant Judaism to 
compete with other cultures, one biographer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to Santa Monica in the 1980s and eventually persuaded Bleiweiss, who 
was already editing and publishing several labor publications, to take over the 
magazine a month before she died in 1989 at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
 The journal, influential despite its limited circulation, was down to about 
800 paid subscribers and 1,500 copies of each issue mailed when Bleiweiss 
assumed control. He said the journal has doubled its paid subscriptions and 
publishes at least 5,000 copies each issue. Donors, including Bleiweiss 
himself, cover the costs of the extra distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 In linking up with the University of Judaism, Gordis became vice chairman of 
the nonprofit corporation that owns the journal, American Friends of the Center 
for Jewish Living and Values. Rabbi Robert Wexler, president of the university, 
also joined the center's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleiweiss said he hopes the magazine will receive further exposure through the 
university's constituency of 10,000 alumni, students and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I have in mind is to increase the frequency to six or eight 
issues a year," he said. "Part of my problem is that I don't have time or staff 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleiweiss and his wife, Vida, who helps run the magazine out of their home, 
attend a Reform synagogue in Woodland Hills. They have a son who is an Orthodox 
rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Eli Schochet of West Hills' Shomrei Torah Synagogue, who knows both 
Bleiweiss and the university's leaders, said the marriage is promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the severest critics of Conservative Judaism and the school have 
been people associated with the university itself," said Schochet, an adjunct 
professor at the hilltop campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as if to demonstrate that, Gordis wrote an article in the summer issue 
that belabored unnamed leaders of the Reform, Conservative and small 
Reconstructionist branches of Judaism for lacking courage to provide intense 
Jewish schooling for their memberships, such as Orthodoxy does with its 
yeshivas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall issue of the magazine published a letter from Rabbi Ed Feinstein, of 
Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, saying that the idea of a liberal yeshiva is 
brilliant but Gordis' accusations were "wrong-headed, arrogant and offensive." 
Gordis wrote a sharply worded reply in the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking beyond the dispute in print between colleagues, which Gordis said he 
now wishes had not become so personal, Gordis said he was struck again by the 
wide impact of the small-circulation quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got calls from Canada and letters from Israel and heard that it was raised 
in staff meetings of various Jewish organizations in New York," Gordis said. 
"It's being read avidly by Jewish leadership and gets passionate responses."

EVEN AGENTS TAKING A HIT DURING BASEBALL STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The producer of "Saturday Night Live" is holding on Line 1. . . . Better pick 
up Line 2, Bret Saberhagen is calling from an airplane. . . . Did you call back 
the people at Fox? . . . Is everything set with Michael Bolton? . . . When does 
"Seinfeld" need Danny Tartabull again? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gilbert, perhaps the most prominent agent in baseball, works in a fancy 
office building in Beverly Hills, complete with a panoramic view of the city 
from his penthouse suite. He wears Armani suits, drives a Rolls-Royce and lives 
in a 14,000-square-foot mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is absolutely miserable these days, feeling no different than the 
thousands who have been affected by the baseball strike. 
</P>
<P>
 One difference is that he keeps working, putting in longer hours on baseball 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Gilbert, along with hundreds of other baseball agents, continues 
to work without getting paid. When the players walked Aug. 12, the checks 
stopped. If the players don't get paid, neither do their agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Sports Council's client list includes a Who's Who of 
Baseball. Barry Bonds, Mike Piazza, Saberhagen, Tartabull, Rickey Henderson, 
Jose Canseco, Bobby Bonilla, Kevin Appier and John Franco are among his 75 
major league clients. Gilbert and his partners represent 12 players who each 
earned base salaries in excess of $2 million in 1994, and five players with 
salaries of at least $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the Beverly Hills Sports Council receives 5% commission, the 
company lost $653,861 in wages from the dozen players earning at least $2 
million, and close to $1 million from their entire clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't feel sorry for me," Gilbert said. "We may have lost the most money, but 
that's because we have negotiated the biggest contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this office misses most, though, is the game. That's the fun part about 
being an agent. I mean, we got the penthouse floor just so we could rent out 
space on the roof for satellite dishes. We normally would have games on all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, instead of watching baseball games on TV, I'm watching Bob Shapiro 
perform on TV. It feels weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Borris, who along with Rick Thurman is a partner with Gilbert: "It's 
a tremendously empty feeling. This is the time of year we'd be scattering 
across the country to see our guys in playoff games. Now, we sit around and 
talk about labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous void in all of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, 46, a former minor league outfielder who became a millionaire by the 
age of 30 by selling life insurance, says he won't suffer any financial 
hardship because of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he has immense overhead, with phone bills that run nearly $10,000 month, 
but business will be conducted as usual. There will be no layoffs on his staff, 
and he rejected the invitation from his employees to take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know times are tough," Gilbert said. "I had an agent call me the other day 
and asked if he could come work for me. It's going to be tough on a lot of 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can't change. We can't cut back. We've got to ride this out, just like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cutthroat business, so perhaps it's only natural that no one is 
reaching out to provide financial or even emotional assistance to hundreds of 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 If agents sense that one of their brethren is in trouble, some will swoop down 
and try to woo clients away. The less competition, the better. One man's 
anguish is another man's joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure not too many people are feeling sorry for us," said San Diego-based 
agent Barry Axelrod. "People forget that we're humans too. Not many, but there 
are some." 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod, a veteran of 18 years in the business, has 10 players in the major 
leagues, including Jeff Bagwell, a shoo-in for the National League's most 
valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, who earned a base salary of $2.4 million in 1994, normally would be 
able to parlay his season into a five-year contract for about $5 million a 
year. If nothing else, he'd be eligible for arbitration, which would guarantee 
that his salary would at least be doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, who knows what will happen? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like an idiot," Axelrod said. "The reason my clients retain me is that 
I'm supposed to be able to assess the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm clueless. I don't have any idea what will happen. I don't have any 
idea where he stands now. He could eventually be in a situation with no rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for Jeff, too. Assuming he is the MVP, I think it will always be 
tainted. I think any of us associated with this season will always have that 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be like (client) Rick Sutcliffe's 1981 World Series ring. He keeps it 
in a drawer because it wasn't a true season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so hard to get excited about anything associated with baseball 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod, whose only staff member is a secretary, says that he, too, will 
survive the baseball strike. He also represents a handful of actors and 
actresses, and that has helped offset the baseball business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is that it has created cause for a couple of family meetings," 
Axelrod said. "Believe me, there won't be any vacations or new cars this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike certainly is coming at a rotten time for Manhattan Beach agent Alan 
Meersand, 46, and his family. He already had started construction on an 
addition to his home that will cost more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have 11-month-old twin sons, Meersand and his wife learned, the house 
can get awfully small in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally can handle the 29% hit," Meersand said, "but I'm not one of the 
unfortunate people in a front office who have lost their job. The owners almost 
seem to be reveling in the bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
 Meersand, who represents four free agents -- Tim Wallach, Darrin Jackson, 
Damon Berryhill and Jesse Orosco -- says the most troubling aspect is the 
uncertainty. He's unable to negotiate a deal for any of the free agents, much 
less market his free agents during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to rally our guys to stay in there," Meersand said. "I think there 
has to be fear by everybody. Every player is worried. Come on, you tell me that 
Bobby Bonilla isn't sick about losing $31,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everybody has the right to do what they want, but I tell them there's 
no way they can cross the picket lines unless they want to pay for the rest of 
their careers. You'll get frozen out. You'll get thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't cross the union. Players may not agree with every move they make, 
but as long as you pay for their leadership . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Said agent Paul Cohen, who represents potential young stars such as Dodger 
outfielder Billy Ashley and Angel outfielder Jim Edmonds: "Everybody has their 
own issues. My players tell me that 2% or 3% of the guys are going to do what's 
best for them. But it's not like, 'Oh, my God, what am I going to do now?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real test will be April, May and June. It's just absolute 
craziness right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Scott Boras of Newport Beach said this normally is the time of year he 
would begin preparing arbitration cases for his eligible clients. Instead, he 
found himself recently writing letters to players explaining the antitrust 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of players didn't even know what the antitrust agreement was until a 
couple of years ago," said Boras, who represents about 45 major league players 
and 25 in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boras' predicament is that in a year in which he represents such free agents 
as Kenny Rogers, Kevin Brown, Jim Abbott, Tim Belcher and Bip Roberts, it might 
be the worst year to be a free agent. If every club really is losing money this 
season because of the strike, who's going to turn around and unleash a spending 
spree on a free agent? 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder Boras and his staff have sent out 20- to 30-page briefs on the 
merits of his free-agent players to every general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate clubs will sign players to contracts," Boras said, "but I would 
suspect there might a catch, like, 'You have to report by March 1.' I also 
don't think you're going to see the lucrative signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's legally fascinating what's going on in the sports world right now. But 
it's a little frightening also." 
</P>
<P>
 Arn Tellem, who is grateful he negotiated a three-year, $14-million contract 
for Angel starter Mark Langston last spring instead of testing the free-agent 
market, says agents now are forced to explore every option for players. He, in 
fact, recently hired a Japanese lawyer in anticipation of possibly sending some 
of his players to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a weird way, it may be advantageous to be a free agent," said Tellem, who 
represents free agents Bo Jackson, Matt Nokes and Rex Hudler. "If there's no 
season, what good does a contract do? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a contract with one club, it gives you the opportunity to 
go overseas and make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, again, many of the players might have other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the players first had time off," San Diego agent Tony Attanasio said, 
"it was like a vacation for the first five, 10 days. After that, they began to 
use their minds and imaginations in other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had guys ask about everything from investing in property to getting 
involved in boxing exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Axelrod: "We all know when players have idle time, they have weird 
thoughts and different ideas. They can't go to the clubhouse anymore, so they 
lost their support-group network, and now they're bouncing those ideas off 
their agents." 
</P>
<P>
 The days of players picking up a quick $10,000 are over, too, their agents 
say. The card-show market has soured, and considering the popularity of 
baseball, who in their right mind is going to spend big bucks getting players 
to endorse products? 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't exactly the best of times," said San Diego agent John Boggs, who 
watched possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars in endorsements evaporate 
when the season stopped Padre outfielder Tony Gwynn's bid for .400. "You just 
don't see the big baseball-card shows, and at this juncture, you don't have the 
marketing opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take away the fact that Tony won his fifth batting title, but 
imagine what kind of interest there would have been in Tony if he had made a 
monthlong run of batting .400." 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, agents simply will have to wait. They may not be in danger of 
standing in an unemployment line, but surely, there are those wondering if this 
still is a lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd say this, because I had mixed feelings about it," Tellem 
said, "but I'm very thankful now my wife is a hard-charging professional. She's 
an executive at Warner Bros., which I'm very thankful for." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thurman of the Beverly Hills Sports Council: "Right now, I think all of 
us are too concerned about the players to worry about ourselves. We're the ones 
who have to reassure them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what has changed for all of us is the mystery of the unknown. That's the 
greatest fear. And that's not going away."

RAMS; PACKERS' RUNNING BACKS ARE FOCUS OF THE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Green Bay's rushing offense ranks 26th in the league, and Ram tailback Jerome 
Bettis has outrushed the Packers, 507 yards to 364. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Sunday's game at Green Bay, the Rams are concerned about Packer 
running backs Edgar Bennett, Reggie Cobb and rookie LeShon Johnson for another 
reason -- their receiving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre's screen passes to his running backs have 
become the team's money play this season, and also has taken some of the heat 
off wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Packers are the best screen team I've seen in all my years in the NFL," 
said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "They do a great job with their 
backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett leads all NFL running backs in receptions with with 33 for 220 yards. 
Cobb has 14 catches for 134 yards, and Johnson has eight catches for 150 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has receptions of 33, 33 and 24 yards in the past four weeks, but 
dropped a screen pass against New England last week that Packer Coach Mike 
Holmgren said would have easily gone for a 60-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, teams were blitzing the Packers regularly, and they had to come 
up with a play that would get them out of trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ram pass rush is considered one of the best in the league, and linebacker 
Shane Conlan was effective blitzing Atlanta last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert missed practice again to rest a sore shoulder 
and ankle, and tailback Jerome Bettis sat out his third consecutive day of 
practice with a deep bruise on his low back. Gilbert and Bettis are expected to 
play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup tailback David Lang (thigh bruise) is inactive for Sunday's game, and 
wide receiver Todd Kinchen will replace Lang on kickoff returns. Linebacker 
Brett Collins, defensive end Brad Ottis and offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore 
(knee) also are inactive. MIKE REILLEY

CROWLEY FINDS HANDLE IN GOLDEN WEST BACKFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Crowley, a sophomore at Golden West College, figured he worked hard 
enough and ran well enough to win the starting tailback spot this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was told he would split time with sophomore Thomas Green. Golden 
West Coach Ray Shackleford has often rotated his tailbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in, Crowley had trouble holding onto the ball. He fumbled twice, 
losing one, in the season-opening 35-14 loss at Long Beach. The next week 
against Pasadena, he was about to cross the goal line for a touchdown but 
fumbled again. The game ended in a 35-35 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The fumbles brought to mind a painful memory. When Crowley was a junior at 
Marina High, he fumbled a pitch on his first carry of the season and was sent 
to the bench for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad flashback," he said. "The coaches (at Golden West) said it was 
poor concentration and I agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley appears to have overcome his fumble troubles. He hasn't lost the ball 
in the last two games and had his best game against El Camino last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed for 89 yards in 10 carries and also caught three passes for 26 
yards. He scored two touchdowns rushing and caught a pass for another one.  
</P>
<P>
 He said his tentative early season approach has been replaced by a desire to 
run through the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a lot of nervousness," he said. "But I'm over that now. This is 
my make-it-or-break-it year (to get a scholarship)." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley, 20, figured he would already have moved on to a four-year college. 
Coming out of Marina, he was barely recruited despite leading the team in 
tackles as a linebacker. He choose Golden West, where his brother Mike had been 
a wide receiver. He also decided to return to tailback, a position he had 
played until he was needed on defense as a senior at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the 1992 season, he hurt a hamstring, then was in a motorcycle 
accident and missed the first half of the season. He returned in the final 
month to play fullback and appeared ready to make a major impact in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crowley became distracted by other interests, which he declined to 
identify, and wasn't academically eligible for the 1993 football season. He got 
things in order last spring and was a standout on the Golden West track team. 
Despite never throwing the javelin before, he finished second in the Orange 
Empire Conference and fourth in the State meet. He also took part in the 
decathlon, his first, and ended up eighth in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had done seven events in one meet," Crowley said. "So I figured 10 in two 
days would be a piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's Mission Conference Central Division 7 o'clock games: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (0-3, 0-0) vs. Golden West (0-3-1, 0-0), Orange Coast -- This is 
Golden West Coach Ray Shackleford's final game against district rival OCC. 
Shackleford has a record of 14-12-2 against the Pirates. Orange Coast has won 
three of the last four. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (2-1, 0-0) at Riverside (1-2, 0-0) -- Rancho Santiago is 
soaring after a 31-14 victory over Palomar and a 50-27 thrashing of previously 
unbeaten Long Beach last Saturday. But Riverside, the defending division 
champion, has an outstanding running game. The Tigers average 218 yards per 
game rushing. Simon Fuentes, Rancho Santiago's quarterback, is 37 of 55 for 526 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern (0-3, 0-0) at Saddleback (0-3, 0-0) -- Saddleback leads the 
all-time series, 19-3, and is badly in need of a victory after three 
frustrating losses. Saddleback's James Ligons leads the conference in 
interceptions with three. 
</P>
<P>
 In a non-division 7 p.m. game: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (1-1-1) at Cerritos (3-0) -- Fullerton wide receiver Steve Correa 
had 10 catches for 199 yards and two touchdowns in the 42-41 victory over 
Pasadena last Saturday. He is third in the conference with 18 catches but leads 
in yardage with 380.

CHAPMAN'S ROBINSON SET TO TAKE ON AZUSA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman's murky quarterback situation cleared up a bit Thursday night when 
Curtis Robinson got in a full practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who suffered a serious scratch on his right eye in the first quarter 
against Redlands last week, is expected to start today in the 1 p.m. game at 
Azusa Pacific, Chapman Coach Ken Visser said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for the Panthers. Robinson is best suited for Chapman's 
modified wishbone offense, the I-bone. At the start of the week, the Panthers 
basically had one healthy quarterback, freshman Jacob Galasso. Now they have 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Gragnano, who relieved Robinson against Redlands only to injure a finger 
on a botched field-goal attempt, is still hurting. Galasso, a Trabuco Hills 
graduate who has been playing tailback for Chapman, took most of the snaps 
early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who said he suffered a tear in his cornea, was cleared for contact 
drills Wednesday and practiced lightly. He said he can still feel the scratch 
when he blinks but that his vision, doubled and blurry immediately after the 
injury, is OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's healing real fast," Robinson said. "My pain tolerance is extremely high, 
which is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson still is bothered by the mildly separated shoulder he suffered in the 
season opener against Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the offensive line has been blocking for Panther backs, the 
quarterback position is almost an afterthought. Chapman (2-0-1) rushed for 185 
yards against Redlands and it didn't seem to matter who was getting the ball. 
Juan Garcia rushed for 53 yards, Darnell Morgan (in limited time because of a 
sore knee) gained 43 and Galasso and Oscar Ford each gained 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific (1-3) won its first game of the season last week, beating 
Whittier, 24-17. Tailback Marcus Slaten rushed for 203 yards in 37 carries. It 
was the first 200-yard performance for an Azusa Pacific back since Christian 
Okoye set the single-game record of 248 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chapman's defense has been strong against the run. It gave up only 109 
yards rushing to Redlands, then the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Conference's leading rushing team with a 304-yard average.

cross-country team finished third at the Irvine Invitational Friday at Irvine 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lasers, the defending State champions, finished third with 103 points. San

 Riverside's Charlotte Mayock continued her strong running, winning the 
individual title. Mayock dominated the field a month ago at the conference race 
and did the same Friday. Mayock ran the 5,000-meter course in 19 minutes 41 
seconds, but this time, Mayock was challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 She and El Camino's Sawako Nakamura ran together early on. Mayock took a 
slight lead at the halfway point, but Nakamura stayed close. 
</P>
<P>
 When the runners entered the final 500 meters, Mayock put her head down and 
ran hard; Nakamura couldn't answer and finished 10 seconds behind. Erin Remy of 
Orange Coast ran another strong race, finishing fourth in 20:03. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley's Mayra Medina (20:29) was fifth, Fullerton's Teresa Vega 
(20:35) sixth, and Golden West's Kim Foster (20:45) was 10th. Vega, who was 
bothered by illness, needed assistance after the race but after cooling down 
and getting enough to drink, she was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Pruitt of Irvine Valley was 14th (21:10) and Saddleback's Natalie 
Lupica was 20th (21:35). The race featured 152 runners from 24 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County runners didn't do so well in the men's race. The top finisher 
was Irvine Valley's Larry Holland who was 15th. His time was 20:55 on the 
four-mile course. Dax Baca of Irvine Valley was 17th in 21:02 and Jose Rangel 
of Rancho Santiago was 20th in 21:08. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Wilhelm Gidabuday dominated the race, winning in 19:19. Riverside 
took the first four places but Glendale (45) won the event. Riverside (52) was 
second and El Camino (86) third. Rancho Santiago (169) was fifth, Orange Coast 
(282) ninth and Fullerton (300) 12th. STEVE KRESAL

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; STRONG SECOND HALF SPARKS MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei football Coach Bruce Rollinson didn't want his team getting in a 
scoring contest with Riverside Ramona Friday night, so the Monarchs made it a 
one-sided show in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, the second-ranked team in Orange County, pulled away in the 
second half to beat Ramona, 30-14, in a nonleague football game. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 14-14, midway through the third quarter, but Mater Dei put 
the game away with touchdown runs of four and one yards by Steve Bodnar and Pat 
Shinnefield's 47-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid of getting in a scoring contest and that's what ended up 
happening," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs marched 80 yards in 10 plays on their opening drive and took a 
7-0 lead on a 14-yard run by Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar finished with 178 yards in 16 carries and scored four touchdowns. Joe 
Trampush added 102 yards in 13 carries for Mater Dei (5-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-1) tied it later in the first quarter when Nian Taylor broke loose 
on a 92-yard punt return. But on the next play from scrimmage, Bodnar had an 
80-yard touchdown run to give Mater Dei a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona moved deep into Mater Dei territory twice in the second quarter, but 
missed a 39-field goal attempt and later was stopped on a fourth and one at the 
Mater Dei 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tied it, 14-14, in the third quarter when J.B. LaCombe caught a pass 
three yards past the line of scrimmage and lateraled it to Taylor, who went 55 
yards for a touchdown.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; GRIFFINS POUND MILLIKAN; PREP FOOTBALL: 
QUARTERBACK FETERIK PLAYS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE BREAKING HIS HAND IN SEASON 
OPENER AND LEADS LOS ALAMITOS TO 56-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' 56-0 victory over Long Beach Millikan Friday night was 
predictable, maybe even easier than it looked. And it looked like your basic 
56-0 wipeout. 
</P>
<P>
 But amazingly enough, there was more at stake for the Griffins than merely 
extending their unbeaten streak to 40 games. Despite the wide winning margin, 
this turned out to be an important game for Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik, a junior quarterback, made his first start since breaking a 
bone in his left hand in the season opener. Although he appeared rusty at 
times, Feterik didn't have much trouble shredding an overmatched Millikan 
secondary for 254 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 13 of 21 passes before he was relieved by Sean Stein with 4 
minutes 39 seconds left in the third quarter. The 5-0 Griffins, top-ranked in 
Orange County and fourth-ranked in the state, led by 42-0 at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was rusty early," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said. "He needed to get 
ready for next week. I think he'll be better off (after playing against 
Millikan)." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein directed two four-quarter touchdowns, including a 24-yard scoring pass 
to wide receiver Stan Guyness. Guyness and Brad Melsby each scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby had a standout night, catching seven passes for 140 yards and 
intercepting two passes by Millikan quarterback Josh Weller. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Barnes apologized to Millikan Coach Tony Peralta, who seemed 
unfazed by the final score. Barnes played his reserves almost exclusively 
midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 What else the Griffins gained by beating Millikan (1-4) wasn't immediately 
clear. Barnes certainly hopes Feterik is sharper next week against No. 10 
Marina (5-0) in the Sunset League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he didn't believe the Griffins, who haven't lost since Oct. 25, 
1991, are ready to win a league championship. That might be a little tough to 
fathom, however, particularly after such an overpowering performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a lot of mistakes," Barnes said after Los Alamitos did not throw an 
interception or lose a fumble. "But our skill guys cover us." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Whatever mistakes Barnes believed the Griffins committed, they were 
difficult to spot against Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes into the game, Melsby grabbed a Weller pass at the 
Millikan 42-yard line and raced down the sidelined untouched for the Griffins' 
first score. Guyness turned a screen pass into a nine-yard scoring pass with 
1:45 left in the first quarter and the rout was on.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; TRABUCO HILLS USES TURNOVERS IN 
DOMINATING EL TORO, 35-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills' Chad Collins caught a pass in the flat, sidestepped a defender, 
and ran for a 19-yard gain. He then did plenty of talking to the El Toro bench 
in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at me, he seemed to be telling them. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident exemplified the game. Trabuco Hills' 35-0 victory Friday over 
rival El Toro delivered a similar message to Mater Dei. Look at us, the 
Mustangs seemed to be saying. 
</P>
<P>
 With the South Coast League opener against the county's second-ranked team on 
the horizon, Trabuco Hills had the kind of game every coach hopes for. The 
Mustangs turned four turnovers into 28 points and did little wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed everything we could muster to give us some confidence," Trabuco 
Hills Coach Jim Barnett said. "If we hadn't had the lead that we did, we 
probably would've done a little more on offense, but since we're playing Mater 
Dei, there's not a lot of point in . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't finish the comment, but there wasn't a lot of point in showing his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (4-1) got a big defensive game from several players, including 
Bobby Johnson, who had three sacks, and Chris Clayton, who had two. In all, El 
Toro (3-2) gained only 104 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to let (Mater Dei) know we're no slouches," Johnson said, not 
in a boastful way. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro's three first-half turnovers led to scoring drives of 43, 48 and 36 
yards and 21 points. Trabuco Hills' defense gave up only 15 yards rushing and 
11 passing in the half. In fact, El Toro's longest play -- a 16-yard run by 
Jamie Hanaway -- ended in a fumble that led to the Chargers' third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Gronsky got the first turnover; he picked the ball out of the air after 
it popped out of El Toro quarterback Brian Wilson's hand as he was being hit. 
The pressure was a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, De Sha Runnels made it 7-0 by scoring from eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Hocking recovered two fumbles. The first set up a 22-yard scoring pass 
from Collins to Laquent Fobbs, and the second set up Runnels' 15-yard score to 
make it 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few El Toro highlights. Its opening 29-yard drive in the third 
quarter surpassed the 26 yards it gained in the first half. In all, El Toro 
spent all but four plays on its side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And El Toro's troubles continued. Wilson, punting from his 38, watched the 
ball sail over his head. He recovered it, but Johnson tackled him at the 14. 
Fobbs hauled in a J.C. Pintsak pass 66 seconds later. And the defense, which 
had been so much a part of the game for Trabuco Hills, fittingly scored, when 
Alec Bain returned an interception 47 yards.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ESPERANZA RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST 
LONG BEACH POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the big plays and key turning points, Long Beach Poly won not with a 
bang but a whimper Friday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits' 27-24 victory was only secure when a wobbly fourth-down pass 
from Esperanza quarterback Chris Stretch slipped out of the hands of Ryan 
Wilkins with a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, who had to chase the Jackrabbits from the game's first play, got 
as far as the Poly 30 in the final two minutes. On fourth and seven, Esperanza 
Coach Gary Meek decided against a long field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to win a game, not tie it," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 He got neither. Stretch's pass was high. Wilkins grasped it for a second, then 
it slipped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (3-2), ranked seventh in the Southern Section Division I poll, had 
closed from deficits of 21-7 and 27-16, but could not get over the hump. In the 
end, the Aztecs were one big play short. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wore them down and moved the ball," Meek said. "We just weren't there at 
the end. We made too many mistakes."  
</P>
<P>
 Right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch's first pass was tipped by Bruce Carter and intercepted by Jerry 
Sprewell, who returned it 15 yards for a touchdown. It was one of many big 
plays by the Jackrabbit defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch, who was averaging more than 200 yards passing per game coming in, was 
11 of 26 for 92 yards. He was also sacked four times, twice by linebacker 
Vanrick Francis. Stretch also fumbled a snap, which was recovered by Sprewell, 
with six minutes left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poly defense overwhelmed the Aztecs' front line, providing good field 
position for an inconsistent offense. The Jackrabbits had to break a sweat on 
two touchdown drives, but they were only 49 and 55 yards. Both ended with Aaron 
Tyler touchdown runs, covering six and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler also returned a kickoff 79 yards to the Aztec four and then scored on a 
two-yard run in the first quarter. Poly (5-0), ranked fourth in Division I, 
led, 21-7, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the offense was picking up defensive handouts, it was doing its best 
to throw the game away. The Aztecs stayed close with opportunities provided for 
them by Poly quarterback Robert Toler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Clark scooped up a Toler fumble and raced 59 yards for a touchdown in 
the first quarter. Anton Hector intercepted a Toler pass and returned it 58 
yards in the third quarter to set up a one-yard touchdown run by Dahrin 
Footman. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly's defense held for the most part. The Jackrabbits returned only one 
defensive starter, but had given up only 36 points in four games. The Aztecs 
had been averaging 35 points per game, but the only offense they could manage 
came from Footman, who gained 145 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman led a fourth-quarter drive that ended in a four-yard touchdown run by 
Stretch. Stretch ran for the two-point conversion to cut the deficit to 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's as close as the Aztecs would get.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SCORECARD / COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 
5; LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Realignment has brought the six-team league into vogue in Orange County, and 
that meant a five-week nonleague schedule for all but the seven-team Garden 
Grove League. Well, that's over now, and the drive for the playoffs begins next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the most notable matchups take place in the Sunset League, where 
newcomer Los Alamitos (ranked No. 1 in the county) plays host to No. 10 Marina 
on Thursday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium and third-ranked Esperanza, the 
league's other new team, plays No. 4 Edison on Friday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big matchup involving a newcomer is Trabuco Hills playing host to 
Mater Dei Friday. The Mustangs were in the Pacific Coast League last season but 
went 5-1 against South Coast League opponents; now they're in the South Coast 
and find themselves staring at the second-ranked Monarchs. That's a tough 
introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove title could be decided when No. 5 Los Amigos plays Friday 
against Rancho Alamitos, ranked ninth in the Southern Section Division VII 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea View League also gets a premium contest Friday when undefeated Newport 
Harbor visits Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 For historical purposes, Orange's Dick Hill goes for Orange County coaching 
victory No. 200 Thursday night against El Modena. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it at all. He's a big hitter and a great athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Takahashi, Los Amigos coach, who is baffled by the lack of attention 
his quarterback/safety Ape Tuato is receiving from college recruiters. 
Takahashi said Colorado is the only Division I team that has shown any interest 
in the 6-foot, 205-pound senior. IT'S A NEW NO. 2 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows Los Alamitos' unbeaten streak is the county's longest at 40 
games. The second-longest streak belonged to Savanna -- 10 games -- but the 
Rebels were defeated by Newport Harbor, 22-15, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-longest streak now belongs to Woodbridge. The Warriors have won six 
straight -- five this year and their final Sea View League game last season; 
they failed to make the playoffs in 1994. LONG DISTANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo quarterback Austin Moherman threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to 
Michael Smith in the first quarter of the Diablos' 21-17 loss to Villa Park. 
The play set a school record for longest pass play and tied a Southern Section 
record held by many. MARKING TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park baseball Coach Scott Wilson moonlights as the trainer for the 
Spartan football team, but he never had a patient like the one he had Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mission Viejo wide receiver Michael Smith dove for a first down in the 
third quarter, he broke one of the first-down markers. Wilson made makeshift 
repairs by taping up the broken yard marker with athletic tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "Yeah, that's what everyone is saying. It was such a tough game 
even the yard markers got beat up." MISSING A MEAL 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing La Serna to score on a halfback option with 13 seconds remaining 
in the first half of La Habra's 31-7 victory Friday night, the Highlanders' 
defense cost themselves a meal. The defense was guaranteed a steak dinner by 
the coaching staff if it could shut out the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing the shutout, Mike Sweet, Keven Ness, Raoul Apadaca and Copeland 
Holt each earned Slurpees with their interceptions. HOW SWEET IT IS 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson remembers Todd Borowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut's new head coach was at the controls last year for Anaheim when the 
Colonists handed Kennedy its first and only loss of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us our only loss until the (playoff) semifinals and it got them 
into the playoffs," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said revenge wasn't a factor Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different season with different kids," Olson said. "It's kids against 
kids, not coaches against coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish handed Borowski and his Mustangs their first loss of the 
season, 21-14. How Top 10 Fared

MOORPARK EDGES PAST OAK PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior running back Bryan Wilkins had just rushed for 151 yards and four 
touchdowns in 34 carries to lead Moorpark to a 35-34 victory over Oak Park on 
Friday night in a game that saw five lead changes between two undefeated teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Wilkins in the middle of a throng of Oak Park players, shaking 
hands, hugging and consoling old friends. Wilkins played for Oak Park as a 
freshman. But make no mistake, his heart and home are now in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "This win . . . I don't know how to describe it," Wilkins said. "Against my 
old coach, my old friends. They're my friends, but for 48 minutes they're not 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame Oak Park's players if they felt a little sorry for themselves 
afterward? Oak Park (4-1) outgained Moorpark, 278-215, and took a 34-29 lead 
with 4 minutes 9 seconds left. But the Eagles couldn't stop Wilkins and they 
couldn't stop celebrating after the go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, two delay-of-game penalties on 
out-of-bounds kicks and a face-mask penalty gave Moorpark the ball at the Eagle 
35. Five plays later, Wilkins dove three yards for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking we scored a little too soon," Oak Park Coach Dick Billingsley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Oak Park tied the score, 14-14, on a 14-yard touchdown pass play from 
Ron Allen to Ryan Johnson with 46 seconds left in the first half, Tyler Dritz 
raced 60 yards with the ensuing kickoff to give Moorpark (5-0) a first down at 
the Oak Park 27. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bryan Paul was sacked, he found David Burns on a slant pattern for a 
31-yard touchdown with five seconds left to give Moorpark a 21-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park took a 28-21 lead in the third quarter on an eight-yard run by 
quarterback Ron Allen and a 20-yard Allen touchdown pass to Dan Heckman. Allen 
completed 10 of 15 for 166 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins put Moorpark back on top, 29-28, with a one-yard scoring run and a 
two-point conversion run before Johnson, who gained 92 yards in 17 carries, 
countered for the Eagles with a 15-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkins, Johnson's old classmate, had the final word.

ROYAL KEEPS TAKING WHAT IT WANTS, 35-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Those Royal High defensive players. All they do is take, take, take. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders took the ball away from Newbury Park seven times on Friday 
night, creating ample opportunities for the offense in a 35-0 Marmonte League 
rout at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great," said Royal defensive back Christian Broussard, who had 
three interceptions. "It was just a total team effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders intercepted five passes and recovered two fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they had a great defense," Newbury Park Coach George Hurley said. "We 
were just hoping we could execute. But we were playing with nine guys every 
play. We had two guys doing something wrong on each play, and it was always a 
different two guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (4-1, 2-0 in league play), which posted its second consecutive shutout, 
held Newbury Park to 93 yards passing and 38 yards rushing.  
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders tackled the Panthers for losses on nine plays, including six 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's Justin Vint completed six of 12 passes for 52 yards in the 
first half, and Chris Czernek completed three of nine for 41 yards in the 
second. Vint threw three interceptions and Czernek threw two. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal tailback Jerome Lee gained 111 yards and scored two touchdowns in 11 
carries. Quarterback Wes Lagatta completed three of nine passes for 87 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park (3-2, 1-1), playing at Moorpark College for the first time since 
it won the Southern Section Division III title there last December, could only 
manage 56 yards in the first half, and three of its drives were stalled by 
Broussard's interceptions, all of which came inside the Royal 30. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of Royal's second-half scores were set up by turnovers in Newbury 
Park territory. The defense scored when Mike Weyandt returned an interception 
27 yards for a touchdown.

SAN FERNANDO MAKES ITS POINT TO KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's like a fill-in-the-blank sentence this season. "Kennedy High lost a 
heartbreaker, being edged in the fourth quarter by . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, its tormentor was San Fernando, which came from behind to nip 
the Golden Cougars, 21-20, in a Northwest Valley Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has lost three games this season -- by one, one and two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of broken-hearted kids," Coach Bob Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, San Fernando (3-2, 2-0 in conference play) had a lot of ecstatic 
ones, none more so than Keijuan Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, a 5-foot-8 option quarterback who led the Tigers back from a 20-7 
third-quarter deficit, threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Marcus Jones 
with just under six minutes to play in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could do it," said Douglas, a junior. "I told Coach (Sean) Blunt, 
'I'm going to keep my head in the game, and we'll take it.' And we took it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt made a statement of his own to Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what I told him?" Blunt asked. " 'Good ballplayers make big plays. 
Show me how good you are.' He showed me tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas rushed for 58 yards in 14 carries and threw two touchdown passes to 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavelle Thompson rushed for 111 yards in 12 carries, including a 36-yard 
touchdown in the third quarter to trim Kennedy's lead to 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson intercepted a pass by Kennedy quarterback Dan McMullen, the first of 
three interceptions McMullen threw in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kennedy (2-3, 0-2) forced San Fernando to punt, linebacker Chris Mares 
intercepted a McMullen pass on the Kennedy 30-yard line. Douglas' decisive 
10-yard pass to Jones came five plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen completed 17 of 32 passes for 142 yards and two touchdowns. Kennedy's 
Antwane Smith had 15 carries for 102 yards and a touchdown.

CHAMINADE GETS KNOCKED FLAT, 72-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, at least there was no running clock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about all Chaminade High could stop from running in a 72-14 nonleague 
loss to Bloomington on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, who has been able to stop Don Markham's punch-in-the-jaw, 
double-wing attack that has run over five opponents by a combined score of 
352-45? 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the worst loss I have ever experienced -- period," Chaminade Coach 
Rich Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was it? Bloomington, spreading the carries among seven backs, rushed 
for 302 yards and eight touchdowns, running a play-action attack to 
near-perfection. The Bruins were marching for another score when reserve 
quarterback Chuck Webb fumbled the ball away with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting the drive that was halted by halftime, it was the only possession 
in which Bloomington did not reach the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade (3-2), which shut out its first two opponents and yielded 
minus-eight yards rushing in its first three games, did not throw Bloomington 
for a loss until late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For a measure of balance, quarterback Jason Buell completed all three of his 
passes for 162 yards. Completions of 56 and 67 yards went for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington outgained the Eagles, 464 yards to 100, and sacked quarterback 
Jason Zdenek six times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're awesome," said Jason Giovannettone, who scored both Chaminade 
touchdowns but took them as a defensive back. "They had great play action. We 
couldn't see who had the ball until they were past the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The result should come as no surprise. Since the arrival this season of 
Markham, who has run his old-fashioned, run-oriented offense during coaching 
stints all over Southern California and in Oregon, Bloomington (1-9 last 
season) has been recording such lopsided victories that opposing coaches have 
charged Markham with piling on the points. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Bloomington's games were played with a running clock in the second half 
to provide a quicker finish. But Lawson would have no mercy rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why run the clock?" Lawson said. "There are things we need to work on. I'm 
not going to be a crybaby about it. They came out and played football and took 
it right to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that bothered me is, they were rushing our punter right 'til 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Markham: "This is a practice game. We need to work on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington's Cheyane Caldwell gained 159 yards in 13 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. Greg Oliver had 77 yards and three touchdowns in eight carries.

AGOURA BLOWS ROYAL'S 66-MATCH LEAGUE WINNING STREAK OUT OF WATER; WATER POLO: 
CHARGERS HOLD OFF HIGHLANDERS AT THE FINISH, 12-11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of those rare times when people show up expecting to see history 
and they actually do. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura High held off a furious rally and beat Royal, 12-11, in a Marmonte 
League water polo match Friday at Agoura, thrilling the crowd of about 250 who 
came hoping to see Agoura snap the Highlanders' 66-match league winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team never gets any credit," said Agoura's Chris Driscoll, who scored 
seven goals. "It's always Royal, Royal, Royal. But it's not just Royal 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, whose 13-year title reign remains intact for now, had not 
lost a league match since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But water polo observers might have been able to circle Friday on their 
calendars months ago and predict that was when the streak would end. Royal, 
short on experience, lost to a strong Agoura team in a summer league match. 
Even Royal Coach Steve Snyder said Agoura was the league favorite at the start 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Agoura (12-3, 2-0 in league play) beat Royal, 16-7, in a San Luis 
Obispo tournament match last Saturday, it seemed to be just a portend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday seemed to soften the reality," Snyder said. "I found out we are 
still going to live the next day (after a loss). . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the streak died hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Agoura led by at least three goals for most of the match, taking 
leads of 11-7 and 12-9 in the fourth quarter, Royal (7-9, 0-1) stepped up its 
attack at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bruininga, who scored seven goals for the Highlanders, had three in the 
fourth quarter. His goal with 41 seconds to play and Zack Finley's with 18 
seconds left pulled Royal to within one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Agoura was able to hang onto the ball and kill the clock, setting off a 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still shaking," Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal said 15 minutes after the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruininga gave the Chargers credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried our best in the third and fourth quarters," he said. "They came out 
and beat us."

WESTLAKE AIRBORNE ONCE MORE, 58-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbers for Westlake High quarterback Scott Spruill against Camarillo 
Friday night were impressive, but not exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Spruill did all of his work in one half and five of his 17 
completions were touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill completed 17 of 25 for 287 yards in the Warriors' 58-21 victory over 
the Scorpions at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, Westlake had a 39-7 lead. Brian Shubin took over for most of the 
second half for Spruill, completing all three passes he threw for 52 yards and 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like playing catch out there, the corners had their backs turned the 
whole time," Spruill said. "Last week, we showed we could run but we didn't 
want them to forget we could pass too." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake finished with 528 yards of offense, including 189 yards rushing, 
mostly in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Standout wide receiver Billy Miller was the primary target for Spruill, 
catching eight passes for 152 yards and three touchdowns, all in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Spruill, Miller didn't play in the second half except to field an onside 
kick late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally feel like I played like an All-American tonight," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored on pass plays of 10, 46 and a diving 19-yard reception early in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Leibin (five receptions, 66 yards) caught the other two scoring passes 
from Spruill. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties were the only way to slow Westlake (4-1, 2-0 in league play) even 
momentarily. The Warriors were penalized 15 times for 140 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wastlake scored on every possession in the opening half and nine of 10 
possessions in the game. The Scorpions finally stopped Shubin on a fourth-down 
sneak midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo tailback Roth Valencia caught a pair of late touchdown passes from 
Joe Bouchard to slice into a 58-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard completed 11 of 26 passes for 150 yards. Valencia caught six passes 
for 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia, the leading rusher in the area entering the game, was held to 75 
yards in 17 attempts, breaking away only once, a 21-yard touchdown run in the 
second quarter which brought Camarillo (1-4, 0-2) to within 20-7.

 Jerry Brown had a field day. And as Brown went, so too, did Taft High in a 
53-0 rout of Chatsworth on the Chancellors' home field Friday night in a 
Northwest Valley Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a senior, rushed for a career-high 226 yards and four touchdowns in 14 
carries, and Taft (4-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) scored on each of its 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going good tonight," Brown understated. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown scored the game's first three touchdowns on runs of 35, 19 and six 
yards. He had 134 yards in the first half as Taft forged a 25-0 lead. And if 
that wasn't enough, on his first carry of the second half, he burst through the 
middle and raced untouched for an 80-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (2-3, 0-2) gained only 92 yards and had a 63-yard touchdown pass 
negated because of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft gained 438 yards, including 377 on the ground. Quarterback Dayon Shaw 
completed five of nine passes for 61 yards and two touchdowns. Dashon Polk 
scored on an 88-yard run up the middle and a five-yard pass. Friday's Yardstick

run. Derek Lyons added the extra point for Saugus (2-2-1). However, with two

HART'S ONE-TWO PUNCH DOWNS EISENHOWER, 35-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-ranked Hart scored a decisive 35-0 knockout of Eisenhower in a nonleague 
game Friday night, and if quarterback Steve McKeon was the jab, then Indian 
tailback Ted Iacenda was the body blow. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior tandem hammered Eisenhower by air and by land, as Hart (5-0) piled 
up 405 yards of balanced offense and Indian linebacker Marc Zimmerman 
intercepted two passes to short-circuit the Eagle attack. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon ran for two touchdowns and passed for another, while Iacenda continued 
his workhorse ways with 146 yards in 22 carries and two touchdowns, including a 
one-yard run to open the scoring midway through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, McKeon took advantage of Zimmerman's first interception 
by working some option wizardry from the Eisenhower 18-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 150-pound signal-caller sprinted around the left end, head-faked 
an Eagle defender to the turf and scampered down the left hash and into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time we ran that play that guy (defender) was just waiting on me 
and I made my decision to run a little too late," McKeon said. "So the next 
time I anticipated his move and turned it right up into the hole. Eisenhower 
was the fastest team I've ever played in my life. You had to make your reads 
much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhower (1-4) took the ensuing kickoff and ran six plays, during which Hart 
called two timeouts and got the ball back on their 40-yard line with less than 
a minute to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, McKeon spotted receiver Todd Renfro running a deep slant 
and hit him in stride for a 42-yard touchdown and a 21-0 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda rumbled in for a two-yard score five minutes after intermission and 
McKeon ran in from 13 yards for the final touchdown with 1:30 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart held Eisenhower to 71 yards passing and 140 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed nine of 12 passes for 197 yards and ran for 57 yards. Chris 
McCabe caught five passes for 79 yards.

 Will McIntosh caught three of Sonje Berg's four touchdown passes as La Habra 
pounded previously unbeaten Whittier La Serna, 31-7, Friday night at California 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg was 12 of 18 for 253 yards and McIntosh caught six of passes for 183 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A fumble recovery by Juan Garcia set up La Habra's first score. On a swing 
pass, Berg found receiver Keven Ness, who ran 37 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra (2-3) scored again when McIntosh caught a 59-yard pass from Berg to 
give the Highlanders a 13-0 lead with 9:46 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 An interception by La Serna's Daniel Bruen with 29 seconds left in the first 
half proved costly for the Highlanders. The Lancers, whose offense had 
accumulated only 97 total yards, scored when Matt Friscoe took a pitch from 
Mike Hale and connected with George on a 55-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 After a combined five penalties and four turnovers by both teams to open the 
third quarter, the Highlanders finally opened up the game when Berg found 
McIntosh with a 41-yard touchdown pass. La Habra later increased its lead to 
24-7 after a 24-yard field goal by Chris Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Kosarefss recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff to give the 
Highlanders the ball at La Serna's 18-yard line. Berg found McIntosh in the end 
zone on the next play to extend La Habra's lead to 31-7. JASON HILL

 Clay Kilbarger kicked a 46-yard field goal as time expired to give Canyon High 
a 6-3 victory over Corona in a nonleague football game Friday at Corona High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning field goal was set up on the third interception of the game by 
Canyon defensive back Greg Jacobs, who returned an errant pass by Corona 
quarterback Mike Knox 58 yards to the Panther 31-yard line with five seconds 
remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knox likes to look at just one receiver on each play," Jacobs said. "Once I 
saw him locked into the receiver, I went for the ball and got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs intercepted his first pass with 8 minutes 9 seconds remaining in the 
fourth quarter, but the Comanches were stopped after three plays and forced to 
punt. When Corona regained possession, a Knox pass was deflected by Troy Mills 
into Jacobs' hands. Jacobs returned it 39 yards to midfield, but once again 
Canyon was stopped after three plays and forced to punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona kicker Andy Omlor kicked a 27-yard field goal with 6:16 remaining in 
the first quarter. Kilbarger countered with a 39-yard field goal with 54 
seconds left in the quarter to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona outgained Canyon in total offense, 209-170. The Panther defense held 
Canyon quarterback Adam Hoover to eight completions in 23 attempts for 74 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches' leading rusher was Cody Miller with 55 yards in 13 carries.

<P>
 After a sluggish start, the Villa Park defense stiffened to help the 
ninth-ranked Spartans pull out a 21-17 victory over host Mission Viejo in a 
nonleague football game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park linebacker/running back Tony D'Amato intercepted a pass with 1 
minute 1 second remaining to seal the victory and he scored two touchdowns to 
lead the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Spartans (4-0-1) trailed throughout the game, thanks to a great 
performance from Mission Viejo sophomore quarterback Austin Moherman, who 
completed 17 of 28 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Moherman riddled Villa Park's defense in the first half, helping the Diablos 
build a 17-7 lead at halftime. In its four previous games, Villa Park did not 
allow a point in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some loud talking at halftime," Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "We 
haven't been doing the little things lately, even in practice, and I think 
we've been a little complacent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Diablos (1-4) took advantage of that complacency from the start with Mike 
Rogers returning the opening kickoff all the way to the Villa Park 37. Mark 
Fiore kicked a 32-yard field goal to give Mission Viejo an early 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after Mission Viejo's Todd Himes intercepted a pass at the Diablo 
four-yard line to halt a Villa Park drive, Moherman cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a third and 13 inside the one, Moherman dropped back into his end zone 
and completed a 99-yard touchdown pass to Michael Smith with 11 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter. The play set a school record, equaled a 
Southern Section record, and gave Mission Viejo a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Fielding scored on a 14-yard run with 15 seconds remaining in the second 
quarter to give Mission Viejo a 10-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa Park began running the ball effectively in the second half with 
D'Amato gaining 88 yards in 13 carries and Franklin Haynes gaining 71 yards in 
17 carries for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Sean McMahon, who completed 11 of 14 passes for 115 yards, scored 
on four-yard bootleg to cap a 13-play, 65-yard drive to open the third quarter 
and Villa Park trailed, 17-14.  
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans took the lead on their next possession when D'Amato, who caught a 
seven-yard touchdown pass from McMahon in the first half, scored on a one-yard 
run with 9:48 remaining in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartan defense took care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diablos gained three yards rushing in the second half. With Villa Park 
protecting its 21-17 lead, Bo Barnes intercepted a Moherman pass at the Villa 
Park 25 with five minutes remaining.

 Buena Park linebacker Hung Thai returned an interception 100 yards and Jude 
Reyes kicked two field goals as Buena Park won its first game of the season by 
defeating Bellflower, 20-7, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellflower quarterback Jonathon Rivers appeared to be driving his team for the 
game's first score after the Buccaneers recovered a Buena Park fumble on the 
Coyote 35 yard line.But a third-and-goal pass from the four was intercepted by 
Thai at the goal line. He raced down the left sideline to give the Coyotes a 
7-0 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellflower was trailing, 10-0, in the third quarter when running back Sean 
Rumboiz capped a nine-play, 74-yard drive with a four-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buena Park answered with a 92-yard touchdown drive, capped by running back 
Aaron Hudson's 12-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park put the game away midway through the fourth quarter, when Reyes 
kicked a 40-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Buena Park offense controlled the game, Coyote linebackers Niel 
Flores, Robert Leventhal and Osualdo Olmos kept Bellflower off-balance with 
blitzes. MICHAEL LYNCH

 After jumping out to a 21-0 lead with 2 minutes 31 seconds remaining in the 
first quarter, Kennedy had to hold on to hand Walnut its first loss of the 
season, 21-14, Friday at Walnut High. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Marino, playing his first game in two years at wide receiver, 
accounted for all of Kennedy's points, scoring three touchdowns and kicking 
three extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second play of the game, Marino caught a Jason Myles pass for a 45-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On Kennedy's second and third possessions, Marino scored on a one-yard run and 
a 46-yard screen pass from Myles to put the Fighting Irish (4-1) up, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut (4-1) scored its points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With 5:08 remaining in the game, Walnut had a final chance to score when 
Kennedy was forced to punt. Walnut's Asanti Danzie signaled for a fair catch at 
the Mustang 39-yard line, but the ball bounced off his face mask and was 
recovered by Kennedy's Jon Clasen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Mitch Olson said he decided to start Marino, primarily a running 
back, at wide receiver due to an arm injury he suffered in last week's game. 
Olson said he would return Marino to running back next week in the Empire 
League opener against Katella. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino said he won't complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Playing wide receiver) is fun and all, but there's just not as much action," 
Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino caught five passes for 160 yards. Myles completed five of eight passes 
for 123. GEOFF BILAU

VERDUGO HILLS SHUT OUT AGAIN, 42-0; FOOTBALL: WILSON BLANKS THE DONS, WHO HAVE 
NOT SCORED IN NINE QUARTERS.

<P>
 Haunted by the fact that it had scored in only two of its last 12 quarters, 
Verdugo Hills High additionally faced the specter of Arlin Slayton on Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson High's junior tailback rushed for 244 yards in 17 carries and scored 
three touchdowns to lead the Mules to a 42-0 romp over the Dons in a Northern 
Conference game at Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Slayton's 17 carries, 12 netted 11 yards or more. Slayton scored on runs of 
16, 18 and 47 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, (0-3-2 overall, 0-1-1 in conference play), who last week tied 
Belmont, 0-0, have gone nine quarters without scoring. Their best chance came 
in the third quarter Friday, when quarterback David Kelly (80 yards in 10 
carries) appeared to score on an 80-yard run. However, the play was called back 
because of a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly had three passes intercepted, two by Buster Bradley, who returned the 
second 69 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A safety and Slayton's first touchdown gave Wilson (4-1, 2-0) a 9-0 lead at 
halftime.

SMITH GAINS 256 YARDS BUT GRANT FALLS, 52-25; FOOTBALL: LARRY REED OF VAN NUYS 
SCORES THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN ROMP DESPITE SORE ANKLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Running back Larry Reed prefers to let his actions do his talking so he didn't 
mind Friday when offensive lineman Anthony Patricio answered a question for him 
after Van Nuys High defeated Grant, 52-25, in a Valley Pac-8 Conference 
football game at Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Larry) is only at 60% right now," Patricio said. "There were some runs today 
that he would have broken for big gains if he was 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing for Grant that Reed -- who sat out last week's 22-20 victory 
over North Hollywood because of a sprained left ankle -- wasn't at full speed. 
Still, he rushed for 110 yards in 14 carries, caught three passes for another 
75 and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ankle is real, real sore," Reed said. "But I felt like I had to come out 
here and play for my team. . . . It's still hard for me to cut upfield off my 
left ankle, but I needed to get back to work again." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Di-Onte Smith, the leading City Section rusher in the area, gained 256 
yards in 21 carries and scored touchdowns on runs of five yards, 64 yards and 
one yard. Smith now has rushed for 941 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys (4-1, 2-0 in conference play) amassed 481 yards and scored touchdowns 
on eight of 10 possessions to post its fourth win in the last five meetings 
against its cross-town rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's five-yard run -- which came two plays after Ruben Montoya had returned 
an interception 66 yards -- gave Grant a 6-0 lead in the first quarter, but Van 
Nuys scored touchdowns on its next four possessions to take a 25-13 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 John McPherson (106 yards in 10 carries) ran for seven yards to tie the score, 
6-6, and Reed's one-yard run gave the Wolves a 12-6 lead on the first play of 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys took an 18-6 advantage when Reed and quarterback Chris Byfield (seven 
of 10 for 195 yards, three touchdowns) teamed on a 39-yard pass-run play. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (1-3-1, 0-2) narrowed the deficit to 18-13 when Montoya -- who also 
plays quarterback -- scored on an eight-yard bootleg, but Byfield hit Damion 
Boudreaux (two catches for 97 yards, two touchdowns) with a 31-yard scoring 
pass with 1:40 left in the half.

 Dean Chambers passed for 126 yards and three touchdowns as Western controlled 
the clock and beat Katella, 33-0, in a nonleague game Friday at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers completed 10 of 13 passes, but it was Western's time-consuming 
running game that put the Pioneers up, 14-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from its 30-yard line to open the first quarter, Western drove 70 
yards with eight consecutive running plays. Senior fullback Justin Starkey 
gained 20 yards on the first play from scrimmage and finished the drive with a 
six-yard touchdown run that proved to be all the scoring the Pioneers would 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 Starkey assumed a majority of Western's offensive attack, rushing for 105 
yards in 10 attempts and adding four catches for 42 yards. Western fullback 
Matt Frembling contributed to the running game, rushing 15 times for 69 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing Katella to punt on its first possession after Starkey's 
touchdown, Western responded with another slow drive. The Pioneers went 52 
yards on 12 plays to take a 14-0 lead when Chambers hit David Bell on a 
five-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Western used only three passes in the first half, but reversed its offensive 
strategy by opening the third quarter with a nine-play, 67-yard drive. COREY

 Brea-Olinda used defense and special teams to take El Dorado out of its game 
plan and win, 33-13, Friday night at Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, which forced the Hawks to throw the ball, intercepted four 
passes.Randy Douge returned one 65 yards for a touchdown. Brea-Olinda, which 
used nine running backs, was led by Jerome Owens, who gained 48 yards in 18 
carries. Ismail Abdullah carried the ball twice for El Dorado, scoring on a 
59-yard run late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really pleased with the defense. We dominated the line of scrimmage," 
Brea-Olinda Coach John Looney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda scored on its first possession. The Wildcats began their first 
drive with a five-yard penalty that pushed them back to the El Dorado 41. The 
drive was kept alive by a 17-yard pass from Matt Kalcevich to Travis Robinson. 
A six-yard run by Owens set up a nine-yard reverse by Mike Beamer for the 
Wildcats' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's second possession was three plays and out. The Wildcats then went 
on a 12-play drive that was capped by a one-yard run up the middle by Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 After the kickoff, El Dorado again went three plays and out. After being 
backed up to its 11-yard line, El Dorado had its punt blocked and Brea-Olinda's 
Douge recovered in the end zone for the Wildcats' third touchdown. TED APODACA

 After blowing a 27-point lead, Coronado defeated Laguna Beach, 39-34, when 
Ledge Hakes scored with no time remaining Friday at Coronado High. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (1-4) took a 34-33 lead when Liam McDonagh scored on a four-yard 
run with 1 minute 22 seconds left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakes' touchdown followed a blocked 25-yard field-goal attempt by Coronado 
with 17 seconds left. Laguna Beach Coach Mike Roche argued that the field-goal 
attempt should have been Coronado's last play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That clock should have been running," he said. "I thought we'd won the game. 
But I'm not going to blame the officials. We came out flat and didn't play for 
three quarters. I just didn't have them ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach was outclassed early. The Artists trailed 20 at the half and 27-0 
midway through the the third quarter after Hakes blew up the right sideline for 
a 63-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach quarterback Nate Pivaroff put the Artists on the board with 
42-yard touchdown run. Sean Dixon answered on the Coronado's first play from 
scrimmage following the kickoff with a 71-yard touchdown run. Dixon's touchdown 
gave Coronado a 33-6 lead. From that point Laguna Beach scored four consecutive 
touchdowns. BEN STURTEVANT

 Brett Thompson's 41-yard field goal with 10 minutes 54 seconds left in the 
fourth quarter was the difference as host Capistrano Valley beat Foothill, 
17-14, Friday night in a nonleague football game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game's biggest play came in the third quarter, when Foothill had a 
chance to increase a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A pass by Capistrano Valley quarterback Tim Hirchag was intercepted by 
Foothill's Steve Prutsok, who returned it 28 yards to the Cougars' one. But 
Prutsok fumbled and Capistrano Valley recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirchag, a sophomore, then guided the Cougars 99 yards in five plays as 
running back Charlie Landrigan scored on a one-yard run to tie it, 14-14, with 
7:50 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole game was wacky," Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (3-2) scored in the game's opening two minutes when tailback 
Malaefou MacKenzie, who played despite a hip pointer, scored on a 26-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill tied the score when running back Nick Sveslosky, who rushed for 114 
yards in 10 carries, broke loose for an 82-yard touchdown run with 9:18 left in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (1-4), who lost their fourth game in a row, took the lead on 
Tramel Robinson's one-yard run with 2:17 left in the quarter, but failed to 
score again. FORREST LEE

 Brendan McGraw rushed for 254 yards in 26 carries and scored four touchdowns, 
including a 32-yard touchdown catch, to lead Laguna Hills to a 38-3 victory 
over Dana Hills Friday night at Dana Hills High School.  
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, who is tied for the county lead with Los Amigos' Greg Fausto with 18 
touchdowns, scored on runs of 78, 40 and one yard before leaving the game after 
the third quarter.Not bad for a guy who was running behind a patchwork 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a bit banged up and we have three guys on the offensive line who have 
been hurt and would have been playing tonight," said Laguna Hills Coach Steve 
Bresnahan. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Brendan McGraw is a good running back and we feel that if we can just 
hold the blocks for a second that every time he touches the ball, something 
good is going to happen," Bresnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Laguna Hills' second play from scrimmage, McGraw ran off tackle 78 yards 
untouched for the Hawks' first score. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third play of the next possession, McGraw ran 40 yards for the Hawks' 
second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills finished its scoring in the third quarter when, after Sako 
Yakinian kicked a 26-yard field goal, Brian Genuser threw 52 yards to Andy 
Roman for the game's final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills was also tough on defense, holding Dana Hills to 104 yards in the 
game, 44 in the second half. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

NELSON'S LONG CAREER WILL CONCLUDE IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert (Pete) Nelson, the cross-country and track and field co-coach at 
Kennedy High since it opened in 1971, will retire at the end of the school year 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, 58, said he still enjoys coaching, but the daily grind of teaching has 
taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be 59 1/2 in June and that's enough," he said. "I'll miss the coaching, 
there's no doubt about that. But the teaching part of the job wears on you. 
There is a lot of stress involved in teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kennedy has not finished particularly high in the City Section 
cross-country and track championships in recent years, the school fielded some 
top teams from the mid-1970s through the mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Cougar boys' team placed second in the 1975 and '76 City 
cross-country championships and was third in '77. The girls won the 1983 title 
and finished second in '77, '82, '86 and '87 and third in '81 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Traba (1976), Paula Bresnan ('82) and Frances Silva ('83) won 
individual City cross-country titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In track, Nelson and co-coach Warren Farlow have worked together since the 
1972 season. The pair guided the Kennedy boys' team to third-place finishes in 
the 1980, '84 and '85 City championships. The Golden Cougar girls won the City 
title in 1982 and '83, finished second in '80 and '81, and third in '84. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980 girls' team, led by sisters Sherri and Denean Howard, won the State 
championship, but Nelson said it is difficult to single out one team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so many good kids and so many good teams that they're all special," he 
said. "All the teams that won a lot of meets were pretty special. . . . The 
thing that pleases me most is the consistency we had for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who lives in Northridge with his wife Bernice, tied for third in the 
pole vault for University High in the 1953 State championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended UCLA after graduating from high school and earned his 
undergraduate degree and master's degree in physical education in 1958 and '60. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught at Patrick Henry Junior High in Granada Hills from 1960-63, before 
moving on to Palisades High, where he coached the cross-country and swim teams 
from 1963-71.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; PENALTY-RIDDLED WOODBRIDGE WINS DESPITE 
ITSELF

<P>
 Despite an array of mistakes Friday night, Woodbridge remained undefeated, 
defeating Sacramento Florin, 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling injuries at several key positions, and having to overcome 140 yards 
in penalties, the Warriors were happy to get the victory one week before their 
Sea View League opener against Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had that many penalties in a while," Woodbridge Coach Rick Gibson 
said. "But we had a lot of different players in new positions. Overall, I was 
pleased with this performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge defense was without standout linebacker Ian Dominelli, who 
missed the game with a sore ankle, but it stuffed Florin's run-dominated 
attack. The Panthers (1-4) had only 29 yards rushing and 54 yards of total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warrior defense keyed on Florin running back Jermaine Dyson, limiting the 
normally explosive runner to 13 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (5-0) had good field position in the first half, but had trouble 
moving the ball. Woodbridge started in Florin territory on five of its first 
six drives, but managed only three first downs in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors broke through for the only score of the half on a 48-yard 
touchdown pass from Brian Millat to Gavin Crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the game, Nathan Bennett iced the Woodbridge victory, connecting on a 
29-yard field goal. DAVE ALLEN

 Westminster, trailing by 10 points at the half, scored 23 consecutive points 
in the second half and went on to a 30-24 victory over Huntington Beach in a 
nonleague game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (1-4) led, 17-7, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lions (3-2) took the lead for good on a 15-yard run by Jimmy Adkisson 
with 2 minutes 12 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Adkisson, a wide receiver, took the ball on a reverse around the right side, 
breaking a tackle, before reaching the end zone to put Westminster ahead, 
21-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster had cut the Huntington Beach lead to 17-14 on one-yard dive by 
quarterback Jerry Allison. 
</P>
<P>
 David Harrison scored on a 37-yard touchdown run with 7:15 left in the game to 
put Westminster ahead, 27-17. The extra-point attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, a senior running back, rushed for a career-high 102 yards. He had 
scored Westminster's first-half touchdown on a 15-yard run in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster's final score came on a 25-yard field goal by David Jarrick with 
2:44 left and put the Lions ahead, 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach scored the game's final touchdown on a 14-yard pass from 
quarterback Jason Bartusick to Dennis Masuda with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' on-side kick attempt failed and Westminster ran out the clock. KEN

 Bradley Lisotto rushed for 169 yards and scored two touchdowns to help 
undefeated Edison beat Sonora, 29-16, in a nonleague game Friday night at La 
Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisotto scored twice from two yards out in the first half for the Chargers 
(5-0).He also helped put the game away in the third quarter. Edison had a 22-10 
lead when his 65-yard run put the Chargers on the Sonora 20-yard line. Edison 
scored four plays later when tight end Joe Khamis fell on a Lisotto fumble in 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora (2-3) stayed in the game with two TD passes by quarterback Kevin 
Rodriguez to Junior Rodriguez. The first went for 49 yards on the Raiders' 
opening drive. The second was an 85-yard pass play to close out the scoring 
late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Charger defense was solid expect for the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora had four plays from Edison's three-yard line that would have cut the 
lead to six, but couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first-string defense gave up one big play all night," said Edison Coach 
Dave White. "We were a little out of sync, but they had something to do with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Rodriguez finished with 242 yards passing. Junior Rodriguez with three 
receptions at 132 yards. DAVID GRIMM

<P>
 Marina improved to 5-0, its best start since 1981, with a 34-7 nonleague 
victory over Ocean View on Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings consistently started with good field position, with six of their 
10 possessions starting in Ocean View territory thanks to good special teams 
play and two Seahawk turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings' Mike Williams rushed for a game-high 114 yards and a touchdown in 
the first half, but sat out the second half icing a twisted right ankle. 
Williams, who has rushed for 668 yards this season, is expected to play in 
Thursday's Sunset League opener at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina took a 7-0 lead midway through the opening quarter, as Chad Scuncio 
intercepted a Ted Norman pass at the Seahawk 6 and Williams scored three plays 
later on a one-yard run. The Vikings increased the lead to 17-0 at the half on 
a six-yard scoring pass from Matt Roberson to Joe Borzoni and a 40-yard field 
goal by Peter Mignosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzoni ran the second-half kickoff back 62 yards to the Ocean View 31. Micah 
Harrison eventually scored on a four-yard run to make it 24-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View got on the board with 5:05 left in the game, as Jason Hoffman 
scored on a one-yard run. The Seahawks have lost 34 consecutive games, the 
longest current losing streak in the state. ERIC MADDY

<P>
 The battle between two of Orange County's finest running backs never 
materialized as Corona del Mar scored early and often to beat Santa Ana Valley, 
55-13, Friday night at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea King senior Brian Hogan gained 159 yards in 23 carries and teammate Josh 
Walz rushed for 123 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley senior Dwayne Cherrington was limited to 48 yards in 16 
carries as the Sea King defense kept the Falcons (2-3) to 130 yards in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar (2-3) connected on its first drive, as Darren MacDonald caught 
a 14 yard screen pass from Walz just 5 minutes 38 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings led 13-0 after one quarter after J.J. DiCesare ran five yards 
for the first of his two rushing touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 DiCesare finished the game with 68 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea King defense kept the Falcons off guard all evening. Billy Taketa ran 
an interception 46 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter and Fred Garcia 
recovered two fumbles, the latter for a Corona del Mar touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After Walz's four-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter, the Falcons' 
Kyle Marks took the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. MATT FARMER

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SAN CLEMENTE DOMINATES MISTAKE-PRONE 
TUSTIN, 49-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, it actually did get worse for Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outscored by an average of 18 points in their first four games, 
the Tillers were beaten by San Clemente, 49-7, Friday night in a nonleague game 
that wasn't as close as the score indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente (3-2) capitalized on four Tustin turnovers and miserable special 
teams play by the Tillers to score on seven of its first nine possessions. The 
Tritons started six consecutive drives inside Tustin's 40-yard line and took a 
28-7 halftime lead and a 49-9 third-quarter advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente usually passes the ball, but the Tritons rushed for more than 200 
yards. Tailback Cheyenne Dixon ran for 100 yards and two touchdowns in only 
eight carries, including a 70-yard touchdown run on a draw play. Fullback Keith 
Gros contributed 53 yards and a touchdown in eight rushes, and third-stringer 
Owen Williams had a touchdown and 53 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it got out of hand, San Clemente quarterback Jeff Carlin completed 
eight of 21 passes for 132 yards and three touchdowns, two to wide receiver 
Trevor Insley. Carlin's other scoring pass went to Ryan Hoffman, who also 
kicked six of the Tritons' extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin scored on its opening drive, a 12-play, 75-yard march capped by Gabe 
Nava's 16-yard run. But the Tillers, who used three quarterbacks, couldn't move 
the ball after that, and didn't reach 100 yards in offense until their last 
drive of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente overcame 115 yards in penalties and three turnovers mainly 
because it started almost every drive inside Tustin's 35-yard line. Tustin 
punter Sean Barnhart had a rough night as he had one ball snapped over his head 
and three other punts for less than 20 yards.

 Any rushing yardage at all would have been an improvement for Fountain 
Valley's offense Friday night, especially after the Barons were held to minus-1 
yard on the ground last week against Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Barons went above and beyond mere improvement Friday night against 
Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons rushed for 211 yards and two touchdowns in a 29-17 nonleague 
victory over Santa Margarita at Orange Coast College. Quarterback Chris Ponchak 
ran for 103 yards and running back Matt Harrison chipped in with a strong 
second half for the Barons. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominance on the ground was a quantum leap for Fountain Valley, 
considering it ended up in negative rushing figures in a 23-7 loss to Servite 
on Sept. 30. But against Santa Margarita, the Barons broke open a close game in 
the second half with a solid ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (2-3) led at halftime, 7-5, and moved 75 yards in 15 plays for 
a touchdown to start the second half. They gained 54 yards in 11 rushes on the 
drive, including 20 yards by Harrison. Ponchak finished the drive with a 
four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Rumford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons increased the lead to 22-5 with 11:30 left in the game when Ponchak 
scored his second touchdown, scoring from the one. The touchdown was set up by 
James Melad's blocked punt, which gave Fountain Valley the ball at the Santa 
Margarita 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who finished with 61 yards in six second-half carries, closed out 
the victory with an eight-yard touchdown reception with 1:46 to play. MARK

48-yard field goal as Orange Lutheran rolled to a 41-0 nonleague victory over 
Pasadena Marshall Friday night at Brea-Olinda High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway, recovering from lower back spasms suffered two weeks ago, rushed for 
a five-yard score on his first carry and added touchdown runs of two and 49 
yards in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton made his record kick midway through the third quarter after the 
Lancers (4-1) got possession following Jake Anderson's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Joe Juliano led a balanced Orange Lutheran attack, passing for 178 
yards and a touchdown, and running for 94 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall quarterback Jonathan Chambers completed only eight of 23 passes for 
71 yards and had three passes intercepted as the Eagles fell to 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran's Aaron Kenney led all receivers with three receptions for 74 
yards, while Dan Young added an 18-yard touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Maybe John Selbe, Cypress coach, could petition the Southern Section to change 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone knows about the Orange League, it's Selbe and his players. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive week, Cypress (2-3) played a team from that league, 
but this time the result was more to the Centurions' liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a strong defensive performance that limited Magnolia to nine yards on 
nine plays in the first half, the Centurions won, 16-8, Friday night at Western 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia didn't get its initial first down until 6:19 remained in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (1-4) were trailing, 16-8, and had a fourth and two at the 
Cypress 16 with 6:41 left to play. Magnolia's Sean Roy was stopped a yard short 
of the first down by Bruce Swinford and Jeff Steenbergen. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia's other problem was trying to stop Cypress' Greg Cleave, who rushed 
for 165 yards in 33 carries. He scored on a 21-yard run in the third quarter to 
give the Centurions a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce Brunsting gave Cypress a 7-0 lead when he caught a 10-yard scoring pass 
from David Wheeler in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia's only score came on a four-yard run by Jesse Elizalde in the third 
quarter. He set up the score with a 50-yard kickoff return. RUSSELL BANKS

<P>
 Century gave away the ball and then the game Friday night, as the Centurions 
lost their homecoming game to West Covina, 26-17, at the Santa Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs capitalized on three second-half turnovers and 72 yards in 
Century penalties to overcome a 17-7 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Century (2-3), which turned over the ball five times, played well in the first 
half, gaining 159 total yards in offense and holding West Covina (3-2) to 95. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions held the ball for more than 15 minutes in the first half behind 
the running of Beau Wallace and Nick Andrade, and had a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade began the Centurions' first scoring drive with a 52-yard run down the 
sideline. Wallace took the ball in five plays later on a 15-yard draw play with 
2 minutes 5 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Century opened the second half with a 76-yard drive, capped by a five-yard 
touchdown run by Wallace and led, 17-7, with 6:03 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Centurions collapsed. Andrade ran 23 yards but fumbled. The Bulldogs 
recovered and scored on an 80-yard halfback option on the next play to make it 
17-13 with 2:07 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina then sealed the victory when Greg Wardlaw intercepted a pass from 
Stanley Villanueva, and scored three plays later on a 24-yard pass from Henry 
Frank to Wardlaw. MELANIE NEFF

 Sophomore Ryan Cleary connected on three field goals, the longest from 49 
yards, to help propel Garden Grove to a 25-12 victory over Pacifica in a Garden 
Grove League game Friday night at Bolsa Grande Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary hit on tries of 38, 44 and 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it was as good as a punt," Coach Ralph Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary gave Garden Grove (3-2, 2-0 in league) a 3-0 lead with his 38-yard 
field goal and Garden Grove increased its advantage to 5-0 when Darrel Paplia 
tackled Mike Fernandez in the end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (1-4, 0-2) took its only lead of the game when Tommy Summers scored 
from 11 yards, but the two-point conversion effort failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove quickly regained the advantage on the next play from scrimmage, 
when Troy Haller hit Gerardo Lopez with a 67-yard touchdown pass and Cleary's 
conversion made the lead 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary hit a 44-yard field goal with 22 seconds left in the first half to 
increase the Garden Grove lead to 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica put together a 63-yard scoring drive capped by a three-yard scoring 
run by Summers on the opening drive of the second half to cut the lead to 
15-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts regained a six-point lead on Cleary's 49-yard field goal with 48 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's final opportunity to tie and possibly take the lead was stopped 
midway in the final quarter when a fourth-down pass was dropped and Garden 
Grove put the game out of reach on Ruben Reyna's 18-yard touchdown run with 
2:18 left. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; FAUSTO SCORES FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN LOS

 Greg Fausto scored five touchdowns Friday night to lead Los Amigos to a 42-13 
victory over host Aliso Niguel. Fausto scored on runs of four, four, three, 
five and nine yards, and shares the county lead in touchdowns with 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 140-pound junior gained 157 yards in 25 carries. He has 658 
yards rushing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos (5-0), ranked fifth in Orange County, overwhelmed the first-year 
Wolverines (2-3) in total offense, 414-135. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto's two touchdowns in the opening quarter gave Los Amigos an early, 13-0 
lead. But Aliso Niguel made a game of it in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 First, defensive end Ryan Wiedeman returned an interception for a five-yard 
touchdown. Trailing, 20-7, Aliso Niguel pulled off a successful hook-and-ladder 
play. Quarterback Scott Nemeth threw to Justin Martin, who lateraled to Andrew 
Mashburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mashburn ran the final 60 yards of the 68-yard play, cutting the Lobos' lead 
to seven at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Amigos wore down Aliso Niguel in the second half, limiting them to 
just 14 yards on 12 plays and no first downs. And the Wolverines were hurt by 
five turnovers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobos quarterback Ape Tuato was 10 of 15 for 174 yards including a 
fourth-down, 21-yard touchdown pass to Warren Roberge. Nemeth completed 10 of 
19 for 96 yards. MICHAEL CASEY

ANGELS NAME BLYLEVEN MINOR LEAGUE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bert Blyleven rejoined the Angel organization Friday when he was named 
pitching coach of Class-A Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven, who pitched four years for the Angels, rejoins the organization 
after being a roving instructor during the 1993 season. This summer, he told 
Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi he wanted to coach, and that he wants to be a 
pitching coach in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also released pitcher John Dopson (1-4, 6.14 earned-run average), 
who had not pitched since June 22 because of an inflamed right shoulder. The 
Angels have 38 players on their 40-man roster.

BOONE HOPES TO TEACH ROYALS HOW TO WIN; BASEBALL: FORMER ANGEL CATCHER WHO 
MANAGED IN THE OAKLAND A'S ORGANIZATION IS HIRED BY KANSAS CITY TO REPLACE HAL 
MCRAE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years of managing in the minors taught Bob Boone about losing. He was 
hired Friday to teach the Kansas City Royals to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, a major league catcher for 19 years, was chosen to succeed Hal McRae 
who was fired the day after the baseball season was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited a long time for this," said Boone, a Villa Park resident. "This has 
been put on hold for a long, long time, maybe because I played too long." 
</P>
<P>
 His managing experience came in the Oakland Athletics' organization, where he 
had a 125-161 record before joining Davey Johnson's coaching staff in 
Cincinnati last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a tremendous time at Tacoma," Boone said. "I learned how to lose, which 
is not an easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience demonstrated how rewarding managing can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best thing was the players that had an opportunity to be touched 
by me and go on to be major leaguers," he said. "I'm very proud that I had the 
opportunity to touch those players. It really touches me to be able to put 
something in their brain and get them over the hump of getting to the big 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals were looking for a manager-teacher as they cut their $40-million 
payroll with a game plan of rushing their top minor-league prospects to the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a teacher needs is a student," Boone said. "What a student needs is to 
know that they want to learn about what you know. The key is getting the player 
to want to know what you've got. The key is establishing a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Herk Robinson termed it an exhaustive search that started with 
20 names. Boone was one of four people interviewed along with third base 
coaches Tony Muser of the Cubs and Ron Gardenhire of the Twins and Cardinals 
hitting coach Chris Chambliss. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone played nine years in Philadelphia and seven with the Angels before 
finishing his career in 1990 with the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 He held the record for most games caught at 2,225 before it was broken by 
Carlton Fisk. He batted .254 and won seven Gold Glove awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone played in four All-Star games, six playoffs and the World Series in 
which the Phillies defeated the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the toughest jobs to get, there's only 28 of them," he said. 
"I hear managers say all the time that they're going to get fired. My goal is 
to never get fired. I'm going to do that by doing the job that I said I would 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Bret, is a second baseman with the Reds and part of major league 
baseball's first three-generation family. Boone and his father, Ray, were the 
first father-son combination to each hit 100 home runs.

 Franking charges -- A statement in The Times on Oct. 7 saying that Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson used his franking privileges to aid his reelection 
campaign should have been attributed to Richard Sybert, Beilenson's opponent in

SPENCER PLAYS AGENT, RE-SIGNS WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS BAKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elmore Spencer, the Clippers' seven-foot backup center, doesn't believe in 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the agent process is grossly overrated," Spencer said."I just felt I 
didn't need a mouthpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer negotiated his own contract extension, signing a $5-million, 
three-year deal as training camp opened Friday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who was in the final year of his contract after starting 63 of the 
final 68 games last season after center Stanley Roberts suffered a 
season-ending Achilles' tendon injury, averaged a career-high 8.9 points, 5.5 
rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 With Roberts overweight and out of shape at the beginning of camp, Spencer 
could play a key role for the team again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elmore did a very good job for us last year and there's no reason he 
shouldn't be a better player this year with the experience he got last year," 
General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "Seven-footers are hard to find, and with 
Stanley's situation, it's a key that we have Elmore." 
</P>
<P>
 California forward Lamond Murray and Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski, the 
Clippers' first-round draft picks, remain unsigned, although the Clippers say 
they're progressing in negotiations. CHRIS BAKER
